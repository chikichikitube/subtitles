00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,740
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,970
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,920
Who is it?

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,230
Hello everyone

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,540
It's Jinnai Tomonori!

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,410
Has everyone heard of the phrase "set phrase"?

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,210
So have you ever had the experience of being set up?

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,900
What happened exactly?

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,960
At a handshake event, a fan came over and said they were meeting me for the first time

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,080
So I said "nice to meet you" but was then told "it's not the first time we've met"

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,030
Wow, that's bad

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,740
Have you ever been trapped in a conversation?

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,790
Those guys from Weekly Magazine

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,650
I thought I was talking to them about something they already knew, so I confessed everything

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,160
After saying that, the guys actually looked surprised with a "is that so" look

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,560
I didn't know how far the other side had investigated

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,280
After that, I had to give a press conference and get a divorce

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,880
That's enough from you

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,180
※In 2009, the day after he filed for divorce, he held a press conference and admitted that the reason for his divorce was that he was having an affair with multiple women

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,180
Don't mention that, Junior, it was 10 years ago

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,960
It happens

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,150
So, the theory I bring you this time is:

23
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:10,350
"Is there anything you have to say to me?" If you're told this, you'll likely say something that's unnecessary

24
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,260
I see
-That's scary

25
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,730
I think we all think the same thing in that we'd definitely say something

26
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,360
In this case, for example

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,140
If you go to Hamada's lounge and are told this line by Hamada

28
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,570
You'll probably be interrogated for more than 2 hours

29
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,670
Why!?

30
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,930
No, no, that's if Hamada's getting told off by his wife

31
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,920
He'll confess until the sea runs dry

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,740
He'll just keep going

33
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,270
Later

34
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,480
Will they really say unnecessary things?

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,950
And

36
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,870
Connecting Udo's overuse of "Sorry" with Amano's daily life

37
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,950
Will either notice the connection?

38
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,160
And, if the pitcher and first baseman are magicians

39
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,440
Can they use a hidden ball to get batters out one by one?

40
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:20,390
"Is there anything you have to say to me?" If you're told this, you'll like something that's unnecessary

41
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,210
The initial pair is Impulse

42
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,560
This guy won't listen anyway

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,720
Definitely

44
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,290
I can't really imagine what will happen

45
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,530
It's a little scary... truly

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,030
So...

47
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,340
If he confesses to a crime or something, it's over for us

48
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,210
I'm quite nervous as the pranker

49
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:49,070
After calling out his partner under the pretext of "we need to discuss something," the verification begins

50
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,420
What's going on?

51
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,560
Is there anything you haven't told me yet?

52
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,930
So believable

53
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,920
So believable

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,430
Something I haven't told you?

55
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,200
There's something I haven't been told, right?

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,930
Something that needs to be said?

57
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,680
The autograph thing?

58
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,840
Eh?

59
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,380
Autograph
-Autograph?

60
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,480
That...

61
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,990
I was requested to sign our autograph

62
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,790
So I signed your name as well

63
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,570
So cute

64
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,630
Because it was requested...

65
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,800
That doesn't matter

66
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,930
That doesn't matter at all!

67
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,770
That's not what i'm referring to

68
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,090
He laughed!

69
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,980
Ah...the gym?

70
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,880
Eh?

71
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,600
The gym

72
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,680
What about the gym?

73
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,490
I lost 2KG of weight after exercise?

74
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,940
Had a slight change in body size

75
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,160
No, why would I call you out because of this?

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,590
You lost 7KG when you were forced out of the business because of the scandal

77
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,860
I wouldn't call you out today to talk about losing 2KG

78
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,200
Well, yes, yes, that's right...

79
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,400
Although I could say it

80
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,540
"It's like this" can also be said

81
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,480
I think it's better to let you confess yourself

82
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,090
Impressive

83
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,180
Western...Western restaurant thing?

84
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,880
Eh, what? What Western restaurant?

85
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,690
I want to open a western restaurant

86
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,190
Gotta get a health permit

87
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,420
Seems like the kind of thing that would actually happen

88
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,860
An interesting pursuit

89
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,530
His look suits a Western restaurant

90
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,460
Eh? Western food...

91
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,470
Since i've been back at work I've wanted to open a Western restaurant

92
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,700
It has become an interrogation

93
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,610
Although forced to talk

94
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,040
All he gives are useless updates

95
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,720
Explosive announcements seem to be few

96
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,750
After that too

97
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,520
Is it about preparing to study abroad in summer?

98
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,420
Want to open a cooking channel on Youtube?

99
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,620
Debt...debt?

100
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,590
Hair regrowth?

101
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,830
Dad...that I was beaten by my dad?

102
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,460
The small material keeps on coming

103
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:29,470
Even telling a story like "I was beaten up by my father" is unbelievable for someone over 40 years old

104
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,330
Originally this guy is bad

105
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,010
It's not that

106
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,580
Eh...

107
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,420
After saying "it's not that" repeatedly

108
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,620
If I say "It's this" then that's the end of it

109
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,420
I need to hear the words
-Um...

110
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,820
If it doesn't come directly from you

111
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,830
I won't be in the mood to help you

112
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,130
Things that I should say to you...

113
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,010
The last thing he squeezes out after thinking incredibly hard is...

114
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,470
That...

115
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,180
The encounter

116
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,780
What encounter? Go on

117
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,880
Let's see if it's right

118
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,250
Signed up for the dating app that thing?

119
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,260
Already laughing

120
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,040
Laughing so obviously!

121
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,790
Don't laugh!

122
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,490
It's really funny though

123
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,890
Never had the opportunity to find an attractive...

124
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,800
Is this it? Eh, is it?

125
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,330
Did you register under your real name?

126
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,170
No, it says "42-year-old company employee"

127
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,040
Did you upload photos?
-No, I didn't

128
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,440
But if you don't show your face, it's a little bit...

129
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,310
It'll eventually end in...

130
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,710
When we meet, it'll be "You're Teshita, right?"

131
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,550
Is this something that will cause you problems?

132
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,790
No, these kinds of things don't matter at all

133
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,220
So, we reveal the truth

134
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,460
What?

135
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,630
These familiar faces will make you understand

136
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,530
Wednesday?

137
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,300
Indeed

138
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,470
What just happened?

139
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,000
What's happening?

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,400
Did I do something?

141
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,460
After conveying the theory

142
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,040
Don't air the thing about the dating app thing!

143
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,880
How are the results of the dating app

144
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,910
Nothing at all

145
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,280
The guy who "earns 150 thousand a year at the age of 42" has no chance at all, right?

146
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,280
Next is

147
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,670
A survey of seniors and juniors who usually have a good relationship

148
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,410
And so

149
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,700
TKO's Kinoshita-san seems pretty bad

150
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,830
Really stingy

151
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,200
And Yukio's brain is a bit wrong, right?

152
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,240
From what Matsushita says

153
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,250
This guy keeps talking about it

154
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,940
They're obviously trying hard but still being told they don't get it

155
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,210
I don't understand why he doesn't understand

156
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,610
We all work very hard

157
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,210
Really? What about Otake?

158
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:52,380
Nadal who does not stop badmouthing his seniors

159
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,880
Will soon be faced with the statement

160
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,200
Nadal, do you have something to say to me

161
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,930
No no

162
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,730
There is

163
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,900
Something I have to tell you?

164
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,010
There is

165
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,910
Is it about LUMINE? LUMINE

166
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,310
Talking about your Heroshow segment?

167
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,420
Talking about our segment?

168
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,960
They've been doing the same thing for 18 years

169
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,790
"It's always the same, and the people listening to it remember it", something like that

170
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,060
I think someone said that

171
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,770
Who said that?

172
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,500
Who said it...

173
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,540
Anthony did

174
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,440
Anthony?

175
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,880
Immediately betrayed the man

176
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,710
Is it really what Anthony said?

177
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,380
"It's always Heroshow"

178
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,180
Anthony? He was looking down on it?

179
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,520
Funny... funny damage

180
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,850
What does funny damage mean?

181
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,290
I didn't understand either

182
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,690
I've already heard about that, to be honest

183
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,490
It reached my ears

184
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,930
Don't eat the mushrooms

185
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,590
Finished it in one bite!

186
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,940
I told you not to eat mushrooms

187
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,710
I really do not know what you are talking about

188
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,610
I haven't done anything

189
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,710
I really do not want to be the one to say it, Nadal

190
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,410
Eh...the private work thing?

191
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,520
I really don't want to take private work, but I can barely afford to eat

192
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,750
How often do you do it?

193
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,890
Not that often

194
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,560
This golden week, there are "Golden Private Shows" and such

195
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,460
You can live well if you don't take private work

196
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,660
Although I hate to say this

197
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,400
ZAKO said this

198
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,040
He said "Why is private work dark?"

199
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,610
I said "Yeah"

200
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,310
He replied "When the darkness is gone, the light comes"

201
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:57,810
What the hell?

202
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,650
Don't do private work, you're on TV after all

203
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,720
Yes, I'm sorry

204
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,960
But its not this... private work does not matter what

205
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,880
So

206
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,290
What is it?

207
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,730
X？

208
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,060
Eh?

209
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,810
This is bad

210
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,960
Not good not good

211
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,060
So we disclose the truth

212
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,260
That face!

213
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,630
Always staring!

214
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,970
A good bad expression

215
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,290
Wait a minute Fujimoto

216
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,280
A lot of good info came out

217
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,920
I also said the X thing

218
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,570
Look at his eyes

219
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,260
What is this thing?

220
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,200
What day of the week is it?

221
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,400
Wed... Wednesday Downtown

222
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,900
Seriously?

223
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,470
Don't be like this, seriously

224
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,940
FUJIWARA's Heroshow segment

225
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,610
It's being looked down on

226
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,210
By Anthony and you

227
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,780
No...that's what everyone says

228
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,250
What do you mean "everyone says so"?

229
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,670
Next is also a senior and junior who have a good relationship in private

230
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,190
What about the master-disciple relationship?

231
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,960
Recently I heard some bad rumors

232
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,190
Is there something you're not telling me

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,720
Eh...

234
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,500
Bento? The bento thing?

235
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,000
Bento...ah, bento...ah

236
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,340
Bento?

237
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,680
I took the bento?

238
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,910
Who?

239
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,610
Me

240
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,910
Who's?

241
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,680
Yours

242
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,750
From the lounge?

243
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,490
Yes

244
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,350
You took my bento from the lounge?

245
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,360
Yes, I'm sorry

246
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,130
Is it this?

247
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,930
How can it be this?

248
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,400
I went with various people...

249
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,170
I have worked in various places with different people and done it there

250
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,740
Bento thief?

251
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,570
Yes... yes

252
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,610
I've done it to loads of my seniors

253
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,280
Who? Your seniors?

254
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,450
Viking's Nishimura and a few others

255
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,350
What's wrong with you?

256
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,180
Who? Viking's Nishimura

257
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,750
Nishimura

258
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,620
But this doesn't constitute a crime, right?

259
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,090
I didn't say anything about crime in the first place

260
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,830
But isn't this something that everyone knows

261
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,230
I don't care about the bento

262
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,500
That? The thing with the AV actress?

263
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,070
Eh?

264
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,380
Having dinner with the AV actress?

265
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,720
My wife realised

266
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,520
Eh?

267
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,550
Kumomoto... I told her it was your fault

268
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:04,430
And now my wife is wary of you

269
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,330
You've overthinking it

270
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,130
As a liaison with an AV actress is exposed...

271
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,220
Kumomot's reputation is unexpectedly brought into question

272
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,490
Yeah, this'll happen

273
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,680
And there's more

274
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,680
Macau?

275
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,610
Eh?
-Macau?

276
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,350
Macau?

277
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,320
In Macau...

278
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,620
The thing about that woman?

279
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,990
Eh? Woman from Macau?

280
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,090
Was I there?

281
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,360
You were there

282
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,690
We went together, right?

283
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,490
Don't don't

284
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,200
No no no

285
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:45,660
With both about to suffer, the verification is brought to an end

286
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,500
This...

287
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,650
Due to the damage it will bring to Kumomot's reputation, please cut this out

288
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,050
That's reasonable, right?

289
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,020
Kumomoto's wife... right?

290
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,490
I'm sorry, Kumomoto's

291
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,360
I'm so sorry

292
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,740
Last is Morita who will be questioning his junior

293
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:33,210
Last is Morita who will be questioning his junior

294
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,490
You two have something to talk about

295
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,790
Eh, what? What? What? What? What?

296
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,580
So i'm leaving

297
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,960
Wait a bit

298
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,260
It doesn't matter if he's here?

299
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,330
First of all, it's just us two

300
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,900
First? What do you mean, first?

301
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,170
Eh, what? What? What? What? What?

302
00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:01,980
Is there anything you have to say to me?

303
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,420
Something I have to say?

304
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,650
Hmm

305
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,520
No there isn't

306
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,670
There must be something you have you say to me

307
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:16,290
I don't understand your reply at all

308
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,760
I already know

309
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,650
What kind of interrogation is this?

310
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,130
It's not like that

311
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,900
Not "not like that"

312
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,360
If you know, then say it

313
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,110
I want to hear it from your own mouth

314
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,470
What are you angry about?

315
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,280
I am completely confused about what is going on here

316
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,140
The atmosphere is getting interesting

317
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,680
What exactly do you want to hear?

318
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,850
I already know

319
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,180
If you know then just say it

320
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,750
I want you to hear it from your own mouth!

321
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,890
But there's nothing, I've said nothing

322
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,160
I already know!

323
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,660
Then say it!

324
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,490
You just keep saying "I know, I know!"

325
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,180
Unlike the previous three groups, this group does not have a particularly obvious senior-junior relationship

326
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,620
Thus, the scene turns into an argument

327
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,270
We have set up a personal office

328
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:06,540
It is absolutely necessary to understand each other. It is not possible for us not to share things, right?

329
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,050
Since it's such an important thing, just say it

330
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,380
Why do you refuse to say it?

331
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,450
Say it, or do you not know anything?

332
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,120
What do you really want to hear?

333
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,920
That is, with

334
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,520
Don't just say "you know", it won't get the conversation going

335
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,790
What do you hope to achieve with this type of set phrase?

336
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,230
It's not a "set phrase"

337
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,700
Then just come with some evidence and say "what is this?"

338
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,940
You've gotta do both

339
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,010
It's because i'm not doing that that you don't want to do it

340
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,430
What do you want to do then?

341
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,480
If you confessed from the start I wouldn't be angry

342
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,250
What, is it a business thing?

343
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,980
Eh?

344
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,220
What? Business?

345
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,690
Yeah, business? Yes

346
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,390
So it's that!

347
00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:00,970
Well... I took on jobs and so on...

348
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,540
I went alone and did a hosting gig

349
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,780
I didn't tell the company that I did it

350
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,480
Eh, the company?

351
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,580
Is that not it?

352
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,690
He took the bait in the end in such a typical manner

353
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:30,220
The duo and their manager are the only three people in their company

354
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,450
And thus engage in a private business-focused exchange

355
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:38,130
Morita, who couldn't hide his shakiness in the face of such a real betrayal

356
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,640
This is not the same as ordinary private work

357
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,810
Yeah, because it's personal

358
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,550
Eh? What? You took a job?

359
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,880
Isn't that the thing?

360
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,780
It's also a bit related to this

361
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,950
I don't think this is what you were referring to

362
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,280
It's not about this, is it?

363
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,920
What about the pay?

364
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,520
How much did you get?

365
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,220
Basically just pocket money

366
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,590
We're supposed to share half of everything!

367
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,800
You take a share of all my solo work

368
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,770
That's because it's all on the firm's books, so it can't be helped

369
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,770
Then isn't it wrong to do it outside of the company?

370
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,440
How much did you take? Enough is enough

371
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,040
Just say how much you've taken, and don't worry about the rest

372
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,710
How much did you get paid?

373
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,710
20

374
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,280
Eh...

375
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,350
20？

376
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,580
You didn't talk about it with Yamane?

377
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,250
I didn't, so i'm sorry, but this is beside the point

378
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,290
This is obviously not what you wanted to ask about

379
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,390
Saying this out loud means i've already half lost!

380
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,760
It's not a loss

381
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,830
It is because of the way you are talking

382
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,530
A half-loss

383
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,470
No, no, no.
-A half loss means you still have another half

384
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,430
No no no

385
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,540
You just said half of it
-Wait, wait, wait, it's just one

386
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,170
It's not because there are two halves that you say "half lost"

387
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,940
Something needs to be cut into two halves to have lost half of it

388
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,140
Do you have something you need to say?

389
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,710
Huh?

390
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,550
You also have something to say to me, don't you?

391
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:04,020
Suddenly, an unanticipated counterattack is launched

392
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,890
Like you said, it has to come out of your own mouth

393
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,430
No, really

394
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,890
That's enough out of you!

395
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,930
Don't do this!

396
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,030
This question is too annoying

397
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,570
So, what about that? In Fukuoka?

398
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,410
Huh?

399
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,040
When was it?

400
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,230
You took a job at the beginning of the year, right?

401
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,850
At that time, we agreed to go to dinner with our clients

402
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,120
Only you said stuff like "I've got something later"

403
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,890
You're the only one who didn't show up, saying "I'm going home"

404
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,560
Yes, I said, "I'm not feeling well, I'm going home."

405
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,570
Bad health but you actually went out, right?

406
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,340
Huh?

407
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,440
You were in bad health but you went out?

408
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,740
Huh?

409
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,040
What do you mean "huh"?

410
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,380
You went out at that time right

411
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,910
No I didn't

412
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,980
I already know!

413
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,050
No no no no

414
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,070
That's enough. Don't go on like this!

415
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,090
You went out
-Huh?

416
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,720
One of the girls sent me a private message

417
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,760
No, no, no, no, no, wait, wait

418
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,790
No, no, no, wait

419
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,260
I know!

420
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,930
No, I'm talking about you

421
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:16,590
I already know about it!

422
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,290
What?

423
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,430
I got a private message from Fukuoka!

424
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,470
"I work at a hostess club", like that, and you went there

425
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,970
That's enough, that's enough!

426
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,540
This topic is closed

427
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,270
It's weird you don't wanna talk about yourself

428
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,140
I'm tired, i'm tired

429
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,740
I'm the one that's tired!

430
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,710
I'm really tired

431
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,970
And so, we reveal the truth

432
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,150
What is this?

433
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,690
What? What? What? What? What? What? What? Enough, i'm tired

434
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,490
What's going on?

435
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,820
I don't get what's going on

436
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,090
Eh? You, eh?

437
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,330
What is this all about?

438
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,300
You...

439
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,560
No, it's you, isn't it?

440
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,530
You did something, didn't you?

441
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,000
It's strange for you to ask me "what's going on?"

442
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So what is going on?

443
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,600
Isn't it you?

444
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:06,980
Due to the counterattack, Morita thinks that he has been counter-pranked

445
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,710
A trick, right? No?

446
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,180
I knew nothing of it

447
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,020
So what is this?

448
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,800
What kind of magic is this?

449
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,860
I don't know!

450
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:23,490
In summary
this a theory that no one benefits from

451
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,270
Very explosive

452
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,180
This is bad

453
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,390
Yeah, no good

454
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,240
It became like an Obon Kobon event

455
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,430
The way of quarrelling

456
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,830
I'm relieved about Teshita

457
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,020
Each reveal was quite cute

458
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,640
Wants to run a Western restaurant and stuff like that

459
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,880
I'm cheering him on

460
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,350
Let's welcome the next presenter

461
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,770
Zun's Iio!

462
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,320
First time seeing you

463
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,700
Matsumoto, I've been here two or three times already

464
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,890
Hamada, what has happened to him?

465
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,300
What theories have you brought so far?

466
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:13,580
5 years ago, Udo's good nature is insane

467
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,020
Oh yeah

468
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,940
What was particularly unusual about that verification

469
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,580
Was Udo's various apologies

470
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:26,020
He was sorry for everything.
-He apologized for everything

471
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,240
"I'm sorry for almost hitting you"

472
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,330
No one even noticed
-Indeed

473
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,660
Last summer, I sat in front of the air conditioner

474
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,320
Udo passed between me and the air conditioner

475
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,050
Then he turned around and said

476
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:44,070
"Sorry about blocking the cold air from the air conditioner for a moment, Iio"

477
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,210
In this regard, we have brought this project

478
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,280
Kyaeen's One-day Electric Linked Life

479
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,150
One-day Electric Linked Life

480
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,960
Every time Udo says "sorry"

481
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,260
Amano will receive a shock of electricity

482
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,260
This is pretty bad
-It's awful

483
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,640
The question is, can Amano solve the mystery?

484
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,470
And stop the shocks

485
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,510
Again, this is the type of project that benefits no one

486
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,070
So, the one being shocked is Amano

487
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,180
However, the source of the current

488
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,230
Has been previously explored

489
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,230
This is the issue

490
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,240
Yes, yes, yes

491
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,150
Sorry, please take care of me

492
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,600
Udo's mantra: "Sorry"

493
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,360
At that time, to co-stars, staff and even agents

494
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,090
He apologized like crazy and talked endlessly

495
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,470
In this schedule

496
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:52,180
Will Amano be able to detect the linkage and stop the current?

497
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,350
So, at 10:00 a.m., it starts with

498
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,400
Artiste Navigation Yeah!

499
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,270
Using the Sunshine Shopping Building in Ikebukuro as a stage

500
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,200
Emotional Udo's trip begins!

501
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,630
Before you know it

502
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,470
Have you been to Sunshine City?

503
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,270
I was just here not long ago

504
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,070
There's a planetarium.
-Oh, oh, planetarium

505
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,840
I remember, Amano he...

506
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,000
He worked as a planetarium narrator

507
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,280
I think it was here in Ikebukuro Sunshine

508
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,110
If not then sorry

509
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,280
If not then sorry

510
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:38,290
It only takes 5 minutes and reaching the topic of Amano for him to say sorry for the first time

511
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,360
So, Amano, who is called out for a fake meeting

512
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,920
Will taste his first shot of electricity

513
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,100
Ow ow ow ow!

514
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,820
His meat is hanging out

515
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,560
A naughty peek at the belly

516
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,810
Ow!

517
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,250
What's going on?

518
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,110
This is scary...

519
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,090
Amano, confused by the sudden electric current

520
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,500
Is suddenly greeted by the program staff

521
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,560
What the hell is this?

522
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,300
We are Wednesday Downtown

523
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,170
It hurts. Did you guys just do that?
-Yes

524
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:26,100
What what what what what what, what a bunch of weirdos you are!

525
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,840
What the...what the hell? What are you verifying?

526
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,660
Faced with an unaccustomed trick, it takes a while for Amano to get in the mood

527
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,080
Subsequently, he is fitted with an electrical device

528
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,450
Then

529
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,320
So cute, so cute

530
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,350
Sorry, can I ask you a personal question?

531
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,090
Idiot, idiot!

532
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,690
Too... sorry, really

533
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,410
It hurts. It hurts a lot!

534
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,930
What kind of experiment is this? Can't you tell me?

535
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:00,470
Of course, it is impossible to reveal the details at this stage

536
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:06,410
Instead, we tell him to enjoy his day to the fullest

537
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,050
Next, some more meetings take place

538
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:13,050
So the meetings...all have to be held in this state?
-Yes

539
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,320
Why?

540
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:24,330
Even though the meetings were fake, we carried on as usual

541
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,900
This will be troublesome for others, its not good

542
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,040
Thus begins Kyaeen's electric linked day

543
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,310
Once again

544
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,280
Sorry, are there any special events today?

545
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,010
Ah, yes yes yes

546
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,880
Sorry

547
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,720
Sorry

548
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,550
Sorry, really, sorry

549
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,660
Sorry, taking up your time

550
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,790
Thank you very much, sorry

551
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,240
Excuse me

552
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,300
Are you okay?
-I'm okay

553
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:08,040
The conversation at the service desk alone involved 7 apologies

554
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,100
Next...

555
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,640
Sorry, what type of guy do you like?

556
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,610
Sorry, this
-Ow!

557
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,920
Really, sorry

558
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:24,490
Ahhh I can't stand it... why is it still going on!

559
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:29,190
Even during a break from location shooting

560
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,060
Thanks, sorry

561
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,930
I'm really sorry, thank you

562
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:39,170
For making you go to the trouble of putting black honey all over it, i'm really sorry

563
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,900
Sorry...

564
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,710
Sorry, thanks very much

565
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,660
An endless barrage!

566
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,660
Udo's sorry meter climbs sharply

567
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,080
While the staff wait for Udo to use the toilet

568
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,070
Ah, this kind of time...

569
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,530
He'll surely say it

570
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,390
Ah, are you waiting for me?
-Yes

571
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,630
Oh i'm very sorry, sorry

572
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,430
Sorry, really, sorry

573
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,650
You had to wait so long, sorry, sorry

574
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,170
For me, really, sorry...

575
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:17,270
Sorry sorry sorry sorry

576
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,780
An 11-sorry explosion

577
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,980
It hasn't stopped yet. It hasn't stopped yet

578
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:29,590
So far, shooting time has lasted for 2 hours

579
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:33,490
And the sorry count is up to 150

580
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,740
Amano's next job is

581
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,350
I'm Takayanagi
-I'm Amano

582
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,720
Please advise me

583
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:46,020
A fake location shooting with the full assistance of the "King's Brunch" crew

584
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,600
Complete with a host and costumes

585
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,830
It's impossible to distinguish from the real thing

586
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:58,350
King's Brunch Shopper!

587
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:03,050
Let's introduce our guests!

588
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:06,220
Hiroyuki Amano!

589
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,060
This is the second time you've participated

590
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,600
I remember...always remember that...

591
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,870
I bought a lot of things that time

592
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,570
At that time Yuuka was here

593
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:30,750
Er... Yuka- gave me an amulent... sorry

594
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,420
Then let's get started!

595
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,720
Let's go!

596
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:47,030
Amano has been haunted by eerie feelings since the beginning of the show

597
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,350
Thank you, and I apolgize for making you wait so long

598
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,230
Sorry, thank you

599
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,570
Look at that look on the clerk's face.
-Completely stunned

600
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,580
The one just now was delicious, sorry, I didn't even thank you for it

601
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,380
Thank you very much, sorry

602
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,420
Sorry, I just want to buy something I didn't get

603
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,450
Sorry, really, sorry

604
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,120
…Yes

605
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,460
I said a bunch of inexplicable, really sorry everyone

606
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,050
I apologize, really, sorry

607
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,360
At this point, the filming ends

608
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,990
Next

609
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,400
A banned word?

610
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,940
Once I say that word I'm...

611
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,750
Amano fails to consider that someone else may be involved

612
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,900
Finally, Amano will join Udo's location shoot

613
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:46,960
Can he detect the link and stop the current or not?

614
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,170
5:00 p.m. The stage is changed to the shopping street of Takanouji Temple

615
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,170
The shoot continues towards the store where Amano is waiting

616
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,980
So

617
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,940
Hello, wow so delicious, look

618
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,070
Ah sorry

619
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,230
Sorry, really

620
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,180
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

621
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:14,780
When Amano takes his 393th shock of the day

622
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,720
Huh?
-Hey, wait a minute

623
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,960
Isn't this Amano? Great!

624
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,900
I'm waiting for you guys!

625
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,400
I'm so happy, Amano.
-All of a sudden the enthusiasm is high

626
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,970
That's great, Amano. You're so cute.
-Cute? I'm your partner, right?

627
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,070
As soon as I came up, I saw Amano, so warm, so warm

628
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,380
A pair of 49 year-olds

629
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:47,510
Udo doesn't even know that his dear Amano is being mercilessly destroyed by his own mantra

630
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,090
Sorry, it's really cute

631
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,520
Wait a minute, what's going on here?

632
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,720
Next

633
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,360
Here you go then.
-Is that okay? Really? Sorry, thanks

634
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,500
What are you doing? What's the point?

635
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,440
What I'm trying to say is...
-Do you want to pay?

636
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,340
I was going to say, "So there's 1,000 yen"

637
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:14,840
Udo doesn't particularly notice that someone is continuously screaming

638
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:21,350
On the other hand, Amano fails to notice the connection

639
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,720
Are you a couple?

640
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,460
No
-Oh no?

641
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,890
I really thought you guys were, sorry

642
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,960
Sorry sorry sorry

643
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,300
What are you doing? What is "ay"?

644
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,600
Scared, right? Sorry

645
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,870
Huh?  -It's okay.

646
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,510
Can I ask you what kind of man is your type?

647
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,210
Udo!
-The first time!

648
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,840
Thank you so much!

649
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,850
Thank you very much, sorry

650
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,320
I am so happy

651
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,090
Thank you very much, sorry

652
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,960
OK OK OK let's go

653
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,650
After these 4 consecutive shots, Amano begins to notice something

654
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,200
Then

655
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,400
Sorry

656
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,650
What are you doing?

657
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:17,710
We are strolling around Takanouji

658
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:21,350
I heard that the sashimi here is very good.
-Yes

659
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,110
Could you please... Store Manager, sorry

660
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,350
Let's have a taste

661
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,080
Sure

662
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,920
Wait a minute...

663
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,560
Wait a minute...

664
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:37,630
At this moment he finally senses something

665
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,060
Please have a taste!

666
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,200
Dried bamboo shoots and barbecued pork
-This much is no longer considered a tasting, right?

667
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,400
If you can, please.
Come on, Udo

668
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,600
Ah, sorry

669
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,370
This is a little scary

670
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,370
Are you okay?
-That was close

671
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,210
Why do you look like a figure skater

672
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,910
Oh I thought this was a sign

673
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,020
Excuse me

674
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,350
Back to the camera, sorry

675
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,690
What? Do you want to practice boxing?
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

676
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,590
Are you dodging before you throw a punch?
-Wait a minute

677
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,170
Will you shut up for a second?

678
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,630
Anyway, don't talk to me.
-Why?

679
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,570
Do you need anything else?
-Sorry

680
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,500
Finally?

681
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,670
This excellent barbecue...

682
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,240
I'm already convinced

683
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:25,980
I've suffered all day because of you
-Sorry

684
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,310
What?
-This is it!

685
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:36,280
After 8 and a half hours since the start of the verification, after 461 currents

686
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,010
Amano finally correctly identifies the source

687
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,590
So we disclose the project here

688
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,870
Thank you for your hard work

689
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,670
Thank you for your hard work

690
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,550
After explaining the project to both of them

691
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,680
Huh? That location shoot was actually...

692
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,850
It won't be broadcast

693
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:07,380
Ah... it was just for "sorry"？

694
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,320
Please stop!

695
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,450
I've had this thing on since this morning

696
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,720
How many apologies have you made?

697
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,670
Did you apologize continuously and incessantly?
-No

698
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,070
What a lie!

699
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,000
I guess I did
-You did, right?

700
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,330
I thought the machine was going berserk

701
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,140
How many times in total?

702
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,740
The total is now 462 times

703
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:33,080
462 times, each time the feeling was as bad as the last!

704
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,510
Each impact was like first love

705
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,460
So it has come to this

706
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,680
Okay, OK

707
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,650
That's all for today's shoot. Thank you very much.
-Thanks

708
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,450
Help me dismantle it!

709
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,970
Removal of the current device takes place finally after 9 hours

710
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,350
But

711
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,570
Really sorry, thank you very much

712
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,330
Sorry

713
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,230
Sorry, Mr. Driver

714
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,640
Stop stop stop pain pain pain pain pain pain

715
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,670
Ouch... ouch...

716
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:10,110
That guy is apologizing in some damn place again. It hurts!

717
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,100
By the way, if the total current of this day is accumulated

718
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,650
It is just over one shot from a taser

719
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,080
Surpassed the taser

720
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,040
What do you think?
-Very impressive

721
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,430
The phrase "I'm sorry for making you have you put the black honey on it" is simply...

722
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,500
He applies the same amount every time, right?

723
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,550
Probably like a tiny little bottle

724
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:35,810
If he doesn't finish it, he'll say, "I'm sorry I didn't finish the honey."
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

725
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:41,740
Taking Downtown as an example, it's the same as Hamada saying "I'll kill you"

726
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:45,180
If I was electrocuted every time he said it i'd be a mess

727
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,880
The first sentence of the segment would be "I'll kill you"

728
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:56,560
Next is everybody's theories

729
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,030
Tonight's presenter is

730
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,050
Kamaitachi!

731
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,020
This is our first time, please take care of us

732
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,910
So...

733
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,940
No, these two people have been rehearsing for a very long time

734
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,400
Backstage?

735
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,120
Yes

736
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,320
Matsumoto, please don't say that

737
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,860
So I was wondering what they'd say

738
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,530
We were just confirming the content
-That's it

739
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,510
Please never say we were practicing or anything like that

740
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,460
No no no no

741
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,690
You didn't practice for ages?

742
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,840
People will be concerned to hear we had to practice such a simple thing

743
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,460
We all expect a bit of chat after they come out, right?

744
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,840
We were really just confirming the details of the process

745
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,750
We aren't holding back a big move

746
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,720
Indeed

747
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,270
How... did this opening become so stifled?

748
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,520
It's super hard to get such an opening

749
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,540
Everyone, let me ask you a question

750
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,620
What are your impressions of "magicians"?

751
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,890
Dexterous

752
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,990
Good with their hands and stuff

753
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:03,320
Very good at hiding things

754
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,340
Yeah

755
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,730
So, the theory we bring today is this

756
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:13,380
If the pitcher and first baseman are magicians, they can use a hidden ball to get the opponent out one by one

757
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,940
I see

758
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,420
Should work

759
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,040
The fielder hides the ball

760
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,290
The moment the runner leaves the base

761
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,530
He uses this ball to get the runner out of the game

762
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,120
A trick play

763
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,710
It's like this

764
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:29,380
So to put it in perspective

765
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,010
A magician will hide it cleverly

766
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,500
As if holding it over here

767
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,440
But it's not. It's this hand that's holding it.
-Awesome

768
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,100
Impressive

769
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,800
That's how it'll work

770
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,340
That's great, but I hate it

771
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,920
Why? Why?

772
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,630
Great and annoying

773
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,680
While I write he does not anything else other than practice magic

774
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,910
Don't say such things!

775
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,520
So his current level of magic is super high

776
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,320
I go drinking with a magician

777
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,420
Regularly?

778
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,900
Yes, many times

779
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,240
Once we went to a business meeting with a magician.
-Stop it!

780
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,760
To potentially enter the magic business, instead of being comedians

781
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,270
Eh what? It's not funny, don't bring up this kind of thing

782
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,400
This is the part that you were rehearsing, right?

783
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,280
This sequence

784
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,810
So...this is it

785
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,980
No, no, no

786
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,270
Are you here to bring shame to the king of conte?

787
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,160
We won

788
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,000
Here we go again

789
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,900
It's not like that, think about it, the depth of the work is completely different

790
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:44,300
If the pitcher and first baseman are magicians, they can use a hidden ball to get the opponent out one by one

791
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:50,730
This time, we used the phrase "1 million dollars if you succeed in stealing a base in front of a former professional baseball catcher"

792
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:57,270
Thus, this fake project attracted several performers known for their running ability

793
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,530
So

794
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,130
With the cooperation of the former Hanshin's catcher, Kano

795
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,130
※狩Keisuke Kano: Hanshin Tigers catcher from '01 to '17, most stolen bases in the Central League in '09

796
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,550
What do you think of using a hidden ball?

797
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,720
How can I put it

798
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,490
It would be too bad to be finished by this

799
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,490
Even if you are criticized for being careless, there is no way to refute

800
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,660
Have you ever experienced it?

801
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,530
Not really

802
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:24,900
It would definitely start a fight

803
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,300
"What are you doing?" and so on

804
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,800
I've never seen it

805
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:34,210
A hidden ball that is extremely difficult to see on the court

806
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:40,900
There have only been four successful ones in baseball history in the last 15 years

807
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,450
So, there are still some

808
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,810
It is a trick play that is very rare

809
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,650
So, these experts in slight of hand are brought in

810
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,930
And should be able to get people out

811
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:57,340
1 million for successful base stealing in front of the former professional baseball catcher

812
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:04,160
So the first challenger is Bobby Ologun

813
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,840
The initial target is Bobby Ologun, a regular in such sports projects

814
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,930
After a good warm-up

815
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,220
Everyone, let's stop Bobby's 1 million

816
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,030
Enemy?

817
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,860
So, the verification begins

818
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:37,140
First, a magician with pitching experience holds the ball and sets up a stationary position

819
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,560
Seeing this, Bobby boldly pulls away

820
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,290
Really>

821
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,380
By the way, although they are magicians

822
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,720
They are forbidden to use two balls to complete the hidden ball out

823
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,370
I see

824
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,400
No dirty tricks

825
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,820
At this time

826
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,320
I don't think so

827
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,560
Indeed

828
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:11,280
But the distance is so big

829
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,080
A handkerchief?

830
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,860
Yes, the thing handed to the pitcher was

831
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,410
A rolled-up handkerchief

832
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,880
You wouldn't notice

833
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,700
But Bobby completely missed it

834
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,660
So

835
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,180
This will be over soon, right?

836
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,770
Out!

837
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:41,770
Bobby failed to steal a base

838
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,080
Totally out!

839
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,810
OK, well played

840
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,440
Challenge failed

841
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,250
Blocked successfully

842
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,020
Why?

843
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,090
You held the ball and threw it to him

844
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,390
That's wasn't a ball, it was a handkerchief

845
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,690
It was a handkerchief

846
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,960
Is this okay?

847
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,230
What the hell?

848
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,030
You didn't confirm where the ball was

849
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,870
Who was holding what

850
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,770
Do you usually throw handkerchiefs?

851
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:18,370
Can you throw a handkerchief at the Tokyo Dome?

852
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:21,740
There used to be a "Handkerchief Prince"

853
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:23,710
※Yuuki Saito: In 2006, Saito's high school division reached the Koshien Summer Conference. His valiant appearance and the way he wiped his sweat with a neatly folded handkerchief on the pitcher's mound caused a media frenzy and the name "Handkerchief Prince" became popular. He only accumulated 15 wins in 8 years of his career as of the 19th season.

854
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,710
Took it out of his pocket like this

855
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,780
Saito, right?
-Yes, the same thing.

856
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:31,190
The pitcher was sweating and handed a handkerchief to him at first base

857
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,760
So

858
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,580
The next target is

859
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,720
Giants Sakamoto player's impersonation artist Honzaka

860
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,720
※akamoto Isato: The current captain of the Yomiuri Giants joined the Giants in 2007. On May 1, 2019, he hit the first home run of the NPB order and era at Tokyo Dome.

861
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,250
Really similar!

862
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,480
He belonged to the baseball team as a student

863
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,480
Very true

864
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,870
So similar

865
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,230
Will he notice the hidden ball?

866
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,610
Sakamoto is this short?

867
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,240
The result is...

868
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:08,650
After holding the same position as before

869
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:10,560
Just as a sec

870
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,040
Under the guise of a strategy meeting

871
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,170
And the fielders gather on the mound

872
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,120
Give the ball to first base

873
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:25,880
And on the pitcher's glove is something commonly found in magic

874
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,610
A dove

875
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:30,940
Okay?

876
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,530
Open again

877
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,650
Sorry, let's start

878
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:43,050
After returning to their respective positions, the game resumes

879
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,680
The pitcher gives Honzaka a quick glance at the ball-like object

880
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,510
Not surprisingly, the distance between the base bag and the distance...

881
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,450
Wow!

882
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,720
Out!

883
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,370
Thank you, OK OK

884
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:13,430
Thank you

885
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,680
At this time, the plan is revealed

886
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,800
No success

887
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,200
Yes... ah

888
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,380
The last is the man that has a 10-second record for the 100 meters

889
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,840
Dante Carver

890
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:41,340
For this verification a similar approach is used

891
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:48,000
Again the players gather on the mound

892
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:53,860
Where is the ball?

893
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:04,470
Out!

894
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,450
Thank you

895
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,410
Seriously?

896
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:17,480
In summary
Regardless of whether it's allowed or not, its impossible to avoid

897
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,920
What do you think?

898
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,250
Not very interesting

899
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,800
So direct?

900
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,760
No, it's fun

901
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,670
Get rid of this VTR

902
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,260
Wait, Matsumoto, its our first appearance
-Magic

903
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,050
It's not called magic, it's post magic

904
