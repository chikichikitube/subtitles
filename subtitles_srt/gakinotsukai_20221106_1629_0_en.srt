00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,440
8th Gaki no tsukai ya arahende!!
Let's go to a town we've never been to and ask for the 3 best places there!!

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,240
We will do this again.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,940
- Okay, I'll take this one.
- That was quick!

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,310
We don't have to talk, do we?

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,010
Even so, that was too quick!

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,550
Besides, I know what you guys sound like.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,380
That's not the point.

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,620
This is the 8th time.

9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,790
Chiba, Chiba, Kanagawa, Chiba, Chiba, Saitama, Chiba.

10
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,090
- We went to Chiba a lot.
- Yeah, Chiba has a lot of countryside.

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,290
I wanna go to a different place than we've been.
Who draws the lots?

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,100
- It doesn't matter who does it.
- Last time it was me.

13
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,460
Really?
Then, Endo draw the lots.

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,100
Me again?

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,630
- Then I'll draw the lots.
- Draw a good one.

16
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,840
If not, I'll break your hand!

17
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,440
In that case, I apologize very much to you.

18
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,010
I'll take that one!

19
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,810
- I'll open it.
- Please, be a nice place!

20
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,220
- Draw a good place.
- I don't know where the good place is, though.

21
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,180
Is that a town you know?

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,590
Higashi-fuchu.

23
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,220
That's where the horse racetrack is.

24
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,090
Ah,  the horse racetrack in Fuchu.

25
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,690
Higashi-fuchu is...

26
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,000
Here.

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,300
Right here? Higashi-fuchu station, right?

28
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,940
Higashi-fuchu.

29
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,170
This is where the prison is, right?

30
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,670
I don't think you have to talk that way.

31
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,710
There's a horse racetrack here, too.

32
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,750
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:29,720
[Subbed by RAIDEN1017]

34
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:36,360
From the Nippon TV station in Shiodome, it takes about 40 minutes by car to get to Fuchu City in Tokyo.

35
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,970
Now, we are here at Higashi-fuchu station on the Keio line.

36
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,540
Yeah, this is the most urban place we've ever been.

37
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,210
- Yes, this is a city.
- There are many people.

38
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:59,550
Higashi-fuchu station is served by the Keio line and the Keio Horse Racetrack line, and you can get to Shinjuku in 30 minutes by express train

39
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,620
This station is recommended for commuting to the city center and going to school.

40
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,030
Let's ask the residents here for the best 3 in Higashi-fuchu.

41
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,130
It's going to finish soon today.

42
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,270
- In the first place, there were no people in the previous places.
- Right!

43
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,240
There are a lot of people here.

44
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,140
Well,

45
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,040
I don't want to get wet even if it's just one drop!

46
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,750
Isn't that impossible?

47
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,780
If one single drop lands on me,
I'm going home.

48
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,650
Because I'm a bit cringy.

49
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,820
You are too cringy!
It will rain sooner or later.

50
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,890
They moved toward the station and immediately began asking around.

51
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,830
Let's ask him.

52
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,870
Hello, sir.
May I ask your name?

53
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,770
- My name is Ito.
- Hi, Ito-san.

54
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,940
We are looking for recommendations for a place in Higashi-fuchu.

55
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,440
How about the Sungari Restaurant over there?

56
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,350
Oh, it says Sungari over there.

57
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,920
- Oh, a restaurant?
- Sungari Restaurant?

58
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,690
It's an old and unique Chinese restaurant.

59
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,630
- Sungari Restaurant!
- Thank you!

60
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,700
- Since we're here, let's ask people of various ages, shall we?
- I see. That's a good idea.

61
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,300
So they also interviewed some women who work in the area.

62
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,310
We are looking for recommendations in Higashi-fuchu.

63
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,280
- Food, places, anything!
- Your personal opinions are fine too.

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,220
Yeah, do you have any recommendations for places to go?

65
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,190
- Anything at all?
- Of course!

66
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,720
Hey, excuse me!

67
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,460
Sorry, wait a minute.

68
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,890
Please really don't do that kind of thing.

69
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,500
She was trying her best to answer our interview, but he was pushing her from behind.

70
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,500
I didn't push her that hard!

71
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,340
Let's go to the police box together.

72
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,870
- It's right there.
- He was caught red-handed!

73
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,380
I'm really sorry.
So, what's your recommendation?

74
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,720
If you go straight down this street, you'll find an independent general store.

75
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:20,930
They sell all kinds of things at low prices.
They also sell clothing and school supplies for elementary school children.

76
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,560
By the way, have you ever been to the Sungari Restaurant over there?

77
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,400
It has been there for a long time.
The clerk gave me change for 500 yen, saying,
"Here is 5 million yen."

78
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,170
Hmmm, that's SUPER funny.

79
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,470
If they do that, we all have to overreact.

80
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,340
- That's very good.
- I want to make sure of that.

81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,780
- Do they always say "5 million yen"?
- I don't know if they always say that.

82
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,820
I want to go there.

83
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,520
They also asked Takagi-san, a resident of Higashi-fuchu, for his recommendation.

84
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,420
As I thought, Okunitama Shrine.

85
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,890
- A shrine?
- Okunitama Shrine?

86
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,930
Is there something famous there?

87
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,000
Something famous?

88
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,600
What's so funny!?

89
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,670
Please don't do that!

90
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,340
You hit harder than before.

91
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,400
Do you know of any more minor places?

92
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,410
Your personal recommendation of a place is fine.

93
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,780
So why are you laughing?

94
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,610
It's fine!

95
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,620
Let's go to the police box together!

96
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,980
This is a Tsukkomi.

97
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Next, they asked the Takanami-san family for their recommendation.

98
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,290
We are looking for recommendations for a place in Higashi-fuchu.

99
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,300
We have to make this guy stop!

100
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,510
This time of year, we go to the playground inside the horse racetrack.

101
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,540
Is it in there?

102
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:51,150
You can go there when they are not holding horse races.

103
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,980
Can't I get in there if it's being held?

104
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,190
What kind of restaurants do you go to for eating out?

105
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,990
Recently I have been going to VANSAN.

106
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,700
- What kind of restaurant?
- It's a Italian restaurant.

107
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,200
Ah, I see.

108
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,830
The cheesecake is very good.
They roast it in front of you.

109
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,840
Thank you so much.

110
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,540
Furthermore

111
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,180
A cafe with owls.

112
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,310
A famous milk tea cafe.

113
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,080
They interviewed many people in front of the station.

114
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,460
And found out about various recommended places, such as shrines and restaurants.

115
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,460
Where is the 3rd place they are going to?

116
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,400
- Sungari Restaurant.
- That's close.

117
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,470
Do they really say "5 million yen"?

118
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,570
They headed for Sungari Restaurant, where the waiter was unique.

119
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,180
Is he hungry?

120
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,180
He'll keep moving forward.

121
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,780
He'll move on.

122
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,550
Huh? Is it open?

123
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,620
The shutters are closed.

124
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,660
They're not open.

125
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,190
- It sucks.
- Are they closed today?

126
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,560
They're closed today.

127
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,700
Today is a regular holiday.

128
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,700
It was a wasted trip.

129
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,340
Sungari Restaurant.
I'm very curious about this.

130
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,540
What do we do?

131
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,740
Let's go somewhere from this list.

132
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,810
So, would you eat cheesecake in the Italian restaurant?

133
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,020
If that restaurant is closed too, I'm DEFINITELY going home!

134
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,320
To be honest, several drops landed on me already!!

135
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,990
They headed to Italian kitchen VANSAN where cheesecake is recommended.

136
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,700
Maybe that is VANSAN.

137
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,430
We need to cross the crosswalk twice.

138
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,670
We have barely moved from the front of the station.

139
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,640
That's right, we haven't been to a single place yet.

140
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,680
Hey, the light is red!!

141
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,510
Was he that impatient?

142
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,950
Don't be so loud.

143
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,550
It happens.

144
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,550
He's crossing the street.

145
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,120
It's okay that way.

146
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,730
Then let him negotiate permission to shoot.

147
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,700
Matsumoto-san, please negotiate and get permission to shoot.

148
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:27,340
Matsumoto arrived first and entered the restaurant alone to ask the clerk for permission to shoot.

149
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,840
Suddenly he entered the restaurant alone.

150
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,810
Did he get permission to shoot?

151
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,750
She was someone who had been to a HEY!HEY!HEY recording as an audience.

152
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,020
That's amazing!

153
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,120
She graciously gave me permission.

154
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,690
Is it okay?

155
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,530
She is someone who has been to a HEY!HEY!HEY! recording.

156
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,530
I have been there many times!

157
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,700
Who was your favorite?

158
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,230
Hama-chan!

159
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,670
Oh, you like Hamada?

160
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,440
Is that why this supports Demae-can?

161
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,840
- Oh, great!
- Yeah, it's Demae-can.

162
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,440
- I will go prepare your seat.
- Thank you!

163
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,580
She is preparing our seats.

164
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:13,520
VANSAN is an Italian restaurant popular for its homemade pasta and pizza.

165
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,490
They went inside for the recommended cheesecake.

166
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,960
It's Iced tea!

167
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,130
We came for the cheesecake.

168
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,860
- Roasted cheesecake?
- Yes!

169
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,400
Is this okay?

170
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,740
Well, do you want pasta first?

171
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,010
You want pasta?

172
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,580
I'd like to try pasta.

173
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,310
Then let's order two kinds.

174
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:48,020
We'll have the pasta with anchovies and cabbage and  the bolognese.

175
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,690
Sure.

176
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,590
Are you from Mainichi-kou?

177
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,400
I'm presbyopic and have bad eyesight.

178
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:13,240
They ordered pasta at VANSAN, an Italian restaurant.

179
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,410
Then.

180
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,620
Looks delicious!

181
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,290
- Dish out this.
- Okay.

182
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,520
The noodles are delicious.

183
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,230
This is fresh pasta.

184
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,610
They finished off two kinds of pasta and ordered the cheesecake they wanted.

185
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,640
We'll have the roasted cheesecake, please.

186
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,780
- Just one?
- Two, please.

187
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:55,390
They asked the clerk, Hasegawa-san, for her recommendation for Higashi-fuchu.

188
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,590
Minor places are also fine.

189
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,630
There is an abandoned U.S. military base.

190
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:14,540
You can't see it in the summer because of the overgrown trees, but in the winter, when the leaves die down, you can see through the fence the base that was once used by the U.S. military.

191
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,910
- Isn't that place used now?
- It has not been used for decades.

192
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:25,020
- And you can only see it from the outside?
- Yes. The windows are broken and it looks nostalgic.

193
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,720
It's raining and the derelict building would make a good picture.

194
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,790
And here comes the roasted cheesecake they've been waiting for.

195
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,660
I see!

196
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,760
Now I'm going to roast this.

197
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,330
- Oh, nice!
- It's awesome!

198
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,200
That's quite a roast.

199
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,710
It's like a cheese fondue.

200
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,720
What does roasted cheesecake taste like?

201
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Really tasty.

202
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,230
Delish!

203
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,430
I've never had anything like it.

204
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,460
This is delicious!

205
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,330
It's really good!

206
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,730
I see.

207
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,840
They were all very satisfied with the roasted cheesecake! Thank you!

208
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,710
They headed to the  site of the U.S. military base recommended by Hasegawa-san.

209
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,980
How old are you, Endo?

210
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,550
I am 51 years old.
My career is 30 years.

211
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,850
- Hosei-san's career is 34 years?
- Yeah.

212
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,290
- Come to think of it, you have a disciple, don't you?
- Yes.

213
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,600
Why don't I have any disciples?

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,260
Because you are annoying.

215
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,540
A newcomer these days would go to a training school.

216
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:01,110
Downtown was the first graduates of the training school.
The same goes for High Heel and Tommies.

217
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,650
Huh?

218
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,150
The same goes for High Heel and Tommies.

219
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,680
Huh?

220
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,080
You don't have to say it anymore.

221
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,520
You are not wrong.

222
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,590
Yeah.

223
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,160
Don't say it again, just say it once

224
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,590
Who are the second graduates?

225
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,430
Dango Kibino.

226
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,260
He was in a comedy duo with Katsumi.

227
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,830
- What was the name of the duo?
- Don Quixote.

228
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,840
Yeah, Don Quixote!

229
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,440
Don Quixote.

230
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,970
They said, "Let's meet at the corner of Maru Buil."

231
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,780
"Okay, the corner of Maru Buil.....There's no such place!!"

232
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,880
That's funny.

233
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,480
We all had a good laugh.

234
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,620
Ken of the Tommies was not a first graduate, though.

235
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,960
- Masa-san used to be a solo comedian.
- Masa brought Ken.

236
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,930
Masa-san became popular right away.

237
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,200
He was on a show called Yoru-ha-Kunekune.

238
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,900
He was first in a duo with Hamane.

239
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,200
"I was Surp Surp Surprised"?

240
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,970
He was with "I was Surp Surp Surprised".

241
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,310
I went with Hamada to Hamane's house, and we went somewhere in his car on our own.

242
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,140
You remembered it well!

243
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,210
You took Hamane-san's car without permission?

244
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,720
At that time he didn't say, "I was Surp Surp Surprised"

245
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,590
He said, "This can't be a joke."

246
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,560
Did he say it in a serious way?

247
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,830
They arrived at the site of the U.S. military base.

248
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,730
What a place!

249
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,500
This was a U.S. military base?

250
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,070
This whole forest was it?

251
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,050
Where's the building?

252
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,950
Where's Panama?

253
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,950
Oh, look!
There's a broken window!

254
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,020
- This is it.
- Oh, my gosh.

255
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,130
- We can only see it from here?
- Yeah.

256
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,770
The high school I went to was like this.

257
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,500
-Your high school was pretty wild.
- That was too wild.

258
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,510
There was a time when it was like that.

259
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,270
I want to see this from above.

260
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,340
Site of U.S. Military Base Fuchu

261
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:31,130
This is the site where the headquarters of the U.S. Forces in Japan was located aft er the war.
Most of the land was returned to Japan in 1975, and although the use of some of the land was reserved after that, it was fully returned to Japan in September 2021.

262
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:39,640
Therefore, the second recommended place in Higashi-fuchu is the site of the U.S. military base Fuchu.

263
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,650
They went back to the front of the station to ask for more information on their No. 1 recommendation for Higashi-fuchu.

264
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:56,850
They immediately asked Mera-san, who has lived in Higashi-fuchu for 10 months, for her recommendation.

265
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,520
Do you have any recommendations for places around here?

266
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,460
What places do you recommend that you know of?

267
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,600
- Is it a restaurant I recommend?
- Anything is fine.

268
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,200
Why did you think it was a restaurant?

269
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,270
Cause it says VANSAN, doesn't it?

270
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,700
- Don't talk so familiar.
- Ouch!

271
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,740
That's the seventh time today alone!

272
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,410
Let's go to the police box together.

273
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,650
I watched the whole thing.

274
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,150
You really shouldn't do that!

275
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,120
Restaurant is already ranked, so I thought another place would be a good choice.

276
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,060
I can only think of the udon restaurant.

277
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,060
- Is that place famous?
- Udon restaurant....

278
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,670
They continued to ask around.

279
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,870
There really is nothing in Higashi-fuchu.

280
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,940
There are hardly any good places here.

281
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,780
But they did not get any recommendations.

282
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,380
That's pretty tough.

283
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,220
At that time, they interviewed Yamada-san and his daughter, who live in Higashi-fuchu.

284
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,460
There is only 1st place left.

285
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,130
We can't leave without deciding on this one.

286
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,330
The Kyodo-no-mori Museum.

287
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,860
What is there?

288
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,030
There is a planetarium.

289
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,500
All our members love the stars!

290
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,910
I've never said that.

291
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,940
Have you been there a few times?

292
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,080
How many times have you been there?

293
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,850
Many times.

294
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,020
You've been there many times?

295
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,620
Can you give me a specific number?

296
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,690
That's enough!

297
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,160
This is new information.

298
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,790
Thank you.

299
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,890
- Well, shall we go there then?
- Yes.

300
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,000
They went to the Kyodo-no-mori Museum, which has a planetarium.

301
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,670
We like the stars.

302
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,770
Did someone say that?

303
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,610
I don't remember saying that.

304
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,810
I was surprised that five people who like stars happened to get together.

305
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,750
I don't know much about constellations.

306
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,030
They arrived at the recommended museum.

307
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:28,470
The Kyodo-no-mori Museum is a field museum that integrates the entire forest, including many buildings.

308
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:38,520
In addition to the main building, which has a permanent exhibition hall and a planetarium, there are also restored buildings such as an old farmhouse and a town hall.

309
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:47,690
It is also a place of relaxation where many Fuchu citizens gather to enjoy various plants such as Japanese apricots and hydrangeas.

310
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:52,600
They immediately checked the planetarium's showing time at the reception desk.

311
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,070
How long is the planetarium?

312
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,800
It is 45 minutes.

313
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,140
Thanks.

314
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,840
It's 45 minutes.

315
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,510
The screening time is 45 minutes.

316
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,210
Would you like to watch it?

317
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,840
I won't watch it!

318
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,710
If it were 15 minutes, I would watch it.

319
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,380
I thought it would be about 30 minutes.

320
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,220
That's pretty long.

321
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,590
Anyway, they checked the planetarium's screening schedule.

322
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,960
What time is it?

323
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,230
It's 15:20.

324
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,430
The time is just right, though.

325
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,370
What else can I see besides the planetarium?

326
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,910
There is an exhibition hall on the second floor.
It seems that there are exhibits about the history of Fuchu City.

327
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,740
How extreme!

328
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,250
Either a small Fuchu City or a vast star-filled sky.

329
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,080
Let's go to the museum.

330
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,760
They went to the permanent exhibition room on the second floor of the main building.

331
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,560
Let's take a look at the history.

332
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,590
It's so big!

333
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:13,040
In the permanent exhibition room, visitors can learn about the history, culture, and nature of Fuchu through actual materials, models, and videos, making it an enjoyable facility for adults and children alike.

334
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,310
This diorama is amazing.

335
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,850
This is amazing.

336
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,550
I wish I could have seen the U.S. military base like this.

337
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,560
This is amazing.

338
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,530
What would you do if "Tanaka Tie Kick" was displayed at the end of this video?

339
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,130
It would really be like that.

340
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,870
Zelkova?

341
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,000
"Which one is Zelkova?"

342
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:50,050
This is an interactive game where you have to correctly select the flower, leaf, and trunk of a zelkova, the tree of Fuchu City.

343
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,380
- Let's do this.
- I can solve this

344
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,150
Oh, really?

345
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,050
The trunk is this.

346
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,220
Zelkova leaf is this.

347
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,800
And zelkova flower is this.

348
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,270
- You are great!
- No, this is it.

349
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,530
You are awesome.

350
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,800
So what's the answer?

351
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,970
It's coming.

352
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,050
So this is how you know the answer.

353
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,320
This is quite humiliating.

354
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,020
Can you answer this correctly,  curator?

355
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,390
This is a zelkova trunk, right?

356
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,420
I think so.

357
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,830
I didn't know about the leaves.

358
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,360
Oh, the leaves were wrong.

359
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,930
This would be the right answer.

360
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,070
Huh!?

361
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,010
Hey!

362
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,350
When he said "Huh!?", the end roll would be playing.

363
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:04,690
The 1st place is the Kyodo-no-mori Museum, where you can learn about the history of Fuchu in a fun way.

364
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:11,030
It's a lot different than the faraway countryside we've been in.

365
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,300
The places we couldn't shoot will be shot by the staff later.

366
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,640
The Chinese restaurant?

367
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,540
A few days later, the staff went to Sungari Restaurant, which was closed on a regular holiday and could not get in.

368
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:31,110
Among the many dishes on the menu, he ordered ramen, which has been popular since the restaurant opened.

369
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,650
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

370
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,420
It's delicious with an old-fashioned taste.

371
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,530
Finally, it was time to pay.

372
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,230
The clerk gave me change for 500 yen, saying, "Here is 5 million yen."

373
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,230
Will she really say it?

374
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,540
It's 510 yen.

375
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,070
Here is 1010 yen.

376
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,980
The change is 500 yen.
Thank you very much.

377
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,950
She did not say, "Five million yen.

378
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,620
He told her the information he heard on the street.

379
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,120
I heard that the clerk here would say "5 million yen.

380
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:16,190
That is what my father said.
He is old

381
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,900
He is so old that he seldom takes shifts at the restaurant.

382
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,400
If you see him when you come here he might say it to you.

383
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,940
