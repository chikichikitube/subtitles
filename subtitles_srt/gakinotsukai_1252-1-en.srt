00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:25,390
"Miso soup" in 2004 was the last time he got the right answer

14
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,000
It's been more than a decade...

15
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,100
A decade is a way too long time ago

16
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,270

00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,370
So 1 out of 3 got it right

25
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,420
What the hell is this? Looks fancy

26
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,470
Its price is 20 thousand yen

27
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,650
20 thousand?!

28
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,470
The cheapest one is 57 yen?

29
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,500
If we mistake take this as that, this fancy one will lose it's face

30

They have to find the right green tea out of 12 brands

31
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:53,450
The rule is pretty simple. They have to find the right green tea out of 12 brands

32
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,420
100 thousand yen prize

33
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,420
If they're correct

34
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,420
Who will get it?!

35
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,920
A hundred thousand yen goes to the challenger who gets it right. Who's gonna get it?

36
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,390
The first challenger

37
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,390
Endo Shozo

38
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,250
The first challenger is Endo.

39
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,270
His green tea is "Gyokuro-iri Ocha" by Pokka Sapporo

40
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:16,150
This tea was steeped with low temperature water to reduce bitterness and promote mildness. Can he remember its flavor?

41
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:21,520
I don't think it's too strong.

42
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:23,200
Accuracy Rate: Out of 37 challenges  4 have been correct

43
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,320
Here I go...

44
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,610
You're likely to succeed. 1 out of 3 got it right

45
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,610
Yeah if I get the right answer,

46
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,700
I will keep getting one after another

47
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,140
But the Gaki staff are a bunch liars

48
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,380

49
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,050
No they aren't

50
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,020
If it was a lie...

51
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,970
Usually I drink this one only

52
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,420
Healthier...

53
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,920
So you can recognize the taste of it?

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,870
Yes I can recognize the taste of Healthier

55
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,550
You really are eager to burn your fat, eh?*

56
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:04,200
*(The Green Tea Endo prefers is a diet type)

57
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,300
Yes I really want to burn my fat

58
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,170
But it's not good to drink that kind of tea too much, so sometimes I drink this

59
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,440
He's desperate

60
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,810

72
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,450
This one is totally different

73
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,770

Correct!!

79
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,570
This is obviously different. Now then...

It doesn't have any scent at all

The taste though...must be special

97
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,550

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,300
I guessed as much

101
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,000
Does it taste like soup?

102
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,500
What the hell...

103
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,980
I guess it tastes like soup, right?

106

Yes he is. I'm sure he heard you

107
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,720
It's so strong!

108
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,850
It absolutely is

109
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,500
Its color is pretty weak though

I suppose you have

121
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,520
It must be tough if you have never tried it

122
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,020

Don Quixote...57 yen. These three are doubtful

He's gonna describe everything so he can be on TV as much as he can

127

He goes on explaining all of them

128

Is that what he wants?

129
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,430
He's definitely thinking "I want to be On Air"

By giving all the information?

131
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,570

It tastes weak

153
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:11,670
Though it is weak,I think the one I had had a bit more bitterness. So it's not the one

154

Don't say if you are not holding it!

188

We've been drinking it too much... right?

192
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,540
It's not bitter at all...

193
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,740
Do you think you have tried it before?

194
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,980
I don't remember

195

Oh boy, it's super close!

213
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,870
If I can mention any difference, it would be the after taste

214
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,900
I wonder if that one left that strong of a taste

215
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,200
It's gone so smoothly...

216

I suspected the flavor of the tea to be weaker?

277
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,900
It can be categorized as "Weak" as you guys mentioned

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,830
It wasn't bitter

493
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,970
Nobody has succeeded so far. Matsumoto's tea is Ichiban-cha iri Ryokucha by AEON

494
00:19:15,990 --> 00:20:23,980
Correct Answer

495
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,600
Ok I'm eliminating from this side

496
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,570
I actually want to know how this tastes

497
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:47,870
Now tasting

498
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,070
This is really something

499
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,780
It's super stro-o-o-ong

500
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,580
It's super stro-o-o-ong

501
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,420
It remains on my tongue so vividly

502
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,650
It's definitely not it

503
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,070
Completely wrong

504
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:48,800
What I drank was not King of Green Martha Premium!

505
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,440
Correct!!

506
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,570
I don't even have to try this but I'm gonna do it anyway

507
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,430
Â¤ He is disposing an empty bottle

508
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,500
More or less as sort of an alibi

509
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:19,860
Now tasting

510
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,550
It's less different than I expected

511
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,380
It's less different than I expected

512
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:11,370
I thought it would be more different

513
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,950
It is different but much less than I thought

514
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:20,130
What I drank was not Healthier Green Tea

515
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,400
Correct!!

516
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,020
Ok it's gonna be tough

517
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:32,330
Matsumoto's challenge

518
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:32,330
Remaining 10 / 12

519
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:32,330
m 0 0 l 366.875 0 l 366.875 59 l 0 60

520
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:32,330
m 0 0 l 366.875 0 l 366.875 59 l 0 60

521
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,950
Can I try this?

522
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:38,750
Ok let's try Fuka-mushi Ryokucha

523
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,630
Don Quixote

524
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,630
[Fuka-mushi Ryokucha]

525
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,630
m 0 0 l 366.875 0 l 366.875 59 l 0 60

526
00:20:35,630 --> 00:23:11,560
Correct Answer

527
00:20:35,630 --> 00:23:11,560
Now tasting

528
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,760
Huh?

529
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,800
Oh this is the worst...

530
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:54,720
It's so close!

531
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,350
Calm down, calm down, no this isn't okay

532
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,800
No, It can't end here

533
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,450
No seriously

534
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,280
That's water

535
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,150
To be honest with you,

536
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:20,070
I guess it's the right one

537
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,230
But the problem is

538
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,230
My screen time on tv

539
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,530
Screen time, that's the problem

540
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,230
I haven't been on much lately

541
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,670
I haven't been on much lately

542
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,370
I think I haven't been on TV long enough today

543
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,330
I think I haven't been on TV long enough today

544
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,570
I don't think so

545
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,810
I've heard that this show is on TV at the same time in Osaka now

546
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,420
Yes since last week

547
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,240
Right?

548
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,150
So my mother and sister would say

549
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,150
[Hey, you weren't on TV so much]

550
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,200
No way, you are on TV long enough

551
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,150
Like, "You weren't standing out!" ?

552
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:51,020
"We were watching but you weren't there so much!"

553
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:58,920
You guys picked a tricky one. Did you really pick Fuka-mushi at this point?

554
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,970
Yeah it can be possible. I think I was trapped perfectly.

555
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:09,120
Ok I'm gonna get it right so the show can end happily.

556
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:16,870
But what if I fail? It would be so miserable

557
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,280
DAMN!!!

558
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,150
I don't think that was quite right

559
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,170
It will be edited

560
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,920
I think it wasn't right

561
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,470
It will be edited

562
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:37,720
My mom would say "Hey, we watched the show,

563
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,020
but you looked kinda mentally unstable"

564
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,610
In fairness

565
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,580
That's your usual behavior

566
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,450
You often shout suddenly

567
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,250
What should I do? Ok I'm gonna go! Go!

568
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,120
Go!

569
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,160
Ah!!

570
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,060
His normal behavior

571
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,960
His normal behavior

572
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:06,050
That's our Ma-chan

573
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:13,220
What I drank was Fuka-mushi Ryokucha!!

574
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,860
Incorrect!!

575
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,240
So quick!

576
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:23,950
Ok I'm gonna poop here!! I mean it!!

577
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,320
It's because you drink nothing but protein!!

578
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,150
Oh it really makes me feeling like pooping...

579
00:23:30,470 --> 00:24:09,690
This video was brought to you by tofu panda fansubs

580
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,250
It really hurts

581
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,050
So nobody got the right one today

582
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,050
So we got zero again

583
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,920
Told ya. They tell us nothing but lies!

584
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:48,010
All of the staff have had been fired by their former employers because of their lies!
