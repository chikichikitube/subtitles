1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,050
Our love
is eternal.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,050
Shine...

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,690
Oh no.

4
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,700
Oh no, oh no.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,860
Welcome home.

6
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,860
I'll make dinner right away.

7
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,450
I told you I'd be back at 8:00.

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,350
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,150
I've been feverish all afternoon.

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,910
Dinner will be ready soon.

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,520
You've been drawing manga, though.

12
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,990
Homemaker:
Kurasawa Kanae

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,470
Someone from Tokiwa publishing is
reviewing it the day after tomorrow.

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,790
Will you hurry up?

15
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,010
Oh, yes.

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,200
Kanae's husband:
Kurasawa Yoshihito

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,400
Don't make dinner tomorrow.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,370
I've been invited to general
manager Tadokoro's house.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,250
Understood.

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,290
Say...

21
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,560
Can I go to the hospital tomorrow?

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,350
Why not?

23
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,580
I have no cash.

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,690
I give you cash every month,
and you're already out?

25
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,770
Dumb woman.

26
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,940
Dear, you got a call.

27
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,680
General Manager Tadokoro:
Hey, hey, about tomorrow...

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,330
I'm glad you're happy

29
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,330
Score! I love you

30
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,330
She said dinner's ready, just a sec

31
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,890
Hey, hey, about tomorrow's
Spanish restaurant, I made
the reservation!! Can't wait

32
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,200
I'm glad you're happy

33
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,200
Score. I love you

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,830
I love you, too.

Just kidding.

35
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,770
You chose your wife poorly (lol)

36
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,310
I'll be home late tonight.

37
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,920
Oh, yes, you're having dinner
with general manager Tadokoro.

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,460
Yeah. See you later.

39
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,200
Have a nice day.

40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,530
Give my regards to general
manager Tadokoro.

41
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,430
adultery divorce compensation

42
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,310
Filing divorce papers?

43
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,180
It's usually around one million yen.

44
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,660
The retainer fees, form preparation fees and
contingency fee will total about a million yen.

45
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,420
Many of people end up
broke because of them.

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,540
End up broke...

47
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,170
If you'd still like to go
through with it,

48
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,000
the retainer fees will be
100,000 to 200,000 yen.

49
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,150
I'll have to think about it.

50
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes. Thank you.

51
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,300
Kurasawa-san, I read it.

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,730
Oh. How was it?

53
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,850
To be honest, comparing this work to
last year's newcomer award winner,

54
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,650
I just didn't feel it.

55
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,340
Oh, I see...

56
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,610
But, I'll have my senior
editor take a look at it.

57
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,030
No, no. I'll redo it.

58
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,560
A refill for your beverage?

59
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,580
Not for me, thanks.

60
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,860
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,940
You don't have to apologize to him.

62
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,070
A refill for your beverage?

63
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,900
Kanae-san, you've changed.

64
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,770
What?

65
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,700
You seemed to be much happier before.

66
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,530
Before, when you encountered a guy like that,

67
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,510
Editor at Tokiwa Publishing:
Tabata Misato

68
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,510
you would say, "Oh, I can
use that in a manga!"

69
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,260
You were looking for material.

70
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,580
Did something happen?

71
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:05,380
Well, you see...
Lately, my husband...

72
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,640
A refill for your beverage?

73
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,500
Let's see...

74
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,490
I don't want a refill
for my beverage...

75
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,630
But can you pay me compensation?

76
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,190
One order of compensation... Compenãƒ¼

77
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,570
Compensation?

78
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,830
Compensation for cheating on your wife.

79
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,940
Four million yen.

80
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,600
Four million...

81
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,790
You don't have to come to my restaurant
and cause me trouble.

82
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,180
I sent you an affidavit to fill out the
other day, but haven't heard back.

83
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,410
Is this the lowdown way
you conduct business?

84
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,680
What an interesting thing to say.

85
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,680
You have a Twitter account, don't you?

86
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,340
It's full of tweets
degrading your wife.

87
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,870
In terms of public and court opinion,

88
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,650
who would be viewed favorably?

89
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,260
The slandering cheater,
or the slandered wife?

90
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,460
Oh yes, and there will be further
compensation you will be liable for.

91
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,250
1.5 million yen, for
which you will be billed.

92
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,160
In total, that will be
5.5 million yen.

93
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,530
Thank you for your time.

94
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,220
5.5 million...

95
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,080
How can I pay 5.5 million?

96
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,010
I can't afford that.

97
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,820
But you have this
restaurant, don't you?

98
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,500
This is my precious restaurant.

99
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,770
600 yen for one cup of coffee.

100
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,340
The sandwiches are dry.

101
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,180
The proprietor manages the restaurant
to fool around with young waitresses.

102
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,530
What a corrupt establishment this is!

103
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,480
Or, would you like for
the court to decide?

104
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,110
All the details of your
adultery, what you did,

105
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,980
when, and how, will all have to
be reported in explicit detail.

106
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,390
It might get drawn out for years...

107
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,750
Please. Have mercy.

108
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,670
You see? See?

109
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,120
The one you should
apologize to isn't me.

110
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,970
Can you guess who is?

111
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,170
My wife.

112
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,280
Well said.

Yes.

119
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,510
Do you need counsel?

120
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,070
Yes, well...

121
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,170
Oh, no!

122
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,280
Can you follow me to my office?

123
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,050
But, I haven't...

124
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,910
Please, hurry!

125
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,910
O-Okay!

126
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,080
Hurry, please!

Please hurry!

131
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,660
Please, this way.

133
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,620
Please come in.

134
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,060
Yes.

135
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,010
Please wait there.

136
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,740
Have a seat.

137
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,970
No, thank you.

138
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,690
Want some sugar crisps?

139
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,970
Oh. No.

140
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,610
What?

141
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,380
So, are you the cheater
or the cheatee?

142
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,680
Just a second.

143
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,540
That face says it's the latter.

144
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,400
Am I wrong?

145
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,240
Well... yes.

146
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,630
Maybe a victim of domestic violence?

147
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,580
No, there's been no violence.

148
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,920
Oh, well. How boring.

149
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,500
Boring?

150
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,920
You know what...

151
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,550
I'll come back some other time.

152
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,020
Why?

153
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,520
Because places like this charge you
just for listening to you talk.

154
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,160
I've got no money right now.

155
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,330
Consultation is free here.

156
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,630
What?

157
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,800
The economy's tough, but he
insists on acting on principle.

158
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,330
You've come to the right place, though.

159
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,770
Hakamada-sensei looks like that,

160
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,770
but when it comes to practicing
divorce-law, he's crazy good.

161
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,810
All right.

162
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,380
Thank you for waiting.

163
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,020
First step, fermentation,
has been completed.

164
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,860
First step, fermentation?

165
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,570
Sensei is into baking bread.

166
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,690
You were in such a hurry for this?

167
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,190
The first step of fermentation is the
most important step in baking bread.

168
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,490
You could say this principle
applies to life, as well.

169
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,760
For relatives' weddings,

170
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,970
the first step should
be fermentation.

171
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,370
Please.

172
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,880
Okay.

173
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,130
Please.

174
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,450
So...

175
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,760
What can I do for you?

176
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,090
Um... Well...

177
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,630
My husband is cheating on me.

178
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,060
Cheating?

179
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,640
Give me all the details, please.

180
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:37,880
Yes.

181
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,810
I'm Kurasawa Kanae, 32 years old.

182
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,290
I'm a stay-at-home wife.

183
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,400
My husband Yoshihito works for
an advertising agency. He's 39.

184
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,160
We met eight years ago at work,

185
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,890
then we got married.

186
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,200
I quit working immediately
after I got married.

187
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,660
Right now, I'm an aspiring
manga illustrator.

188
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,080
I found out about the cheating
by reading his texts.

189
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,680
My husband has the woman's email
address under a fake name.

190
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,060
Didn't his cell phone have a lock?

191
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,610
No.

192
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,610
What a low-level coverup.

193
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,610
Huh?

194
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,710
He must really think you're stupid.

195
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,310
"She'll never find out."

196
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,580
"Even if she did, I could easily
talk my way out of it."

197
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,490
"Even in the worst case scenario,
it wouldn't be a problem."

198
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,960
That's probably the extent
of what he thinks of you.

199
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,060
Please, continue.

200
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,460
My husband is in charge
of all our finances.

201
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,600
He gives me an allowance of
40,000 yen per month, and that's all.

202
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,810
He's cheap!

203
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,540
Couples with husbands in full charge
of finances often go bankrupt.

204
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,100
It's amazing you lasted eight years.

205
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,450
But, he's shelling out a fortune
for his mistress, isn't he?

206
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,230
And it seems he's been calling me
"that dumb woman" to his peers.

207
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,620
That's terrible.

208
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,500
An impoverished vocabulary
when it comes to insults.

209
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,600
Sensei. Tea.

210
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,820
Me, too.

211
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,350
Yes.

212
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,040
By the way... are all
of you lawyers, too?

213
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,140
I am a private investigator,
Umemoto Kurumi.

214
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,140
Private Investigator:
Umemoto Kurumi

215
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,940
Investigator?

216
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,360
Like a detective.

217
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,150
Private Investigator:
Umemoto Kurumi

218
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,570
I'm intricately affiliated
with this office.

219
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,950
I'll be a helping hand.

220
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,820
I'm Shinozuka Rina.

221
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,320
Temp:
Shinozuka Rina

222
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,180
I'm a college student.

223
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,620
I help prepare documents.

224
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,070
I'm Toyama Yoshie.

225
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,490
Office Landlord:
Toyama Yoshie

226
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,490
I'm the landlord.

227
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,050
The landlord?

228
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,380
In other words, you have
nothing to do here.

229
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,010
Thank you for waiting.

230
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,220
I owe this office a lot.

231
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,280
You haven't paid rent yet,
have you, Sensei?

232
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,370
I can pay you last month's.

233
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,340
Let's start with the month before.

234
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,220
You'd better take her on as a client.

235
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,150
And when you get your fee, pay the rent.

236
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:13,010
You owe me for
investigation expenses, too.

237
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,550
My temp job payment, too.

238
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,320
Um...

239
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,940
Do you really plan on getting a divorce?

240
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,700
Yes.

241
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,120
You're prepared to fight if you have to?

242
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,140
With your husband, that is?

243
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,980
Fight?

244
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,890
Y-Yes.

245
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,180
I want to divorce him and start over!

246
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,010
Understood.

247
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,550
For now, please return home.

248
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,560
What?

249
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,930
What are you saying?

250
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,640
Aren't you taking her on as a client?

251
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,700
I know I might be stepping
out of my bounds, but...

252
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,730
This is of the most important decisions
you'll make in your life.

253
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,430
Please think it over.

254
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,740
What are you saying?

255
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,150
Why don't you think it over?

256
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,130
Sensei, why don't you
take her as a client?

257
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,090
You have no steady income as it is.

258
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,860
I'm home.

259
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,610
Welcome home.

260
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,510
Dinner's almost ready.

261
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,330
Don't move.

262
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,140
What?

263
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,850
It's our wedding anniversary next week.

264
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,300
I'll be on a business trip,
so I can't celebrate with you.

265
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,960
Wasn't this expensive?

266
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,740
You've been helping with our
budget, so I could afford it.

267
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,740
Thank you.

268
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,470
General Manager Tadokoro:
About next week's trip...

269
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,800
Now we're set to really have
a great trip next week!!

270
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,800
OK you can expect that

271
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,800
Was your wife happy? Wasn't that a good
choice? I want a diamond for my birthday (lol)

272
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,970
Was your wife happy? Wasn't that a good
choice? I want diamond for my birthday (lol)

273
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,380
She's a dumb woman after all. She's naive.

274
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,210
She's a dumb woman after all.

275
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,550
I'm ready.

276
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,890
I'm ready to fight my husband.

277
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,010
I officially accept you as my client.

278
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,940
Please follow my instructions
for all of our upcoming actions.

279
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,870
Yes.

280
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,770
Please.

281
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,430
But, first...

282
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,210
What is it?

283
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,720
How much are the fees involved?

284
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,590
Shinozuka-san, please explain.

285
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,820
Document preparation: 50,000 yen.

286
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,170
Retainer fee: 300,000 yen when
negotiating terms with other parties.

287
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,190
Fee contingent on success,
call it a reward fee: 10%.

288
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,970
You need not worry.

289
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,780
This particular case...

290
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,880
we will get about five million.

291
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,440
Five million?

292
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,940
If you follow my instructions,
I guarantee it.

293
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,160
What do you need me to do?

294
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,850
I need you to continue playing
the "dumb woman" for now.

295
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,440
Keep playing the dumb woman,

296
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,200
and keep your husband's guard down.

297
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,630
For now, we let him swim freely,

298
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,690
and we gather evidence that
will give us an advantage.

299
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,080
We'll gather evidence regarding
when the infidelity began,

300
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,890
the days and times of his
trysts with his mistress,

301
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,250
and maybe even the number of times he's
had physical relationships with her.

302
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,230
Physical relationships?

303
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,410
What we need is reliable evidence.

304
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,580
Photos of him cheating, for example.

305
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,680
How are you going to
acquire such things?

306
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,240
Ye of little faith...

307
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll let you in on techniques
I learned from the CIA.

308
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,330
The CIA?

309
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,610
From this.

310
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,540
"Iron Spy Woman, Marilyn"
Season 2, episode 3.

311
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,710
If you want to learn about the target,

312
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,080
first you have to know their car.

313
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,420
Car...

314
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,730
That's right.

315
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,560
Cars are filled with information.

316
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,620
First, the GPS history.

317
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,760
Diver Street 07 Jan 14
Shinagawa Royal Hotel 07 Jan 14
Sky Bridge 05 Jan 14
Minami Yurakucho 23 Dec 13
C'est bonjour Bar 14 Dec 13
Grand Hills 14 Dec 13
Karuizawa Golf Club 07 Dec 13
Karuizawa Garden Hotel 07 Dec 13
Yoyogi Station 07 Dec 13
Roppongi Sky Tower 07 Dec 13

318
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,760
History Search

319
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,200
After you gather the GPS history,

320
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,470
don't forget to attach the GPS tracker.

321
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,710
Once we pinpoint their date
location from tracker data...

322
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,910
We storm in.

323
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,310
We storm in!

324
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,120
This is for you.

325
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,560
Happy birthday.

326
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,230
Thank you.

327
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,230
Yoshihito's subordinate:
Aikawa Shiori

328
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,160
What a wasted opportunity!

329
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,810
Why didn't you snap the picture
as they went into the hotel?

330
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,730
I just couldn't do it.

331
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,170
I couldn't bear to watch.

332
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,060
Yeah...

333
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,140
I understand how you must feel. Here.

334
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,460
Kanae-san.

335
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,820
You did decide to go through
with the divorce, didn't you?

336
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,860
Yes.

337
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,150
And from that moment onward,

338
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,310
that your husband would
become a total stranger to you.

339
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,280
A person with whom you
would not grow old.

340
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,290
And you would be able to
separate yourself

341
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,200
from this stranger,
a person who infuriates you.

342
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,120
And you'll be able to get a lot of money
from that total stranger.

343
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,250
Everything you see is
going to turn into money.

344
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,770
Can you hear the fanfare?

345
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,570
Defeat your enemies
with a heart of lead.

346
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,620
These are perfect!

347
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,420
The mistress is Aikawa Shiori,
a subordinate at my husband's office.

348
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,560
The infidelity began
last year in February.

349
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,730
As to the physical relationships,
I have confirmed at least 24 times.

350
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,540
It must have been hard for you
to gather that much information.

351
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,780
But, when I think of him
as a total stranger,

352
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,820
I think to myself,
"This is material for manga."

353
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,600
Actually, I found myself
having fun at it.

354
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,110
I feel like a spy woman.

355
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,210
Not so fast.

356
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,880
Your actions were the most
elementary of the elementary.

357
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,930
It'll take you another 15 years of
experience to reach Marilyn's level.

358
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:48,420
Well, let's move
on to the next stage.

359
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,810
Please go ahead.

360
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,930
This time, I want you to cheer him on.

361
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,530
Huh?

362
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,860
I want you to cheer on
Yoshihito-san's love affair...

363
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,900
with all your might.

364
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,920
I'll be late again.

365
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,850
General Manager Tadokoro
is having me over again.

366
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,220
I see.

367
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,900
Have a great time!

368
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,060
Huh?

369
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,230
You're going out for drinks, aren't you?

370
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,030
You should have the
best time you can.

371
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,430
Well, yeah.

372
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,600
Have a nice day.

373
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,530
Do your best.

374
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,000
See you later.

375
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,140
Honey!

376
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,180
Do your best!

377
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,550
May I have a moment of your time?

378
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:44,390
We're searching for a lovely couple
to be wedding-ring models.

379
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,820
She called us a couple.

380
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,630
What can I say?

381
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,090
Please, come this way.

382
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,830
Please, come right in.

383
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,860
Here they are.

384
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,800
They're so cute.

385
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,770
We're actually not married yet.

386
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

387
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,540
It's just you two seemed
so suited for each other.

388
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,010
But, isn't your wedding
fast approaching?

389
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:06,810
What?

390
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,480
I can tell.

391
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,110
I speak from much experience
in this line of work.

392
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,620
Is that so?

393
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,990
We're currently having a newlyweds campaign.

394
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,260
We're giving discounts
for wedding rings.

395
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,930
I want this.

396
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,830
I'm a pushover.

397
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,630
What a kind husband!

398
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,930
Whoops, jumped the gun
on the "husband" part.

399
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,870
But I sense the start of a happy family.

400
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,110
You make me envious.

401
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:39,420
Envious! Envious! Envious!

402
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,850
Excuse me, please mind our customers.

403
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,220
Those two are serious.

404
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,160
What?

405
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,910
If they were just fooling around,
they'd cringe at the word "marriage."

406
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,200
But Yoshihito-san is
behaving like a newlywed.

407
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,900
He even bought her a wedding ring.

408
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,270
I see...

409
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,900
But, now the ball's in our court.

410
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,340
How do you mean?

411
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,840
If he's serious about marrying her,

412
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,080
he'll be willing to pay
highly to get a divorce.

413
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,980
I see.

414
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,920
Also, because we've given
them the encouragement,

415
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,520
their love affair is at high tide.

416
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:26,160
Yoshihito-san may ask you
for a divorce himself.

417
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,930
And that will be our best chance.

418
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,130
Chance?

419
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,060
Yes.

420
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,090
I have something important
to talk to you about.

421
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,710
What?

422
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,150
I'm in love with someone.

423
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,120
What?

424
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,590
I want to marry her eventually.

425
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:07,170
Of course I'll wait
until you're ready...

426
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,430
In that case...

427
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,040
Let's get divorced. Now.

428
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:13,710
What?

429
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,710
It's not an eventual thing,
you've already decided, right?

430
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,140
Yeah.

431
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:25,150
Will you let me draft
the divorce papers?

432
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,890
Yeah.

433
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,190
By using his guilty
conscience to our advantage,

434
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,300
he will let you draft
the divorce papers.

435
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:45,240
Divorce Papers
Contracts regarding the compensation fee, division of assets,
and other financial settlements.

436
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Divorce papers specify all financial settlements
after the divorce is finalized.

437
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,070
We will draft it to our advantage.

438
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,970
That's why you wanted me
to cheer on their affair.

439
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,140
Now, the compensation you desire...

440
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,310
How much should we make it?

441
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,950
Is there some kind of standard for it?

442
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,850
Actually, there's a site that
will do the calculations for you.

443
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:06,290
Divorce Compensation
Number of years married: 8-under 9 years
Offending spouse's income: 5 million-under 6 million yen
Duration of infidelity: 1-under 2 years
Physical relations: More than 20 times
Status of marriage: Not on good terms
Divorce Compensation: 4,116,720 yen

Calculate

444
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,660
His age, years of marriage,
duration of infidelity,

445
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,290
number of of physical relationships...

446
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,160
By entering the data...

447
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,460
Within 2 seconds...

448
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,130
Got it.

449
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,630
It comes out to 4,116,620 yen.

450
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,830
Number of times of illicit affair: Over 20 times
Regarding marriage relationship: Not on good terms
Divorce Compensation: 4,116,720 yen

Calculate

451
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,830
Detailed.

452
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,800
The calculated sum is highly reflective
of the duration of the affair,

453
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:24,680
Compensation Calculation Site:
Calculations are based on length of illicit love affair, annual income,
the number of physical relationships, and other factors.

454
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,170
and number of times of
physical relationships.

455
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,480
It's quite a sum. But, what do you think?

456
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,580
That would be more than enough.

457
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:34,190
In that case, the compensation we'll
demand of your husband will be...

458
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,720
Divorce Agreement

459
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,460
Six million?

460
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,860
I agree to pay six million yen...

461
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,930
Yes. It was calculated
at a specialist's site.

462
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,830
First, you present him
with a higher figure.

463
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,600
This is ridiculous.

464
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,130
I don't have that kind of money.

465
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,770
Then, you move on to the discount.

466
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,040
The figures are estimates.

467
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,240
Of course you have to figure
living expenses with her...

468
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,110
How about this?

469
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:01,880
What?

470
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,750
When he lets down his guard,

471
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,050
you show him a convenient payment plan.

472
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,290
5 Million Yen [5 Year Payment Plan]
60 installments

473
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,290
I can agree to a five-year payment plan.

474
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:11,590
You'll only have to pay
83,300 yen per month.

475
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,890
83,300 yen a month...

476
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,030
I guess that'll have to do.

477
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,240
5 million yen...

478
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,300
Kurasawa Yoshihito
Kanae

479
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,300
Congratulations.

480
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:31,580
Congratulations! You got the compensation!

481
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,810
Thank you very much.

482
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,850
What do you think?

483
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,120
It's far better.

484
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,390
I'll show it to my superiors.

485
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,930
You don't even have to show it.

486
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,070
Cafe waitress:
Mizutani Sara

487
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,900
This manga will definitely
get syndication.

488
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,940
How would you know that?

489
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,040
I feel it.

490
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,850
I am never wrong.

491
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,350
Who are you?

492
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,350
Who, me?

493
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,250
I am...

494
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,920
Just a waitress at the cafe.

495
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,190
Here's your iced coffee.

496
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,800
But, I ordered a hot coffee.

497
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,230
Oh! I made a mistake.

498
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,500
I'll bring it right away.

499
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,740
Kurasawa

500
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,220
Tabata Misato
Today's Manuscript

My superiors loved it!
Monthly Man-day will run it
as a syndication next month!

501
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,500
Apartment Rentals

502
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,500
Sangen-jaya Station

503
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,570
Sancha's a nice area.

504
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,800
This one has a walk-in closet.

505
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,470
Can we wait on that?

506
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,940
What? Why?

507
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,510
The divorce settlement is expensive.

508
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,520
Compensation and all.

509
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,520
How much is the compensation?

510
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,950
Well...

511
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,090
about five million.

512
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,720
Five million?

513
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,230
Can't you do something about that?

514
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,130
I've already given my signature.

515
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,870
I'm going home.

516
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,580
Wait a second.

517
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,920
She sure is pretty.

518
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,230
Are you Kurasawa Yoshihito-san?

519
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,900
Who are you?

520
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,200
I'm Kanae-san's legal representative.

521
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,440
My name is Hakamada.

522
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,570
Attorney:
Hakamada Yukio

523
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,410
A lawyer?

524
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,680
Sorry to bother you,

525
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,280
but I've got the official divorce
agreement document for you.

526
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,890
H-Hold on a minute.

527
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,260
I cannot stick to this agreement.

528
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:36,960
What do you mean?

529
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,930
How could I pay compensation like this?

530
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,430
We've got living expenses to consider.

531
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,570
I understand.

532
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,840
However, you have already consented.

533
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,710
I admit to my infidelity.

534
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,750
But, Kanae and I were already finished.

535
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,360
I was miserable for so long...

536
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,030
day after day, without
any excitement...

537
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,860
I started hating myself
for growing old like that.

538
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,340
Things changed when I met Shiori.

539
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,470
It was just for laughs at first.

540
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,050
But when I was with Shiori,

541
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,460
I felt like a man again.

542
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,280
Then things got serious.

543
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,890
You're a man, too. Can't you understand?

544
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,960
I'm very sorry to say...

545
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,900
I don't.

546
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:53,340
Because I'm not a fool who
would cheat on my wife.

547
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,440
I'm sorry.

548
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,630
I know it's none of my business, but...

549
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,120
Before you set your life straight,

550
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,690
don't you have something
you need to do?

551
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,400
Goodbye.

552
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,840
Tokiwa Publishers

553
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,320
This is my superior, Ueki.

554
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,960
I'm Ueki, chief editor of
Monthly Man-day.

555
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,120
Please.

556
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,390
Nice to meet you.

557
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,760
I have made some modifications
to the previous manuscript.

558
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,740
Um...

559
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,800
Concerning the syndication...

560
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,040
it's been canceled.

561
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,140
What was wrong with it?

562
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,210
I can change it all you want.

563
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:09,280
That's not the problem...

564
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,020
Our superiors put a stop on it.

565
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,520
What?

566
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,890
Our advertising sponsor
put in their word...

567
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,630
they are our sponsor,
so it's out of our hands.

568
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,430
I'm so sorry.

569
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,350
I'm home.

570
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,320
My syndication by Tokiwa Publishers
was canceled today.

571
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,590
Oh, yeah.

572
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:55,630
Our advertising agency directs many
of our clients to Tokiwa Publishers.

573
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:00,100
We also have long-term relationships
with many other major sponsors as well.

574
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:05,540
I think it's going to be very difficult
for you to make a living in this field.

575
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,310
I knew it.

576
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,820
You're behind it.

577
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,850
Could you rethink the compensation?

578
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,380
This is terrible.

579
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,820
That was dirty.

580
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,320
Don't talk to me about dirty tricks.

581
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,160
That lanky-looking lawyer
fed you ideas, didn't he?

582
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,790
He's out to gouge me, isn't he?

583
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,490
Besides, this is a matter
between husband and wife.

584
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,170
Shouldn't it be the
two of us who decide?

585
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,320
Um, Hakamada-sensei.

586
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,620
May I have a little of your time?

587
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,730
Kanae-san.

588
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,690
What's the matter?

589
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,300
Um...

590
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,100
I want to rewrite the divorce agreement.

591
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,740
What?

592
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,410
I want to lessen the compensation.

593
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,940
Did your husband say something to you?

594
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,520
I know it's none of my business, but...

595
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,220
I cannot acknowledge that.

596
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:36,800
But this is a matter between us,
as husband and wife.

597
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,390
No, it is not.

598
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,970
When your husband had the affair,

599
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,770
he rejected the wholesome marriage.

600
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,270
From that moment on,

601
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,650
the two of you became
perpetrator and victim.

602
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:02,550
Adultery is viewed as
malicious intent by the court.

603
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:10,320
I view it as no different from a crime.

604
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,340
The adulterer should be duly penalized.

605
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,650
Hakamada Law Office

606
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,050
Hey.

607
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:31,620
Hm?

608
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,560
What happened with the compensation?

609
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,960
It went well.

610
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,260
I have no intention of paying
such a ridiculous sum.

611
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,530
I'm glad.

612
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,700
I'm not some domestic simpleton.

613
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,430
I'm a survivor of society.

614
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,170
I don't take things lying down.

615
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,510
I'm home.

616
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,530
How do you do?

617
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,020
The compensation has been modified.

618
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,460
Now you and I can start
living our new lives.

619
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,360
Divorce Agreement

620
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,230
10 million yen.

621
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,960
Ten million?

622
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,300
What's the meaning of this?

623
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,570
Regarding that, let me explain.

624
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,740
You...

625
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,010
We've already met.

626
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,410
First of all, regarding: "Ten million?
What's the meaning of this?"

627
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,890
Let me answer that question.

628
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:46,110
First of all, compensation is
measured by psychological duress.

629
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:51,560
Notwithstanding, by continuing to see
your partner in infidelity...

630
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,120
and bringing her into your home,

631
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:02,370
Kanae-san's psychological duress has
doubled since you made the agreement.

632
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,910
That will cost two million.

633
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:10,420
You have also acted to obstruct
Kanae-san's profession as manga illustrator.

634
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,920
The compensation for
that will be two million.

635
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:16,890
In total, the sum is now ten million yen.

636
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:19,660
Are you joking? I don't
have ten million yen!

637
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,430
Understood.

638
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:29,200
But, it was Kurasawa Yoshihito-san,
employee of the electronic advertising agency,

639
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:35,060
who acted to cancel Kanae-san's
syndication at the publishing company.

640
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,100
I will be reporting
this to your company.

641
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,340
Wait a second.

642
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,780
Please don't involve the company.

643
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,520
In that case, will you make the payment?

644
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,150
But...

645
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,320
In that case,

646
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,030
we will see you in court.

647
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,870
And I will fight you, for years,

648
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,990
even decades, however long
it takes, to make you pay.

649
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:10,810
You should remember this for the next
time you agree to a compensation.

650
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,310
There is something an
adulterer must first do.

651
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,380
That is to apologize.

652
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,090
The second thing to do, is apologize.

653
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,020
The third thing to do is likewise.

654
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:28,090
You will have to keep on apologizing.

655
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,810
And yet, notwithstanding,

656
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,340
you haven't asked Kanae-san's
forgiveness, not even once.

657
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:45,150
I have no intention of lessening the
compensation for a person like you.

658
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,580
But still, this sum is too much...

659
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,520
August 17th, Karuizawa Hotel,
Junior Suite, one night, 32,000 yen.

660
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:59,390
Expense List of Illicit Affair

661
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:58,590
October 3rd, Spain
Restaurant, 13,000 yen.

662
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:03,430
November 9th, Hokkaido Crab
Buffet Tour, 75,000 yen.

663
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,900
Just from what we know about, in six months,

664
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,470
you've spent over one million
yen for Shiori-san.

665
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:15,570
Considering that, the sum isn't
impossible for you to pay.

666
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:21,500
To this day, I haven't had any client
whose research was more thorough...

667
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,810
I almost wish she'd
come work at my office.

668
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,590
In contrast, to this day...

669
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,790
I haven't met anyone come up with a

670
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,900
more stupid scheme to
lessen the compensation.

671
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,570
Of all the men I have ever met...

672
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:48,870
you are a "dumb man"
of the highest order.

673
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,810
Sorry about that.

674
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,120
As to the rest, talk it
over at your leisure.

675
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,780
Please.

676
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:31,080
My husband consented.

677
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,920
He said he'll pay ten million yen
in a five-year payment plan.

678
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,060
I'm glad.

679
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,560
Usually when it goes to court,

680
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:46,930
the court generally agrees
on one to two million.

681
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,170
What?

682
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,790
In order for you to have gotten
the high compensation,

683
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,070
the agreement phase was critical.

684
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,610
I see.

685
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,660
What have you got planned for yourself?

686
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,020
My current apartment is costly,

687
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,250
so I'm going to find
another place to rent.

688
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,860
Hakamada-sensei.

689
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,760
You have been truly good to me.

690
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,090
It's nothing.

691
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,130
Goodbye.

692
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:27,210
Kanae-san's a different person
from when she first walked in.

693
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:31,480
But tougher battles are yet
to be fought. Right, Sensei?

694
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,910
Oh.

695
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,670
The bread is baked.

696
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,860
Hakamada Law Office

697
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,330
Hello.

698
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,330
Kanae-san.

699
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,460
Are you in trouble again?

700
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,460
No.

701
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,470
I have a different request today.

702
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,510
A different request?

703
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:37,770
Would you let me work here?

704
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,480
What?

705
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,610
My manga is about to get syndicated.

706
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,780
Please take a look.

707
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,490
This is it.

708
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:51,320
This main character looks like...

709
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:53,290
You will pay
the compensation!

710
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,330
It's Hakamada-sensei.

711
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,690
It looks like him.

712
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,860
Especially the goofy look.

713
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,200
He's an attorney specializing
in divorce compensation.

714
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,170
I thought if I worked here,
I'd always have material...

715
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,870
Well, you might find material,

716
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:09,210
but lawyers must keep
client confidentiality.

717
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,680
Of course, I'll
fictionalize those things.

718
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,150
You did say, Sensei,

719
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,420
that you would want me
to work at your office.

720
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,150
That was a figure of speech...

721
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,390
I approve.

722
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,720
You're hired.

723
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,890
Yay!

724
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:28,360
Toyama-san, you're just the landlord.

725
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,300
How many months' rent
do you think you owe me?

726
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,540
She can advertise your firm
in that manga, don't you see?

727
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,940
I understand.

728
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,230
Under one condition.

729
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,710
What is it?

730
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,310
This character...

731
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,350
can't you make him look more handsome?

732
00:42:54,290 --> 00:43:05,890
Next episode...

733
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,050
Double adultery!

734
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,660
I can't forgive my husband.

735
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:03,490
Husband's double adultery!

736
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,690
Compensation can be collected
from the mistress, too.

737
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:03,490
Collect compensation from the mistress!

738
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,260
I was forced to see him.

739
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,500
And he raped me!

740
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,560
Look forward to the hearing.

741
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,070
The court has decided...

742
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:06,050
This drama is a work of fiction.
