4
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,750
It's time for Wednesday Downtown! Thanks for tuning in.

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,850
Let's kick it off!

6
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,490
Let's welcome our first presenter. Here she is!

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,010
What's up!!

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,490
It's Haruna Ai!

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,070
Thanks for having me!

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,640
Thanks so much, everyone.

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,810
Well, if it isn't Hamada's side piece.

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,040
Is that true?

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,540
Yeah, she's Hamada's woman.

14
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,540
What the hell... she's a dude!

15
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,250
How lovely.

16
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,250
They get along a little too well, I think.

17
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,320
I'm just saying. It's suspicious.

18
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,320
No, no, no, no.

19
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,090
What I've brought with me this time

20
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,260
Is a theory concerning cosmetic surgery.

21
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,020
I've noticed something about today's panel.

22
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,360
All of you have double-eyelids, right?

23
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,760
Am I correct?

24
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,330
That seems about right.

25
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,940
If it's not a problem... would anyone here mind being picked on?

26
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,450
...about our eyes, yes?

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,450
There's no way anyone will volunteer for that.

28
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,880
If you'd all please direct your attention to the monitor...

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,800
Ugh, it's me!

30
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,210
That's me!

31
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,210
Oh wow, that's...

32
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,810
What a little cutie!

33
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,220
Hamada-san...

34
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,850
This is from when he broke out of boarding school!

35
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,460
You're right!

36
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,500
I've seen this photo before.

37
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,390
And he's got single lids...

38
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,260
Yes! He's single-lidded here.

39
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,260
Yeah!

40
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,730
And now...?

41
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,960
No, you're wrong!

42
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,000
This is a bit suspect, isn't it?

43
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,470
I didn't get anything done to my eyes.

44
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,770
Why would you do something so ineffective?

45
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,840
I didn't!

46
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,570
Hold on a bit. Is it alright if I take a look?

47
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,690
Let me see.

48
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,400
You're too close!

49
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,780
Could you close your eyes?

50
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,820
They're totally banging.

51
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,120
Are they...?

52
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,850
What the hell...

53
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,160
What are you even doing!

54
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,520
What are they doing??

55
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,590
What exactly is this that you're doing?

56
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,760
How did your eyelids get like that, then?

57
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,450
Hell if I know!

58
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,500
Age. It's age.

59
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,030
Ahh.

60
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,030
It's the skin sagging down.

61
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,000
The hell's this got to do with your theory?

62
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,840
That's right! Here's the theory I've brought with me this week:

63
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,880
Nobody's Had Their Double Lids Surgically Changed to Single Lids

64
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,290
Ohh! I see.

65
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,290
That's right. This is the reverse of the norm.

66
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,310
I see, yeah.

67
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,930
After the break: double lids to single lids, we ask the pros about unusual surgeries!

68
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,520
And a program first: The REAL Prank!

69
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,320
I'm with "Weekly Girls' Gossip"...

70
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,330
Scandal Leak! This comedian thinks he's being pranked.

71
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,820
It's real.

72
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,430
...but it's 100% true! How will he react?

73
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,140
Plus, a "Comedians who are bad at improv are funnier when they're drunk" theory

74
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,780
Followed by a trip to see if there's such a thing as a rest area that doesn't sell soft-serve!

75
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,400
Has this strange corrective surgery ever been performed?
We investigate.

76
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,600
Double-eyelid surgery is among the most common cosmetic procedures, however

77
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,740
oh god!!

78
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,920
Could it be that there are those out there who've had the reverse?

79
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,690
stop it with that picture

80
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,870
And so begins our survey of outpatient plastic surgery clinics.

81
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,640
god I hate that photo

82
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,330
what's with all the fans?

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,860
First to respond to our inquiry was this clinic in Roppongi.

84
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,290
Dr. Kamakura, a plastic surgeon with 18 years experience, answers.

85
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,060
Have you ever performed a double-to-single eyelid surgery?

86
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,800
I have not, no.

87
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,260
ah, bummer

88
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Not a single person?

89
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,600
Not a single person.

90
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,440
I'm actually not sure I could do such a procedure.

91
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,390
that's true

92
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,600
It would be quite difficult and take a very steady hand.

93
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,600
is that right?

94
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,780
Academically speaking, that's not a procedure commonly taught.

95
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,850
Conversely, the single-to-double procedure is very simple.

96
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,810
For this doctor, no such thing.

97
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,240
And what's more, the surgery has a very high level of difficulty.

98
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,140
But since we're already here, we asked Dr. Kamakura a few more questions.

99
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,160
Doctor, among the surgeries you have performed,

100
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,830
Has there ever been a time where you've thought "this sure is rare"?

101
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,870
Rare surgeries... let's see...

102
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,500
There was one patient who wanted a "butt chin".

103
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,540
This was a male patient of mine.

104
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,210
Rare Cosmetic Surgery File 1: Butt Chin

105
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,840
not quite to that extent...

106
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,620
surely that's exaggerated?

107
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,620
that's...

108
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,460
"I want to look like a Hollywood star!"

109
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,920
This is the request patients often make.

110
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,060
But how does one go about creating a Butt Chin in the first place?

111
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:44,200
Specifically what that entails is an injection of Hyaluronic acid to split the chin.

112
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,000
We leave the center alone while adding fillers to the left and right, and there you have it.

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,240
Hyaluronic acid is absorbed back into the body after a period of time,

114
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,730
I see, so it's temporary

115
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,200
So the cosmetic benefits only last about a year.

116
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,100
I didn't know that was a thing

117
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,570
Is that so?

118
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,570
Yes.

119
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,610
But that's not the only unusual surgery he's performed...

120
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,250
This was a female patient I had,

121
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,280
She had very slim calves,

122
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,720
And she wanted them a bit more shapely, similar to the shape of a fish carrying eggs.

123
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,360
Rare Cosmetic Surgery File 2: Pregnant Fish Calves

124
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,940
you can get that done?

125
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,260
Since this was a slim person who wanted to gain weight,

126
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,330
Instead of liposuction, the more common procedure,

127
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,600
What this surgery called for was the introduction of fat to the body.

128
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,870
I've experience dealing with requests like those.

129
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,040
There's certainly an air of "what a waste" with such surgeries.

130
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,450
Next to respond was this Shinjuku clinic.

131
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,520
Dr. Yamamoto, in practice for 24 years, answers.

132
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,660
there's a lot of hot plastic surgeons

133
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,490
No, I've never performed that surgery.

134
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,160
What about your colleagues?

135
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,920
No, not among the surgeons I know.

136
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,010
Is that so?
-Yes.

137
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,650
There's no strong leads to be found,

138
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,500
But what about other rare cosmetic surgeries?

139
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,720
rare surgeries?

140
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,310
There was a gentleman with a tattoo on his, uh, manhood.

141
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,180
The tattoo was of his ex-girlfriend's name.

142
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,380
He got it there?

143
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,350
The tattoo was in English.

144
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,780
I think it said "EMIKO"...

145
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,620
Normally this tattoo wouldn't be visible,

146
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:21,330
"When I get aroused I can see the full text, and I don't like that" was the claim.

147
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,080
that's something else

148
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,700
"I'd like you to remove my ex-girlfriend's name."

149
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,270
sounds painful!

150
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,270
That's the surgery I was tasked with.

151
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,040
Rare Cosmetic Surgery File 3: Ex-GF EMIKO-ectomy.

152
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,930
that's enough!

153
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,610
So normally, he couldn't see it, right?

154
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,610
That's correct.

155
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,580
Under normal circumstances, the penis is collapsed similar to an accordion,

156
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,180
And the lettering of the tattoo shrinks with the skin.

157
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,980
So in that instance, the tattoo would look like a black splotch.

158
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,340
no...

159
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,650
that's crazy

160
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,720
It would probably look something like this.

161
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,160
not necessary!

162
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,740
I don't need the visual!

163
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,080
like that, huh?

164
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,570
he already described it

165
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,240
Moving on to our next doctor...

166
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,590
No, I've never had a patient undergo that procedure.

167
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,370
We're unable to get any info on double-to-single eyelid surgery,

168
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,140
nothing!

169
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,570
But what of Dr. Maruyama's other procedures?

170
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,110
There was a male patient of mine who wanted his nipples removed.

171
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,620
what? why?

172
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,680
"My nipples..."

173
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,560
removed...?

174
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,650
"I want my nipples gone," that was the request.

175
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,770
how?

176
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,720
what does that mean?

177
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,780
Wait... what exactly do you mean?

178
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,920
So, basically,

179
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,920
The issue he had was that his nipples would get erect and become visible, even under a shirt.

180
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,060
There are quite a few people out there who are self-conscious about that.

181

Rare Cosmetic Surgery File 4: Nipple Removal

182
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,800
how is it done?

183
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,620
What exactly does that surgery entail?

184
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,670
The first step is to remove the very top of the nipple.

185
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,580
After that, I remove the rest of the nipple, leaving the areola.

186
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,310
Then I take the bit I sliced off at first and graft that onto the areola.

187
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,480
Oh, I get it!

188
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,080
It's not like they're totally removed, right?

189
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,550
When viewed from the front, the nipple appears normal.

190
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,960
But from the side, there's no obvious erection going on.

191
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,120
A lot of very stylish people request that.

192
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,830
"I don't like the way it looks under my shirt," for example.

193
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,820
to get surgery for that reason... wow

194
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,670
Other fashionable plastic surgeries include...

195
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,800
There was a patient whose hobby was running.

196
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,910
And so to prevent irritation during a run,

197
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,310
This patient requested a scrotal-reduction surgery.

198
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,000
what?

199
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,510
Scrotal...?

200
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,510
"I'd like a sportier vibe," was what he said.

201
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,580
Wh... What in the world?

202
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,080
"A sportier vibe...?"

203
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,020
A sportier vibe?

204
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,020
He asked that I make it smaller, more compact.

205
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,020
sporty??

206

Rare Cosmetic Surgery File 5: Scrotal Sportification

207
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,250
I don't get it!!

208
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,700
I made an incision,

209
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,600
And stretched the skin back to reduce its size.

210
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,240
It turned out very well, actually. Looked great too.

211
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,600
"You really helped me out!" was what he told me after.

212
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,770
So he was happy with it.

213
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,770
"you really helped me out!"

214
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,770
Yes.

215
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,420
"helped him out..."

216
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,310
We continue in our investigation.

217
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:57,280
It's very common for Chinese patients to come to Japan for cosmetic surgery.

218
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,180
"Fukumimi," or puffy, long earlobes,

219
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,490
Are a sign of wealth among Chinese people.

220
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,890
What I do is inject Hyaluronic acid into the earlobe and make it bigger that way.

Earlobe Enlargement for Chinese People

222
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,330
Furthermore...

223
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,540
A patient of mine requested that his genital size be reduced.

224
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,390
that's possible?

225
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,040
He's been my only patient so far to have such a procedure.

226
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,600
why...?

227
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,940
Rare Cosmetic Surgery File 7: Genital Reduction

228
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,840
what the hell kind of...

229
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,580
In this case, the patient got married,

230
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,960
the banana...

231
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,380
And his wife had been very suspicious that he was unfaithful.

232
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,120
Her doubts were so strong,

233
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,860
"If you make it smaller,"

234
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,990
"...I won't need to worry anymore" is what she told him.

235
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,500
there's no way...

236
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,730
"So could you make it smaller and shorter?"
That was the specific request.

237
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,890
that is so screwed up

238
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,730
How big did he want it?

239
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,340
what's the point in that?

240
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,870
Well... the size of an elementary schooler's.

241
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,470
The remaining would be the same size as a grade schooler's.

242
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,700
poor guy!

243
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,180
I guess you can...

244
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,180
what? that's possible??

245
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,840
Among the strangest plastic surgeries so far...

246
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,840
absolutely absurd

247
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,740
...we find this case.

248
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,250
We're looking to see if anyone has gotten double-to-single lid surgery.

249
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,320
There is someone who wants a double to single eyelid surgery.

250
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,090
There is?

251
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,090
Yes.

252
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,140
There is?

253
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,390
At last, we've discovered our original objective, a single eyelid surgery.

254
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,560
Is that so?

255
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,040
That's right!

256
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,020
Really?

257
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,320
Finally found one.

258
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,860
Futhermore,

259
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,080
There IS someone

260
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,400
We have the surgery scheduled soon.

261
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,960
One's coming up.

262
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,960
Oh, I see.

263
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,940
Surprisingly, he's preparing to do the surgery in two weeks.

264
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,420
Perfect timing.

265
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,740
I see.

266
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,780
Then, we receive permission from the doctor to interview the patient.

267
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,780
I dunno, I wonder

268
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,900
The next day, we hear their story.

269
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,180
Hello.

270
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,160
Hello.

271
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,840
Thanks for working with us.

272
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,520
This is the Chinese woman receiving the double to single eyelid surgery.

273
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,420
Ah, Ryuu.

274
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,980
Ryuu In, 34 years old.

275
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,940
Ryuu, what for?

276
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,360
They're really defined.

277
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,780
Her eyelids are distinctly double, however

278
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,500
Lovely double eyelids.

279
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:58,200
What's the story behind you getting the double to single eyelid surgery?

280
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,200
Okay, okay.

281
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,940
Because originally I had single eyelids.

282
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,940
Eh?

283
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,740
Originally, I had single eyelids.

284
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,300
What the heck is this?

285
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,120
She wants to reverse it?

286
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,580
15... around 16 years old I think.

287
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,780
Before I came to Japan, my mom said

288
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,820
"In Japan, lots of people have single eyelids so

289
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,720
when you go to Japan, wouldn't it be good to have double eyelids?"

290
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,560
"Let's do it." I said and I had it done.

291
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,640
This time's surgery is on

292
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,460
her surgically made double eyelids that her mother recommended 18 years prior.

293
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,070
They will be returned to their original single eyelid form.

294
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,260
What is she gonna do?

295
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,560
But why the heck did she decide to have this surgery?

296
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:42,710
One thing is everyone says "You had surgery, huh."

297
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
Oh, it looks too obvious?

298
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,900
I'm often found out.

299
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,780
"You've had surgery on your eyes." for example.

300
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,760
It's a little unpleasent...

301
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,380
One reason is that the surgery done in China is rough.

302
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,000
The fact she had surgery is quickly revealed to those around her.

303
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,700
Is that so?

304
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,460
She doesn't like it, huh

305
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,640
Then another reason is

306
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:06,800
Thinking back to when I was small, I really think that, "It was better like that, huh."

307
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:13,140
She came to think that she liked it better when it was natural.

308
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,140
Single eyelids are cute, too

309
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,510
One week later. Surgery day.

310
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,680
What are they going to do for filming?

311
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,720
Long time no see.

312
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,920
It's been one week, huh.

313
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,520
That's right. Today I have a slight surgery.

314
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,020
We inquire what her state of mind is right before surgery.

315
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,000
For Koreans, everyone has single eyelids, right?

316
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,160
I think that's nice.

317
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,960
Ah right, like K-pop.

318
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,880
You're not worried at all?

319
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
No, I'm alright.

320
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,400
The cosmetic surgery that Ryuu will receive is as follows.

321
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,340
First, an incision is made along the double eyelid line from the previous surgery.

322
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,820
The eyelid is then opened.

323
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,160
The thread that creates the double eyelid is removed.

324
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,740
There's a thread inside?

325
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,240
The stitches in the hypodermis under the fold are removed.

326
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,920
That's rough.

327
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,320
The eyelid is then sewn back up.

328
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,240
With that, the surgery finally begins.

329
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,920
Ah, this is amazing!

330
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,360
This is amazing.

331
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,040
Then, after one hour, the surgery is over.

332
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,700
Is the result like before,

333
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,060
with clear single eyelids returned?

334
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,820
Thanks for coming.

335
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,080
After the single eyelid surgery, has Ryuu

336
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,480
been returned to single eyelids like before?

337
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,920
Thanks for coming.

338
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,560
It's so swollen that we can't tell at all.

339
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,320
That's surprising.

340
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,020
But that's right after.

341
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,020
Needs a little time.

342
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,600
You can't really tell...

343
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
It's so swollen.

344
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,060
Still, there is a fresh scar.

345
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,800
At present, it became an even more distinct double eyelid.

346
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,520
Yeah, I see I see

347
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,840
Right, since we're trying to forcefully revert the incisions to make them double

348
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,680
Well, it should get better within two months.

349
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,980
The doctor did a really good job

350
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,440
It's even more of a double eyelid than before.

351
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,220
It's even more.

352
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,500
But it does take two months.

353
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,290
One month later.

354
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:43,340
Only one month after surgery, this is Ryuu.

355
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:48,520
Since we're reverting back, it's more swollen for now

356
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,520
They're still swollen but the progress is good.

357
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,560
We have no choice but to wait a little longer.

358
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,320
That said, they should be healed by the time this airs.

359
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,500
No, no, no.

360
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,460
No, no, no, no.

361
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,180
Yes?

362
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,180
So why did we air this so soon?

363
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,820
No, but really in order to broadcast it, Ryuu was really...

364
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,820
No, no, no, no.

365
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,490
If that's the case, wait until after one or two months.

366
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,490
That's right.

367
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,290
When this is airing, they'll insert footage of it.

368
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,290
Yeah, exactly.

369
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,700
We'll show everyone how the single eyelids look after waiting two months.

370
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,700
Are we in such a rush?

371
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,670
On that note,

372
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,800
Two months after surgery, this is what Ryuu now looks like.

373
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,900
The swelling has gone down but it now looks more like a natural double eyelid.

374
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,180
The swelling has gone down and

375
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,660
it still didn't turn into single eyelids.

376
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,720
In comparison to the surgery I had done in China, I think it's a lot better.

377
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:55,740
However according to the doctor, Ryuu is the slow healing type and going forward they will become proper single eyelids.

378
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,340
Let's move on to our next presenter

379
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,680
Savanna's Takahashi

380
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,880
When you think of "Wednesday Downtown"

381
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,390
you think of the many "Pranks" you have performed

382
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,590
From Hamada's beloved "A person is there" series

383
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,560
to the "Scolding" series

384
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,430
We have assaulted many people with our plans

385
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,860
But within that...

386
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,270
we have discovered a brand new concept

387
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,840
within the world of pranks here today

388
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,840
Really?

389
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,110
That hasn't been done before?

390
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,810
That has definitely not been done before

391
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,610
That I haven't even heard of

392
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,610
I see

393
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,880
And that is this...

394
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,780
Real Prank

395
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,520
What the hell? What do you mean?

396
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,590
What do you mean by that?

397
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,560
Just from the title it's a bit much right?

398
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,560
It really is

399
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,130
When you think of a prank reveal, what kind of things come to mind?

400
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,770
Concerning the image

401
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,770
The sign comes out

402
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,970
The sign comes out right!

403
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:07,670
Everyone's seen that sign come out that says "Prank Success"

404
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:12,180
When that comes out you realized that you've been pranked

405
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,180
Like "Oh man!"

406
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,910
Like "Ahh, it was a prank!"

407
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,910
That's right

408
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,950
Depending on the circumstances, you'd be like "Aw man that was a prank?"

409
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,120
That's the feeling you get right?

410
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,620
This time, on that sign

411
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,830
Instead of "Prank Success", we put...

412
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,700
"Real"

413
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,260
"Real"?

414
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,260
"Real"?

415
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,270
What is this??

416
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:38,400
I don't understand what you mean by this at all

417
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,470
With all the things happening around you

418
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,380
In the moment you think that it's a prank

419
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,980
We reveal that it's real

420
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,980
The fact that everything is real

421
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,450
is what we will convey with that sign

422
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:59,190
So, for this theory, the Wednesday Downtown staff have taken a special route

423
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,730
to do research on several tabloids

424
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,060
Scary!

425
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,630
We were able to successfully obtain

426
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,730
an upcoming article containing personal gossip on a certain celebrity

427
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,730
That's really amazing!

428
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,640
What do you mean?

429
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,010
And that person will get hit with the "truth"

430
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,010
It's actually real?

431
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,010
Yes it is

432
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:25,920
I see, so you make them think that a scandal is going to be released

433
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,220
then when they're thinking "oh this must be a prank"

434
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,490
That it must be a prank right

435
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,560
It's Real!

436
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,560
It's Real!

437
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,460
That's terrifying

438
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,560
In order for this plan to succeed

439
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,640
we needed real, unearthed celebrity gossip

440
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,200
So with that...

441
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,440
Research was performed on several weekly publications

442
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,950
From Weekly Girls' came an article that they planned to write soon about a certain star

443
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,420
That celebrity is...

444
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,420
Sanshirou's Komiya

445
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,090
Oh wait, will it leak?

446
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:09,630
With that, during early May

447
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:16,970
A reporter from Weekly Girls' has prepared to ambush Komiya, as he's about to appear on a show

448
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,010
We were also given permission to film at the scene

449
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,580
Hello Komiya, nice to meet you I'm from Weekly Girls' Magazine

450
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,010
Ahh, this feeling sucks...

451
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,820
Komiya. You had said earlier that you "like cabarets"

452
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,120
It seems like lately you've been having a lot of fun around the countryside

453
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,220
Do you remember?

454
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,420
Eh? Wait? What?

455
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,560
You went to Atami sometime around March correct?

456
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,830
Yeah...

457
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,830
You did, correct

458
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,660
How did it go? Regarding your pick-up style

459
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,000
Wherever you went

460
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,100
Saying things like "Come and play with me in Tokyo", "I'll pay for your travel"

461
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,370
Did it go well?

462
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,370
I never said..

463
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,810
Oh really, I've heard some things here and there about it

464
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,810
Here and there?

465
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,440
The article being released is...

466
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,750
About Komiya flirting and messing around in Atami

467
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,250
Do you have a card?

468
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,250
Oh yes yes, please

469
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,620
I apologize

470
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,390
Suddenly stopping you like this

471
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,560
I have a show now

472
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,560
Oh are you busy now?

473
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,860
I've got a new joke to do so...

474
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,860
Oh... is that so

475
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,100
I can't feel bad for you in this situation

476
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,840
Who cares

477
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,840
Since it's a new joke, we'll back off

478
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,240
This is regarding Atami?

479
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,240
Yes, regarding Atami

480
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,510
What is this? Are you planning to publish this?

481
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,210
Well, yeah we did have that intention

482
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,980
Eh? This is kind of scary...

483
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,050
Komiya becomes startled by the sudden direct interview

484
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,090
But Komiya does remember doing what the reporter is saying?

485
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,720
He did actually go to Atami

486
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,560
Excuse me, I have to contact my manager

487
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,560
Oh, is that so?

488
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,530
And my new joke...

489
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,600
And my legs hurt

490
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,540
This should be your new joke

491
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,640
"new joke" and "my legs hurt"

492
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,280
Komiya tries to escape the reporter with some puzzling excuses

493
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,380
Is this going to be published?

494
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,380
We have plans...

495
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,050
What are you going to drop?

496
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:16,320
Just stuff like the answers you give us..

497
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,490
Well, was there anyone you made fall for you?

498
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,860
No, the girls were just doing their jobs

499
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,800
Is that right

500
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,830
But is there anyone you're still being contacted by?

501
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,370
Being contacted by? Contacted?

502
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't think so, I haven't met anyone either

503
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,940
So the Ogikubo* girl didn't work out either

504
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,680
*Ogikubo is a town outside of Tokyo

505
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,680
Didn't work out... did I contact her?

506
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,350
Ehhh? That's scary!

507
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,250
I think Noda contacted her though...

508
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,280
He sold him out!

509
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,780
This guy!

510
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,450
She said "I got a message from Komiya" though...

511
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,450
Through line?

512
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,920
Yeah, with Line.

513
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,920
I don't use Line though

514
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,560
Oh, via mail then

515
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,560
Mail?

516
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,290
She got several messages from you saying

517
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:01,230
"I'm nearby so let's hang out" is what she said

518
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,800
What about that? Did it go well?

519
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,970
No...

520
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,700
Ahh, I'm sorry, apologies for interrupting you

521
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,040
Thank you very much!

522
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,580
He's sulking

523
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,580
He's sulking so bad

524
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,820
There's small grains of truth here, but this is his first ambush

525
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,660
Still not knowing whether this situation is real...

526
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,930
He stares at the business card he received

527
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,900
They're taking pics

528
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,900
Hurry up, you got a new joke to do

529
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,530
And your legs hurt...

530
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,570
Of course, he has the memory of doing this

531
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,110
He's still looking at the card...

532
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,380
He rationally takes in the situation

533
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,120
Blatantly hangs his head

534
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,190
Afterwards

535
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,630
He reports the details to his manager

536
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,800
You did go right?

537
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,700
To the cabaret club

538
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,700
Yeah, I did end up going

539
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,100
With the shock of knowing that the article is going to be released

540
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,800
We end this day here

541
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,380
The day after the magazine's assault.

542
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:27,850
Komiya is called out to the office to discuss the facts regarding the article

543
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,850
This is pretty heavy

544
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,890
We also contacted the office beforehand

545
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,630
and had them set up some hidden cameras

546
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,990
This is an amazing prank

547
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,000
Basically, the article will publish

548
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,870
Probably around next week it seems

549
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,070
When did you go to Atami?

550
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,140
Well, sometime around last month?

551
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,280
Noda-san, and... just you two?

552
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,680
On vacation?

553
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,080
So you traveled, and at night, you went to the clubs?

554
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,080
That's right

555
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,090
Noda said that he wanted to go

556
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,820
Oh, Noda said he wanted to go?

557
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,820
Yeah

558
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,160
He's like a child

559
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,720
The reporter said

560
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,360
You met a woman in Ogikubo

561
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,060
and exchanged contact info?

562
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,200
That was Noda

563
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,100
He's been bringing up Noda a lot

564
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,900
He's really selling him out

565
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,630
Noda exchanged the contact info?

566
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,940
Noda probably traded numbers

567
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,900
And when we usually go to Kouenji

568
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,940
Noda probably contacted her

569
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:28,180
Repeatedly selling out his senior comedian, Onigashima's Aiamu Noda

570
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:32,920
Komiya tries to save himself, however...

571
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,090
In these days

572
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,760
And even an issue involving a woman, this article...

573
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,460
if it releases

574
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,790
Things would not be looking very good

575
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:47,930
If there were more extreme acts done

576
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,740
You could lose some commercial jobs or sponsors

577
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,610
And you might not be able to

578
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,640
perform on some of your regular shows

579
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,640
I see

580
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,380
Just doing the late night shows is fine though

581
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,210
No, that's not good...

582
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,820
Not allowed even though it's late night...

583
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,820
"Late night only is ok"...

584
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,420
If you could do this in moderation...

585
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:12,360
Being scorned with a rational argument

586
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,490
Komiya can only bow his head

587
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,200
However, the manager leaves his seat...

588
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,370
But all I did was go...

589
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,500
That's right

590
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,370
He's single too

591
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,810
I just went to a store

592
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,210
He's really saying a lot

593
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,750
Is it really that big a deal?

594
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,520
How does everyone else avoid this in life?

595
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,260
I didn't do anything

596
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,190
Why is he talking to himself out loud like that?

597
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,460
Talking to himself in a matter of fact tone

598
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,700
His anxiousness explodes

599
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,400
And then...

600
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,240
Aida usually goes to cabaret clubs more than myself

601
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,680
And he goes to visit prostitutes as well

602
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,040
He talks a lot

603
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,780
He snitches on his partner's unrelated nighttime activities

604
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,380
In terms of popularity

605
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,150
he has less so nothing's been said

606
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,990
Aida uses me as a shield

607
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,200
It's best to tell Tomita that as well

608
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,630
Basically, the article will publish around next week

609
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,840
so please prepare yourself for that

610
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:39,110
With that part being real, he feels down

611
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,850
From here, in order to prepare for the "Real" reveal

612
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:50,090
With the help of actors, we'll make him think the article will not release, and this is a TV prank

613
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,960
and he will become more relaxed

614
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,460
I see...

615
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,100
The first part of the "Maybe this is a prank" block

616
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,230
An interview which reeks of lies, from a show that reeks of more lies

617
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,470
This show is called "Cupid's Love Talk"

618
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,270
Cupid's Love Talk...

619
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,270
Yes

620
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,610
Everytime we bring a guest to the studio

621
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,080
and we solve some love problems

622
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,750
on this talk variety show

623
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:15,750
Ok

624
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,720
We'll be asking you a few questions

625
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,580
so we're pleased to be working with you

626
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,490
This was supposed to be an interview about romance, however...

627
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,860
It's common to go out to the countryside

628
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,660
When you visit the countryside, do you like to play around?

629
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,670
Well, you see...

630
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,270
I go to the onsen, the cabaret clubs, and the like

631
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,910
Do you like cabaret clubs?

632
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:50,680
I guess so, it's nice to go when you want to drink with women

633
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:54,890
For sure, you must be popular when you go there right?

634
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,250
I mean, you're famous...

635
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,690
I'm thinking that's all "Business Talk" though...

636
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,690
Ah, is that so?

637
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:07,160
What do you like specifically about the clubs?

638
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,830
I don't like them that much, but I don't...

639
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:14,040
With that, Komiya has found the connection with the "prank"

640
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,440
And gives an "I'm saved" expression

641
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,680
And then

642
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,310
Ah, camera!

643
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,310
He's looking for the camera!

644
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,120
He surveys his surroundings

645
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,660
Camera found

646
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,260
And then...

647
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,460
a smile

648
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,100
So straightforward

649
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:46,840
Now that he's under the impression that this is a "Scandal Release Prank"

650
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,240
Finally, the man Komiya will suspect as a prank instigator

651
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,980
Onigashima's Aiamu Noda invites him to dinner

652
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,880
giving off the feel that the prank reveal will happen soon

653
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:04,550
The way he sat like he's going to
leave soon is pretty suspicious

654
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,490
And then...

655
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,360
What? What is it?

656
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,860
He's searching

657
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,430
What are you peeking at?

658
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,030
C'mon, I've had enough of this

659
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,200
What?

660
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Nevermind

661
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:20,900
"I already know so hurry up and reveal the prank", he feels

662
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,540
And after that...

663
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,370
Do you know something

664
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,080
I do not know what you are talking about

665
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,450
About the Atami thing

666
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,750
What Atami thing?

667
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:33,050
A woman seemed to leak something...

668
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,590
Eh? Uhhh... eh?

669
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,660
Eh? What's that?

670
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,160
She is... did...

671
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,860
leaked...

672
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,100
I got ambushed

673
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,100
Ehhhh...

674
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,600
What, why are you laughing?

675
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,610
What is it?

676
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:00,080
With Noda's naturally atrocious acting

677
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,580
Komiya's suspicions have been confirmed

678
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,050
With that...

679
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:09,290
From now, we enter the main portion of the plan

680
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,490
Finally, we present the "Truth"

681
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,420
Woah!

682
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,980
To Komiya, who thinks this is all a prank

683
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,550
Finally, we present the "Truth"

684
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,350
Oh!

685
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,120
You surprised me

686
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,620
You surprised me

687
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,560
He looks pretty relieved

688
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,730
As the staff storm the room with cameras

689
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,630
He gives a "Yup, it's a prank" grimace

690
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,470
How're you feeling?

691
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,440
Is it normal to ask that now?

692
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,010
I'm sorry, I have to apologize

693
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:07,840
I really think that I already know...

694
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,880
He's not very good at lying

695
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,020
"I'm sorry for figuring out the prank early"

696
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,990
He apologizes, gazing from his pedestal

697
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:21,390
But really he's a man who's figured out nothing

698
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,360
By the way, umm...

699
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,060
What is it?

700
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,570
He's just holding the sign

701
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:31,330
It's like that right?

702
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:36,370
Regarding the "Komiya was going to Atami's cabaret clubs

703
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,680
and was playing around" thing

704
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,410
Wasn't there talk of an article being released?

705
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,950
That talk, in fact is...

706
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,990
A prank?

707
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,550
It's real

708
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,030
Real?

709
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,030
Real.

710
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,600
Hold on, what do you mean?

711
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,900
It will release?

712
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,900
It will

713
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,640
The article will release in the Weekly Girls' publication

714
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,000
Hold on a minute...

715
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:13,210
Hold on... what do you mean by...

716
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,010
What do you mean "real"?

717
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,250
What's this...

718
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,110
It's real.

719
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,320
Sucks right?

720
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,230
We just came today to convey to you the truth that the article will release

721
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,500
I'm not caught up in a prank right?

722
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,130
You're not, this is all real

723
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,570
What, if it's real, that's no good!

724
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,940
What do you mean 'real'

725
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,410
Normally you'd say "It was a prank"

726
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,410
But it's not

727
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,980
What do you mean "real"? The article will release?

728
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,410
Uhh, what about that reporter?

729
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,750
He's real

730
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,920
Huh? What??

731
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,720
Cause it's real

732
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,090
You're saying "real", what do you mean "real"??

733
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,890
I don't get the trick

734
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,290
Wait, where does it start being real?

735
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,160
I'll say it again

736
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,370
The story that you were messing around in Atami cabaret clubs

737
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,500
Will release

738
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,000
and the main office's anger is also real

739
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,470
Wait, isn't that bad?

740
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:20,440
I don't understand anything, what does this mean?

741
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,180
I've never seen a sign like that

742
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,910
saying "real"

743
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,550
normally it's "Prank" right?

744
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,550
Like we said, this isn't a prank

745
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,650
What the hell!

746
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:33,890
We used the normal prank format to come and reveal the truth to you

747
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,890
No no that's not needed

748
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,160
Are there pranks that leave this shitty of an aftertaste?

749
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,930
This isn't a prank

750
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,930
No, you say "It was a prank"

751
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:43,430
I'd say "Oh, thank god", and we'd have a few drinks. That's a prank.

752
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,840
What is this "real"

753
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,840
This isn't a prank

754
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,370
Saying it's not a prank would be fine if you were to put it a little more gently!

755
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:53,340
Normally you should be releasing this more secretively

756
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,680
A bunch of people will see this (article)

757
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,850
A bunch of people are gonna watch this

758
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:01,550
Hold on, my head is spinning...

759
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:05,690
I don't wanna go home... hold on...

760
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,320
Ehh, this is real?

761
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,260
What am I even saying "This is real?"

762
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,900
And with that, everything is real

763
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,900
This article was actually released correct?

764
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:18,900
Yes

765
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,740
When this airs

766
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:26,660
This gossip article about Komiya in Weekly Girls' will already be out.

767
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,850
This article isn't a big deal though right?

768
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,850
Yeah it really isn't

769
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,080
It doesn't really matter

770
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,180
Komiya's evilness has seeped out...

771
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,180
It really has

772
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:39,560
I think Komiya did a great job though

773
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,190
That satisfied look when Komiya looks for and finds the camera

774
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,130
Even when he realized that

775
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:48,400
He must have thought "I can't reveal that I know, because I'm a comedian"

776
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,600
Ahh, like "I wonder if this might be a prank"

777
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:56,270
So he has to play along with what he thinks is a prank, with that huge smile on his face

778
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:00,780
He really is THE HUMAN

779
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:06,650
I wonder what his new joke was...

780
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,650
What the heck was that brand new joke he had that day?

781
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:13,980
Next, we test various theories from around the world.
The Viewers' Theory Corner

782
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,460
Tonight's presenters are:

783
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,520
It's Miki~

784
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,300
Thank you.

785
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,300
Thank you.

786
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,800
Today we've come here but, um~

787
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,800
Yes.

788
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,720
"We've come here" you said.

789
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,690
Saying you came here, it's work!

790
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:30,910
We're nervous, right?

791
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,900
What are you nervous about?

792
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,500
No, no, no. It's our first time here...

793
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,860
It's fine, "We came here."

794
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,860
We actually did come here.

795
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,060
We came here today.

796
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,060
We took a plane to come here.

797
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,290
We've come here today.

798
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,290
What is this speech?

799
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,280
It's impossible to recover from this speech.

800
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,340
Mastumoto-san.

801
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,340
Yes?

802
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,120
On the IPPON Grand Prix show,

803
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,120
Yes, the oogiri-style improv show.

804
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,380
There you watch various people, but

805
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,670
when you're watching, what makes you say "This guy is good."?

806
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,260
Surprisingly when it comes to manzai,

807
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,260
the straight man seems to be more fitting right?

808
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,340
I see.

809
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,280
Suprisingly.

810
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,700
You prefer the straight man more than the funny man.

811
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,700
I can't say unconditionally, but surprisingly it's sometimes like that.

812
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,700
So, it's sometimes like that.

813
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:11,700
Is that so.

814
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,650
Like Football Hour's Gotou-san...

815
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,650
Therefore...

816
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,820
Sorry, you two were talking at the same time.

817
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,190
Calm down!

818
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,820
I'm not the Eight-Eared Prince Shoutoku...

819
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,090
You can hear two people, right?

820
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,820
You can hear two people, separately.

821
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,020
This time, we have a theory that even comedians bad at improv can become funny.

822
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,770
This is what we've selected.

823
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,720
Here it is.

824
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:35,060
Theory: "Comedians who are bad at improv are funnier when they're drunk."

825
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,520
Ah, I get it.

826
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,940
They're better if they're drunk.

827
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,940
That's right.

828
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:47,980
Let's investigate the theory: "Comedians who are bad at improv are funnier when they're drunk."

829
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,580
Dining-with-strangers Queen Challenge. Yay~!

830
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,850
It's Amaki Jun.

831
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,200
This time, while filming a fake program,

832
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,780
I feel bad for them

833
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,560
these comedians bad at improv will have fun drinking.

834
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,280
For saying "they're bad at improv"

835
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,280
Otake huh...

836
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,360
Tooth!

837
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,840
That's a strong start.

838
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,960
Once they've had plenty to drink,
they'll receive their improv challenge.

839
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:11,270
Ah, that's the good stuff.

840
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,720
That's good!

841
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,440
They pound glass after glass.

842
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,480
They may be bad at improv but these three are good at drinking.

843
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,160
Then.

844
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,960
Fukuoka.

845
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,240
Nagasaki.

846
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,960
Yamagata.

847
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,420
They continue drinking for three hours.

848
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,860
Amazing.

849
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,860
Amazing, 12 drinks.

850
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,760
They've become completely dead drunk.

851
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:43,300
Hmm, I want to go a trip, just the two of us.

852
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,800
For our main purpose, we move to the TBS studios.

853
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,800
There's a strange atmosphere.

854
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:53,320
On this improv set, we'll test our theory.

855
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,320
So sudden.

856
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,240
Open this, open this.

857
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,240
Heigh-ho​.

858
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,220
Huh?

859
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,760
Wait a minute, what's this?

860
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,760
I've been waiting for you.

861
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,260
No, no. Everyone's been waiting.

862
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,760
What do you mean?

863
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,760
Alright.

864
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,080
What is this? What, what?

865
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,160
No, no, no.

866
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,860
What? What? What's this?

867
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,970
We've already started.

868
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:13,580
What? What? What? What's this?

869
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,580
No, no.

870
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,580
They're incredible.

871
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,470
What, what? Wait a minute.

872
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,610
Kasuga, please sit.

873
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,240
For now, sit down. Ok.

874
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,380
I don't know.

875
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,880
Wait, wait, wait.

876
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:19,880
That's enough.

877
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,050
Ah, that's good. You turned out great

878
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,080
That's good.

879
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,980
Abareru-kun, thanks.

880
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,900
This is really bad.

881
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,800
You guys are Wednesday Downtown.

882
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,120
Wait, wait, wait.

883
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,360
What? Kawashima-san,

884
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,360
Wait a minute! What, what, what?

885
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,760
Have a look.

886
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,960
It's everyone's favorite.

887
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,960
What, what, what?

888
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,330
Hmmm, college girls.

889
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,360
So much work for Kawashima-san

890
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,800
Sit, you! Quick.

891
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,400
Hurry up and sit, you.

892
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,330
Well then, what theory is it?

893
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:45,970
Ah, answering a quiz, something about answering a quiz while drunk.

894
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,970
Ah, I see.

895
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,240
About boisterously answering the quiz.

896
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,540
That's why we're drunk.

897
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,540
Let's do some improv!

898
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,860
What did you say?

899
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,040
"Let's do some improv!"

900
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,910
Why would we improv? There's no way

901
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,910
Astute!

902
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,650
Eh?

903
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,650
Today's investigation is:

904
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,820
"Comedians that are bad at improv are funnier when they're drunk."

905
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:05,460
Seriously?!.. wa-wait, wait.

906
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,460
Thank you.

907
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,790
Could you be quiet a little

908
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,290
Eh, do improv right now? In this state?

909
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,290
Yes, everyone's energetic improv.

910
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,000
This is a show right now?

911
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,000
You already know that.

912
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,760
Your-

913
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,760
It's Wednesday.

914
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,700
Wednesday.

915
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:23,340
Kawashima will judge when their improv answers are funny.

916
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,920
Too hard!

917
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,000
Will they really be funnier when drunk?

918
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,280
Dead drunk improv start.

919
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,460
Well, let's get started.
The first question is:

920
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:38,580
What's the stage name of the sumo wrestler who went 10 years without a win and retired?

921
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,560
This is a good one, huh?

922
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,060
This is too sudden

923
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,400
Ah, he's quick.

924
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,340
Quick.

925
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,930
The stage name.

926
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,370
Which one? This one? This one?

927
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,240
I'll go, I'll go. I've got it. I've got it.

928
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,020
Alright, Otake-san. Let's see.

929
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,360
Looking forward to it.

930
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,360
I'M DONE!

931
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,020
Ok.

932
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,840
The sumo wrestler's stage name?

933
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,840
Sweet shrimp.

934
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,120
Ah~ close. Good point though.

935
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,090
Why is it no good?

936
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,910
If it was the character for "shrimp" you would've been fine

937
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,910
I see

938
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:04,880
So it's about that

939
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,880
The hell is this diligence

940
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,190
Well, cause I'm your senior

941
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,150
Okay Abareru-kun!

942
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,690
Tell us the name of the wrestler!

943
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,190
Stoic

944
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,470
Ah I get it

945
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,030
Got one!

946
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,030
Kasuga-san, let's go

947
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:21,120
The name of the wrestler who didn't even win once

948
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,920
Osumo-chan!

949
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,300
That wasn't it

950
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,240
Go for it Otake-san!

951
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,740
Vinegar

952
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,540
Yeah that's good!

953
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,740
Was it Su(Vinegar)?

954
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,080
Okay you got it.

955
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,110
That made me happy

956
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,050
With an answer he could not have provided if he was sober

957
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,520
Otake splendidly gets a point

958
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,440
Are they still making him drink?

959
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,860
Onto the next theme...

960
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:52,330
What was the message Momotaro sent to the demons before going to the demon island?

961
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,200
Have a think

962
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:59,530
This is getting messed up.

963
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,630
Does he think that's some kind of ultra miracle water?

964
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,400
They're really picking up the pace now

965
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,870
Huh? To the demon island?

966
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,040
He goes there right?

967
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,010
You must get this

968
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,240
Got it!

969
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,710
Go for it Kasuga-san!

970
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,000
Do you have space for 4 people today?

971
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,160
Yay!!

972
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,350
Yeah that's good

973
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,320
Kasuga, who is only slightly drunk

974
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,560
Gets a point with a genuine answer

975
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:23,760
That's kind of embarrassing

976
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,500
If Downtown were to change their name to ___ &____ what would be it be?

977
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,370
It's gotta be this...

978
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:36,920
Alright Abareru-kun, what would be their new name?

979
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,730
"The Blonde Yakuzas"

980
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,140
Are you alright?

981
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,080
You happy with that one?

982
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,050
You sure that was it?

983
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,450
It's a buzzer for me

984
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,290
This dude is just...

985
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:51,990
His face is turning pale

986
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,720
What would Downtown change their name to?

987
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,590
"Gangster organization"

988
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,900
Are you ok?

989
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,540
He's drunk!

990
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,930
When they watch this live, they're gonna be furious at you, you know

991
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,170
He's drinking alcohol

992
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,770
No uh, it can't be helped

993
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,300
You were like that stupid Amuro Ray guy

994
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,660
Otake-san, what would be downtown's new name?

995
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,940
It's cause they're two different characters alright?

996
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,450
The breast meat & the thigh meat

997
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,750
That one was funny

998
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,750
Yeah it was

999
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,010
The breast meat and

1000
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,010
The thigh meat yeah

1001
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,020
Cause they're playing separate characters

1002
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,830
Who would be someone unexpected to have released a nude photo book?

1003
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,520
Next one could be funny

1004
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,520
Okay okay!

1005
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,140
Come on, let's go one by one

1006
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,070
Huh? Whatcha say?

1007
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,640
What did you say again?

1008
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,800
Check by yourself please

1009
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,910
Otake is gone

1010
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,760
Ok, go ahead

1011
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,060
Issei Sakamoto

1012
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,910
This was wrong huh?

1013
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:47,510
It is wet instead

1014
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,910
Sorry, I'm gonna go take a leak

1015
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,480
Are you going to go pee?

1016
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,450
Sorry～

1017
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,850
I'll do this one too

1018
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:56,790
That was close

1019
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,430
What's up with you anyway?

1020
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,130
Well, I'm not drunk so

1021
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:02,800
Give us one, we're drunk so give us an example.

1022
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,230
Please give us one example

1023
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,930
I'm just saying he should have one

1024
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:07,730
Instead of only us giving you answers

1025
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,430
What would you write if it was you?

1026
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,180
Yeah we want a hint from you

1027
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,100
Provide us an example

1028
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:17,310
He ain't gonna give us a hint guys～

1029
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:22,410
No he'll give us something more like "This answer is the correct one"

1030
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:25,410
You're the improv legend

1031
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:26,680
I'm not a legend

1032
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,450
You've never failed with improv

1033
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,450
That's right

1034
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,640
Expect, we're being serious

1035
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,920
I have to be serious okay?

1036
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:34,960
Reina from Max

1037
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,390
I had to be serious

1038
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,220
That was very good

1039
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,400
We got the correct answer!

1040
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:48,490
As you can see, here are the points so far

1041
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:45,140
They are having a blast

1042
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:51,040
And now, the last question

1043
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,010
What would be a comedian with the nickname "A stupid ass without a punchline"?

1044
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,910
What did you say?

1045
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,960
Kasuga-san, go for it

1046
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:02,550
A stupid ass without a punchline is Chiemi Blouson

1047
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,960
It's the alcohol talking

1048
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,890
A bell is no good

1049
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,160
Give me the buzzer

1050
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,730
Okay, that's good is it?

1051
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:11,690
Yup yup yup

1052
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,000
Kasuga-san

1053
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,140
Who would be a stupid ass without a punchline?

1054
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:23,310
* A respected TV-presenter and actor

1055
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,600
Hide-chan (Hideyuki Nakayama)*

1056
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,600
You okay?

1057
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,970
Wow... that's

1058
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,700
He's drunk

1059
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,310
This is really bad

1060
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,310
He's drunk

1061
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:24,850
Are you alright?

1062
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:27,610
You've got courage for sure

1063
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,610
There are many Hide-chans

1064
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:30,640
He's way too drunk now

1065
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:30,150
Well, you wrote "chan" so...

1066
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,480
My Hide-chan is not the one everyone else thinks it is

1067
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,380
When you get the bell it goes straight to air you know.

1068
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,380
No no no

1069
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,820
In conclusion, when you drink alcohol you dare to say more

1070
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,590
Just terrible

1071
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:42,590
It was pretty funny though

1072
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,530
This was bad

1073
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:46,260
We just want you to understand that they were drinking

1074
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,720
They were not serious

1075
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,200
It's because it was improv

1076
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,200
Exactly exactly

1077
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,070
Well of course...

1078
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:53,770
That's why

1079
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:56,210
we don't think downtown is a gangster organization

1080
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:57,670
No that's fine

1081
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,680
cause we actually are so

1082
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,180
No no we're not

1083
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,810
We have another one

1084
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:07,680
So people who have been to a highway...

1085
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,390
Highway?

1086
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,390
Been to..

1087
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:15,360
I'm pretty certain there are people who have been to highways

1088
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,770
What are you on about?

1089
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,770
Going there...

1090
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:20,260
You mean more like people who has been on them right?

1091
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,260
Correct

1092
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,930
People who have been on them

1093
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
Exactly, that

1094
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,960
There are service areas

1095
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,640
And you go to them right...?

1096
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,640
Stopped at one!

1097
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,210
Yeah I've stopped at one.

1098
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,210
Right?

1099
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:32,740
There's lots of food at these service areas

1100
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:36,510
Any classic foods you think of?

1101
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,510
I wonder...

1102
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,750
Corn dog

1103
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:40,250
Corn dog!

1104
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,250
Potacon!

1105
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,350
Potacon!?

1106
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:44,550
It's bacon inside potatoes that's on a stick

1107
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,690
We're asking about staples though

1108
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:47,790
They have them around

1109
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:50,190
Everyone is confused

1110
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,190
We're only on #2, don't throw a special ones

1111
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,080
Melon pan

1112
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,080
Ah I see

1113
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,300
Exactly

1114
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,100
Soft serve

1115
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,100
Right!

1116
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,500
We have a strong image of them

1117
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,140
Soft serve at service areas

1118
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,400
Cause they are everywhere

1119
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,400
Yeah I guess we do

1120
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,710
This is the theory

1121
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,410
Theory: There's no service area that doesn't sell soft serve

1122
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:15,180
They have them everywhere don't they?

1123
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:15,180
Exactly

1124
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:21,520
Theory: There's no service area that doesn't sell soft serve

1125
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,530
How will this go?

1126
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,200
And so:

1127
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,210
I'm sure they all have it

1128
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,600
Here are the people who will help us with the verification this time!

1129
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,170
Thank you very much!

1130
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,170
Okatsu loves these

1131
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:38,120
In addition to soft serve, we're also investigating the classic corn dog and melon pan

1132
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,010
The three participants

1133
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:43,850
will visit each of the service areas along the Tomei Expressway

1134
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,680
Wow this is tough

1135
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:49,350
They will then check if these three items are sold

1136
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:52,250
What do you guys think will be the best?

1137
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,120
I'm thinking the corn dogs

1138
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,090
And you?

1139
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:57,630
I think soft serve

1140
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:03,800
The wishes of the participants decides who is in charge of what item

1141
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,770
The winner is whoever has bought their respective item until the last stop

1142
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:12,580
In other words, if the item isn't sold, you drop out

1143
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,340
We drop out?

1144
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:14,340
Correct

1145
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:18,610
So if you picked an item that's available everywhere

1146
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:21,120
you get to be on TV for longer am I right?

1147
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,120
Exactly

1148
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:23,650
And with that,

1149
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,990
we're off to our first stop: Kouhoku parking area

1150
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,360
You're married right?

1151
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,790
Yes I am.

1152
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,530
He has a daughter as well

1153
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:34,530
She's 5 years old

1154
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:36,470
5?

1155
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:36,470
Oh I see

1156
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:43,340
She does ballet, gymnastics and judo.

1157
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,940
Ballet and judo are opposites!

1158
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:51,580
On Saturdays mornings she has ballet and judo in the evenings

1159
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:53,650
That was apparently very funny

1160
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:59,860
While the bus is running, have arrive at the first location, Kouhoku Parking Area

1161
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,690
We're expecting to find them aren't we?

1162
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:05,560
No one's dropping out on the first stop

1163
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,200
The investigation begins

1164
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,530
Yes, investigation just begun

1165
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:11,040
And without delay

1166
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:12,600
There's one immediately!

1167
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,500
A bakery!

1168
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,620
There's melon pan, huh

1169
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,670
Found it!

1170
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,340
Yay!

1171
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,410
I got a brioche melon pan

1172
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,940
This is a good sign

1173
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,350
They have them

1174
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,750
I'm a bit anxious...

1175
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,890
There's a...

1176
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,090
Shonan gold!

1177
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:35,380
Ah, it exists

1178
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:35,360
They have it!

1179
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,130
Hokkaido Soft Serve

1180
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,130
They have it!

1181
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:37,610
Of course they have it

1182
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,120
Look below it please

1183
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,140
Corn dog for 250 yen

1184
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,430
We go it!

1185
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,130
Yay!

1186
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:51,070
Soft serve and corn dog gets cleared right away

1187
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,270
That looks delicious!

1188
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:53,140
Here we go!

1189
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,900
Oh they eat it?

1190
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:54,810
They gotta eat it?

1191
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,710
Delishhh!

1192
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,520
This gotta be tough

1193
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:01,650
The deliciousness is in the yokozuna class

1194
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,990
It's a fusion of delicious and a Hak...

1195
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:08,060
Next they will be arriving at the "Ebina Service Area"

1196
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,900
That was sad

1197
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,060
It can't be helped

1198
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:13,800
Morita clears his right away with the famous Ebina melon pan

1199
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,270
We sold 27,000 of these in two days

1200
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:18,970
You sold 27,000!?

1201
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:19,560
That's amazing

1202
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:23,240
The number of sales has been certified by the Guinness World Records

1203
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,670
And then,

1204
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,640
A Yubari melon one right?

1205
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:29,980
They have corn dogs!

1206
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:30,760
Yahoo!

1207
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,010
Yay!

1208
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,740
They had all of them

1209
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,950
They complete all of the three items this time as well

1210
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,490
This is tough

1211
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,020
How's the world class taste?

1212
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,260
Yeah it's really different than the last one

1213
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,430
How is it different?

1214
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:44,290
It's more delicious

1215
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:45,790
I mean I say delicious but...

1216
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:49,160
It's strange that it doesn't really go all the way in

1217
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,830
Um... It's really delicious

1218
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:55,740
deliiiirious

1219
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,580
However something's strange with Morita

1220
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,580
They didn't even ask why he said that.

1221
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,380
Are you full?

1222
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:03,380
Yeah I'm getting there

1223
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,980
A feeling of fullness seems to have hit him

1224
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:09,000
Well I guess so

1225
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,020
Incidentally, This time we introduce a rule that the person must finish the product

1226
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,430
This'll make you full for sure

1227
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:22,800
And at our third stop, Nakai Parking Area

1228
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:24,730
We struck a double!

1229
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,570
Corn dog

1230
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:27,370
And soft serve

1231
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:28,640
Yay!

1232
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,540
Immediately!

1233
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,340
We did it!

1234
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:35,740
While Tsuneda and Akatsu found theirs smoothly...

1235
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,480
Uh the melon pan's gotta be inside for sure

1236
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,740
Morita goes inside the shop for his search

1237
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,280
That's rough

1238
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,280
That's right

1239
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,090
At that point

1240
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,090
Uh!

1241
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,420
Aah aah!

1242
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,830
Oh no its wrong. This is Anpan

1243
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:52,390
You gotta be kidding me

1244
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,160
Custard... Cream...

1245
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,030
Cream pan... Cream pan...

1246
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,200
Don't have them already?

1247
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,770
What about the outside?

1248
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,240
Unfortunately, They didn't sell any

1249
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,400
Ah I see...

1250
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,380
Great work!

1251
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:07,380
No way!

1252
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,580
You're kidding me!

1253
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,880
You've dropped out.

1254
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,880
No way. I can't believe it

1255
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:15,580
Is it ok if I'm in the car chatting?

1256
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,390
Please go home

1257
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:24,930
And with that, on the third Nakai parking area stop, Melon pan Morita drops out quickly

1258
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,020
Haha, Melon pan Morita

1259
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:27,790
And so,

1260
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:34,040
Yup I'm feeling it

1261
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,870
Don't you think we can exchange just once?

1262
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:38,810
No

1263
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:38,810
Ok...

1264
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,910
Delition!

1265
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:42,880
They gotta be full

1266
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:44,610
Kakuryuu?

1267
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:44,610
That's right

1268
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,380
It's going very well for out two contestants

1269
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,760
Sorrie

1270
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,200
Haha sorrie

1271
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,080
Is he alright?

1272
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,800
It seems like he's approaching his full stomach limit

1273
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,870
Well of course

1274
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:01,240
Ice cream seems like the toughest one

1275
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:05,700
At which point, at the 7th spot, Ashitaka Parking Area

1276
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,440
The second person to drop out is:

1277
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:11,840
Do you have corn dogs?

1278
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,780
No we don't.

1279
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,780
Huh?

1280
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,480
You serious?

1281
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,250
Didn't have any huh

1282
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,480
This for real?

1283
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:21,110
You were right about the soft serve

1284
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,250
Okatsu san...

1285
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,800
Indeed

1286
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:23,650
You've dropped out

1287
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,650
Really?

1288
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,450
I can't believe it

1289
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,640
And with that,

1290
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:32,360
Corn dog Okatsu drops out

1291
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:37,930
Soft serve Tsuneda is left alone

1292
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:42,340
We've arrived at our 8th stop, Fujikawa service area

1293
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,460
Fujikawa

1294
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:46,900
As expected, they found soft serve here as well

1295
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,280
They have them everywhere

1296
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,300
I guess so

1297
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,240
Right

1298
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,180
Somehow he manages to finish it

1299
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,360
There aren't any places that don't have them

1300
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:58,650
Without failure, the service areas keep selling and he keeps eating

1301
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:05,090
It's been 9 hours since the start of the recording and he's completed 10 soft serves

1302
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:04,100
9 hours!

1303
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:08,000
This has been a big

1304
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,870
time waster for me

1305
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,980
Tsuneda realizes that

1306
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:18,510
even if he wins it will still be a waste

1307
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,340
And so,

1308
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:24,410
We've arrived at our 11th stop, Ogasa parking area

1309
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,890
Around here is pretty dark now...

1310
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:28,950
Yeah it's dark, it's already evening

1311
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:31,020
Are you sure they have it?

1312
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,450
Let's have it

1313
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:33,690
Let's have it..

1314
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:35,690
You seem tired

1315
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:35,690
No no

1316
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:37,760
Hmm?

1317
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:41,030
The search begins promptly inside the shop as usual

1318
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,170
But they can't quite find it

1319
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,340
Do you perhaps have soft serve?

1320
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:49,770
Sorry, we don't do soft serve here

1321
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,010
Really?

1322
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:54,540
Which means... this is the end

1323
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,080
Can't be real

1324
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,450
Really!?

1325
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:56,450
Yes

1326
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:57,610
They don't

1327
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:58,180
right

1328
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,780
have it

1329
00:53:58,810 --> 00:53:59,780
correct

1330
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:06,290
If I may, why don't you sell any here?

1331
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,290
Uhm well,

1332
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:10,730
we used to sell it before

1333
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,560
Because of various circumstances...

1334
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,630
Since February this year, sorry

1335
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,430
Well that's it then. There are shops that don't have it

1336
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:19,600
Tsuneda, this is the championship

1337
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,870
We did it...

1338
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:26,800
Unwittingly, if it wasn't for Ogasa parking area,

1339
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,850
they would have sold it all the way until Sakurajima service area in Kagoshima prefecture.

1340
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:33,380
So they do it sell it everywhere

1341
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,480
Yes

1342
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,320
So that was the result!

1343
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:43,260
If you guys called them beforehand he could've finished it

1344
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,250
That's right but...

1345
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,860
If we did we'd all be very sorry for Tsuneda-san

1346
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,900
He'd have to eat sooo much soft serve

1347
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,900
What did you think? Nimura-san.

1348
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,000
I mean there are a lot of different flavors depending on where you get it.

1349
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,210
It was fun

1350
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:57,210
Right?

1351
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,910
If we could try them all together sometime that would be great. Ok so that's it!

1352
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:04,380
That was us from "Viewers' Theory Corner"

1353
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,850
That was such a forced ending!

1354
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:34,880
Check out our Facebook and Website for more Wednesday Downtown! This video was subbed by a community run project called the Wednesday Downtown project. Thanks for watching!

1356
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,990
Next week: Real Life JoJo Transmission Tower returns!

1357
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:16,040
In the ruins of a mountain

1358
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,960
No what is this

1359
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,460
You can't escape unless you lure in a substitute

1360
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,770
So I'm camping right now

1361
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,870
A tribute to ever-growing harshness and betrayal of human life

1362
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:29,810
And also,

1363
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,430
Are there people who actually call themselves breast maniacs!?
