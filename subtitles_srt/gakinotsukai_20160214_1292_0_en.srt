Tsukitei Hosei     Endo Shozo     Tanaka Naoki

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,080
I wonder if this guy is gonna be alright.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,880
It's 24 hours.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,930
The first time I saw him I thought

7
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,500
he came straight out of Tensai Bakabon.

8
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,620
He jumped right out of volume 8.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,250
So far, both Tsukitei Hosei and Drunk Dragon's Suzuki Taku

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,770
24 Hour Long Interview

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,840
have challenged the 24 hour long interview.

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,740
I've broken a lot of people's bones.

13
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:38,480
Talk about their life nonstop for 24 hours

14
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,660
During this segment, one has to talk nonstop

15
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,330
about their own life so far for 24 hours.

16
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,480
The one who will challenge it this time is...

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,520
Tonight's special guest is Jimmy Onishi, welcome!

18
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:50,180
Jimmy Onishi (52)

19
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,100
You just pulled the red curtain right over you.

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,890
You've probably been hiding back there since yesterday.

21
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:56,020
Recently you've been in all kinds of TV shows.

22
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,880
Well, since you let me show up here every year.

23
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,880
Yeah, at the No Laughing Series.

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,450
That has really helped me out.

25
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,760
But you've shown up at all these popular shows

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,940
that suddenly wanted you as a guest.

27
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,260
Shows like Golden and Gan Gan, right Jimmy?

28
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,090
Have any of those appearances left you anything good?

29
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,850
Well, maybe 1 good hit out of 10 swings.

30
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,850
It's not that many...

31
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,850
It's only 10 percent.

32
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,850
I think that's too many swings.

33
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,060

Tonight's stage is a certain hotel in Asakusa.

39
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,090
Look at the snow.

40
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,220
How do you feel about the 24 hour interview?

41
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,260
There's a few breaks here and there, right?

42
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,260
There's no breaks.

43
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,980
Nonstop?

44
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,980
It's nonstop.

45
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,580
It's fine if I sleep a little bit, right?

46
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,580
No.

47
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,580
Good morning.

48
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,140
The 24 hour long interview will take place in this room.

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,100

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,090
During this interview we will be using this time-line

62
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,520
to go over everything that has happened in Jimmy's life.

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,370
Today I'd like to start our 24 hour interview with your birth.

64
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:38,530
Sure

65
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,720
Jimmy, when were you born?

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,280
I was born on January 1st, 1964.

67
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,490
On New Year's Day.

68
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,280
You were born on New Year's Day.

69
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,280
Yeah.

70
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,980
The interview starts with some personal questions.

71
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,410
What's your real name?

72
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,000
Um, Onishi Hideaki

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,810
So your name is Hideaki.

74
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,410
Can you explain the meaning behind your name?

75
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,970
Onishi...um...the Onishi...well,

76
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,180
there's nothing I could do about that.

77
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,180
You don't need to say that.

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,860
You couldn't do anything...

79
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,120
The "Hide"came from Toyotomi Hideyoshi...

80
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,280
because he was born on January 1st.

81
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,880
And then the "Ake" came from the phrase for "Happy New Year".

82
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,040
So there was a meaning
behind the name.

83
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,000
That's the meaning behind "Hideaki".

84
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,060
How many people were there in your family?

85
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,740
My family was...

86
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,980
My dad, my mom...um...

87
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,600
Say it quickly!

88
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
My older brother and me for a total of four.

89
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Wow, that's scary.

90
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,810
Jimmy was raised in a family of four.

91
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,840
Why didn't you remember your brother?

92
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,250
But what were his parent's personalities like?

93
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,580
I'd like to know what kind of people were your parents.

94
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,890
My dad was...

95
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,900
an alcoholic... so he drank all day.

96
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,920
What kind of father was he at home? Was he scary?

97
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,140
He had a lover so...

98
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,600
He didn't spend much time at home.

99
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,900
When did you learn he had a lover?

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,200
Some time before my dad retired...my mom...

101
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,760
found a letter from his lover inside his suit's inner pocket.

102
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,730
When she opened and read it, it said... um...

103
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:37,040
I've been by your side for

104
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:37,040
35 years,

105
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,800
That long?

106
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:33,770
Yeah.

107
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,040
thank you for making me so happy.

108
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,940
I thought he did a really good job hiding it.

109
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,560
Next, an episode about his mother.

110
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,010
What kind of parent was your mother?

111
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,730
She used to work at the cafeteria of what is now NTT.

112
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,480
"You won't be able to speak on the same level as your parents

113
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,740
until you start bringing your own money to the house."

114
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,370
She used to say that.

115
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,780
That's why I started delivering newspapers since the 4th grade.

116
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,380
Really?

117
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,280
Yeah.

118
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,080
I was a young worker.

119
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,640
I see.

120
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,360
I'd like to learn about the influence your parents gave you.

121
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,020
First, what kind of influence did you get from your father?

122
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,810
My dad taught me...

123
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,340
"Imagine everyone around you is a thief."

124
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,410
My mom taught me...

125
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,420
"Don't touch other people's belongings."

126
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,050
Something like the shield and the spear.

127
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,540
Opposite...
they're opposite.

128
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,040
Complete opposite.

129
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,340
Growing up in that family, what kind of child was Jimmy?

130
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,100
I'd also like to ask about kindergarten.

131
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,610
Do you remember anything about kindergarten?

132
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,240
According to things I've heard from others...

133
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,340
I was always alone... um...

134
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,410
playing with wooden blocks or pretending I was a train.

135
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,140
I guess I didn't mix too well with everyone else... um...

136
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,620
I wasn't able to speak at first.

137
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,320
My mom said "I'll take him to the hospital."

138
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,200
My grandmother said "It won't do any good if you take him."

139
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,760
"He'll learn to speak eventually." And well...

140
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,060
In elementary school there was a girl I really liked.

141
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,700
So the first word I spoke was "like".

142
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,240
I liked a girl called Maki.

143
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,380
After saying "Let's play together during summer"...

144
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,450
she got some kind of disease and...

145
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,840
she passed away in September of that year.

146
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,400
What kind of relationship did you have?

147
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,600
Well, rather than a romantic relationship...

148
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,640
it was more like a little love.

149
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,090
What are you even talking about?

150
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,780
Were you able to make friends during elementary school?

151
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,500
During elementary school...

152
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,500
Between 3th and 4th grade I made more and more friends.

153
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,970
What helped you make so many friends?

154
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,440
I guess it was thanks to me telling Maki I liked her.

155
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,210
Everyone was surprised that I could actually speak.

156
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,420
And from there I began to slowly learn how to speak Japanese.

157
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,730
What the hell?

158
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,050
Things like being able to say my own name.

159
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,400
You sound like a kid
returning to Japan.

160
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,080
That makes me angry.

161
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
You couldn't have spoken anything other than Japanese.

162
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,530
He experienced his first love
and his first farewell during
his elementary school years.

163
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,410
Your face hasn't changed at all.

164
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,400
What will he say when asked about his earliest memory?

165
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:41,280
What is the earliest memory you can remember? If you can.

166
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,570
I can't recall anything.

167
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,240
Just that there was this big stone over me.

168
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,090
A big stone?

169
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,300
My body was laying under a big stone.

170
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,300
Are you Goku?

171
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,300
That's the only thing I can remember.

172
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,050
Are you Son Goku?! (Sun Wukong)

173
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,460
What do you think about that big stone?

174
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,450
It was a rock. I was under the rock.

175
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,370
That was Goku.

176
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,450
Definitely.

177
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,610
I couldn't knock the rock off me.

178
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,970
Being trapped by a rock.

179
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,580
That's when Sanzo
Hoshi helps him.

180
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,890
And after that...

181
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,740
It's size was about from there all the way over here.

182
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,940
I couldn't knock it off so I tried to slip out like this.

183
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,940
The story of the mysterious rock continues

184
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,360
So then...

185
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,420
Let's say this was the rock, I was just stuck going like this...

186
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,760
Because I couldn't knock the rock off me.

187
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,290
Enough about the rock!

188
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,490
He's been going on forever about the rock.

189
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,010
Once again we try to identify the real identity of this rock.

190
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,330
In your opinion, what exactly was that rock?

191
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,690
It was a rock.

192
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,840
Yeah, you've made that very clear.

193
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,800
That's seriously all I can remember about the rock.

194
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,740
Jimmy Onishi's 24 Hour Long Interview

195
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,740
Time: 1 hour and 23 minutes

196
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,060
We're still at the beginning of Jimmy's history.

197
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,650
Now I'd like to ask about your elementary school years.

198
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,960
How well did you do in school?

199
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,480
I didn't do well at all.

200
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,620
Every time I brought my report card home,

201
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,620
my mom would...

202
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,620
she called me Hide-chan.

203
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,050
"Hide-chan, your report card is like a marathon."

204
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,490
"It goes 1, 2, 1, 2."

205
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,160
Did you learn any skill during elementary school?

206
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,090
Yes.

207
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,160
The abacus.

208
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,020
Using the abacus?

209
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,090
Yes.

210
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,120
But I didn't earn a grade for learning it.

211
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,140
I got an award for my effort.

212
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,010
You didn't get a grade?

213
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,890
Why did they give you an award for your effort?

214
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,400
No matter what, I just couldn't earn a grade.

215
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,260
So in the end they just gave me the award.

216
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,520
How long did you practice it?

217
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,520
3 years.

218
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,850
And you couldn't get a grade?

219
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,180
After 3 years they should have just given you a grade.

220
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,560
Jimmy was really bad at school, but...

221
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,920
along with the abacus, he practiced something else...

222
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,240
You practiced baseball, right Jimmy?

223
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,200
Yeah, I uh...

224
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,410
When I was younger...

225
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,040
I would do things like XXXXX and XXXXX.

226
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,820
You did bad things.

227
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,970
I would do very bad things so,

228
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,780
I was pretty much forced into baseball.

229
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,780
Jimmy was a naughty kid who loved mischief.

230
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,720
Who was your best friend during elementary school?

231
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,580
The bathhouse's XXX-kun

232
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,100
What kind of person was he?

233
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,440
He used to peep at the baths a lot.

234
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,720
The women's bath?

235
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,700
The women's bath.

236
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,840
When I went to his house we would always

237
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,650
peep from above for a long time.

238
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,770
We wanted to ask more about Jimmy's thoughts on his best friend.

239
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,980
How do you regard XXX-kun?

240
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,140
Well, he taught me how to masturbate so...

241
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,760
He's my lewd benefactor.

242
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,650
She didn't ask you that.

243
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,650
You're talking nonsense.

244
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,650
The interview is gonna continue like this...

245
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,540
Was that the awakening of your sexuality during puberty?

246
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,810
I'd say my puberty started since the 5th grade.

247
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,500
I haven't missed a single day since then.

248
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,660
Missed what?

249
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,660
Masturbating.

250
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,160
Since the 5th grade?

251
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,450
I've masturbated without missing a single day since the 5th grade.

252
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,610
I guess today will be the first time.

253
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,140
This must be scary
for the interviewer.

254
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,020
Because she's a girl.

255
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,180
The first time?

256
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,400
That interviewer must have been trembling.

257
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,980
She accepted the job.

258
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,680
She must have been shaking then too...

259
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,420
How many times did you use to do it?

260
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,810
At least 5 times every day.

261
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,210
The most was...

262
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,000
about 13 times I think.

263
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,640
An elementary school student who followed his instincts.

264
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,560
We tried asking a simple question.

265
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:14,860
Can you tell me your schedule for a day back then?

266
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,530
I woke up at 2:30 AM to deliver newspapers,

267
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,090
finished between 5:00 and 6:00 AM,

268
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,260
I ran home...

269
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,660
and masturbated,

270
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,660
ate breakfast...

271
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,170
and masturbated,

272
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,050
and went to school...

273
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,760
I ate my lunch,

274
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,890
and went to the restroom to masturbate,

275
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,820
I went back home,

276
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
and masturbated,

277
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,420
Stop that!

278
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,220
went to baseball practice, went back home and...

279
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,890
and masturbated...

280
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,840
And you went to sleep.

281
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,500
then I went to sleep but if I woke up to go to the toilet,

282
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
I would masturbate again.

283
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:11,050
And then it was 2 in the morning again.

284
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,360
Your lunch is here.

285
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:22,900
Time: 2 hours 47 minutes

286
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,440
Lunch time takes place at 12:50.

287
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,360
Today's menu is egg drop soup and shrimp fried rice.

288
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,800
Middle aged guys shouldn't eat unbalanced meals.

289
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,120
Do you prefer Japanese, Western, or Chinese food?

290
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,040
Western.

291
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,980
Western-style food?

292
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,880
What kind of Western-style food?

293
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,810
Food like...

294
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,530
fried prawn and...

295
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,460
Salisbury steak...

296
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,860
That's just
wrong...

297
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,020
He's slurping
pretty hard.

298
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,040
I can't watch
this anymore.

299
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,930
Time: 3 hours 32 minutes.

300
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,690
It's 1:36 PM.

301
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,290
After eating a meal and recovering lost stamina,

302
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,720
the interview continues with his middle school years.

303
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,780
I'd like to know more about your middle school years.

304
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,580
Sure.

305
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,040
What kind of middle school did you attend?

306
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,000
My middle school was...

307
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,220
Well, I was in the baseball and judo clubs.

308
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,480
Did you have a nickname in middle school?

309
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,900
It was a long nickname but...

310
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,100
"Guts Ishimatsu's face after losing a match"

311
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,560
Because my face looked just like when he lost...

312
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,700
Guts Ishimatsu's face when he lost a match.

313
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,060
Definitely not his
face when he won.

314
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,370
They called me "Guts".

315
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,370
So then they just called you "Guts"!

316
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,130
Who's your favorite artist?

317
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,240
Inoue Yosui

318
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,920
I really love "Yume no Naka e".

319
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,730
The way the song takes hold of one's heart.

320
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,700
Time: 3 hours and 50 minutes

321
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,210
It's been 3 hours and 50 minutes since the start.

322
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,500
Around this time something
unusual happens to Jimmy.

323
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:26,740
What does the song "Yume no Naka e" mean to you?

324
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,610
What's wrong? Wait a minute!

325
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,560
The interviewer is asking you a question!

326
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,500
He went into a dream.

327
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,460
TL Note: Yume no Naka he = Into a Dream

328
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,770
Is this some kind of hypnotism?

329
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,740
He did go into a dream.

330
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,970
You're kidding!

331
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:50,960
Jimmy fell asleep...

332
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,890
They're asking you.

333
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,820
He's sleeping?

334
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,740
Jimmy, are you alright?

335
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,820
Ah, you scared me.

336
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,730
Mornin'

337
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,210
You didn't get much sleep yesterday?

338
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,290
No, I did sleep but...

339
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:08,770
I just ate so I got kinda sleepy and dozed off. Sorry.

340
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,460
Can I go smoke a cigarette real quick?

341
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,410
You can't.

342
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,880
Please hold it in for now.

343
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,260
After just 4 hours, Jimmy is assailed by drowsiness.

344
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,740
And after that...

345
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,290
What made you start smoking?

346
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,700
That's too fast.

347
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,040
You're kidding, right?

348
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,260
Jimmy, that's way too fast.

349
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,370
Jimmy?

350
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,920
It felt really good.

351
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,610
What made you start smoking?

352
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,700
It looks like you've been up for 16 hours.

353
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,040
Jimmy?

354
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,440
Not good.

355
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,090
What made you start smoking?

356
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,340
JIMMY!!

357
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,800
What the hell is this!

358
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,980
Wake up.

359
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,780
What the hell!

360
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,480
This guy is a monster.

361
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,690
Please wake up.

362
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,680
This is too funny.

363
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,780
Jimmy... Jimmy...

364
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,240
Jimmy!

365
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,810
How many times are
you gonna do this?

366
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,010
Ah, a cigarette.

367
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,300
I can't, I can't

368
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,100
Jimmy!!

369
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,010
If they showed us this during New Year's it'd be dangerous.

370
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,100
Please wake up.

371
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,970
Alright, different question.

372
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,200
I'll change the question.

373
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,980
Okay, what did you think of middle school?

374
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,450
What did middle school mean to you Jimmy?

375
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,380
Wake up!

376
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,520
He's still at it.

377
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,660
Wake up!

378
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,600
Seriously, this is against the rules.

379
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,540
The 24 hour long interview won't be completed if this continues.

380
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,740
They should take him outside!

381
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,610
Therefore...

382
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,220
Yeah.

383
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,730
Yeah, take him somewhere cold.

384
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,240
Jimmy!!

385
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,620
Can I go smoke real quick?

386
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,720
You can't.

387
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,380
We're going somewhere else to continue.

388
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,960
Well then, let's go outside.

389
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:54,800
Jimmy is taken out of the room in order to wake him up.

390
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,240
Of course.

391
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,800
Do you always doze off?

392
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,810
I get sleepy after eating.

393
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,520
Today is gonna be tough if you won't let me sleep.

394
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,970
!@#$%&。

395
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,410
What was that?

396
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,660
Figure it out.

397
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,820
Nobody could understand that.

398
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,520
Jimmy, do you usually go for walks?

399
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,280
Only when I need to buy something.

400
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,010
Surrounded by chilly air, they walk towards their destination.

401
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,690
Which city do you prefer, Tokyo or Osaka?

402
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,370
There's nice things in Tokyo and nice things in Osaka so...

403
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,940
I can't really pick one over the other.

404
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,880
Time: 5 hours 3 minutes

405
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,680
It's weird how you keep slurring words.

406
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,420
The interview will continue in this theater,

407
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,420
starting with the high school years.

408
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,160
First, what sort of high school did you enter?

409
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,210
Well, I got into high school with a baseball recommendation.

410
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,930
How strong was your school?

411
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,540
I'd say we were in the top 4.

412
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,580
The team won a tournament with private schools...

413
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,480
Back then PL Gakuen High even had...

414
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,280
Yoshimura who later played with the Giants.

415
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,020
That time our school won.

416
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,560
That's amazing.

417
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,130
It was a strong high school.

418
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,290
I'm guessing practice was very intense.

419
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,200
Rather than intense, I'd say it was dreadful.

420
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,650
Back then any mistake was quickly met with a punch.

421
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:24,050
I heard that you were bullied during high school...

422
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,660
Well, it was just teasing from my seniors.

423
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,210
Things like making me stop a train.

424
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,540
The express trains don't usually stop...

425
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,500
and they really wanted to stop one.

426
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:42,980
So I stood naked shouting "Stop! Stop! Stop!".

427
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,100
So they made you do that.

428
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,240
Thankfully I did that on a straight part of the track.

429
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,000
Spartan Days

430
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,000
Those were days of nothing but baseball, but what about his love life?

431
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,240
You didn't happen to get a girlfriend during high school?

432
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,880
No, I wasn't really able to get a girlfriend.

433
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,600
When did you have your first kiss?

434
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,410
I think it was right when I entered this world (show business)...

435
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,860
with a working girl when I was 18.

436
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,440
You keep talking about this stuff.

437
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,520
What did you think of high school?

438
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,600
Eh!?

439
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,690
What are your thoughts on high school?

440
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,400
The interviewer
started irritating me.

441
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,690
Darkness.

442
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,690
And why is that?

443
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,060
I thought that without baseball I could have lived a happier life.

444
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,060
Time: 6 hours 37 minutes

445
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,090
It's now around 4:40 PM.

446
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,330
We change location and continue with his beginnings as performer.

447
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,410
Let's continue and talk about your apprenticeship at Yoshimoto.

448
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,650
What did you do after graduating from high school?

449
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,080
I graduated from high school and...

450
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,370
I worked as a stagehand at the Nanba Kagetsu theater,

451
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,920
closing the curtains and setting up for rakugo.

452
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,320
That's were I met Sanma-san.

453
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,890
So you met him around that time.

454
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,850
Yeah, I met him back then.

455
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,730
By the way, why did you decide to join Yoshimoto?

456
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,140
I'd say it was because since my school days Yoshimoto was...

457
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,330
they've been in Osaka for a long time so...

458
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,580
Yoshimoto was very entertaining,

459
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,620
as an entertainer you'd want to join them.

460
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,930
Who joined them at the time?

461
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,220
People like Downtown, High Heel and Tommys.

462
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,410
So you met them all at once, at the beginning.

463
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,780
What did you think of Downtown the first time you met them?

464
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,970
I thought they were amazing. They were very funny.

465
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,570
Mr. Okure

466
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:44,570
Starting as a stagehand,
Jimmy was able to begin
his life as a performer.

467
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,160
Why did you decide to move on from being a stagehand?

468
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,090
Sometimes I would be part of Downtown-san's performances.

469
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,900
Why are you
adding "-san"?

470
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,120
I really liked it.

471
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,320
I wanted to become someone's apprentice.

472
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,410
So I asked Sanma-san and he told me,

473
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,880
Join someone who is kind, that way you'll be able to keep up.

474
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,930
Bonchi Osamu was very kind so I chose to become his apprentice.

475
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:16,400
19-year-old Jimmy started his apprenticeship with Bonchi Osamu.

476
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,520
How long were you Osamu's apprentice?

477
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,920
2 years.

478
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,740
Can you tell me what you liked and disliked about your teacher?

479
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,240
I disliked that he was a cheapskate.

480
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,380
He was a cheapskate?

481
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,360
Yeah, he was.

482
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,600
If we ate something better than him he would get mad.

483
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,850
One time we went to the cafeteria and he got kitsune udon while I got tempura udon.

484
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,180
He shouted "Why are you eating something better!"

485
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:46,090
I thought, "What? There's only a 50 yen difference."

486
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,340
"Make sure you order the cucumber roll".

487
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,220
That was his ironclad rule at the sushi shop.

488
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:56,720
Changing the subject, we ask about the story of his first kiss.

489
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,820
You mentioned earlier that your first kiss was when you were 18, when you were a stagehand?

490
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,220
Yes, when I was a stagehand...

491
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,610
Sanma-san asked me "Are you a virgin?", I said yes.

492
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,920
"Here, I'll give you 20000 yen, go to XXXX.", he said.

493
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,170
"Go and then tell me how it went."

494
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:17,040
So I went to XXXX and kissed and stuff...

495
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,700
It felt really good, so I said "I'm coming!"

496
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,530
and she said, "It's fine, go ahead."

497
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,370
But what came out was pee so she got really mad.

498
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,220
I told Sanma-san about my failure but he really enjoyed the story.

499
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,610
Is this really TV!?

500
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,620
I thought it was...

501
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,770
Next week!

502
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,980
How did you seduce her?

503
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:50,370
Jimmy Onishi's 24 hour interview concludes.

504
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:59,180
The truth behind his mysterious turnover to painter and his return to show business will be revealed.

505
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,090
Anything else you want to say?

506
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,450
No, there's nothing left.
