00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,350
Hello!

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,390
Excuse me? I'm sorry but..

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,060
I got a big event today

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,460
Actually I need to go to a party

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,100
I don't have much time, but

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,140
it will be a casual home party, so

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,770
I could just go empty-handed

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,010
But, well you know,

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,480
to be honest

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,040
people around me think that...

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,520
I'm very special because I am a foreigner

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,680
I could just go empty-handed, but

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,190
I want to kind of

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,660
meet their expectations

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,160
So a small bunch of flowers would be nice

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,530
I'm in a hurry

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,000
but can you help me?

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,960
Can you get something for me? Thank you

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,970
Please hurry as I have no time

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, today is..

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,440
Yes tes, that is it

23
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,010
As always

24
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,750
Like this..and that...

25
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,080
Hold this, and then

26
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,590
Don-tah-tah-tah Don-tah-tah-tah

27
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,260
Den-den-den-den Den-dende

28
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,460
Girls in love are

29
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,460
Ban-ban-ban Ban-ban

30
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,330
Tonight with you

31
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,530
Ban-ban-ban Ban-ban

32
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,070
Den-den-den........

33
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,940
Jeez, I told you to wake me up!

34
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,770
WHAT IS THAT!

35
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,710
It doesn't make any sense!

36
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,380
There are too many elements!

37
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,750
No center core in this

38
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,320
It was hige-dance in the beginning,

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,650
then suddenly there were lyrics
and " I told you to wake me up"

40
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,790
It makes no sense!

41
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,760
Nonsense!

42
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,120
What the hell

43
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,230
Do it right! I'm counting on you

44
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,700
Really..please do it right

45
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,270
You are always fooling me..well

46
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,900
Roses. Roses. Roses are good

47
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,900
Everybody would love roses, right?

48
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,900
Bring some roses

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,510
I'll take roses

50
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,740
Yes, roses are good

51
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,510
Please hurry

52
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,950
I'm sorry for you, but

53
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,750
* Bara = Roses  Bara-su = To put the chill on

54
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,750
It seems that I have no other choice
but putting the chill on you

55
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,390
as you went against us, Black tigers

56
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,430
It is too late to beg for your life like that

57
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,300
You know too much about us

58
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,070
You got to know too much

59
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,400
Da-da-da-dan Da-da-da-dan

60
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,770
You know too much!

61
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,370
SHUT UP!

62
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,010
Don't copy what I do!

63
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,750
This is my moment!

64
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,020
You always try to join me!

65
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,220
No wonder Otsuka Nene refused a kissing scene with you!

66
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,190
You stupid! What are you thinking?

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,090
Wrong. I said roses!

68
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,630
Why do I have to kill you?

69
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,830
Do you know what is a rose?

70
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,930
Rose!

71
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,800
The one with thorns. Thorns!

72
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,800
Thorns! You understand it right? Bring me some!

73
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,810
Thorns. The one with thorns

74
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,710
Hurry up. I have no time!

75
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,640
He's day-dreaming

76
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,050
Why did you do that, Master?

77
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,060
Master of ceramic art

78
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,860
Why do you say this was a mistake?

79
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,500
We don't understand

80
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,900
Master..I can't go your way any longer

81
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,270
Sorry, I'm going my way

82
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,920
Isn't it wrong

83
00:03:59,250 --> 00:03:59,950
Let's do it right

84
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,290
I came to buy flowers

85
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,220
I don't care about ceramic art

86
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,330
I'm too tired to shout

87
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,360
But

88
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,030
The one thing..

89
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,700
I have to reward you for one thing...

90
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,240
I'm glad, what I was glad about was that...

91
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,140
You were still wearing the wig

92
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,310
That is a great work of you

93
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,380
Really great. If you weren't wearing the wig,

94
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,780
It would be too terrible to look at

95
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,520
This is really

96
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,920
Let me shake hands

97
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,760
You scored a point

98
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,890
This is your kindness

99
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,460
Your kindness

100
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,130
But

101
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,800
Do your business now

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,240
Bring some flowers if you are a florist, OK?

103
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,470
Do it right!

104
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,510
Show me that you are a member of society!

105
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,010
Am I right?

106
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,040
Don't fool around!

107
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,110
Don't even think about fooling around...

108
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,780
Tetsuya

109
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,210
WHO THE HELL IS TETSUYA!?

110
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,250
Who is Tetsuya?

111
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,850
Go, hurry!

112
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:07,620
OK?

113
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,460
Well...never mind

114
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,790
Let's see..what would you know

115
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:18,460
Something gorgeous and eye-catching, OK?

116
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,700
Are you OK? Alright then

117
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,270
Please hurry

118
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,400
Run! OK?

119
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,740
Make it quick

120
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,310
Damn, I told him I have no time!

121
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,710
Oh boy

122
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,080
What can I do about this?

123
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:46,690
* They are imitating "Waratte Iitomo"

124
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,320
Being introduced by Hisako Manda

125
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
Today's guest is this person, please come in!

126
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,030
Who the hell is it!

127
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,800
It doesn't make any sense!

128
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,270
Do your job, stupid!

129
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,700
I will never ever come again!

130
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,840
Stupid!

131
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,500
Die!
