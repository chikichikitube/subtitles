He's already started

8
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,430
He's not taking this seriously

12
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,010
Yamasaki's thieving nature, we've got a video to explain it

13
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,200
Please, observe

14
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,310
Yamasaki Hosei "Sneaky Thief" Trial

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,310
Incidents of him ignoring rules

16
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,860
This incident occurred when filming "Umezu Kazuo's 500 Questions", aired the other day

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,290
This is so recent

18
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,970
"The winner is ... Endo Shozo!"

19
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,060
I did it!!

20
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,110
That day, Endo gave the most correct answers

21
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:35,740
And his prize ... a caricature drawn by that famous manga artist

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,470
Wow! I'm really jealous

23
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,670
We don't even get to meet Umezu-san

24
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,870
Yes, only the winner was allowed to meet him

25
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:56,500
Everyone else wasn't allowed to see him even after the filming ends

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,130
"Here you go, congratulations!"

27
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,150
Thank you very much!

28
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:05,480
Endo was delighted by this special present just for him

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,430
However when the filming wrapped up, this incident occurred,

30
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,000
Please pay attention to this shocking video

31
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,170
While Endo was getting an autograph, behind him ...

32
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,930
He was loitering about

33
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,430
I'm really really happy about this

34
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,630
Yamasaki ignores the rules

35
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,420
This is amazing right?

36
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,600
Woahhh, that's amazing

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,740
Man this makes me happy

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,830
Thank you very much!
Thank you!

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,900
That's amazing

40
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,750
Even as the staff wrap up, Yamasaki stays there

41
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,750
What the hell are you doing there?

42
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,930
He has nothing to do with this

43
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,370
What the hell?

44
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,230
He said that sweater might look good on him

45
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,930
He won't leave at all

46
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,970
Yamasaki waits for a lapse in the conversation

47
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,370
As soon as the conversation ends,

48
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,270
These shocking words come from Yamasaki's mouth;

49
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,310
Sensei, can I get your autograph?

50
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,940
Can I get your autograph?

51
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,300
Can I get your autograph?

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,720
Not only did he meet Umezu, he even asked for an autograph!

53
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,800
In this moment he stole the winners prize!

54
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,830
How low will this man go?

55
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:36,300
Your honour, is it OK if juror Endo presents his testimony?

56
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,400
Come forward

57
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,570
I'm not sure why the judge is so nervous however

58
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,650
I'm sure everyone here also wanted to meet him,

59
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,270
But we didn't meet him

60
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,520
We couldn't meet him, that was the rule

61
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,300
You weren't allowed to meet him at all

62
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,330
So Yamasaki-san, what was the meaning of that?

63
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,770
Well what it means ...

64
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,130
I'm honestly, a huge fan of him

65
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,430
Well in that case, we could've also asked him for an autograph

66
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,730
But you know,

67
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,730
The first manga I ever read was "Makoto-chan"

68
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,230
I have a different affection for him

69
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,300
But still, you had to follow the rules

70
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,100
Then you should have gotten more answers

71
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,110
That's true

72
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,500
What was that, waiting for the conversation to end,

73
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,050
Waiting there like some advertising agency employee

74
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,850
Hold on a second please,

75
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,430
An autograph at least, it's alright isn't it?

76
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,900
No it isn't!

77
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,770
That is the problem!

78
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,800
Then how come during Ikko and Tanaka's thing, you didn't even approach them?

79
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,770
Well I couljn't joo anything-

80
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,670
"Couljn't joo"?

81
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,070
Hold on, this is,

82
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,400
I just asked for an autograph, and Umezu-san excitedly gave me one.

83
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,040
And he drew a portrait by his own will

84
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,930
We've brought this thing in,

85
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,100
What is it?

86
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,670
This here, look

87
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,500
What's that?

88
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,300
He even got him to draw a portrait

89
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,730
But still, Umezu-san was glad to do it,

90
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,270
He said to me "Actually, I'm the one who's glad"

91
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,570
Did he really say that?

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,300
Umezu-san said he was gwad I went to meet him

93
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,870
"Yamasaki-kun"-

94
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,870
He said he was "gwad"?

95
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,100
Yes, instead he was-

96
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,810
Stop acting like these are your first words

97
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,700
How Yamasaki's steals his new styles

98
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,080
One day, after filming Gaki,

99
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,870
"Hmmm what should I do, I'm lost"

100
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,520
"Hmm? What happened Zaki-san?"

101
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,700
"I'm thinking of what clothes I should wear for my new style,"

102
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,070
'But there's nothing good!"

103
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,070
He wracked his brain for ideas,

104
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,100
But he couldn't find anything that easily

105
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,230
But then, nearby,

106
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,410
"Good Morning!"

107
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,890
Gaki no Tsukai's #1 "Fashionable Boy", Director Takahasi had arrived

108
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,700
Why the hell?

109
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,830
"Zaki-san, what were you talking about?"

110
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,030
AH! THAT'S IT!

111
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,530
Where did you buy this? I see, this style and that style,

112
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,370
What shoes are those?

113
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,030
Yamasaki really liked his style, and asked him about every little detail

114
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,880
But it was a totally different image to Yamasaki's usual look

115
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:43,630
"But Zaki-san, are you sure this kind of look will suit you?"

116
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,160
"It's fine! I'm just checking it out anyways"

117
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,470
And with that, the day ended

118
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,530
And then a week later...

119
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,170
"Good Morning~"

120
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:15,450
Yamasaki showed up in exactly the same style as Takahashi did last week

121
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,030
"Hello, I am the reborn Yamasaki"

122
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:26,370
He stole every bit of Takahashi's style, and bought the exact same clothes

123
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:32,230
It's been said Takahashi threw away those clothes...

124
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,400
Was it really exactly the same?

125
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,830
I have proof here

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,830
Really?

127
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,570
We can see how similiar they looked,

128
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,530
First, this is Director Takahashi

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This here

130
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,530
He does dress like that normally

131
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,570
Yes, we've seen him like this often

132
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,390
Now pay attention here,

133
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,870
Next,

134
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,030
Just 1 week later

135
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,830
No way...

136
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,900
I'm kind of scared now

137
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,470
This here,

138
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,730
This is unacceptable!

139
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,900
You can't do that!

140
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,770
There's a limit to "inspiration"!

141
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,500
It's just the shoes!

142
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,500
Yes

143
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,700
He's wearing the same shoes he always wears

144
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,430
He actually wanted the shoes as well

145
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,030
It's exactly the same!

146
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:21,970
The other thing is, it's not just at Gaki's studio,

147
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,150
So he's wearing this to other shoots

148
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,190
And when he comes to this show, Takahashi is there too

149
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,370
Exactly, like they said in the video,

150
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,470
He hasn't worn those clothes since!

151
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,930
Not since!

152
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,630
Two people on set in the same outfit, that's embarassing isn't it?

153
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,430
And in fact one of them is a celebrity!

154
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,530
Takahashi has no choice but to change

155
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,670
That's really bad of him!

156
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,430
What were you thinking?

157
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,570
What did I do wrong here?

158
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,880
This is wrong of course!

159
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,900
It's creepy isn't it

160
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,370
Incidentally, how long after that did you buy these clothes?

161
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,830
Well the next day, I was in Shinjiku, coincidentally!

162
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,830
Was it really? Was it really coincidental?

163
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,130
No it really was for work, I had to go to Lumine

164
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,170
And also, the fragrance

165
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,830
He thought that Takahashi smelled nice,

166
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,630
He brought his nose up close and said "man, you smell nice"

167
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,630
"You're using some cologne aren't you?"

168
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:28,030
And the defendant bought the same cologne! He went as far as to copy his smell!

169
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:32,470
Unfortunately however, that nice smell was coming the fabric softener!

170
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,300
It was just the laundry smell

171
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,030
I see

172
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,030
Just from washing the clothes?

173
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,680
He just went "Wait, really?"

174
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,560
It wasn't the cologne

175
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,270
It was softener?

176
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,380
It was just the smell of the softener

177
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,960
I see

178
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,420
Like he said before, at least keep it to different studios. At the very least

179
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,180
Why would you wear it here, on purpose?

180
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,360
I,

181
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,910
I like Takahashi

182
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,220
Sorry?

183
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,560
I really respect him, as a person

184
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,290
So you wore those clothes here on purpose?

185
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,160
It wasn't on purpose, I wore those clothes on other days after seeing Takahashi

186
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,580
You know, it's just,

187
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,100
A celebrity, looking up to a staff member...

188
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,570
I've never heard of that

189
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,110
He looks up to a younger staff member

190
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,220
He's sure having fun, look at that face!

191
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,710
But you know, If I like someone,

192
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,820
What the hell have you been saying?

193
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,780
That's not what you're on trial for

194
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,610
Well that's just the reason,

195
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,330
Why did I wear these clothes? It's cause I like Takahashi

196
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,120
As a person right?

197
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,270
I like him as a person

198
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,990
But does Takahashi like Yamasaki?

199
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,510
I've never heard him say it, but I bet he does

200
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,690
I've talked to him a lot

201
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,240
What do you mean?

202
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,020
Like in meetings...

203
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,230
That goes for all of us then

204
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,210
Stealing Ideas from other people

205
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,150
Yamasaki has come up with many gags

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,510
But almost none of them have become popular

207
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,130
These are some of them

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,200
But that bumbling gag maker got a big chance last year

209
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:42,650
Next year is gonna be tough for Yamasaki, so we'll have him perform a new gag for us to close us off

210
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,590
Yamasaki was put on the spot;

211
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:53,960
"Uwahh what should I do? Oh no! I can't keep on like this-"

212
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,890
"Wait! There's that one!"

213
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,740
Yamasaki's brain remembered a famous gag. That gag is ...

214
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,780
"But that doesn't matter! Ah that doesn't matter!"

215
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,930
It was the gag Kojima Yoshio came up with last year

216
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:17,990
In that moment, Yamasaki crossed a line as a comedian

217
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,390
"Doesn't matter, cause it doesn't matter!"

218
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,640
"Doesn't matter, cause it doesn't matter!"

219
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,660
He's copying Kojima Yoshio's gag

220
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,100
He's ripping it off a bit

221
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,380
Copied "But that doesn't matter"

222
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,580
Thank you God!

223
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:38,710
Yamasaki was able to get big laughs from that stolen performance

224
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,950
An act of sneaky thievery indeed!

225
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:47,020
Your honour, we have a witness regarding this matter, can we bring him in?

226
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,360
It makes sense he's in no mood to dance

227
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,600
Yes, that's not what this is about

228
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,310
You watched that video as well

229
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:08,940
Honestly, when that aired the other day,

230
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,620
Do you have something to say as a victim?

231
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,510
I do,

232
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:23,200
Honestly, I thought I could keep that gag going until April at least

233
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,990
I was gonna keep doing that, however,

234
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,490
Cause of that guys "Cause it doesn't matter"

235
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:37,690
So I've come up with a new gag to take its place

236
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,330
Well, we didn't know about that

237
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,740
Could you show us?

238
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,330
Yes, if you do have a new gag

239
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,220
Yeah, Yamasaki can't copy this one. Feel free to do it

240
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,460
IT'S YOUR FAULT!

241
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,640
Kojima, Kojima calm down

242
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,760
I wanted to do it starting fresh,

243
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,570
So what do you think after hearing all that?

244
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,960
Do you have any objections, defendant?

245
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,380
You copied him right?

246
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:22,130
Yes, you accept that right? You have no objections

247
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,720
Why are you poker facing this?

248
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,560
You're gonna start poker facing now?

249
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,250
Oh he's speaking

250
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,050
Can I say one thing?

251
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,900
Well even if it's one thing, explain yourself

252
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,100
I do not believe I copied him, in my opinion

253
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,150
However!

254
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,150
They sure are similar...

255
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,100
We're the ones who think it looks similiar!

256
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,500
If you thought they were similiar then why did you still do it?

257
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,320
Would you do that? If you had a similiar gag you would stop doing it?

258
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,960
Of course I would!

259
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,960
Lies! That is a lie!

260
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,600
How many gags do you think there are in the world?

261
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,550
That's not really the point...

262
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,850
There's always some similar part

263
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,000
So saying things like "stolen" or "copied"-

264
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,750
Are there any other gags that are similiar like that?

265
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:22,760
Of course!

266
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,600
Like?

267
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,600
They're all like that

268
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,850
All of them?

269
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,850
All of them?

270
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,750
I would be glad to hear an example

271
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,500
You know that "Gajong!" one?

272
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,450
So that "Gajong!" gag, and my other gag...

273
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,900
You can't use yours as an example!

274
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,600
You can't say your own!

275
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,000
So then you are copying them

276
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,730
"My other gag" you say?

277
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:50,550
Up until now, Yamasaki has been able to weasle out of the allegations,

278
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,670
However, after this, some definitive proof will be revealed!

279
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,910
In regards to this gag, your honour we have another victim

280
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,050
For this gag?\

281
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,900
Can we introduce him?

282
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,350
Understood. Witness, enter.

283
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,200
Yamasaki finds himself in trouble when that bomb comedian is revealed

284
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:16,300
Regarding this gag, your honour we have another victim. Can we introduce him?

285
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,250
Understood. Witness, enter.

286
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:28,970
As I'm sure you all know, this is a young Yoshimoto comedian named Nagai Yuichiro

287
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,540
What kind of performances does Nagai Yuichiro do?

288
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,050
He appeared on "Enta no Kamisama" as "Axel Hopper"

289
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:53,200
He showcased his ungforgettable rhythym gag,

290
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,050
What claim does he have against Yamasaki?

291
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,750
Well as you saw, I have this "Axel Hopper" performance,

292
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:06,410
After that, they let me do my "Nights Nights" gag

293
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:13,750
This year, 2008, I was thinking of introducing some new material,

294
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,200
That person over there, used that material,

295
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,450
And even though he was doing the "Doesn't matter" gag,

296
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,600
It still resembles my material

297
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,100
Huh? That part is also similiar?

298
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,250
So he took the words from him,

299
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,700
The words of "Doesn't matter"

300
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,100
And from him he stole the movements and the tempo

301
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,300
Surely not,

302
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,600
I don't think Yamasaki is that rotten!

303
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:42,550
Even though you are a victim. I'm sorry, I don't think he's fallen that far

304
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,850
I think that might be going too far

305
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,880
Alright, alright then let's watch the video

306
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,220
Yamasaki's modification of "That doesn't matter"

307
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,490
"Doesn't matter, cause it doesn't matter!"

308
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:03,750
Yamasaki stole this gag from Kojima Yoshio, however,

309
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,550
There is one more act of theft in here

310
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:13,410
This occurred 2 months before the creation of that gag

311
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:18,800
On Yoshimoto's comedy show,

312
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,080
On that day Nagai Yuichiro was performing,

313
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,960
Pay close attention

314
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,400
"This queen's rhythym is no prblem,"

315
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,400
"Cause it's no problem!"

316
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,200
That's no good!

317
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:51,810
The rhythym is exactly the same! Yamasaki stole from both of these comedians

318
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,500
That really hurt!

319
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,050
God that really hurt!

320
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,490
When did you learn Yamasaki stole from you?

321
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:06,150
I run a blog,

322
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:11,750
And people leave comments on there. I saw one of them,

323
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,000
I went "Eh?"

324
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:23,550
"I'm watching Gaki no Tsukai right now, and Yamasaki totally stole your 'No Problem!' gag"

325
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,850
So you learned from that comment

326
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,000
From a viewer

327
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:34,020
Also, I went to this drinking party. I did pretty well in my live show that day

328
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,150
And at the seat beside me, the "Doesn't matter, it doesn't matter"

329
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,160
It became like a drinking chant,

330
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,150
I just thought, well there goes 2008

331
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,470
Well Nagai-kun,

332
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,580
I must apologise to you

333
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,300
He totally stole that from you

334
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,950
You believed in Yamasaki too

335
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,550
I didn't think he was that rotten

336
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,500
Defendant, what do you have to say?

337
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,950
Well, now that I've heard it,

338
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,200
What's with your stoic acting?

339
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,750
So full of himself

340
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,550
So full of himself, very annoying

341
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Excuse me a second,

342
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,240
Did you know about his "Axel Hopper"? Did you not know about it?

343
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,150
Can I be honest here?

344
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,150
No shit

345
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,070
Yeah you idiot

346
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,370
I knew about it

347
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,810
He really just confessed that

348
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,880
So you saw it?

349
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,800
So you were ripping him off during that gag

350
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,490
But, just let me say this please,

351
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,450
Well honestly, I knew

352
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:45,350
And the "Doesn't matter gag", I thought it was great when I saw it

353
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,600
Well, he is complimenting your gag

354
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,450
So I took that gag I liked, the "Doesn't matter"

355
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,250
And using the rhythym I remembered, all I did was combine them!

356
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,500
That's what we're saying!

357
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,100
So you stole it then

358
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,300
Why are you saying I stole it? That's awful!

359
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,080
Honestly that story made me happy!

360
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,700
That "Doesn't matter" gag at the drinking party,

361
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,850
My gag, "that doesn't matter"-

362
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,750
He said "My gag"

363
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,000
That made me really happy!

364
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,450
That's never happened to me before!

365
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,400
Well that's dangerous then, that it become so popular,

366
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,650
It's fine isn't it?! I didn't do anything that bad!

367
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,670
This trial has established he's a thief

368
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,470
No, why is that?

369
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,700
I don't feel that way at all

370
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,480
I never intended to hog all the glory for myself with that gag,

371
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,250
I intended us to do it together!

372
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,180
What a liar

373
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,500
Well, why don't you tell him then

374
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,050
It's actually supposed to be a collab

375
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,620
This is the first time I've met him!

376
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,800
It's the first time we've met

377
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,800
Oh really?

378
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,750
Wait? It's your first time?

379
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,150
Wow, even that is awful

380
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,500
He stole from someone he never met

381
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,650
This year ... this year ...

382
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,550
No, not this year, it really is the first time

383
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,200
He lied again

384
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,950
This is a courtroom

385
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,200
Why did you like like that?

386
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,700
Cause you're all attacking me

387
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,820
What?

388
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,550
I didn't rip him off, I want to collab with him!

389
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,200
I just said I want to collab, I did!

390
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,890
Then do it, show us here

391
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,250
It's gonna be really great

392
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,500
Kojima you too, all 3 of you

393
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,000
Is it alright then?

394
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,730
That's all I'm saying

395
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,350
They're both your victims,

396
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,600
Why are the victims keeping their distance?

397
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,000
Let's see this then

398
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,600
This is amazing what you've pulled off

399
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,540
You should fear god

400
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,250
Do it, do it

401
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,100
Are you ready?

402
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,980
Here we go

403
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,980
Please do

404
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,900
Ready, steady ...

405
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,950
Sorry

406
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,510
We won't broadcast this

407
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,580
Don't mind

408
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:26,460
Next week, more tales of Yamasaki's thieving nature
