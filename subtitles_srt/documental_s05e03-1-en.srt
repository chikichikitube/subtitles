1
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,830
Well, they'll probably come up with some strategies

2
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,610
But Documental is where those strategies will not end up as expected

3
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,430
Did I laugh?

4
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:41,190
I feel like the ability to offense and defense is disproportionate

5
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,560
Funny people are usually easily amused

6
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,560
Remember it, dude

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,760
They'll probably prepare some bullets

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,240
But it's difficult to determine the timing of using those bullets

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,420
Maybe they'll use too much in the beginning, or maybe they'll end without using any

10
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,840
It's not like a machine gun, they won't have infinite bullets

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,790
So the timing is crucial

12
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,720
And also who to shoot

13
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,140
And he said "something gummy just came out of me"

14
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,130
Oh, I got some good cards

15
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,110
Tamuken

16
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,660
Eh? No way, definitely not me

17
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,330
Okay, I'll look at it again, is that fine?

18
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,040
Isn't it just a normal egg

19
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,930
Yeah, it's just a normal egg

20
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,840
Out!

21
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,020
Wait a second, wait second, I didn't even...

22
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,890
Let's start

23
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,530
Shall I do the PPAP dance?

24
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,530
The exaggerated PPAP

25
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,980
Shall I do it?   -Sure

26
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,470
Ready?

27
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,430
I have a pen

28
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,240
I have an apple

29
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,300
AHHH

30
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,900
Apple pen

31
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,270
How do you do the normal one again?

32
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll do the normal one

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,870
I have a pen

34
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,070
I have an urethra

35
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,840
Urethra pen

36
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,700
I have a pen

37
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,980
I have an anal

38
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,460
Anal pen

39
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,220
Urethra pen

40
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,730
Anal pen

41
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,480
Pen-urethra-anal-pen

42
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,410
Pen-urethra-anal-pen

43
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,640
That's not the normal one at all

44
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,830
Don't put your pen in urethra, that's too painful

45
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,010
Really?

46
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,780
I did it wrong?

47
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,320
You were touching your anal when you said urethra

48
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,130
You tried to act cool when saying it

49
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,860
Like "urethra"   -No, I didn't say it like that

50
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,820
That's really unnecessary   -No, wait...

51
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,690
Like "urethra"

52
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,380
That's not what I did at all

53
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,320
He did, right? Kanoh? Show us how he said it

54
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,920
He's like "It's urethra, dude"

55
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,680
I didn't say "dude"

56
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,290
I never say "dude"

57
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,440
Junior...

58
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,660
What are you looking at?

59
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,000
Eh? He's kind of laughing is he?

60
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,380
Show us Perfect Human

61
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,270
*Perfect Human is a song released by the comedy duo Oriental Radio

62
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,270
Perfect Human?

63
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,450
That's enough

64
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,180
Junior is in danger already

65
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,370
Hey, look at him

66
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,920
Na, ka, ta, Nakata, na, ka, ta, Nakata, na, ka, ta, Nakata

67
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,050
I'm a per---

68
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,610
Per---fect human

69
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,970
Na, ka, ta, Nakata

70
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,490
I'm a per---

71
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,940
Per---fect human

72
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,970
Okay, okay, he endured it

73
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:54,830
You can imitate anyone?

74
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,540
Yeah, I can imitate Nishimura from Viking too, without exaggeration

75
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:00,770
*Zakoshi is very good friends with Kotoge and Nishimura from Viking, and he always imitate them on his YouTube channel

76
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,910
Eh? Show us, please

77
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,770
Nishimura from Viking?

78
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,050
Oh, I haven't been here for a long time, I feel so nostalgic

79
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,560
Oh, nothing changed at all, I feel so nostalgic

80
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,190
Kotoge-sensei, it's me, Nishimura

81
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,980
Nothing changed at all

82
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,990
That's it   -It's really well-imitated

83
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,990
You can imitate Kotoge too right?

84
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,930
Yes, I can

85
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,560
Hey, I'm Nishimura, don't you recognize me?

86
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,270
I don't recognize you

87
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,080
I'm Nishimura, don't you recognize me?

88
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,310
I said, I don't recognize you

89
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,020
That's it

90
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,650
You're quite good at imitating right?

91
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,900
Yeah, of course

92
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,650
What about Koume?

93
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,030
Imitation

94
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,680
His another imitation is the best though

95
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,740
Another one?   -Zakoshi is amazing

96
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,760
The one about Fist of the North Star

97
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,840
Oh, the imitation of Fist of the North Star in Famicom, when he enters the cave and leaves

98
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,440
In Famicom

99
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,730
Glad that I don't know about this

100
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,200
You're really into it

101
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,780
Zakoshi is terrible

102
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,920
Huh?

103
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:28,100
I did over 300 outdoor filming in Kansai last year

104
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,500
Many of them are taken in osteopathy clinics

105
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,280
So I became able to tell whether a person could have bunions

106
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,320
Jinnai-san, please   -Oh, me?

107
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,540
Yes   -Sure, please take a look

108
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,120
He knows about bunions?

109
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,720
With bunion, you may have ingrown toenails, and end up walking in a strange form

110
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,990
And you may even run-down

111
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,610
Ah, showing one leg is enough

112
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,110
Even males can have bunions?

113
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,010
Yes, males as well, you can see many of them in hospitals

114
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,160
Can you please put your right leg over here?

115
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,810
What would you be able to tell?

116
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,200
Whether he could have bunions in the future

117
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,330
Jinnai is having a hard time

118
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,730
He scored many points for this

119
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,120
He's just tickling me

120
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,030
No, this is different from tickling

121
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,620
No way, wait a second, that's just the same as tickling

122
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,930
No, it's not, they're different

123
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,450
That's just the same as tickling

124
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,640
Well, but Yamaguchi scored many points for this

125
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,380
That's just the same as tickling though

126
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,410
Well, but still, you need to endure it

127
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:51,620
No way, wait a second please, come on
This is inappropriate, of course one will laugh

128
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,400
He was licking like crazy

129
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,420
Eh? Are you joking?

130
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,890
No way, that's a foul, of course one will laugh

131
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,890
No, please, wait a second bro...   -Because you laughed out loud

132
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,290
Not yet, please, wait a second...   -Let's take a look

133
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,450
This is hard to say...   -He's just tickling me

134
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,990
-Should this be a yellow card though?   -Seriously, anyone will laugh when being tickled

135
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,180
Whether he could have bunions in the future

136
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,860
He's already laughing here

137
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,390
Because he's tickling me

138
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,260
Well, he is not tickling here

139
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,380
He kept licking my feet like crazy   -That's not tickling

140
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,340
He kept licking between my toes

141
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,280
That's strict   -He's in danger

142
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,080
You laughed, indeed

143
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,950
No, that shouldn't be called as laughing...

144
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,950
And I don't like how you cover your face after laughing

145
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,190
No, no...   -I don't like how you try to hide your face after laughing

146
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,250
Well, but Yamaguchi scored many points for that

147
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,650
Thank you very much

148
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,200
Let's start

149
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,340
Tamura-san?   -I had a surgery for ingrown toenails already

150
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,340
-Jinnai, let him check your another leg?
-No, no way, I'm fine, I don't mind having it anyway

151
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:32,210
Takahashi-san, looking at how you stand,
you're probably a potential patient

152
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,530
Just let him check your legs

153
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,810
No way, this is awkward, this needs to be done on two people?

154
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,560
Well, I don't think it's awkward   -Let me check it, just in case

155
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,860
You already know what will happen right? So it must be fine

156
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,830
I didn't know what will happen   -He's right

157
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:56,190
Takahashi-san just let me do a quick check
(Well yeah, you'll probably laugh if you don't know what will happen)

158
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,180
If you're right-handed, then it's better to let me check your right leg

159
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,900
This is just... Are you okay with this?

160
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,980
I really don't like these kind of things...

161
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,790
It's incredible that no one laughed at that

162
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,970
That was a bit close

163
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,820
I think you'll be fine

164
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,930
Do you need to lick that much to check?   -You were licking it like crazy

165
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,800
I thought something is wrong at first

166
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,470
That's amazing

167
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,020
I somehow feel sorry for you

168
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,740
No problem at all

169
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,260
I somehow feel sorry

170
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,770
Yamaguchi is amazing

171
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,280
What happened?   -My shoulder hurts

172
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,080
It hurts?   -Because he was enduring all the time

173
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,570
Yeah, it somehow hurts

174
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,040
Huh?

175
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,200
-You should check his another leg then
-Yeah, people say it's a diagonal line

176
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,890
Let him check your left leg too

177
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,690
Please, just in case

178
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,810
Well, I don't feel like having any problem though

179
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,300
But I'll check it just in case

180
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
He's so kind

181
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,100
How is it?

182
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,310
Doctor, how is it?

183
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,680
Please wait a second

184
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,320
Here comes the last bit

185
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,970
Yamaguchi was incredible

186
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,810
This is inappropriate   -Yeah, it's inappropriate

187
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,710
How did everyone hold back on that one?

188
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:16,280
Instead of checking my legs, I feel like he's trying to make me cum

189
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,950
That scene was amazing

190
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,740
Taking everything into consideration

191
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,710
Doctor, how is it?

192
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,710
Please wait a second

193
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,840
Here comes the last bit

194
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,730
Well, yeah, a yellow card

195
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,370
That was awful

196
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,310
I feel like Jinnai laughed as well   -No, I didn't laugh

197
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,140
No, I didn't laugh, what are you talking about?

198
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,600
It's awkward to give me a red card like this

199
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,290
Let's start

200
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,030
What's that?

201
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,120
Doctor Yamauchi-sama from Kamaitachi

202
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,260
Take that off, dude

203
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,030
Who are you?

204
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:24,040
It's so hot, it's so hot...AHHH

205
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,420
So it's his "so hot" gag

206
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,310
You know that?

207
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,250
Zakoshi is so aggressive

208
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,900
Oh, what's that?   -I'm addicted to instagram

209
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,860
You're taking photos with that?   -No way

210
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,660
You can't upload to IG with thtat

211
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,890
Just use smartphones

212
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,710
This increases the charm

213
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,430
So after using the camera, you take the photo again with smartphone?

214
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,950
Yeah, just take it again

215
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,360
Are your photos instagrammable?

216
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
Yes, they're instagrammable

217
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,830
What kind of photo?   -I take photos of people too

218
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:59,180
Can I take a photo of you then, Tamuken?

219
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,760
Can you make a pose, please?

220
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,660
Is "Cha" fine?   -That's good

221
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,900
Cha

222
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,540
Looking good, are you ready?

223
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,540
Say cheese, okay

224
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,870
Can I take one more?

225
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,430
Can you take one step backward, please?

226
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,570
Say cheese, okay

227
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,390
I actually saw him performing this before

228
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,060
Eh? He performed this?   -So it's a gag

229
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,980
You performed this gag before?   -Yeah, I saw him performing

230
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,080
Did that gag get a laugh?

231
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,750
Yeah, it got a laugh

232
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,320
Sorry, I was looking up when I did "cha"   -No problem

233
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,540
He's so short

234
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,870
Eh? Umemiya-san is so short

235
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,740
Why is he so short?

236
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,130
Probably like 136cm

237
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,620
He's so short

238
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,870
Was he this short?

239
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,780
He's so nimble

240
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,460
And he's putting his hands in his pocket

241
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:15,980
What happened to you Umemiya-san?

242
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,860
He's pissing me off

243
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,800
He's really pissing me off

244
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,680
Junior is quite weak at Zakoshi's performances

245
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,220
He's Satoru Sayama, the original Tiger Mask

246
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,380
The Mask of Tiger

247
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:47,990
When the Tiger passed over there, he was on high alert

248
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,640
Look, he's on high alert

249
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,970
Because he's a human weapon

250
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,340
Well, but apart from that...try to go near Junior-san

251
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,310
Look, he's on really high alert

252
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,250
What are you doing?

253
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,480
He's really rigid

254
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,000
Although he's not talking at all, he's still wearing the mic

255
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,140
Why are you coming here?

256
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,070
He's here now

257
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,140
He's nose breathing   -Leave me alone

258
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,060
He's nose breathing

259
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,400
Leave me alone

260
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,350
Jinnai wants to do something   -No, I'm fine

261
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,360
Sobat, sobat, I want to watch rolling sobat

262
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,300
Ouch, you hit me

263
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,630
Although it doesn't hurt at all

264
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,850
It's so low, your kick is so low

265
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,850
He's nose breathing all the time

266
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,280
He's nose breathing all the time, he's not opening his mouth

267
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,200
Look, he's nose breathing all the time, despite moving a lot

268
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,950
He's deep nose breathing

269
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,290
He's having a rest   -He must be tired

270
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,540
I don't really know about his character   -Me too

271
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,300
Not familiar with Sayama Satoru-san...

272
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,770
What happens if you take off his mask?

273
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,110
Can I take off your mask?

274
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,340
Take off his mask, Kobayashi

275
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,950
Ouch...

276
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,350
He said "ouch"

277
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,170
Takahashi, Takahashi, Takahashi!

278
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,040
Ouch, it hurts...

279
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,220
Lie down here

280
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,050
Is that what Jimmy said earlier   -No, not about that

281
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,020
Eh? What should I do?   -Lie down and face here

282
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,300
Ok, is this fine?

283
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,130
He's still saying "su-su-su" over there

284
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,690
Oh, I see, he's inhaling oxygen

285
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,530
Just relax, although I don't know what will happen too   -Okay

286
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,650
His head is on the Isodine bottle

287
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,010
It doesn't hurt at all?

288
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,940
A little bit...

289
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,110
Are you relaxing enough?   -Yes

290
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,800
Ah, you shouldn't be prepared for it

291
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,860
You shouldn't know when it will come   -Okay, I'll relax

292
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,530
So it hurts because of this right?

293
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,200
Well, but does it hurt at that distance though

294
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,900
Even my nose hurts...my nose hurts...

295
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,170
Na, ka, ta, Nakata, na, ka, ta, Nakata, na, ka, ta, Nakata

296
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:32,900
I'm a Per---fect Human

297
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,160
You were recording it all the time?

298
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:55,100
What happened?

299
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,140
There's an egg   -Eh?

300
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,910
I felt tired and laid my head down, just to find out there's an egg

301
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,220
That's awful

302
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,450
The egg was over there

303
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,920
And it's now here

304
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,900
That's incredible

305
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,930
Is it my fault? My fault?

306
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,720
Wipe it off and deeply reflect on yourself

307
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,540
Eh? It's my fault? My fault?

308
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,550
Let's play Shisho Karuta?

309
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,400
What's that?   -Sounds interesting

310
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,960
Shout out phrases that these comedian masters may say or have said

311
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,480
So the person who put his hand on the card first get to say the phrase

312
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,650
This is Oogiri

313
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,380
Let's try with this card then  -Yeah, sure

314
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,600
I took off my shirt

315
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,600
I can't take it off

316
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,460
No one was inside, so I went in first

317
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,570
Ruiji Yonse, are you free today?

318
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,640
What the heck is that? A shop?

319
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,790
His friend   -The name of his friend?

320
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,790
Ruiji Yonse, are you free today?

321
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,670
Oh, so he's really his friend?   -Yes

322
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,380
Aren't you Ruriko-chan, oh my dear?

323
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,790
That's out

324
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,530
How come?

325
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,030
He doesn't say "oh my dear"

326
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,290
What's this word?   -It's "o"

327
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,600
OH, YES!

328
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,840
Too many cars are parking outside, dude!

329
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,590
I love big cars

330
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,840
Who? Kanoh?

331
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,710
I didn't see that one

332
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,640
That was close   -Sure it was

333
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,070
But then he laughed out first   -That was close

334
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,020
I didn't see that one clearly too

335
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,570
He clearly laughed

336
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,220
Didn't I stopped the laugh like this?   -No, you completely laughed

337
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,930
We can even hear your laughter

338
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,870
Let's watch it again, I didn't see that one too

339
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,490
The color of the card changes, depending on how much he laughed

340
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,180
*Shiroganeze refers to the housewives living in the rich region in Tokyo, Shirogane, who does nothing but shop and dine out

341
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,180
You were laughing like Shiroganeze*

342
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,940
They looked at each other

343
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,090
Well, this one...

344
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,950
Orange!

345
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,020
Wow, that's strict

346
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,260
Good luck everyone   -Thank you

347
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,600
If you're hungry, just call for delivery

348
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,390
I'm starving

349
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,490
Let's eat sushi?

350
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,790
There's sushi here   -Really?

351
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,030
Yeah, it's over here

352
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:43,030
Do you want sushi too?

353
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,100
Yeah, I want sushi

354
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,680
Let's eat with our hands

355
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,180
There's so many sushi shops

356
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,770
Let's continue

357
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,660
There's many sushi shops to choose from

358
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,820
What about this, the 9000 yen set, Mutsuki?

359
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,170
Shall I call them now?   -Yes, please

360
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,700
Mommy...

361
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,700
Mommy...

362
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,080
Mommy, mommy...

363
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,580
Mommy...

364
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:15,400
I loved Funakoshi Eiichiro so much

365
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:35,420
*Kazuyo Matsui is a Japanese actress who divorced her husband Eiichiro Funakoshi, because he cheated on her

366
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,720
I thought I will be with Funakoshi forever

367
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:28,070
However, Funakoshi Eiichiro cheated on me

368
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,570
He chose another woman over me, he cheated on me

369
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,420
He's Matsui-san   -Yeah, Matsui Kazuyo-san

370
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,060
Matsui-san, we need you help   -Yes?

371
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,400
Can you please order sushi for us?   -Sushi right?

372
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,960
He's really calling them

373
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,980
What should I order?   -The Mutsuki set

374
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,140
Hello, I would like to have the Mutsuki set

375
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,060
Yes, two please   -Okay, two

376
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,950
Two 9000 yen sets, am I right?   -Yes, thank you very much

377
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:00,200
What is your address?   -What's the address here?

378
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,330
L1 Studio

379
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,290
L1?   -Yes

380
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,290
Can you please tell me your name?

381
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,020
I'm Mommy...mommy...

382
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,460
Mom?   -Mommy...

383
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,150
You are Mr. Mommy?

384
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,280
Yes, Mommy...mommy...

385
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,570
Okay, I got it   -Mommy, mommy...

386
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:30,770
L1 Studio right? Got it   -Yes, thank you, Mommy...

387
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,480
Okay, thank you very much   -Mommy, mommy...

388
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,960
Zakoshi is terrible

389
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,990
Shall we continue?

390
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,660
Yeah, it's gonna take a while

391
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,670
Starting with "Sa"...   -Sai-shisho helped me a lot

392
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,270
It's really difficult to come up with a phrase for Kanpei-san

393
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:00,900
It's possible for him to say whatever phrase   -Yes, you're right

394
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,910
Please put it upside down

395
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,650
You said something just now right? What did you say?

396
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:20,100
What did you say just now?

397
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
You said something just now right?

398
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,930
What did you say just now?

399
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,940
Samba rhythm

400
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:40,340
Eikoh-chan, say the next phrase straight away   -Immediately?

401
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,340
Okay, got it

402
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:53,190
Don't put your arm around my waist

403
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,420
You even laughed out loud

404
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,860
That was a good one

405
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,770
I was just thinking "what is this all about"?

406
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,470
Oh, you don't know about him?

407
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,830
Yeah, he don't know about this person

408
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,660
That was unexpected

409
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,290
Akiyama   -Yes, I know

410
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,570
Let's take a look

411
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:32,360
Don't put your arm around my waist

412
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,760
It took him so much time

413
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,940
And yet, it's not interesting at all

414
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,780
What color should this be?

415
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,010
He laughed out loud   -Yeah, he laughed out loud

416
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,300
We can clearly hear him laughing

417
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,600
It's so strict this time   -Because you laughed out loud

418
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,690
Many people are just one step away from losing

419
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,060
Let's continue

420
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:19,120
Up till now, Yamauchi is quite amazing for scoring many points, and yet without receiving any cards

421
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,770
And Zakoshi is incredible too

422
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:26,120
Kenkoba is working hard this time too, he haven't received any cards

423
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,060
You guys wanna play a game?

424
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,900
Game?   -What kind of game?

425
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,840
What game?   -Listen to me...

426
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:39,600
This is a game invented by Moriya Biyori, a comedian from Osaka

427
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,220
And it's extremely popular among them now

428
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,880
The game is called Hemonica

429
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:52,430
*Kancho is a prank performed by clasping the hands together in the shape of an imaginary gun and attempting to poke an unsuspecting victim's anus

430
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:52,430
Put the harmonica in your mouth, and your enemy will Kancho you*

431
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,980
And if the harmonica made a sound then you lose

432
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,270
So you can't blow into the harmonica   -Yes, you can't blow

433
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,950
But it's awful to be Kancho-ed

434
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,790
Yes, but even so, you need to endure and not to blow it here

435
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,500
Do you mean the nose?

436
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,020
Not about the nose

437
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,130
No, he's asking are we supposed to breathe with our nose then

438
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:15,200
Of course, or else we'll be dead

439
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,430
Yamaue, can you try it then?   -I'm Yamauchi

440
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,840
Why did you call him Yamaue?   -Two hours have passed and still...

441
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,060
He probably mixed it up with my partner's name, Hamaye   -Oh, I see

442
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,400
Oh, I see

443
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,480
Do you always call people the wrong name, even at home?

444
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,130
*Norika Fujiwara is Jinnai's ex-wife

445
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,130
Maybe you'll call someone Norika by accident?*   -No way, I won't

446
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:46,050
I never said that at home, anyway

447
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,500
Yamauchi, you wanna give it a try?

448
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,870
So I'll get a Kancho? Can I wear my trousers then?   -That's so scary

449
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:57,940
Maybe I'll show you guys how to do it first, I've played this before

450
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,160
I'll show you guys how to endure though this

451
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,580
Be careful though, don't hurt my bones   -Got it

452
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,080
It's here, over here   -Okay

453
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,340
Are you ready?   -Wait a second...

454
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,870
I'll lose if it made a sound   -Yes

455
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:10,570
Are you ready?

456
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,430
I'm gonna kill you!

457
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,700
He surprised me

458
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,750
And then, you shouldn't make any sound right?

459
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,300
That's not how you play the game

460
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,710
Sorry, so I did it wrong

461
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,740
It's ridiculous for him to say "kill me" right?

462
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,140
For the sake of argument, let's say it's fine to kick me

463
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,810
He looked into my eyes and said "kill me", that's ridiculous

464
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:44,890
He probably misunderstood it   -Yeah, it's his first time to play

465
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:47,240
Let him try this again

466
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,110
(These people are so strong in defense)

467
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,830
I'll do it

468
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,970
I'm gonna freaking kill you!

469
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,960
He's saying it for real

470
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,950
He's really thinking about it

471
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:10,070
Did something happened between you two?

472
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,410
Let's play Hemonica properly guys

473
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,220
How do you play Hemonica again?

474
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,670
Put this in your mouth, get a Kancho, and hold your breath

475
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,880
You understand me?

476
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,580
Should I do an exaggerated Harumafuji then?

477
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,730
*Harumafuji Kohei is a Mongolian former professional sumo wrestler

478
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,730
Why the heck?

479
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,470
It's not really exaggerated though

480
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,840
Yeah, it's actually without exaggeration

481
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,140
Harumafuji was actually more exaggerated

482
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,480
(That's hilarious, absolutely hilarious)

483
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,550
I'll do it

484
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,890
Let's play Hemonica properly

485
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:56,660
I'll do it

486
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,420
It's Takahashi and Yamauchi

487
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,130
Who is it?

488
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,970
Both of them laughed

489
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:03,050
Yamauchi laughed for sure

490
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,330
I'm sure that Yamauchi laughed too

491
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,840
Yes, you're right

492
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,680
This is probably a double kill

493
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,250
That one was just awful, Zakoshi

494
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,480
What's wrong with you?   -It really hurts

495
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,840
Just blow it   -It really hurts badly

496
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,840
He attacked him right in his face

497
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,270
But no joke, it really hurts

498
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,620
Let's take a look at Takahashi first

499
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,280
He's still holding on here

500
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,800
Let's watch Yamauchi next

501
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,430
He's laughing already

502
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,430
Well yeah, but after this...

503
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,400
Yeah, so it's a double kill

504
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,620
Takahashi is already...

505
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,820
For Yamauchi, is this your first time?

506
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,180
Yes, it's my first time

507
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:01,040
Sorry, but I have to give you this, even it's your first time

508
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,040
Because you laughed out loud

509
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,760
So strict

510
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,190
I scored many points now right?   -Yeah, sure you did

511
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,200
Someone is knocking the door   -It arrived

512
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,380
Ah, mommy is here

513
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,030
Thank you very much   -Mommy, mommy...

514
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:32,210
Wow, this is amazing   -This looks tasty

515
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,600
Was there anything wrong with our phone call?   -No problem at all

516
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
What is your name?   -I'm Tabuchi

517
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,250
-Tabuchi-san   -So you're not Mommy, huh?

518
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,110
Not at all

519
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,910
What's in your waist pouch?

520
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:48,500
Probably some change right?   -Yes, you're right

521
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,910
Not something dirty, huh?   -Yes, of course

522
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,450
Excuse me...

523
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,340
Wow, this looks so good   -Yeah, it looks delicious

524
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,880
This is really luxurious right?

525
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,260
Shall we play the "Russian Isodine"?   -Eh?

526
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,220
Too dangerous to play with Isodine

527
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,060
You can know which one is Isodine by smell though

528
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,420
Just try to pour some first   -Eh? We're gonna dip in it?

529
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,550
(So basically using it as soy sauce)
As long as the color is the same...   -It's completely the same

530
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:23,360
Can't tell the difference at all   -Let's try it

531
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,900
Eikoh-chan, try this   -Eh?

532
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,910
Give us a Isodine call

533
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,060
Yeah, he can do this

534
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,350
Isodine

535
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,230
Sounds good, you can do this

536
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,980
Let's dig in

537
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,070
I'm gonna start with Toro

538
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,580
The texture is so tender

539
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,900
It looks so tasty   -It's really good

540
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,440
There's a lot of fat on it, so it should be fine   -Yeah, I think he can do this

541
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,440
It looks so good, I'll eat it

542
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,400
The sauce is even on the rice

543
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,240
What happened?

544
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,240
What's wrong?

545
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,640
Scary, scary, scary

546
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,230
Is it that painful?

547
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,430
This is terrible

548
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,910
Eh, something black is coming out of his mouth

549
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:30,230
What the heck is that black thing   -Eh?

550
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,270
It reacted with something   -It turned black, that's so scary

551
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,170
How come it's black?

552
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,340
Eh? Show it to us

553
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,290
Chemical reactions   -It's black

554
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,050
That must be poison   -This is terrifying

555
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,450
How does it taste?   -Delicious

556
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,880
So it's delicious?

557
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,280
How could that be delicious

558
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,380
That color was awful

559
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,410
It's completely black

560
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,720
And somehow purple-ish too

561
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:06,560
-Let's play rock, paper, scissors and the loser will eat this
-Eh, no way, that's impossible, dude

562
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,700
Let's try it with Uni sushi

563
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,250
Every time I breathe, I can taste the isodine and fat

564
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,610
Eh?   -It's reacting?

565
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:18,810
Maybe it's because of the fat then

566
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,810
What about the taste?   -Delicious

567
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,040
So it's delicious...

568
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,040
Someone, please try this

569
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,960
Let's try it with the egg

570
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,750
Egg should be fine right?   -Easy

571
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,750
Easy? Do it then

572
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,830
You said it's easy   -You can do this?

573
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,680
So only the egg

574
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,440
Yeah, it's isodine, dude

575
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,300
Without rice

576
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,560
No,no,no   -Only egg

577
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,420
Aww, it's red   -Ewww

578
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,280
It's already reacting   -Chemical reactions

579
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,790
It's already reacting, come on

580
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,310
Just eat it, dude

581
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,560
(Who said that just now)

582
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,860
No way, no way   -This is terrible

583
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,930
It's black already

584
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,410
This is terrible   -Seriously inappropriate

585
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,000
It's just egg coming out

586
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,550
Something yellow came out

587
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,510
No chemical reactions at all

588
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,640
How does it taste?   -Super delicious

589
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,650
So it's delicious?

590
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,950
We all know you're gonna say that

591
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,590
And you even tried to make a funny face

592
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,260
That's a dull moment

593
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,590
But there wasn't any chemical reactions

594
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,200
Yeah, it didn't went black

595
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,310
Maybe it's because of Eikoh-chan's mouth?

596
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,200
Oh, so because Eikoh-chan is black

597
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,620
It can't be...

598
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,800
He's probably farting ink or something

599
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,210
Eh? Really?   -POO

600
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,310
Did you fart just now?

601
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,190
You farted again?

602
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,080
Yes

603
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:03,090
At this timing?

604
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,020
Yes

605
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,080
So honest

606
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,650
Do you guys know who's jacket is this?

607
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,340
Eh?   -Is this school uniform?

608
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,020
No, it's suits

609
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,680
It's Hatori-sensei right?   -Yes

610
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,370
The Hatori chef

611
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,400
Why do you have it?

612
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,340
Let's see who suits Hatori's jacket

613
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,050
I think it'll suit me   -Yeah, it'll probably suit Kobayashi

614
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,780
It suits muscular people better

615
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,290
So it's probably me

616
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,050
Yeah, it's Kobayashi

617
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,760
Does this look good on me?

618
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,910
It's the Hatori-sensei during new year

619
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,380
Happy new year   -Happy new year

620
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,070
Congratulations

621
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,780
Yamauchi, try this   -Ok

622
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,810
It probably fits Yamauchi too

623
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,060
Sushi tastes so good

624
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,720
What are you drinking?

625
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,240
Soy milk

626
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,690
So many tattoos...   -Are you Hatori-sensei?

627
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:51,170
Yes   -You are Hatori-sensei?

628
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,380
He got so many tattoos...

629
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,220
Sensei, you got some tattoos?

630
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,800
Yes

631
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,240
Eh? Aren't you the teacher of a nutrition school?   -And a chef

632
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,810
Were you gangish when you're young?   -Yes, when I'm young

633
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:10,830
Sensei, what about your back?

634
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,890
Wow, that's amazing

635
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,090
Carp   -Is that a carp?

636
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,510
Because I can cook it   -Oh, I see, carp dishes

637
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,860
But those at the front are irrelevant to cooking

638
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,690
*The Hannya mask is a mask used in Noh theater, representing a jealous female demon

639
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,690
Yeah, it's Hannya*

640
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:28,860
Your tattoos are separated   -Yeah, I got them separately

641
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:33,540
I wonder what's the story behind those tattoos

642
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,660
Each tattoo has a story behind

643
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,640
Eh? What story?

644
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:42,640
I got this one when I knocked down all Osaka chefs

645
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,830
What about the one on your back?

646
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:51,720
When I opened my cooking school   -In commemoration

647
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,250
What about the one on your right chest?

648
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,460
Only for this one on my right chest...

649
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:01,770
I was forced to get this tattoo   -Eh?

650
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,070
Who forced you to get it?

651
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:07,150
Forced by...Kawakoe-kun

652
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:10,210
The french chef Kawakoe-kun?

653
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,470
Eh?   -What happened?

654
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:15,050
You had a dispute with him before right?

655
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,050
Yes, and that's when he forced me to get this tattoo

656
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,340
He forced you?   -That's so scary

657
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,650
He forced you?   -Yes, he definitely forced me

658
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,550
A bunch of french chefs came to me   -Eh?

659
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,920
French chefs are all gangish?

660
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,860
Yeah, French chefs are all gangish

661
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,830
No they're not, dude

662
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,660
You're not cooking anymore now?

663
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,830
I'm not cooking at all now

664
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,830
For about 12 years

665
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,900
Eh? You're not cooking now?

666
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:49,440
This guy is pissing me off

667
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,440
Thank you very much

668
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,640
I didn't eat any

669
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,450
Hey guys

670
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,650
Do you guys shave your pubic hair?   -Eh?

671
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,350
Do you guys shave your pubic hair?

672
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,850
No, nothing to do with it

673
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,220
You guys didn't remove it right?   -Yes

674
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:16,090
That's actually considered as unsanitary from a global perspective

675
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:19,750
Yeah, I've heard about that   -And only Asians don't remove it

676
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,940
Only Japanese don't remove it nowadays

677
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,750
What about you then?

678
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:29,560
I've actually...removed all of it

679
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,760
Since when?   -What the heck?

680
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,980
And you know what? It's so smooth now

681
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:40,550
You removed it with Brazilian Wax right?

682
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:44,520
I saw someone use it before, it was so clean and smooth

683
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,290
It's super clean now

684
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:52,300
Well, I have a bad skin because I removed it recently

685
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:56,890
What will come up if you connect those dots with straight lines?

686
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,380
Oh, these dots?

687
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,280
Lend me your pen

688
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,530
Eh? Are you going to do this for me, Junior-san?

689
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,820
I bet something will come up

690
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:08,290
I actually have metal allergy too

691
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,610
Metal, he said metal allergy

692
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,510
Oh, so because of the belt

693
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,330
Wow, this is awful

694
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,330
Yeah, I have metal allergy

695
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,240
Why did you fart, dude?

696
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,880
Control yourself, please

697
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,500
Incredible

698
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,260
Eh? Did something come up?

699
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,750
Yeah, I can see this coming

700
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,660
Eh? Really?

701
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,440
Not doing it on purpose?

702
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,320
No, not on purpose

703
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,760
You've connected the dots?   -Yeah, and that came up

704
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,470
Is that Sneech? (from Doraemon)

705
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:54,430
So I'm actually Sneech?

706
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:57,800
Simply by connecting the dots...   -Yeah

707
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,800
Maybe the dots on you guys have something too, so...

708
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,720
I've actually cut my pubic hair too

709
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,450
Oh, really?   -Yeah, but not shaved, just cut

710
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,450
I've brought the Brazilian Wax here

711
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:07,630
Mine is quite short already

712
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,780
Eh? How do you do this?   -It must be painful

713
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:13,520
I've already cut my pubic hair   -How come?

714
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,360
Look, look

715
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,520
Yeah, your hair is so short and thin

716
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,180
This can remove your underarms hair too

717
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,600
My pubic hair is short, is it fine?

718
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,150
Yeah, that's perfect, it can't be too long

719
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,070
It looks clean right?

720
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:28,070
I did this myself, so I can do this for you guys too

721
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:29,780
Will it grow again after a while?

722
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,460
No, it won't grow again

723
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,640
Eh? No way

724
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,780
The amount that grows become less   -Eh?

725
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,780
That's so scary   -Yeah, so scary

726
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,780
Wow, amazing   -Never seen something like this before

727
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,430
Seriously, after using this

728
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:47,850
It becomes impressively clean and smooth

729
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:49,730
It will be removed immediately?   -Yes

730
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:52,610
So scary

731
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:57,030
So sticky   -It's quite hard already?

732
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:59,030
Is it fine to be that hard?

733
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,400
Wow, it's so hard   -What should you do after this?

734
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,470
Wow, it's already...

735
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,680
That's just glue!*

736
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:18,790
*"That's glue" has the same pronunciation as Norika, which is the name of Jinnai's ex-wife

737
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,660
Norika?   -No, no, that's not what I meant

738
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,000
I mean it's like glue

739
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,170
This reminds you of her?

740
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,790
No, it's awkward to remember her because of this, dude

741
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,620
Do you need to put on that much?   -What the heck is going on...

742
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,450
What a gentle penis

743
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:28,750
Yeah, he has a smart penis

744
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,240
What was that just now?

745
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,890
I missed that one too

746
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:38,920
What the heck was that?

747
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,040
I was so happy because he said my penis is gentle

748
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,350
You completely laughed, so happily

749
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:51,090
I felt so happy for someone to say my penis is gentle

750
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:55,800
That was a refreshing smile

751
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,160
I was so happy

752
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,760
Is this the first time for Koba?   -Yeah, the first time

753
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,420
That was quite a laugh though   -Yeah, it was

754
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:10,380
It can't be...

755
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,140
Just kidding...   -This scared me

756
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,880
But still orange?   -Yeah, probably orange

757
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,040
It should be, you were laughing naturally

758
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:27,210
But apart from this, Jinnai, you said Norika right?

759
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:30,340
Yeah, that was terrible

760
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:36,800
-I want to give you a card because of that
-No, no, I just meant it looks like glue

761
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,690
That was surprising   -I feel sorry for this

762
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:40,700
That was just...I almost laughed too

763
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,370
Do you need to put on that much?   -What the heck is this...

764
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:47,900
What a gentle penis

765
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,910
What the heck was that?

766
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:55,870
That was a benign smile

767
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:59,420
Yeah, I didn't feel bad at all

768
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:04,180
I even thought he's praising me

769
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,180
Did everyone received an orange card?

770
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,870
Me too   -Me too

771
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:09,120
Mine is just yellow

772
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,770
Yeah, some are just yellow

773
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:13,850
And Zakoshi is zero

774
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:16,040
Received no cards and scored many points

775
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,120
He's so strong   -Yep, zero

776
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,350
Is it fine to take it off now?   -Yeah

777
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,710
Is it dangerous now?  -Quite dangerous

778
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,400
We've waited too long

779
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,920
Let's start

780
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,140
It's dangerous?   -Yeah

781
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,930
Shall we play Hemonica at the same time?   -Yeah, you're right

782
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:42,330
Let's play Hemonica

783
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:44,420
Is it fine?   -It must be painful

784
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,330
Wow, is this really going to be fine?

785
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:49,800
I feel like it's gonna peel off his skin

786
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,340
Is this going to be fine?

787
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,470
Eh? So scary   -Are you ready?

788
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,590
He definitely laughed at that one

789
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:10,440
That looks so freaking painful

790
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,100
That's awful   -Are you okay?

791
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,710
It hurts so freaking bad, what the heck was that?

792
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,410
I bet it must be painful

793
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:19,520
Is that the proper way to do this?   -I don't know too

794
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,240
Tamuken said he knows how to do this   -It hurts so bad

795
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,990
That's awful

796
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:25,970
Eh? What happened?

797
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:28,530
He's the one who did that and he's laughing

798
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:31,040
Yeah, depending on the actual situation, I'll give him a red card

799
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,080
You must be kidding me

800
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:39,950
He already received a yellow card, so let's take a look and decide whether to give him an orange or red card

801
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:43,600
Wait a second, come on, why did I ever start this?

802
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,940
That's not laughing   -You clearly laughed

803
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:53,730
You completely laughed   -You were laughing out loud

804
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:55,630
You definitely laughed at this one

805
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:01,120
*Takuzo Kawatani was a Japanese film actor, most famous for playing villains

806
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:01,120
You even looked like Takuzo Kawatani

807
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,290
Chattering his jaw

808
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:07,750
I was attacked both visually and audibly

809
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:11,820
Why the heck did I even start this?

810
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:15,970
OUT!!

811
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:16,830
You're out!

812
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:26,540
Eh? Seriously?

813
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,480
*Mizuame is a sweetener from Japan which is translated literally to "water candy"

814
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,480
It's like Mizuame now

815
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,920
Someone, please do this again for Koba

816
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,900
Eh? We have no idea how to do this

817
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,360
Just hold this tight and give a strong pull

818
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,910
Koba lie down and do this again   -No please, I'm so scared

819
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:45,540
Yeah, better let him lie down first

820
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,710
Someone need to pull this off for him

821
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,420
I actually have many other things to perform

822
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:54,330
Eh?

823
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:58,800
Eh? You thought I'm done?

824
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,660
How come you invited me?

825
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,460
That was so fast, am I the second person out?

826
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:07,140
Yeah, you're right

827
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:11,680
That was completely a self-destruct, I should have asked others to do it

828
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:20,940
When Kobayashi's penis, who has been so gentle all the time, went crazy like "uueehh"

829
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:23,590
That got me and I just can't hold back

830
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:26,210
I really wanted to stay for a bit longer

831
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,730
Just for a bit longer...
