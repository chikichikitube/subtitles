1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
Risk your life with one mouthful! Fight for the
100,000 yen prize! Kiki Canned coffee!

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,560
Today, everyone's going to try the Kiki Can Coffee.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,470
We've got several kinds of canned coffee lined up
on the table here in front of us.

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,400
Each challenger, out of the 20 kinds we have here...

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,940
while blindfolded, will drink what's given to them.

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,850
After that, take the blindfold off, and drink these
one by one...

7
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:42,150
If it's not the one you tasted before, put it in here.
When you think "This is it!", hold it up and say so.

8
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,020
If you guess right, you get a 100,000 yen prize.

9
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,290
If you get it wrong, there's a penalty waiting for you.

10
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,960
- Still, you do you drink coffee?

11
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,570
- I do.   - Well, you normally don't, right?

12
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,310
- Then, why now? Is it the money?

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,980
- You idiot. I want a prize even if it's 100,000 yen.

14
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,280
- You want some money the wife does know about?
I guess that's good.

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,720
Your bank statements say 1,000,000 yen, and you
keep 10,000 that she doesn't know about.

16
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,500
- Should I go first?   - Really?

17
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,470
- Can I? Okay. I'll go first.

18
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,810
- Then come to the front of the table and put
this blindfold on.

19
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,220
- So, the stakes are 100,000 yen.
- Yep. 100,000 yen.

20
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,490
- Let's pick a can. Which should we take?

21
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,790
- There it is!
- This seems like something Yamazaki would drink.

22
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,390
- Excuse me. Can we get this one?

23
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,030
* Blendy *

24
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,270
After drinking it, it has a silky feeling to it.

25
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,140
I'll try to guess by using that silky taste.

26
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,410
- We get that. Now go ahead and drink it.

27
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,480
- Let's go.
- Let's take off the blindfold.

28
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,120
- I recognized that bitterness. It's this one!

29
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,930
Ah. This one's wrong. The smell is different.

30
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,270
The one I chose. . .    (- Chose?)
is NOT Morinage bottled coffee!

31
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,940
-You didn't choose anything. You just drank something.
- The one I drank!

32
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,240
I'll go with the Pokka.

33
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,080
- Now he's becoming an expert!

34
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,920
- The one I drank is NOT Pokka!

35
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,660
It was NOT Piknik!

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,160
It was NOT Cafe-o!

37
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,800
- You ARE an expert!

38
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,710
- I'll try "Boss"!

39
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,250
The smell! It's the same as the one I drank!

40
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,250
* Blendy *

41
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,590
This is it!

42
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,560
- The one I drank was this Boss Canned coffee!

43
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,740
- Don't make fun of Brazilians!

44
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,050
- That really hurt.

45
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,780
- The one you had was this one. Blendy.

46
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,360
- Why are you holding there? She hit the other side.
- Yeah, but she knocked my jaw over here.

47
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,930
- Next up, Endou, who says he normally drinks coffee.

48
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,930
The drink chosen for him is the same that was
chosen for Yamazaki: Blendy.

49
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,440
- What? Something's wrong?

50
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,180
- The Shou Aikawa of the Comedy world.

51
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,620
- I'll start with this one.

52
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,590
Sangaria's "Kilimanjaro".

53
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,600
- Are you about to sing?!

54
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,610
- The one I drank. . .

55
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,710
is not this Kilimanjaro coffee!

56
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,550
And it's not this diet Kilimanjaro!

57
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,060
This is not sweet at all. It's sugarless.
It's different.

58
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,600
The one I drank was NOT this "Super" by Kirin.

59
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,950
- What's the bowing for?!

60
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,090
- The one I drank was. . .

61
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,300
Nescafe's Montalban coffee!

62
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,270
- You jerk. Don't make fun of coffee!

63
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,980
- The next challenger is the coffee-disliking Hamada.

64
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,720
The flavor chosen is Piknik by Morinaga Dairy.

65
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,690
-You really don't like it, do you?

66
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,090
- He's not enjoying it at all. It's like a batsu game.

67
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,010
- It's REALLY close.

68
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,920
Is this it?!

69
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,470
. . . But the aftertaste is different.

70
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,940
The one I drank is NOT this Morinaga bottled coffee.

71
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,150
- And he went all the way over there too.

72
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,750
- I had the feeling Hamada-san was
about to get slapped.

73
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,140
- This isn't it.

74
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,510
The one I drank is NOT Piknik!

75
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,550
- Don't mock us C-class actors!

76
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,460
- It was that one.
- But it was really closer to that one before.

77
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,560
But damn, that hu~rts!

78
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,900
- Next up, the most knowledgable about coffee,
and definitely confident Tanaka.

79
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,270
- It's going to be hard to fool Tanaka.

80
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,070
Should we switch to curry? (A food Tanaka
doesn't eat very often)

81
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,040
Tanaka's life is riding on Pokka Coffee!

82
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,090
- The one I drank is not Jack coffee.

83
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,330
-He's fast.
-He is.

84
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,430
- The one I drank is not Georgia brand.

85
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,840
- Damn, that was smooth!

86
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,880
- It wasn't Fire either.

87
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,790
- Oh! He stopped!

88
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,190
- He was going so fast and suddenly stopped.

89
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,530
- The one I drank is Coffee Time!

90
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,180
Coffee's bitterness is the same as life's bitterness!

91
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,220
Lastly is the man at noticing differences: Matsumoto!

92
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,590
- When you taste stuff, you have to chew it.

93
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,530
It filters out foreign substances.

94
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,430
Like pebbles.

95
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,030
There's no way they'd be in there.

96
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,940
To be honest, the reason I'm so calm is because I
already know which one it is.

97
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,240
You got a little excited, didn't you?

98
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,980
But if I don't try it. . .

99
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,220
That's completely wrong.

100
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,370
Well, we can juse eliminate this one.
The one I drank is not Cafe Latte!

101
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,480
When I drank the first one, it was a little cold.

102
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,910
That was because the can's metal shared it's
coldness with the coffee!

103
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,590
- Then why did you pick that one first?
(It comes in a plastic cup)

104
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,920
- Nice tsukkomi!

105
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,300
If that one didn't work out, I wouldn't have a clue.

106
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,040
- Well, that was fast.
- You only eliminated one.

107
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,300
- Let's try Boss.

108
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,750
(Is this it?)

109
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,720
(Is this it?)

110
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,600
It's close though.

111
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,010
The one I drank is not Boss coffee!

112
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,750
Let's try Blendy now.

113
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,920
The one I drank is not Blendy!

114
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:01,000
- One after the other, Matsumoto eliminated several
brands and has only 8 cans left.

115
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,570
- No, no. That's water.

116
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,490
- The one I drank is not Georgia's Emerald Mountain!

117
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,730
- Marcia's angry too!
* "Kankan"(angry) being a play on "can" *

118
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,140
- That was painful!
- Don't you always drink this brand?

119
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,650
- And now for the climax: the last challenge!

120
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,650
Tanaka and Matsumoto will cooperate and try
to guess one brand of coffee.

121
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:58,920
They are given the brand that was just before
given to Matsumoto: Georgia's Emerald Mountain Blend.

122
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,670
- No need to even talk about it.
- It's okay if you two differ in opinions.

123
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,270
- Yes, but there's nothing to talk about. It's different.

124
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,080
The one we drank is not Sangaria's Kilimanjaro.

125
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,720
It's not Boss Plus One.

126
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,350
- All of these we've line up here are different.

127
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,830
- After that, their conversion streak continued
and they were left with just six cans.

128
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,680
- I think this is it.

129
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,650
It took a while, but we've finally found it!

130
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,590
- At last!
- This is a bad skit!

131
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,760
- I don't think this is it.

132
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,970
I think it's different.

133
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,070
I think it had a stronger taste to it.

134
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,780
It just feels different in your throat.

135
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
- Which is it then?

136
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,380
- Yes! Let's do this!

137
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,590
- The one we drank is not Montalban!

138
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,830
- You think that one's wrong?
- Yep.

139
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,210
I think this is different.

140
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,840
- This one's definitely different.

141
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,640
- The taste doesn't pack the same punch.

142
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,850
- The bitterness is too harsh.

143
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,260
The one we drank. . .

144
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,960
is NOT Georgia.

145
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,440
- What's wrong with your tongues?!

146
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,670
- Stop doing this segment!
