He's a completely crazy person when it comes to this

00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,100
It's common knowledge

83
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,920

To check the smell

125
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,850
Disgusting worn socks are being put into the air canon

126
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,720

Everyone's the same

171
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,300
Holding it's fine right? Once you press it'll shock.

172
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:58,300
When you squeeze you get shocked. Squeeze whenever you want

173
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,300
Squeeze it.

174
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,160
I've gotta do it myself?

175
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,900
Doing it by myself is worse!

176
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,680
Well, We can't do it.

177
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,640
Go!

178
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,920

191
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,940

00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,780
It's boiling

230

Please don't freak out!

241
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,950
You didn't do a simulation did you?

242
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,940
They did.

243
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,060

00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,780
He took it off so fast...

256
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,560

This is one that'll make you puke

263
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,460
Matsumoto would go well with this Old man thing

264
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,020
You're right

265
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,880
If I get out on this one...

266
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,400
I'm gonna be suspicious of all of you!!

267
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,040
Something is off about this

268
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,040
How about you take a card first

269
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,060
This and... this...

270
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,600
Which one!?

271
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,720
I'm gonna divide them alright?

272
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,710
Why the hell?

273
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,080
You have this

274
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,150
It's fine like this?

275
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,180

You're gonna be put into it.

284
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,480
How does this work?

285
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:27,940
A box with a lid on it is put on the head

286
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,620
Why?

287
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,160
He's got a lot of sweat

288
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,800
This old man again?

289
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,880
The Old man has gathered a lot of sweat from wearing a Sauna Suit

290
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,850
He only took off his jacket

UWAAH! IT STINKS!!

294
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:10,850
Because they have to think about the people around them

295
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:10,850
They can't scream or talk loudly

296
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,220
What the hell are you doing?

297
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,180
Working with you is scary

298
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,440
The smell...

299
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,180
It's still there?

300
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,320
It's not leaving...

301
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,280
Just calm down

302
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,600
Ah! The last one!

303
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,360

The Kanji is scary

313
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,380

This is a new one

323
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,900
A new one!?

00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,820
A new one!!?

325
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,860
I've never seen it before

326
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,380
Don't try new things on people!

327
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,440
Open your mouth

328
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:21,790
The balloon in his mouth will fill up with air and water and explode!

329
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,100
Breathe through your nose

330
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,280
Don't open your mouth

331
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,120
I'm gonna die!

332
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,420
I was right before death!

333
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,320
The top of my mouth closed my nose

334
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,880
I was about to die

335
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,740
After a quick fix one more try

Gaki No Tsukai is gonna kill me

337
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,900
It's fine

338
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,080
It's good here right?

339
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,740
This one is pink

340
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,720
Pink huh?

341
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,620
The pink colour is pretty cute

342
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,560

347
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700

348
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,000
It broke

349
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,200

354
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,680

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,640
This is surprisingly better than the others!

380
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,740
It's embarassing

381
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,880
You weren't even hit hard

382
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,700
It was embarassing because he talked about my hair

383
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,100
It was incredible!

384
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,820
That's embarassing. Stop it

385
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,440
His nipple hair?

386
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,800
It was incredible

387
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:59,240
Current Punishment Count

388
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,440
Just take the next one Endo

389
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,700
Ah. Endo hasn't gotten one!

390
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,820
It's fine!

391
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,860
Just take the next one for us

392
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,780
We're paying you money so do it

393
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,950
Ass
Canon

394
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,140
What is this?

395
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,560
I hate these ones

396
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,640
Enough with the ass stuff

397
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:08,850
Ass Canon

398
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:08,850
Punishment

399
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,780
I hate these ones

400
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,660
It'll be fine if its Endo

401
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,760
Three, Two, One!

402
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,460
ALRIGHT!

403
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,160
m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100

404
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,870
MATSUMOTO

405
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,870
SHHH

406
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,870
Ass Canon

407
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,870
m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100

408
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,760
Enough already!

409
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,480
Spare me please!

410
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,220
I'll pay money!

411
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,800
I'll pay for this to stop!

412
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,640
No way

413
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,080
This is bad!

414
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,340
This is so scary

415
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,860
What is this?

416
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,820
Is this really fine?

417
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,980
Put your feet there

418
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,180
This is fine right?

419
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,900
The angle is the most important!

420
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,880
Match the angle!

421
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,980
Match the angle!?

422
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,720
I don't know anything about the most optimal angle for this!!

423
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,540
Up more!

424
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,420
Up!

425
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,400
Did you not hear me?

426
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:55,770
His ass will be hit by a canon

427
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,400
Here we go

428
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,400
This is scary!

429
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,720
My ass hurts already!

430
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,720
Here we go!

431
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,860
Three, Two, One!

432
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,800
AH! I TORE IT!

433
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,720
It was really pretty

434
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,540
I tore it

435
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,820
Tore it!?

436
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,380
It was really pretty

437
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,380
Apparently he tore his ass

438
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,700
His ass got torn

439
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,160
It was pretty huh?

440
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,480
Really pretty

441
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,500
Take the next one Endo!

442
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,100
I don't want that

443
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,700
Here we go.

444
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,760
Thigh
Bamboo
Sword
Machine

445
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,200
No way!

446
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,800
Thigh Bamboo Sword Machine

447
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,800
Punishment

448
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,920
Let's take and flip it one at a time

449
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,820
Alright, You start.

450
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,420
No, I'm fine. Yamazaki

451
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,200
Alright!

452
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,180
Alright!

453
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,500
Pick one Daigo.

454
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,240
Alright!

455
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,720
This is great!

456
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,540
Hamada's Thighs will

457
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,540
be hit by a bamboo sword machine!

458
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,500
Hamada's thighs will be destroyed by a bamboo sword machine!

459
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,940
Uwah!

460
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,100
Can you lie down here?

461
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,240
Lie down!?

462
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,220
Yeah, right here

463
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,980
It's gonna be quick

464
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,680
He goes on standby after lying on the machine

465
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,400
Lie down!?

466
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,580
He's talking normally!

467
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,620
I've never heard of this one

468
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,040
We've never had to lie down for these!

469
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,880
I haven't heard of this before too

470
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,940
This is no good!

471
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,620
He's talking so loud!

472
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,280
That's good

473
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,500
You're serious?

474
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,660
Here we go!

475
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,320
No! Wait a minute

476
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,680
Three, Two, One, Go!

477
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,920
I still want to use my thighs!

478
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,600
Ah, Thank god thats it

479
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,020
That wasn't - OUCH

480
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,820
Embarassing!

481
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,700
Nice try!

482
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,880
So embarassing!

483
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,480
The lamest thing to see on TV.

484
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,360
Punishment odds level up!!

485
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,320
Now we've increased the skull cards increasing the odds for a punishment!

486
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,000
Enough already!

487
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,940
Lip
Weights
( X2 )

488
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,880
Look!

489
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,880
Why now...

490
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:16,710
Lip Weights ( X 2 )

491
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:16,710
Punishment

492
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,100
There's two skull cards

493
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,500
This will be incredible if I survive it

494
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,500
Start from me?

495
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
You had the last punishment

496
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,780
It'll be perfect if Hamada gets the lip punishment!

497
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,720
It'll be fine if it's all you

498
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,520
And if Endo gets it too...

499
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,520
Come on Endo!

500
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,430
m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100

501
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,260
ENDO

502
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,260
SHHH

503
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,260
Lip Weights

504
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,260
m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100

505
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,820
It'll be nice with Tanaka

506
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,280
Alright! Safe!

507
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:57,750
REMAINING SKULL CARDS  1/3

508
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,760
Today is really incredible!

509
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,750
What are you three going to do?

510
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,260
You pick one Nobu

511
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,700
Pick one, Nobu

512
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,960
Pick one!

513
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,580
The closest to Matsumoto was this one so I'm going with this

514
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,220
Three, Two, One

515
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,520
So close!

516
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,770
The punishment goes to MATSUMOTO or DAIGO!?

517
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,380
It's either Daigo or Matsumoto

518
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,740
Please go ahead Matsumoto.

519
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,900
It's too much for me

520
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,840
So close

521
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,640
This is so scary..

522
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,410
Please pick one Nobu!

523
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,540
Daigo!

524
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,340
Ah! Not Nobu!

525
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,760
You really mixed them up

526
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,700
Daigo!

527
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:39,040
Please pick one, Daigo!

528
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,560
Honestly pick one.

529
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,560
Then this is yours

530
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,360
You flip yours

531
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,740
Endo and Matsumoto's Lip Punishment

532
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,920
It's real.

533
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,580
ENDO AND MATSUMOTO'S JOINT LIP WEIGHT PUNISHMENT!

534
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,650
Matsumoto&Endo  get the lip weights!

535
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,300
They're joined together

536
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:10,850
They place a clip on their lower lip while a laundry basket hangs from it

537
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,080
Give me a second

538
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,500
It's fine if you do it alone!

539
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,620
Ah, I get it now

540
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:19,100
Place heavy items (water bottles) in the basket

541
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,080
You let go of it here

542
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,180
I'm putting the first bottle in!

543
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,180
Here's the first one!

544
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,360
There.

545
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,900
The second one!

546
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,960
It hurts

547
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,820
Enough already

548
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,820
Hamada did it

549
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,340
It'll be good if Endo gets one by himself

550
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,320
Why?

551
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,240
Let's do Endo's..

552
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,540
The last one will be Endo

553
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,200
Bamboo Sword Nipple Strikes

554
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,280
What do you mean?

555
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,420
Let's just check the next one

556
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,480
Let's just check

557
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,470
Face
Compression
Bag
( X 2 )

558
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,120
One that kills

559
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,280
That'll kill you

560
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,040
It's like they want us to die

561
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,580
It's fun and all but you're just trying to kill us at this point

562
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,040
Especially on air

563
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:14,050
Face Compression Bag ( X 2 )

564
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:14,050
Punishment

565
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,260
If we don't do this they'll be pissed

566
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,960
Let's just get this done

567
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,740
Then Endo will have the last...

568
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,920
As a special

569
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,900
As a special?

570
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,000
Sorry but  we're relying on you

571
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,920
You're relying on me?

572
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,480
He's only saying that because he want's to see it

573
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,660
I kind of want to see it

574
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,860
Is it going to be on air?

575
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,100
No it won't.

576
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,480
Honestly

577
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,560
Really?

578
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,600
Is there a point in doing it then?

579
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,100
Who got the last punishment

580
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,260
Then you can pick first

581
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,960
I mean I still don't want to

582
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,580
Enough already

583
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,600

00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,260

592
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,940
Just take the punishment Nobu. You only had one so far

593
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,200
This is tough

594
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,320
Pick one

595
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,420
Flip it

596
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,420

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,160
It ended really well with this

604
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,420
Good luck Nobu.

605
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,500
Oh, They put a balloon in it.

606
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,640
Now I get it

607
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:17,580
A Nylon Bag covers their heads

608
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,600
So that's how it works...

609
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,360
They put that in and it inflates

610
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:23,790
A balloon is put in and inflated

611
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,200
The balloon is in the back

612
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,800
Go ahead!

613
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,800
Stop this!

614
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,800
Stop this already!

615
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,480
It's coming!

00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,840
Dangerous... So dangerous...

We would of died in another 5 seconds

619
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,120
