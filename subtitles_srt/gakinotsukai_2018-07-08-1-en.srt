Gaki no tsukai ya arahende!
Let's rendezvous without using your smartphones: Special!!

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,380
You're disturbing the neighbors if you talk that loud.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,910
I just announced the name of the segment.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,880
You wanted to brag about how loud you are.
"I can be this loud."

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,650
I do this every time.

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,620
"And I can take the control."

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:31,700
The rules are simple.
They go to an imagined location based on the theme presented, and if they can meet up with someone there, they can then move on together.

8
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:37,500
They continue to meet up with more people, and when they are all in the same place, the game is finished.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,740
Let's get this over with!

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,210
I always go to the right place.
I'm right.

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,680
This game can't be finished if I'm in the right place and you guys don't show up.

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,890
The audience will all think that Matsumoto is the only one who is right.

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,590
Not really!

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,260
This guy is terrible!

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,360
- Cocorico is the biggest idiot in the history of Yoshimoto.
- No way!

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,930
You are the biggest idiots in Yoshimoto.

17
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,170
- That has a 100 year history, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,170
Sei Yoshimoto was also saddened by you.

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:16,340
This time, we will challenge this with seven members, including two special guests.

20
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,850
Come on, special guests!

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,120
Hi!

22
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,250
First, Alice Hirose.

23
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,260
Where are you from, Hirose-san?

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,430
I'm from Shizuoka.

25
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,960
No one here is from Tokyo!

26
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,530
- Are you from Shiga?
- Yes.

27
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,630
- It's the prefecture with the brothel district.
- What the hell!!

28
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,740
Why are you being soo perspicacious?

29
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,740
At least tell me it's a prefecture with Biwa Lake.

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,670
- How long are you going to keep talking?
- What the hell!!

31
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,040
Why do I have to be slapped by you?

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,240
It's only been 10 seconds since I appeared!!

33
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,850
- You know this segment, don't you?
- Of course!

34
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,350
This segment is about meeting someone or not.

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,190
I have been in Tokyo for more than 20 years.

36
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,320
That means next year is the last year of R-1 for you.

37
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,820
R-1!?

38
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,930
Are you going to compete in it?

39
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,930
What do I mean to you?

40
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:19,410
And if they meet up with the joker, they have to split up.
The joker moves on to see the same theme as them.

41
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,110
Who is the joker?

42
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,040
This person is the joker.

43
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,910
Is it serious?

44
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,850
Oh, really?

45
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,320
She suddenly hit him.

46
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,520
Why did she hit him?

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,760
She suddenly hit him.

48
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,490
She is hard to get along with.

49
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,630
The joker is Iyo Matsumoto.

50
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,700
Iyo-chan is unpredictable.

51
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,700
You've been in Tokyo for a long time, haven't you, Iyo-san?

52
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,640
I watch this show quite a bit.
Well...I always guess â€¦...pretty well.

53
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,240
What are you talking about?

54
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,410
What is the first theme that will determine their fate?

55
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,810
The first theme is this!

[Big Hospital]

57
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,250
It's in a lot of places.

58
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,820
It's basically big.

59
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,290
It's a matter of what you judge as big.

60
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,530
Iyo-chan, you have to think about it too.

61
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,560
Yeah, I got the general idea.

62
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
So fast!

63
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:29,910
[Subbed by RAIDEN1017]

64
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,610
The first theme is Big Hospital.

65
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,650
The game started at 12:10!

66
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,120
I'm glad it wasn't a segment like Strange Town.
That one is tough.

67
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,020
This is a difficult.

68
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,900
I can think of a lot of ideas.
There are a lot of options for this one.

69
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,240
I've been to a lot of big hospitals.
I went to the hospital right after the Moriman Showdown.

70
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,710
I've been to the hospital right after the Gaki recording.

71
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,150
I rarely go to the hospital.

72
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,490
I cure my illness by sleeping.
So I can't think of anything at all.

73
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,020
Where would you like to go?

74
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,090
What would you do?

75
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,900
There are a few common places, but if I go there, I might find Iyo-chan.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The other day, Hosei sang a song of mine.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,110
- Lip Sync Hit Studio?
- Yes.

78
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,510
He was lovely.

79
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,550
Where is the confident Matsumoto going?

80
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,590
After all...

81
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,990
The closest one from here is Juntendo.

82
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,430
He headed for Juntendo Hospital in Ochanomizu.

83
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,830
That place is famous.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,370
I'll go to Juntendo at the end of my life.

85
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,940
I'll think, "I came here for a recording of Gaki a long time ago."

86
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,550
And I'll die.

87
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,080
And Hosei.

88
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,650
I had already thought of a few ideas.

89
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,660
First, I thought of a few hospitals I've been to.

90
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,400
But the one I thought I should go to the most was the one I've never been to.

91
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,870
In other words, I'm not putting my feelings first, I'm being objective.

92
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,970
What hospital is that?

93
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,070
Keio.

94
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,270
- So you would go to Keio?
- Yes, it can only be Keio.

95
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,680
And Hamada.

96
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:52,850
A while ago, when I caught a cold, I used to go to Kosei Chuo in Ebisu.

97
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,120
I have an image that that place is often used for filming dramas.

98
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,890
That's right.
The entrance there is often used for filming.

99
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,560
Why do they let us use it for filming like that?

100
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,500
Hamada chose Kosei Chuo Hospital, which is often used for filming dramas.

101
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,870
Where would Nishikawa, the guest, choose?

102
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:16,180
There is a hospital where celebrities often go.

103
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,840
Is it a place with good security?

104
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,080
And it's a hospital that is accustomed to dealing with celebrities.
I think they would come to mind.

105
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,580
I see.

106
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,820
Then I think Sanno Hospital.

107
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,250
- Sanno Hospital?
- Yes.

108
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,030
He headed for Sanno Hospital in Akasaka, where many celebrities go.

109
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,930
I don't think I'll ever meet Tana-yan.

110
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,430
The place Tanaka-san goes is always out of place with the other members.

111
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,540
Yeah, I have watch this segment many times.

112
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,040
He is garbage.

113
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,740
And Tanaka.

114
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,710
Toho...

115
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,580
Toho Hospital?

116
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,280
Where is that located?

117
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,850
it's located in Ikejiri.

118
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,250
- It's Ohashi Hospital.
- Ah, Ohashi Hospital?

119
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,290
There is Seiiku Hospital in Kinuta.

120
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,560
Seiiku Hospital?

121
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,600
There is Tokyo Medical University Hospital in the subcenter of Shinjuku.

122
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,900
Tanaka, who is not good at meeting up, had three hospitals in mind.

123
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:23,780
I think they know these three.

124
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,450
And where does Alice Hirose, the actress who cures illness with sleep, head?

125
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,820
I think university-affiliated hospitals are big.

126
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,030
***** University Hospital.

127
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,460
There's one called ***** University Hospital.

128
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,360
Let's go there.

129
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,570
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

130
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,140
Are you okay with a decision like that?

131
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,470
Yes, it's fine.

132
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,070
Let's go there.

133
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,010
I can manage if I apologize later.

134
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:04,180
You can see their destination.
There is a chance to meet up with Endo and Hirose where they are going.
What will happen?

135
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,160
Hosei arrived at the Keio Hospital in Shinanomachi one step ahead of the others.

136
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,590
No one is there now, though.

137
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,130
Well, okay.

138
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,900
Then...

139
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,870
Have you already finished today's class?

140
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,770
Yeah.

141
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,580
- What was your name again?
- You don't know my name?

142
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,750
Remember!

143
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,460
- You appeared in "Don't Laughing."
-  That's right!

144
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,490
What's your name?

145
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,890
Look up my name yourself.

146
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,990
Look, the signal's changed.

147
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,260
What's his name!!?

148
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,730
Stop, I'm embarrassed!

149
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,070
What was Nishikawa doing then?

150
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,540
Thank you.

151
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,810
He was at Sanno Hospital in Akasaka, where famous people go to see him.

152
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,340
First of all, this place is close.

153
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:11,950
Because there is Hamada-san who wants to finish his work so quickly.
He would not go to such a far place.

154
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,190
There is not enough video taken to broadcast the Downtown DX.

155
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,220
They can't afford the video taken to broadcast that show.

156
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,660
At that time, Hamada arrived at Kosei Chuo Hospital in Meguro.

157
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,800
This place is often used for dramas.

158
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:37,440
This hospital is often used for dramas.

159
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,950
This hospital is very generous to dramas.

160
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,320
The other members arrived at their destinations one after another.

161
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,960
I never met someone on the first theme.

162
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,360
I hope someone is there.

163
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,360
And...

164
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,630
Time's up.

165
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,770
Time's up.

166
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,040
Where did they go?

167
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,610
They were located on the call.

168
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,980
Hey, you guys, think about it.
We started in Kojimachi.

169
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,520
And the theme is big hospital.

170
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Consider the distance.

171
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,620
For all intents and purposes, you guys should go to Juntendo Hospital.

172
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,160
Juntendo?

173
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,890
Juntendo Hospital?

174
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,870
I'm at Tokyo University Hospital.

175
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,970
Where is that?

176
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,770
- I'm at Tokyo University Hospital.
- Where is that?

177
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,780
See, Alice went to a place we don't understand.

178
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:48,910
You guys haven't been watching the news lately?

179
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,120
I'm at Nihon University Hospital.

180
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,190
Nihon University Hospital?

181
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,590
If you're in a place like that, you might see former coach Uchida.

182
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,990
Where is Tanaka?

183
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,030
I'm at Tokyo Medical University Hospital in Shinjuku subcenter.

184
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,400
Tokyo Medical University?

185
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,670
Why did you go there?

186
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,640
This place is very famous!

187
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,670
Tanaka, go home now.

188
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,510
This place is very famous!

189
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,340
Iyo-chan didn't come anywhere?

190
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,310
Where did Iyo-chan go?

191
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,050
Where is the hospital where Iyo Matsumoto, the joker, is headed?

192
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,760
Hello again!

193
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,530
Iyo-chan is here!

194
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,070
But I'm alone, so your coming here is pointless!

195
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,270
No one could meet up with someone at the first theme, "Big Hospital".

196
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,870
No one could meet someone.

197
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,610
We are all idiots.

198
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,280
They did not meet someone, so I would not be offended.

199
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,020
You were not accused of anything by them?

200
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,760
They said, "Where is that?"

201
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,160
They changed their minds and the next theme was announced.

202
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,530
"The first place you go when you come to Tokyo."

203
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,940
What's with this vague theme?

204
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,370
Isn't this different for different generations?

205
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,180
There are so many options.

206
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,710
But I think I'll meet someone on this theme.

207
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,880
The most common is Tokyo Tower.

208
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,090
Now it could be Sky Tree or Asakusa.

209
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,360
By the way, where did you go?

210
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,690
I think...

211
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,970
It was Studio Alta.

212
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,010
But they don't broadcast "Waratte Itomo" anymore.

213
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,940
And where did Matsumoto go?

214
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:05,520
The orthodox answer is Shinjuku.

215
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:13,530
Where in Shinjuku, we would say Studio Alta.

216
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,200
It's a bit old.

217
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,000
But I think we can meet.

218
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:32,810
If no one comes to Studio Alta with this theme, the Japanese entertainment industry is dead.

219
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,580
This is difficult.
This is different for each person.

220
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,990
After much deliberation, where did Hamada choose?

221
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,730
Well, let's go to Tokyo Tower because it's so common.

222
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,230
I'm sure someone will come.

223
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,900
Hamada chose Tokyo Tower.

224
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,270
Downtown cannot meet up at Studio Alta.

225
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,780
Where are the other members destinations?

226
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,920
This theme is an opportunity.
People my age can only think of that place.

227
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,490
This is true.

228
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,500
If I came to Tokyo now, I would want to see Shibuya.

229
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:30,200
So when I think of meeting people, it would be at the Shibuya *****.

230
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,010
If I think about it simply, it would be there.

231
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,240
Please head to *****.

232
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,410
Where are the places in Tokyo that you wanted to visit, Hirose-san?

233
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,720
Tokyo Tower, Shibuya and Harajuku.

234
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,490
I wanted to see 109 in Shibuya.

235
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,490
But I don't think they will ever come there.

236
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,130
Hey you, are you from Tokyo?

237
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,440
Yes, I'm.

238
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,980
- You are a city girl.
- But I'm from Itabashi Ward in the countryside.

239
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,480
In the real countryside, there are dead raccoon dogs on the side of the road.

240
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,190
There were often dead raccoons hit by cars on the road.

241
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,220
That's insane.

242
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,390
- Where did that happen?
- That's the story of my hometown.

243
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,600
There were often signs saying "Beware of Bears."

244
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:37,900
The common ones are Omotesando and Takeshita Street in Harajuku.

245
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,940
Oh! I just remembered!

246
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:47,880
When I asked my nephew where he wanted to go when he came to Tokyo, he answered Takeshita Street.

247
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,390
Nishikawa took his nephew's opinion into consideration and chose Takeshita Street in Harajuku.

248
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:04,760
A place of memories and a classic tourist spot.
Will they be able to meet up as their thoughts lead them to each other?

249
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,870
Matsumoto is on the move to Studio Alta in Shinjuku.

250
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:19,180
We came to Tokyo when "Waratteru Baai Desuyo" was on the air.

251
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:26,220
And we stayed at the Star Hotel near Alta for a week.

252
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,930
We didn't have a week's worth of manzai, so I stayed there and made it up as we went.

253
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,130
But Hamada went somewhere to play.

254
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:46,140
We bought instant yakisoba noodles at the hotel.
But we forgot to get chopsticks, so we ate it with a comb.

255
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,080
Nishikawa was heading for Takeshita Street in Harajuku.

256
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,510
When I was in the band, I had no money.

257
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,650
But I had to prepare costumes on my own.

258
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:07,560
I used to go to Takeshita Street clutching 10,000 yen bill and trying to get everything from hats to shoes.

259
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:14,770
When I think about it, Takeshita Street was the first place they went too.

260
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,740
Did you buy the short pants on Takeshita Street, too?

261
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,470
What the hell.
What are you saying?

262
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,110
Those were made by a very fine stylist.

263
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,780
They are very well designed.

264
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,280
You can make funny jokes like that if you want to edit and use only my footage.

265
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,090
But this time you're using footage of seven people.

266
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,990
Do you know how many minutes of my footage will be used?

267
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:44,160
Nishikawa's car came near the Shibuya scramble crossing.

268
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,230
Then...

269
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,600
Tana-yan is here!

270
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,770
There he is!

271
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,310
- Whereis he?
- Next to the green train.

272
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,610
See!

273
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,080
What a surprise, Tanaka was there.

274
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,950
See, there he is!
Tana-yan is there!

275
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,720
He is there!

276
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,390
At that time, Tanaka was...

277
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,630
- There's the ZIP staff right there.
- Really?

278
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,400
Oh!

279
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,340
Hi! How are you today?

280
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,440
He had run into the ZIP staffers.

281
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,410
What are you recording?

282
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,110
It's a street interview.

283
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,050
Somehow I'm embarrassed.

284
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,120
Bye-bye, Tana-yan.

285
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,590
I don't want to go over there.

286
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,130
Nishikawa and Tanaka had a near miss.

287
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:00,610
At that time, Alice Hirose was talking about Downtown in the car.

288
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:07,610
Why do both Downtown wear sunglasses on the back of their heads?

289
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,020
On the back of their heads?

290
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,890
That's for sure.

291
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,120
I laughed because they do the same thing.

292
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,090
- They both did.
- Yes!

293
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,930
I thought they were kinda cute.

294
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,200
Hamada arrived at Tokyo Tower.

295
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,370
Please! Someone come!

296
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,370
If someone doesn't come here, I'm in trouble!

297
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,740
He waited for five minutes, hoping to meet up with someone.

298
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,360
Come on, someone!

299
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,460
At least come on endo.
This is a common place.

300
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,230
Hamada-san!

301
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,540
I know, right?

302
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,170
Thank goodness!

303
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,310
Hamada and Hirose met up with joy at the Tokyo Tower.

304
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,350
Around that time, Matsumoto arrived at Alta in Shinjuku.

305
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:24,320
No crowds at all.

306
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,000
If anyone would be waiting here, it would be someone who is not popular.

307
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,710
I'm relieved.

308
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,780
From a distance, I figured there were no stars here.

309
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,320
Because there were no people here at all.

310
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,620
But there you are.

311
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,490
Is it possible that people don't gather here like this?

312
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,290
I was surprised too.

313
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,900
They don't gather at all.

314
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,770
I was over there thinking, "There will never be any celebrities here."

315
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,700
That's enough!!

316
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,740
How many times are you going to say it?

317
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,910
Do you remember?
I thought Downtown would definitely come here.
Downtown used this studio for Gaki.

318
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,610
Yeah, that's right.

319
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:26,490
After all, Alta is a place of memories for us.

320
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,420
Leaving aside Hosei's unpopularity, they met up at Alta.

321
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,230
He is Tsukitei Hosei.

322
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,570
You wouldn't know what to do if he told you that, would you?

323
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,470
- He is Tsukitei Hosei.
- Hi!

324
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,610
Time's up!

325
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,680
Where are you, Alice-chan?

326
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,490
I'm at Tokyo Tower with Hamada-san.

327
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,020
You are at Tokyo Tower with Hamada?

328
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,430
Yes!

329
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,700
How disgusting!

330
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,170
Where are you, Matsumoto-san?

331
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:20,610
I'm at Alta in Shinjuku as a matter of course!

332
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,740
Alta?

333
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
Thats lame!

334
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,280
Where is Cocorico?

335
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,050
It's Endo.

336
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,120
I'm not at the Tokyo Tower, but at the Sky Tree.

337
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,190
That's too new from my point of view.

338
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,290
Where is Tanaka?

339
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:45,400
I'm at the scramble crossing in Shibuya.

340
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,870
Are you an idiot?

341
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,930
They're choosing places like a youngster.

342
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,800
Tanaka, really you should go home.

343
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,980
Tanaka, this segment is not for you, so go home.

344
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,710
Please don't say that.

345
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,080
Don't say that.

346
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,650
- Hamada, I'm sad.
- Why?

347
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,050
Downtown started at Alta, right?

348
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,020
I thought so too.

349
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,030
You're gonna leave me for a younger woman?

350
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,170
Two pairs could meet up at "the first place you go when you come to Tokyo."

351
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,640
And where did the Joker go?

352
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,440
Everyone! I have a report!

353
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,450
She came to Takeshita Street in Harajuku, where Nishikawa is.

354
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Did you wait for me?

355
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,750
I have been waiting for you.

356
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:48,730
Again, the Joker showed up in a place where there was no excitement at all as a show, where there was only one person.

357
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,000
Two and a half hours have passed since the start.
You can see where they are now.

358
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,440
Aim for many successful meetings.
What's the third theme?

359
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,910
[University]
- Hey...
- This is bad.

360
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,810
There are many of these.

361
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,280
I have passed by these many times today.

362
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,580
Come on!

363
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,420
This is another broad theme!!

364
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,130
I came up with a lot, so the important thing is which one I choose.

365
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,300
3, 2, 1...

366
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,460
- Tokyo
- Aoyama Gakuin

367
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,870
There are more than 150 universities in Tokyo.

368
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,510
Which of them would they choose?

369
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:42,010
Waseda, Keio, Rikkyo, Nihon, Juntendo.

370
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,550
I could only think of Six Universities in Tokyo.

371
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,790
Or Aoyama Gakuin.

372
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:54,130
A year ago, it would have been Aoyama Gakuin, Tokyo, and Keio.

373
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,430
Nihon is not in there anymore.

374
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,830
- Yeah.
- Now that is no longer in there.

375
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,070
If we did this on TVK, it would be a five-hour special.

376
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,100
What is TVK?

377
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,840
TV Kanagawa, of course!

378
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,510
With all the famous universities that everyone knows listed.

379
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,580
Where will the Hamada and Hirose pair choose?

380
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,690
Tokyo, Keio, Waseda, Aoyama Gakuin...

381
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,620
I have never been to any of them.

382
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,030
- I've been in front of Aoyama Gakuin, though.
- Me too.

383
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:34,800
Aoyama Gakuin is along Route 246, so it might make a strong impression on people who use cars.

384
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,700
Hey, don't say that.

385
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,610
Alice said Tokyo University first.

386
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,270
Huh?

387
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,440
Why are you surprised?

388
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,550
I thought maybe the young people's opinion would be better.

389
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,520
So what would you do if no one was there?

390
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,660
I would slap you on both cheeks, of course.

391
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,030
They believed in the young people's sense of Hirose and headed for the Tokyo University.

392
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,170
However, they had a touch of anxiety.

393
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,770
Iyo-chan might come.

394
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,640
She will definitely come.
The place Iyo-chan goes to is not bad.

395
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,680
Takeshita Street was not bad either.

396
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,080
I want Iyo-chan to go home.

397
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:29,820
The meeting rate is 100%.
Iyo Matsumoto, the joker.

398
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:34,160
Komazawa, Tokyo, Keio.

399
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,030
- Aoyama Gakuin is close.
- Yes.

400
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,100
Aoyama Gakuin, the university of my dreams.

401
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:44,440
I want her to go home.
Doesn't she have work after this?

402
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,710
I heard she's okay for the whole day.

403
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,010
Damn!

404
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,180
Will the seven of them be able to avoid the joker and meet up?

405
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,320
Let's rendezvous without using your smartphones: Special!!

406
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:09,160
Two groups could meet up now.
They were all aiming to meet up at the third theme, "University".

407
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,400
The pair of Hamada and Hirose arrived at their destination, the Tokyo University.

408
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,770
Thanks.

409
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,210
My heart is pounding.

410
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,740
It's the Tokyo University that Alice decided to go to.

411
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,540
Please don't say it like that.

412
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,680
Hamada-san!

413
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,950
Hi...who?

414
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,280
I knew it.

415
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,650
They were there.

416
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,790
- I knew it.
- You're nice.

417
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,330
Good.

418
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,930
He probably called out to us because he just found us, but I wish he would have come running when we were waiting over there.

419
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,600
Thanks!

420
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,210
Anyway, Nishikawa met up with the pair of Hamada and Hirose.

421
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:59,040
Since you guys were going to Tokyo Tower, I was sure you would come here.

422
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,280
- Did you come here for us?
- Of course.

423
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,620
The three of them headed for the red gate of the Tokyo University.

424
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:13,860
Now I just hope Iyo-chan doesn't come.

425
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,260
Oh, there's someone here!

426
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,870
Who? Hamada and Alice-chan?

427
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,170
And there's Nishikawa-kun too!

428
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:32,040
Right, this is the only place!

429
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,080
If you guys don't get here, it's over!!

430
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,680
I'm relieved!

431
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,150
You guys are late coming.

432
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:47,260
They successfully met up with Matsumoto and Housei as well.
Now there are five of them at Tokyo University.

433
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:51,460
Thank God!

434
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,130
If we don't meet someone here, it will be the end.

435
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,300
I was saying
"Japan must die" here.

436
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,940
The rest were the troublesome Cocorico.

437
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,840
Will they be able to meet up at Tokyo University?

438
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:18,520
[subbed by RAIDEN1017]

439
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,860
Let's rendezvous without using your smartphones: Special!!

440
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,000
The third theme was "University".

441
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,630
Five of them were able to meet up at the Tokyo University.

442
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,370
The only thing left is the duo of Cocorico.

443
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,380
But they are late.

444
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,680
The usual stuff.

445
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,220
What's going on with Cocorico?

446
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,090
Why are they dragging us down so much?

447
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,690
What kind of ideas do they live with?

448
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,520
What are their jokes like?

449
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,090
Come to think of it, their jokes are not funny at all.

450
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,660
Stop that!

451
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,600
Tana-yan!

452
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,070
Tana-yan!

453
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,640
I know, right?

454
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,380
It's the only place to be!

455
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,280
Then all that's left is Endo!

456
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,350
If he's heading here from Sky Tree, it'll take him a long time.

457
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,890
If you think about it calmly, this is the only place!

458
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,950
- This is the only place, right?
- Yes, it's!

459
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:30,830
Sorry, Tanaka.
Before you came I told them that Cocorico's jokes were not funny at all.

460
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,500
Yes, you owe him an apology.

461
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:34,970
Time's up.

462
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,000
Endo!

463
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,300
Is it serious?

464
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,910
Time's up?

465
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,110
Time's up.

466
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,210
- Endo?
- Yes.

467
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,180
Endo, where are you?

468
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,150
I'm in front of Nihon University.

469
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,190
There you go.
He is at Nihon University.

470
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,460
Why do you like Nihon University so much?

471
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,090
Everyone has joined up except you.

472
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,130
Why are you surprised?

473
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,500
All of you except me?

474
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,100
Tanaka is here too.

475
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,300
Even that Tanaka is here!

476
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,000
Please don't say it that way.

477
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,210
Tanaka who went to Hanayashiki is here too.

478
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,740
I'm here too.

479
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,080
Shozo, do it right next time.

480
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,680
Is this for real?

481
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,320
Sorry, I'm late!

482
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,520
Sorry I'm late.

483
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,860
Is it serious?

484
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,760
- Six of us came here, but Iyo-chan came too.
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...huh? Only one person didn't come.

485
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,260
Is it serious!?

486
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,530
I really want to scream.

487
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,230
Sorry I'm late.

488
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,240
I feel exactly like screaming.

489
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,040
I want to see the red gate.

490
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,680
- I've never seen it.
- You haven't?

491
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,550
- I can't go there unless it's a good time like this.
- Yes.

492
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:03,550
Because of the Joker's coming, the six of them have to split up.
This is a dreadful return to the very beginning.

493
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,990
We're splitting up?

494
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,090
This sucks!

495
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,290
Huh? Where's Endo?

496
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,760
Only Endo didn't come.

497
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,600
I'm about to cry.

498
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,570
Hey, I told you guys first!!

499
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,270
I have an appointment at 3:00 PM.

500
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,470
Don't make appointment!

501
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,780
- But I told you guys that.
- What appointment?

502
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,880
Starting from zero.
What is the fourth theme?

503
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,780
This is it.

504
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,520
"Department Stores"?

505
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,920
This is a difficult one.

506
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,390
My gut feeling is that is Mitsukoshi in Ginza.

507
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,930
But my frequency is not in tune with everyone today.

508
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,970
They started to move on, but could not recover from the shock of the split.

509
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,440
This split up is painful.

510
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,180
This split up is painful.

511
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,050
Come on!

512
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,450
I can't believe this is happening.

513
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,120
Oh crap.

514
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,090
Let's finish while the sky is bright.

515
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,730
This will never end,

516
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,570
unless Iyo-chan gets hit by a motorcycle.

517
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:31,780
This segment won't be finished until everyone joins the others.
They have to decide where they want to go without being able to get back on track.

518
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:41,220
Isetan in Shinjuku.
Seibu in Shibuya.
There are many in Ginza.

519
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,960
There is only one that comes to mind for me.

520
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,530
- Only one?
- Yes.

521
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,490
Where is it?

522
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,900
Isetan in Shinjuku.

523
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:59,600
I think one or two of us might meet up there.

524
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,010
Mitsukoshi.

525
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,340
- Which store?
- In Nihonbashi.

526
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,050
I think old is important.

527
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,050
Yes, Mitsukoshi.

528
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:21,360
Many choices were raised on this theme.
Hosei chose Mitsukoshi in Nihonbashi and Hirose chose Isetan in Shinjuku.

529
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,330
You and Matsumoto-san have similar places in mind.

530
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,630
Yes.

531
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:32,500
Come to think of it, I meet him often.

532
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,410
Also, I guess he and I think alike.

533
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:41,950
- What do you see as the similarities between you and him?
- My wife said me and Matsumoto-san have similar eyes.

534
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,050
- Your face is like his?
- Eyes.

535
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,980
"You have the same eyes as him"

536
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,790
She said I have a keen eye.

537
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,120
What was Hirose doing then?

538
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:57,860
- I wonder if someone could wait for me first.
- I hope so.

539
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,230
It would be great if someone would wait for me first.

540
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,070
She arrived at Isetan in Shinjuku.

541
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,210
I don't want to be alone!

542
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,150
There he is!

543
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,960
Again?

544
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,590
It's the only place to be, right?

545
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,030
You and I see each other a lot.

546
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,170
Yeah!

547
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,340
I'm so relieved!!

548
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,400
Time's up.

549
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,470
Really!?
Tat was fast.

550
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,670
Time's up

551
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,880
Shozo Endo.
Where are you, Endo?

552
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,450
I'm in front of Mitsukoshi in Ginza.

553
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,650
You're not thinking straight.

554
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,490
Why did you go there and not here?

555
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,790
Where is Tanaka?

556
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:06,360
I'm at the Mitsukoshi flagship store in Nihonbashi.

557
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,170
I'm with Tanaka!

558
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,640
And Hosei is there too!

559
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:18,110
Three noble men gathered here!

560
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,550
Nishikawa is at the Takashimaya in Nihonbashi.

561
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:27,190
This building is registered as a heritage site.

562
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,850
I don't need that kind of information.

563
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,560
The atmosphere is getting a little stiff.

564
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:38,860
Iyo Matsumoto, the joker, came to Tokyu in Shibuya.

565
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:49,710
Four hours and twenty minutes had passed since the start.
The key to meet up is held by Nishikawa, who is all alone, and the clunky Endo, who hasn't been able to meet up with someone today.

566
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,140
Those who are alone now, please think about it.

567
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:58,350
That's right.
I'm not good.
I haven't met someone today.

568
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,550
They want to get this finished soon.
What's the fifth theme?

569
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,430
[Golf Practice Range]
- I have no idea.

570
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:12,300
This is the worst.
None of us play golf.

571
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,660
Right.

572
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,170
What did Hamada, who loves golf, do?

573
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,770
I immediately thought of a place.

574
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,970
Jingu Gaien.

575
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,280
Jingu Gaien.
That's near Jingu Stadium.

576
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,580
Hamada chose Jingu Golf Range with overwhelming confidence.

577
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,150
Please think about where Hamada-san is going.
That is the answer.

578
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,520
I think Hamada will avoid places he goes.

579
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,060
- Is that because he is thinking about the future?
- Yes, that's right.

580
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,200
Then I have no idea.

581
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,330
Suppose the driving range he goes to is broadcast on TV.

582
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,240
Then he would not be able to go there with his mistress.

583
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,900
You right.

584
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,770
- Does he go there with his mistress?
- Yes, he does.

585
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,080
He lectures his mistress, "Hold it like this."

586
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,610
So he doesn't go where he usually goes.

587
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:08,550
Endo used to go to a driving range in Kasai.

588
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,220
- No way.
- If you go to Kasai, it's the end of the road.

589
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,660
The cab fare will bankrupt TV station.

590
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:26,240
There are only two places mentioned, Jingu Gaien and Kasai.
This is a big chance for all of them to meet up.

591
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,440
The pair of Hamada and Hirose headed for Jingu Gaien.

592
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,380
Iyo-chan seems to be going to Himonya.

593
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,750
She might say, "I've been here with my husband."

594
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,550
But what if she comes to Jingu Gaien?

595
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,420
If that happens, I want you to slap me on both cheeks.

596
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:54,000
-It's important what Matsumoto-san, Hosei-san, and Tanaka-san think.
- Yes, it will be up to Yama-chan.

597
00:38:55,470 --> 00:39:00,540
He once went to the tennis court at Jingu Gaien.

598
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:08,710
He had been to Jingu Gaien last February when the theme was tennis courts.

599
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:14,590
At that time, he must have seen the adjacent golf range.

600
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,490
He may or may not say that there is a golf range in Jingu Gaien.

601
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:24,660
What were the three of them doing then?

602
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:33,340
Matsumoto-san, why do you think Alice-chan and Hamada-san meet so often?

603
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:41,880
That guy has the power to attract females.

604
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,120
Females don't like that guy, though.

605
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,750
So you mean he chases women's butts?

606
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:53,590
Yes, he has the ability to chase women's butts.

607
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,660
He's like a anglerfish.

608
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:09,040
He's always emitting some kind of chakra, and he's always lighting up young women with it.

609
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:13,240
They were having a lot of fun talking trash about Hamada.

610
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,550
If this keeps up, Alice-chan will be in danger!

611
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,420
She would say to her manager after work today.

612
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,990
"He's too creepy!!"

613
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:25,890
Is he doing something behind our backs?

614
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:34,330
"Why does Hamada keep coming to where I'm!?"

615
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,270
"Me and Hamada are supposed to have totally different ways of thinking!"

616
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,640
Hamada and Hirose arrived at Jingu Golf Club one step ahead of the others.

617
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,250
This is where they should come.

618
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,120
We will have to wait for a while.

619
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,120
If they head here from Ginza or Nihonbashi, it will take another 5 or 10 minutes.

620
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,190
Only if they come here.

621
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,490
"Only if they come here"?

622
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,560
- You just don't know when to shut up.
- Yeah.

623
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,630
They come here.

624
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,830
They come here.

625
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:11,200
It had already been four and a half hours since the start.

626
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:18,410
I can't imagine a situation where seven of us are gathered and Iyo-chan doesn't come.

627
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,510
I never go to the golf range in the first place.

628
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:32,920
If it doesn't work next time, I will quit being a comedian.

629
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:42,400
Their thoughts were mixed.
What will happen?

630
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:49,040
Hamada and Hirose were waiting for their comrades to arrive at the Jingu golf club.

631
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,940
They were there!

632
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,820
- Yeah!
- Thank goodness!!

633
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,480
I only knew this place.

634
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:05,360
And I jog around here, so I knew this place.

635
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,730
- Great.
- I'm  relieved.

636
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,030
Endo definitely needs to come here.

637
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,960
What if he goes to Kasai?

638
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,670
I don't think so.

639
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,740
But he's the guy to go there, though.

640
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,140
Yes!

641
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,080
Nishikawa has met up with them safely, but...

642
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,280
It would be tough if we couldn't meet at this time.

643
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,520
That would be tough.

644
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,550
I hope some more guys will come here.

645
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,260
No one came after Nishikawa.

646
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,730
I don't feel like someone is coming here.

647
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,070
- I was bitten by a mosquito.
- Really?

648
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,840
Are there mosquitoes already?

649
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:58,140
In this season, they would already be there.

650
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,810
- Is it 5 o'clock?
- I have to go home.

651
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,950
If I were Yujiro, I would have left already.

652
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,990
They waited for 10 minutes.

653
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,860
What?

654
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,560
Isn't that them?

655
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,430
Someone is coming this way on foot.

656
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,830
It's Matsumoto, Yama-chan and Tanaka!

657
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,570
Amazing!

658
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,240
Who's that?

659
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,440
Where's Endo?

660
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,570
Endo's not here!

661
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,280
Endo's not here!

662
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,610
But it was good.

663
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:35,950
How did you know about this place?

664
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,750
Hosei-san chose this place.

665
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,990
- He's been here before, apparently on this tennis court.
- That's right!
- It happened just like you said!

666
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,260
I was just talking about that.

667
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,730
Perfect!

668
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:49,860
Only Endo is left.

669
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:53,800
The rest is Tanaka's buddie.

670
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,670
He's the problem today, not you.

671
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,300
Yes, it's hard to meet with endo.

672
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,440
I can't remember what Endo-san was wearing today.

673
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,710
I don't remember that.

674
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:08,050
I can't even remember if he had a single eyelid or double eyelids.

675
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,380
Will Endo really show up?

676
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,620
We have been waiting for him for quite a long time.

677
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,890
There he is!

678
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,900
Now all seven of them have successfully met up at the Jingu golf club.

679
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,840
If the joker is somewhere else, it's clear.

680
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:39,780
So that means!

681
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,980
Hi!

682
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,020
Are you Iyo-chan, the joker?

683
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,520
Yes, I'm.

684
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,020
Where is Iyo-chan now?

685
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,260
I'm at Himonya Swing.

686
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,800
She is in Himonya!!

687
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:05,800
All seven of us are at Jingu Golf Range!

688
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,040
- Thank goodness!
- That was close!

689
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,850
I'm usually at Himonya with Hiromi-san (husband).

690
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,750
I have a member card of Himonya Swing.

691
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,990
I met Sanma-san by chance.

692
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,120
Oh, you met Sanma-san?

693
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,160
Huh?

694
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,330
Oh, Sanma-san!

695
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,360
What are you doing?

696
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,730
Welcome!

697
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,900
It's a miracle!

698
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,440
What the hell is that you're wearing?

699
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,710
I'm playing the joker and they're not good to see me.

700
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,380
So I'm not good?

701
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,280
Sanma-san, you're out!

702
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:51,920
I'm off then.

703
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,190
- You met him at Himonya?
- Apparently, Sanma-san also goes there.

704
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,860
Why do you look so disappointed!?

705
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:03,690
No, no, no.

706
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:06,430
If all of us had gone to Himonya, it would have been great.

707
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,870
Don't say that!

708
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:09,800
