00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,600
Tonight's Gaki No Tsukai: Ikinari Steak Part 2

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,570
Eating by yourself is OK too

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,570
Is that so?

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,980
Right now, I suddenly -
Shit I said suddenly

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:23,990
They must cooperate to finish 200g of steak at each location

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,760
They aim to eat at all 37 stores along the Yamanote line

7
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,660
There's a prize of 100,000 yen if they finish

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,080
But if anyone gives up, the challenge ends

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,420
Whoever gave up must pay for all food eaten thus far

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,920
In the last episode, they made it past the 7th store

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:57,450
Will they be able to finish?!

12
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,140
They arrive at the 8th location, the Kamiyacho store

13
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,280
Here we are

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,120
This way, let's go

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,120
This poster here,

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,120
It's from that game

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:23,680
This store appears in Yakuza 6 (on PS4)

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,180
This store shows up in the city

19
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,140
Sorry for the wait!

20
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,760
Excuse me,

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,420
This is tenderloin

22
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,830
Yay!

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,480
They enjoy the exquisite steak

24
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,900
They've all eaten 280g of steak so far

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,840
They aim to keep eating

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,950
You guys said you like the Tenderloin right?

27
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,500
Man, you keep on eating that corn

28
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,240
You really do like it

29
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,500
The corn lover Endo is in charge of the side dish

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,030
Let's do something with this corn
A corn episode for Endo

31
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,760
A corn episode?

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,760
You do love it

33
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,540
Isn't that nice?

34
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,880
They quickly finish, and head to the next store

35
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,780
I'm so full!

36
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,220
It's alright to say that
It just matters if I keep eating

37
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,360
That's true, just keep eating

38
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,780
Yeah it's alright

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,860
Exactly

40
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,160
I was hoping someone would say they aren't full though

41
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,400
The 9th store,

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,520
They choose the steak for the 9th store

43
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,080
Endo-san, here you go.

44
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,100
Tenderloin, get the tenderlong

45
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,340
You said tenderlong

46
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,340
It's "top rib."

47
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,570
Top Rib steak

48
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,340
Side?

49
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,080
Green beans

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,880
I can't hear you

51
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,510
It's alright actually, no need to shovel corn down Endo

52
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,810
It's not that kind of episode

53
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,940
I like corn, but...

54
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,040
In order to eat as soon as they arrive, the staff order over the phone

55
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,040
How would you rate your fullness?

56
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,030
For real

57
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,370
Around 5
5 or 6, I can still eat

58
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,770
Hosei-san?

59
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,770
I'm not sure honestly,

60
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,610
The burps just won't stop

61
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,610
Then you're at 10!

62
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,280
It really feels like we're at the end

63
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,400
In past eating marathons, Hosei has given up twice

64
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,000
Hosei's perserverence will be necessary to finish

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,700
At the 9th store at Daimon, they enjoy a rare Top Rib

66
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,500
The most delicious part of a rib roast, the top rib is seared

67
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,200
The flavourful fat is now a burden on the 5

68
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,000
I want something from the side menu

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,220
You want to order?

70
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,080
I want something to wash this down

71
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,540
You always order tea right?

72
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,720
Yeah I do

73
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,060
They can order anything from the side menu,

74
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,680
But they must finish what they order

75
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,130
How many ml is it?

76
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,260
I can't see

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,840
350ml

78
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,040
They enjoy the steak here as well

79
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,360
Endo wait Endo hold on- Stop please
Endo Endo Endo!

80
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,180
Look at this, look!

81
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,400
What's wrong?

82
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,240
It's so different!

83
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,550
It's the same amount of meat

84
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,100
Don't compare with him

85
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah I have to eat the green beans

86
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,200
Rare is delicious

87
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,200
Rare!

88
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,080
Is it becoming difficult?

89
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,080
Not really

90
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Hosei you should drink some of this tea

91
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,680
Yeah you can drink it if you want

92
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,740
Nah, I'm gonna finish this

93
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,740
Oh he did it

94
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,740
Hosei-san, congrats

95
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,740
Finished!

96
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,220
Let's head to the 10th store

97
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,260
However, the unfair portions have defintely affected the members

98
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,440
Next Hosei chooses for the 10th store

99
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,000
Tenderloin, please! Shit!

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,700
What is it?

101
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,080
Top rib!

102
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,390
Hosei-san, how should they cook it?

103
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:46,480
Cook it....
I want corn for the side though

104
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,480
Decide on corn first

105
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,670
Making Endo eat all this corn,

106
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:58,520
Trying to get him to give up, is a problem I think

107
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,520
I see, it's not right

108
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,520
I get to serve it, right?

109
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,520
You get to serve it

110
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,520
Hosei-san, please,

111
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,520
Yeah, don't do that

112
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,340
Do you think I tried to purposely give you the fatty parts last time?

113
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,000
I will never forget that

114
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,460
The 10th store, Sanda location

115
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,860
This is the medium steak

116
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,460
Please enjoy this with the corn

117
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,560
Was there always that much corn?

118
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,300
Small pieces

119
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,790
Are you doing it?

120
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,500
My piece is so big!

121
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,000
I can see that massive piece for me

122
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,120
Mine's is big too

123
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,120
Hosei-san, c'mon this is wrong

124
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,310
Now you've started a war!

125
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,730
Yeah

126
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,100
I did it, sorry, I did
I'm only eating this, this time

127
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,440
At least eat the onions

128
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,440
Endo,

129
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,850
From the next store I'll eat a lot
Sorry, but just now,

130
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,350
Are you being serious

131
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,350
I couldn't even walk!

132
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,880
I couldn't walk!!

133
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,690
I promise!

134
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,420
I'll eat SO MUCH at the next store

135
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,200
Of course Endo has not just the steak, but the corn too

136
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,500
How many grams?

137
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,700
It's not the same for sure

138
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,020
Was the string always that tight on you?

139
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,020
It wasn't like that before

140
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,280
He's like the Michelin man

141
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,280
Finished!

142
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,860
Brilliant

143
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:04,270
The atmosphere is dampened by the weight of their stomachs

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,140
They shall have Tenderloin at the 11th store

145
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,210
Side?

146
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,820
Corn

147
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,290
He's a demon

148
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,590
Demons actually exist after all

149
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,100
Hosei promised to eat a lot at this store

150
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,300
The biggest hurdle awaits them

151
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,660
Ikinari Steak marathon: The 11th store, in Gotanda

152
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,660
Yama-chan, go ahead

153
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,060
You gotta catch up with us

154
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,250
Eat a lot, quickly

155
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,320
It'll be impressive to see what you can do

156
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,220
You gotta do this

157
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,460
Hold on that's not-

158
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,570
It really is like that

159
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,050
You 4 will split that?

160
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,930
Eh? Are you serious?

161
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,060
Thank you!

162
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,060
The 4 eat a literal bite

163
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,500
Hosei must finish most of the steak

164
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,400
A tenderloin at this point is great

165
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,060
You gotta show the people watching TV your eating skills

166
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,000
This is important

167
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,900
Honestly, the people watching this are thinking: "Ah, this is the ending"

168
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,940
Exactly

169
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,260
Right?

170
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,200
I see

171
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,200
They don't believe me

172
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,400
I'm gonna betray them

173
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,400
Yeah show em!

174
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Oh I forgot about the corn, my bad

175
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,720
THAT'S HOT!!!

176
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,090
What an intricate performance

177
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,700
He was sticking his face forward

178
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,140
I'm gonna take care of this

179
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,100
This really makes Endo look impressive

180
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,360
Exactly, you gotta show off too

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,500
He went for it

182
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,980
There it is, the Double Corn!

183
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,100
Hosei shows never before seen perseverance

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,490
Endo challenges him with Double Corn

185
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,910
Endo is amazing

186
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,660
Just the tenderloin now

187
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,510
Today's Yamasaki is different

188
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,460
This is the time to persevere

189
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,300
Let's get past this, this is the first obstacle

190
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,960
I can tell his senses have sharpened

191
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,840
The focus is off the charts

192
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,560
He's crying while eating
Like a little kid

193
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,740
That's what babies do, yeah

194
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,900
He did it!

195
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,480
He kept his word

196
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,260
He's a man of his word

197
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,640
Unexpectdly! Hosei surpasses everyone, and is at 520g

198
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,500
You finished cause it was tenderloin?

199
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,760
If it was sirloin it would be impossible?

200
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,900
Yeah. Rib would've been impossible too

201
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,660
Time to choose the next steak

202
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,480
Top Rib!

203
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,510
Ah, top rib?

204
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,820
What about the side?

205
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,260
Can you?

206
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,270
stop

207
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,090
"Can you?" - Of course he can't!

208
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,800
Why would he say he can

209
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,140
Are you feeling really full?

210
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,080
Matsumoto-san, are you feeling tired?

211
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,580
Who?

212
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,580
Matsumoto-san

213
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,580
Not at all. Does it look like I'm tired?

214
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,800
It totally does

215
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,660
His stomach's been making noises the whole time

216
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,580
It seems like I'm tired?

217
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,440
You've got your face stuck to that seat

218
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,370
Tanaka-san, is your stomach fine?

219
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,430
Tanaka-san, is your stomach fine?

220
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,860
Yeah, I'm fine

221
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,080
Right before leaving,

222
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,400
They were waiting for Tanaka to get back from the bathroom

223
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,140
What was that?

224
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,470
I was feeling a little sick in the car

225
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,310
Car sickness

226
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:07,990
Car sickness?

227
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,280
Why the hell do you work here then

228
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You feel better getting off?

229
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah I feel better after I get off

230
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,300
What about now?

231
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,550
I'm feeling really sick right now

232
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,990
Cause we're driving?

233
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,160
Please don't give up cause of that

234
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,730
That pathetic reason

235
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,560
So on the No Laughing Bus?

236
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,660
Sick, I'm very sick

237
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,440
So you've kept quiet about it all these years?

238
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:37,140
I thought I would ruin the mood on set

239
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,400
So nice!

240
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,000
What a nice guy

241
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:45,800
The 12th store, Meguro Kamiosaki location

242
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,800
We've arrived
Let's go

243
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,280
Are you ok, Hosei-san?

244
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,000
Are you alright Hosei-san?

245
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,400
That was no good, Hosei-san!

246
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,300
Can't walk

247
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,300
Car sick

248
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,300
Corn

249
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,300
Drunk

250
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,300
Full stomach

251
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,300
It seems everyone has an obstacle in this challenge

252
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,200
They enjoy the Top Rib steak, which is exceptionally fatty

253
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:22,000
Thanks for waiting,

254
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,590
Where's the green beans on top?

255
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,590
Green beans coming up!

256
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,000
No no no no! That's ok!

257
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,000
No thanks!  We're ok!

258
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,800
Store person!

259
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,000
Even though you asked not to

260
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,910
We genuinely didn't do this

261
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,920
We wouldn't do this

262
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,110
They made a mistake, for real

263
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,100
They made a mistake?

264
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:53,820
You have to make sure to tell them, or you'll get corn

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,620
The base is corn?

266
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,850
Corn is the base

267
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,400
I totally asked for green beans though

268
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,580
Hosei-san finished

269
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,610
Just the corn left

270
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,850
Endo is actually so slow with that Corn

271
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,680
He did it
Finished!

272
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,520
Next, with heavy steps, they enter the Ebisu store

273
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,800
Here they enjoy a medium tenderloin

274
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Sorry for the wait
A 200g tenderloin, medium

275
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Where's the green beans?

276
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,000
Ah well, what can you do

277
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I truly want some green beans!

278
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,970
Just take it already

279
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
They side is once again the standard corn

280
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,360
Now I actually don't like tenderloin

281
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,420
They struggle to swallow the steak

282
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,640
I want more!!

283
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,360
Finished!

284
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,800
The excitement from the start has disappeared
These 5 are different people than they were

285
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,360
And then

286
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,420
It sucks being the last person

287
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,720
Jus one bite

288
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,000
He's done

289
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,840
Just Endo's corn

290
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,170
It's just this footage over and over again

291
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,480
Is there any scene of me eating meat?

292
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,250
Finished!

293
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,700
Let's head to the next store

294
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,340
Let's go

295
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,660
C'mon let's go

296
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,740
I'm feeling it

297
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,360
5 hours since the start

298
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,540
They've all eaten over 500g

299
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,460
They've long since lost the will to speak

300
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,900
14th store; Shibuya's Sakuragoka location
They enjoy a well done tenderloin

301
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,500
The side is of course CORN!

302
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,720
I'm gonna die at this rate

303
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,840
Making me eat this much corn for 37 stores

304
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,300
The 5 split the steak, aiming to finish

305
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,300
Would you be able to eat, if it was you?

306
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,300
He got mad at us

307
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,300
Can I have the onions?

308
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,840
The onions are pretty good acutally

309
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,480
Well done is a lot

310
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,480
It's well done, right

311
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,480
(complaining about well done)

312
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,790
It just won't go in

313
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,000
Oh, amazing, Endo-san!

314
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,340
Is there footage of me eating meat?

315
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,780
Not at this store

316
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:06,080
But there's plenty of footage of you asking "Is there footage of me eating meat?"

317
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,620
Brilliant

318
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,880
What is it?

319
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,880
This would be a good time to finish

320
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,310
DownTown are at the same amount

321
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,800
They were classmates after all

322
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,080
I think this steak wasn't that bad actually this time

323
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The vibe changed a bit

324
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,000
The vibe changed

325
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,000
This is a good time to finish

326
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,860
There's a lot huh?

327
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,560
That's what everyone is thinking looking at your plate

328
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,140
3 minutes have passed since he touched his food

329
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,160
Is there a time limit?

330
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,320
A time limit for each store

331
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,520
No, there isn't

332
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,470
10 minutes could pass by like this

333
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:33,010
From my POV, that's just a straight up cow!

334
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
A total cow

335
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,660
So, how about 1 more minute?

336
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,620
Is 1 minute alright?

337
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,620
Okay, start!

338
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,770
If he can't do it, we'll take that as a give up

339
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,120
The cow is back

340
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,260
Just a cow

341
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,320
A battle to finish the challenge

342
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,900
Hamada's fork has totally stopped

343
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,340
We're done here

344
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,280
No good!

345
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,620
That was close!

346
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,900
We didn't make it to 37 stores

347
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,300
This one mouthful is impossible

348
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,300
You couldn't get that last bite?

349
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:53,480
Hamada has to pay the 27,416 yen cost from his own pocket

350
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,420
The total is amazing
That's a lot of meat

351
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,820
That's not the point of this challenge!
