1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,130
A town the 5 have never been to, Sakura in Chiba Prefecture, around Shizu Station

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,730
What are the Best 5 things the locals recommend?

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,630
First, number 5

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,000
A curry store

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:20,130
A popular curry shop in front of Shizu station, Sathi

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,340
Chicken and Shrimp curry, a delicious dish you must try at least once

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,670
It's delicious

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,730
Yeah, it's not too spicy either huh?

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,000
The flavour spreads in your mouth

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,730
This one might be better

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,130
See!

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,100
Next a suggestion from a young mother, South Yukarigaoka Park

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,920
They got excited after seeing the lion and giraffe statues

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,830
Furthermore,

15
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,430
Aqua

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,200
What is Aqua?

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,200
An elementary student's #3,

18
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,600
Aqua, a facility with a pool and a bath

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,770
Will Aqua be able to take the #3 spot?

20
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,770
And will they be able to get all 5?

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:11,370
Subbed by senor_wristband

Patreon: patreon.com/senor_wristband
Kofi: ko-fi.com/buresurettosan

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,630
The 5 leave South Yukarigaoka Park, and head towards the elementary student's suggestion, Aqua

24
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:25,930
It's totally possible, for example DownTown-san to be the first celebrities these people have seen in real life

25
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,400
Or us, the Gaki cast

26
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,100
That's pretty amazing I think, meeting the Gaki cast,

27
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,500
Tanaka who was the first celebrity you met?

28
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,900
Inagawa Junji-san

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,470
Same, same

30
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,830
We saw him together

31
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,700
That's amazing

32
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,800
We met him on a location shoot

33
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,800
Was it something like Kaidan? (one his movies)

34
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,650
It was when he got struck,

35
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,000
Ah back then?

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,330
I wonder who it was for me

37
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,700
Who was it?

38
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,230
I think, I didn't run into someone in town,

39
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:58,830
But honestly, probably at Umeda Theatre I think

40
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,970
The car arrives at Aqua

41
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,470
What kind of facility will Aqua turn out to be?

42
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,000
This is it right? Aqua

43
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,210
Indeed

44
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:16,530
Well we found Aqua, but we don't know if we can bring the cameras inside

45
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,760
Go inside and check

46
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,070
As there are a lot of guests inside day, bringing the cameras inside would be a bother,

47
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,000
Cocorico went inside by themselves to check things out

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Then I guess we have to ask around if there's anything nearby

49
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,770
But this place looks like it could be #1

50
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,740
I think surpassing this will be difficult

51
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,650
Certainly

52
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,300
How'd it go?

53
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,730
The bowling alley had 30 lanes,

54
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,700
30 lanes?!

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It was huge

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,420
There were billiards, a game centre,

57
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,900
And the first floor was a bathhouse

58
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,970
It's a massive leisure centre right?

59
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,670
Yes

60
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,670
It's a place kids would enjoy

61
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:12,010
This place, Aqua Yukari, has 30 different types of bathhouse, and an indoor pool. A very varied facility.

62
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,100
Furthermore, there are 30 bowling lanes, and a game corner

63
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,670
A popular leisure centre, that young kids and old people can enjoy

64
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:28,290
Aqua was selected as Shizu Station's #3 recommendation

65
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,070
Next, to find #2, they ask around in front of Aqua

66
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,770
Let's ask that lady

67
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,400
Ah, excuse me Ma'am

68
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,570
Could you help us out?

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,970
Hello!

70
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,370
We're looking for things near Shizu station,

71
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,370
We're asking people for recommendations,

72
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,630
We've asked a bunch of people,

73
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:59,660
What is this lady's recommendation for #2?

74
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,830
You can also recommend an old man you fancy for #2 if you'd like. We'll go meet him.

75
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,930
Your house could also be #2. We'll head there too.

76
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,170
Maybe a new building that was built recently, a nice place you'd recommend

77
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,170
Ma'am, where do you go usually?

78
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,170
The bank, or the post office

79
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,550
Of course, that makes sense

80
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,400
I don't really know

81
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,170
That's alright Ma'am, thank you very much

82
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,970
Thank you!

83
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,630
I think we've reached the limit

84
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,190
I guess it would be this place

85
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,190
In the end, there's no #1 or #2

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,130
We can't decide that yet

87
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,870
Let's try asking some young people

88
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,870
Oh yes

89
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,970
Excuse me young man

90
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,170
Young man, do you have a moment?

91
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,010
Could we talk for a moment?

92
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,010
I'm not good with TV...

93
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,310
You can't?

94
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,910
What about that middle-aged person?

95
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,710
Shall we?

96
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,640
Let's go

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,020
Excuse me

98
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,020
Could we talk to you a moment?

99
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,640
Are you a local?

100
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,930
We are locals,

101
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,730
We've come to this area for the first time,

102
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,900
We were thinking of going to Shizu station's Best 5,

103
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,900
A place you recommend more than these

104
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,800
A place for #2

105
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,490
Is a restaurant alright?

106
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,290
Anything is good

107
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:25,020
A local couple, what is their recommendation for #2?

108
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,930
Was it called Yoen? That place

109
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,040
Ah, Yoen is a good place

110
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,610
Yoen?

111
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,530
On the other side of the station, it's a Chinese restaurant

112
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,130
It's very delicious

113
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,910
Yoen?

114
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,130
Ma'am, do you have a recommendation for there?

115
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,620
I like their Black Vinegar Sweet & Sour Pork

116
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,470
Black Vinegar Sweet & Sour Pork? Sounds great

117
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,710
We all like Black Vinegar Sweet & Sour Pork

118
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,580
And sir, your recommendation?

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
Cantonese Noodles

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,290
Cantonese Noodles?

121
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,020
The Gyoza is good too

122
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,330
The Gyoza is good too?

123
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,510
We got lucky here then

124
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,510
The Gyoza without Soy Sauce

125
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,870
Gyoza without Soy Sauce

126
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,890
Without Soy Sauce?

127
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,820
No sauce

128
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,040
You eat it without Soy Sauce?

129
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,690
No sauce

130
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,110
Gyoza sounds good

131
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,600
It's good eaten plain

132
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,290
By itself?

133
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,130
Thank you very much!

134
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,040
Thank you

135
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,470
Thank you for #2

136
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,240
I think a food place is great at this point

137
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,440
I think so too

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,930
However, now I think finding #1...

139
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,530
It's gonna be pretty hard

140
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,110
Indeed

141
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:24,130
Not exactly a park, but maybe a place with a good view

142
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,580
Something like that

143
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,870
I see

144
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,020
Perhaps a place to see the sun set

145
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,110
Exactly, exactly

146
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,640
I see

147
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,870
With haste, they head to the recommended Chinese restaurant Yoen

148
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,000
Alright, now Endo...

149
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,360
Was it called Yuen?

150
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,840
You don't remember the name?

151
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,090
I do, Yuen

152
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,400
Wasn't it Yoen?

153
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,110
No it was Yuen

154
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,700
Oi Endo!

155
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,700
Sorry

156
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:02,340
Endo meant to use the blinkers, but put the wipers on instead

157
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,090
He drives a foreign car, he's used to left-hand drive

158
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,840
Right?

159
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,690
He's trying to say "I drive a foreign car"

160
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,690
He's trying to show off

161
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,620
He put the wipers on after all

162
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,350
What do you mean?

163
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,930
The stalks are reversed on a foreign car

164
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,040
He put the wipers on

165
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,400
"I drive a foreign car" he wants to say

166
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,690
No not at all

167
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,930
"Tanaka, I drive one"

168
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,400
Tanaka has one too

169
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,820
I drive an import too

170
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,930
The used Volvo

171
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,620
TN: Tanaka drives a Volvo 240 wagon (Introduced in 1974)

172
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
The used Volvo

173
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,030
Eh?! You still drive that?

174
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,620
It's almost 40 years old

175
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,910
You're kidding, Tanaka!

176
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,160
Wait, seriously, why?

177
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,220
You're still driving that Volvo?

178
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,250
Hold on, what's wrong with that?

179
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:47,600
I'm sorry for this cliche question, but a Volvo?!

180
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,290
No no, it's in great condition

181
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,310
What do you like about it?

182
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,330
I like the shape,

183
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,820
That boxy shape

184
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,260
There's so many other boxy cars out there

185
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,360
I don't understand what's so shocking about it

186
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,110
No no no, I think you should make a lifestyle upgrade

187
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,040
You probably can't replace the engine

188
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,360
Yes, I think it's probably impossible

189
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:12,240
While they were making fun of Tanaka, they arrive at the Chinese restaurant

190
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,130
Will this store get the #2 spot?

191
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,130
It's the first time I've seen this character

192
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,560
I can't read this

193
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,870
They're not open yet

194
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,580
Ahh I see

195
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,980
They're closed, they open at 5:30

196
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,890
They start at 5:30

197
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,560
Unfortunately it was out of their business hours, they couldn't enter the store

198
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,220
Starting again, they start asking for #2

199
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,290
Ma'am, could you tell us a recommendation near here?

200
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,640
A recommendation near here

201
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,820
What will this lady that has lived here for quite a long time recommend?

202
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,690
I've been here for 15 years

203
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,420
I live there

204
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,310
That's quite a while

205
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,400
Oh my!

206
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,560
Matsumoto-san!

207
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,570
Oh yes hello

208
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,160
Can we go to your house?

209
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,710
What the hell are you saying!

210
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,220
So angry all of a sudden

211
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,470
That's so sudden

212
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,270
She got angry so quickly

213
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,640
I thought your house could be #2

214
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,180
I don't really know any places to recommend

215
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,930
Oh you don't?

216
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,600
Thank you very much!

217
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,420
I guess it can't be helped if there really is nothing

218
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,730
That's true, for real this time there's nothing

219
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,400
Normally people wouldn't have to think so hard about it

220
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,130
There's nothing here then

221
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,620
Hello!

222
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,870
Excuse us

223
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,930
Right now, we're looking for recommendations near the Shizu area

224
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,760
We've been here, these places from #5 to #3,

225
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,360
Do you have a place in mind for #2?

226
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:57,180
What will this local young man suggest?

227
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,020
Izakaya Hamasen (Izakaya is like a pub)

228
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,640
An Izakaya?

229
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,780
Are they open right now?

230
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,310
Right now? I think probably starting at 5

231
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,000
I see, I see that makes sense

232
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,670
Any other places?

233
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,040
I would've said Izakaya Hamasen

234
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,530
Hamasen and Hamasen?

235
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,310
A location of some sort, some place we should check out

236
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,890
Joza Park

237
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,040
Joza Park?

238
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,270
Is it close by?

239
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,290
It's a short drive

240
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,510
Joza Park

241
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,360
What's over there? A nice view?

242
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,110
A nice view

243
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,670
Is there a hill of some sort there?

244
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,700
Yes

245
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,050
That's great!

246
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,000
We can see the view from up there?

247
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,150
Ok Ok, let's go there

248
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,130
Joza Park

249
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,090
Joza Park

250
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,710
Joza Park

251
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,220
Shall we head there?

252
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,730
Yes

253
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,020
Thank you very much

254
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,870
They drive to Joza Sogo Park, recommended for #2

255
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,920
It's wild, their waving to us this whole time, it's just,

256
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,130
We just don't know what to do

257
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,620
That does happen

258
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,510
I mean I've already waved to them once,

259
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,960
I can't keep waving this whole time

260
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,270
And I guess I'll wave one more time at the end,

261
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,180
But this awkward wait is a lot to endure

262
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,380
Right? This traffic signal won't change at all

263
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,380
The girl in the middle is still waving

264
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,020
I don't think she saw that

265
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,270
Indeed, it seems she didn't

266
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,420
But really, Endo,

267
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,420
You're becoming more selfish each year,

268
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,420
I am?

269
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,640
Well I do get fed up sometimes

270
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,130
There's a lot of rumors flying around

271
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,040
Because of today?

272
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,870
There's a lot of people who say "Next time I meet that guy I'm gonna smack him"

273
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,870
Me?

274
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,110
Eh really?

275
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,110
But that boy definitely hates Matsumoto

276
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,400
I wonder what that was, it was really something

277
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,070
It was really something

278
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,470
He really thought you'd steal it

279
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,670
He really thought you'd steal it

280
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,220
There's no way!

281
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,240
He's gonna tell his mom about it

282
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,820
He did think that

283
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,440
There's no way I'd do that

284
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,640
His dad bought it for him

285
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,640
Just think about it. That kid was pretty big too

286
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,910
I hope this works out

287
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,960
Right?

288
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,670
A good view would be great

289
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,730
We could take a picture with everyone

290
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,740
Exactly, that would be nice

291
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:26,430
They arrive at the park. Will this make it to #2?

292
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,200
It's so spacious!

293
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,800
This is pretty big

294
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,840
This is better than the last park we went to

295
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,710
Right? That's good then. That's good then.

296
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,910
There's a statue there

297
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,600
Oh yeah

298
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,380
We gotta check out that statue

299
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,220
I think we should head over there

300
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,820
A statue we should check out

301
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,330
This thing too, what is it?

302
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,780
It's a measurement thing

303
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,930
Forward Reach Measurement

304
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,730
Looks interesting

305
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,780
This a device that measures your forward reach while sitting down

306
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:09,510
You can measure your body's flexibility by pushing the two pucks forward

307
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:14,340
The 5 try it out. First off is Matsumoto

308
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,710
I think I can go all the way actually

309
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,820
Matsumoto-san is the most likely to do it

310
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,600
I think so too

311
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,510
I can do this I think

312
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,330
Wow

313
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,340
Oh wow

314
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,290
Damn really?

315
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,530
There's just a bit more left

316
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,490
Oh you can do it

317
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,220
He did it

318
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,220
He did it

319
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,020
He went all the way

320
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,820
I see

321
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,560
That's the max

322
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,580
Amazing!

323
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,770
Hamada-san?

324
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,930
Why me?

325
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,760
I can't stretch like that I said

326
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,670
Alright do it

327
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,050
Do it

328
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,290
Ready, steady,

329
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,380
Hamada-san do it for real

330
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,470
No, that's not right

331
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,130
I think you should do it for real

332
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,090
The tips of your fingers

333
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,840
Can I use my fingers like Matsumoto-san?

334
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah totally

335
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,740
Exactly 34

336
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,240
There's a batsu game for this

337
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,690
A batsu game right?

338
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,910
Alright, ready, steady,

339
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,130
He passed 40

340
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,490
That's not right

341
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,780
He was so desperate

342
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,200
No need to be that desperate

343
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,800
What do you think? Well he did do it

344
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,020
Here I go. Ready, steady,

345
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,780
Endo did the same as Hosei, 43cm

346
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,690
Tanaka

347
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,330
Tanaka takes the challenge last

348
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,840
Well you do have the reach

349
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,610
Do as much as you can

350
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,930
Ow!!

351
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,650
What happened Tanaka?

352
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,400
A cramp?

353
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,220
Yes, I cramped up

354
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,310
You didn't say you were gonna start

355
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,270
What happened?

356
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,060
This kind of stuff is scary

357
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,270
Is this your first day?

358
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Next year is your 25th, c'mon do it man

359
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,820
This is scary, this kind of thing

360
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,160
That's what we don't understand

361
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,440
My back, I feel I'm gonna pull it

362
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,980
Is this your first time doing a location shoot?

363
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,220
He's done quite a few

364
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,220
Are you nervous?

365
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,640
Just say "Here I go!" and do it gently

366
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,880
I can't do it gently, I'm scared

367
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,560
That's fine

368
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,640
Just do it slowly then

369
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,200
Can I not do this?

370
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,510
What happened?

371
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,440
I'm scared

372
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,470
I'm scared-

373
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,640
Just do it, we're all having fun

374
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,620
Join in the fun with us

375
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,200
I want to, but I'm scared

376
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,800
Yeah so just say "Here I go!" and do it

377
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,220
Do it slowly so you don't get hurt

378
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,910
Say "Here I go"

379
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,870
I'll say "Here I go"

380
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,760
Just hold on please

381
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,710
I might pull my back

382
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,710
What the hell is this

383
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,870
No really, I-

384
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,330
We're not trying to pad the footage here

385
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,760
Your back hurts right?

386
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,220
Did you pull something?

387
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,270
It's cause your back hurts right?

388
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,020
I'll do it, I'll do it. I'll do it but,

389
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,130
He didn't say anything

390
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,330
What was that, pushing it forward with one hand

391
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,980
You flicked it forward

392
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,160
You really are a goddamn cheater

393
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,220
Such a cheater, really

394
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,160
You can't flick it forward

395
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,020
Tanaka's cheating nature aside, they set out to search for the hill top view,

396
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,440
There's no view point

397
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,710
We can't go up?

398
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,870
We're not going up?

399
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,860
So it's this view, this is the view

400
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,090
It's a nice view though

401
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,060
Well we're already here

402
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:57,360
There was no view point, but they had fun with the measurement device. Jozo Sogo Park takes the #2 spot.

403
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,380
Finally time for #1

404
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,440
Lets ask around

405
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,710
Let's go there

406
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,620
That's the only place

407
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,960
There's young people after all

408
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,000
Should we ask those young people?

409
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,780
Hello, do you have a moment

410
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,930
Do you have a moment?

411
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:17,200
Right now we're asking for recommendations near the Shizu area,

412
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,420
And we've gotten up to #2

413
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,130
Up to #2

414
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,960
So for #1,

415
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,440
Yes, finally #1

416
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,640
The #1 recommendation in the Shizu station area

417
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:33,440
What will this local high school baseball club suggest for #1?

418
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,620
Something that comes to mind?

419
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,820
My house

420
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,540
Do you have a big house?

421
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,640
No not really

422
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,840
We can come over?

423
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,780
Probably yes

424
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,470
Let's go then

425
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,950
Call, call home

426
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,600
This is for #1?

427
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,380
But he's the one who said it, he said his house

428
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,670
What-kun?

429
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,110
So Saito-kun's house is #1?

430
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,400
In the Shizu station area

431
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,710
Alright, alright then

432
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,420
Ask if it's alright

433
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,380
Saito-kun's house is #1 huh?

434
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
Have you been there?

435
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,600
I have

436
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,780
It's a normal house

437
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,400
A normal house huh?

438
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,380
It's not like a huge family is it?

439
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,530
It's a normal household

440
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,690
But since Saito suggested it...

441
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,920
He said it himself

442
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,560
Maybe there's something we should ride on

443
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,360
Oh yeah

444
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,290
Maybe there's some famous thing we should ride

445
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,490
Normally what do-

446
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,580
Eh what'd you say?

447
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,240
The monorail

448
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,910
The monorail?

449
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,130
Nobody said anything about the monorail

450
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,180
Nobody said anything

451
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,960
They said "No Good!"

452
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,980
What'd you tell them?

453
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,840
What do you mean?

454
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,620
You suggested it yourself!

455
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,510
Who said NG?

456
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,180
Who? Your mom?

457
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,220
What'd she say?

458
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,360
The reason?

459
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,180
"We can't really do that"

460
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,840
I'm so sorry

461
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,690
How did you explain it? Maybe the explanation was bad

462
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:11,110
I told them they're looking for stuff around Shizu station,

463
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,160
And I said "They're heading over right now"

464
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,160
And then?

465
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,910
"NG! NG!"

466
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,930
Saito...

467
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,780
Saito...

468
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,420
Well it can't be helped if she refused

469
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,470
What did you say? Did you tell them who's coming?

470
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,040
I said DownTown-san

471
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,780
Maybe she refused because you said DownTown

472
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,130
Maybe she thought we're gonna mess everything up

473
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,000
You said it before, what should we ride?

474
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,380
Monorail

475
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,530
Monorail?

476
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,800
Well that's it then, it's gotta be the monorail

477
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:51,200
We'll head to the monorail now, but if that doesn't work out,

478
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,380
Even if we have to break in, we'll go to Saito's house

479
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,040
Indeed

480
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,480
What kind of house is it? A normal one?

481
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,920
It's normal

482
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,240
A normal house?

483
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,890
What's your mom doing? Making dinner?

484
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,360
Probably

485
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,360
She's making dinner right?

486
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,020
That's ....

487
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,890
Saito-kun is losing the will to live each minute!!

488
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:22,840
They head to the station nearby to ride the train Saito's friend suggested

489
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,760
Well this time,

490
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,090
This was a total failure,

491
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,380
A total failure?

492
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,160
A total failure

493
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,130
Nobody will want to come here

494
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:41,090
Well it was a nice town, it was real

495
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:51,570
Well there were some nice moments

496
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,310
The car reaches the station

497
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,270
They looked up the schedule,

498
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,830
It'll arrive in about 4 minutes

499
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,360
Will we make it?

500
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,980
The next one is a 20 minute wait

501
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,980
Really?

502
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,690
It's here, are they getting on? It looks like it

503
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,530
3 more minutes

504
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,030
3 more minutes?

505
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,400
We can make it

506
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:27,220
Will this train make it to #1?

507
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:36,010
The 5 have arrived at District Centre Station to ride the Yamaman Yukarigaoka Line

508
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,220
The camera can't be taken into the train, so the 5 will ride by themselves

509
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,360
Here we go

510
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,820
It feels like it's been a while since I've done this

511
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,980
There it is, right on time

512
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,690
Are they filiming from outside? Ah there they are

513
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,600
Their train arrives at the next station, Koen Station

514
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,510
The 5 were giddy with excitement over the Koala's on the side of the train

515
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:28,730
The #1 recommendation by the locals of the Shizu station area, the Yamaman Yukarigaoka Line

516
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:35,310
The Yamaman Yukarigaoka line is a new transportation system opened 34 years ago

517
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:41,980
The train goes around 6 stations in 14 minutes, and is loved by the locals

518
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:49,360
With this, Shizu station's Best 5 is completed!

519
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,330
How was it? #5 to #1?

520
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,800
#5 to #1,

521
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,130
We've completed it

522
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,420
How was it Matsumoto-san?

523
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,600
Yes, this was a total failure

524
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:07,580
We're not saying this town is bad, just this episode wasn't very good

525
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:14,690
It's not that rural either. I think a more rural town would be better.

526
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,160
It was a large town

527
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,510
We wouldn't really get an opportunity to ride a monorail, if it wasn't for this episode

528
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,930
A precious experience

529
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,580
What town will we head to next?

530
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,930
Will we be able to?

531
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,930
This series, right?

532
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,220
Let's do it again

533
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,930
I wanna do this again

534
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,110
You want to do this again?

535
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,440
I do

536
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,580
Tanaka likes this more than I thought

537
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,400
Yeah I wanna do this

538
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,870
You know the view we saw after getting off the monorail was the best one today,

539
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,270
But we couldn't bring the camera with us, that was the worst
