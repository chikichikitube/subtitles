1
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:29,990
There are six contestants this time.
What are some of the new attempt or systems you are trying?

2
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,630
These six are stubborn.

3
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,740
They are tough as rocks.

4
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:58,890
This time we will include observers of our choosing.

5
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,490
Are observers allowed to laugh?

6
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,430
Of course.

7
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:10,770
They lighten the mood.

8
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,870
This is the new study.

9
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,310
"Study"?
No, it's the new test.

10
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,110
What's wrong with studying?

11
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,750
Testing is also studying.
Moreover, studying is a sign of a positive attitude.

12
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,020
You got a problem with that?

13
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,460
It's disgusting!

14
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,190
Documental - Season 10
Episode 3  “Activation the Special Rules”

15
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,090
You're really not funny when you're wearing clothes.

16
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,630
Don't....

17
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,160
He laughed.

18
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,470
He is laughing.

19
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,810
Hey, it's not here!

20
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,140
Not here!

21
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,210
Kubota is so close!

22
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,180
Damn!
I blew myself up!

23
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,810
Yellow card.

24
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,080
This is them normally.

25
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,390
Yrah, this is them normally.

26
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,320
So big...

27
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,790
His hand was swollen!

28
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,560
Orange card.

29
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,710
Someone will be here soon.

30
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,640
It will be soon.

31
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,610
I blew it.

32
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,380
I blew myself up.
I got two cards.

33
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,750
That’s too bad.

34
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,450
Coo-chan has two cards.

35
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,450
You and you have one card.

36
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,720
- Kubota has one card, right?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,690
- Do you have two cards?
- I have one card.

38
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,890
You guys don't have cards?

39
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,030
They do not have a card.

40
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:55,360
Fujimon, would you like to go?

41
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,260
Yeah!

42
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,000
- Go play with them. If nothing happens, come back.
- Yes.

43
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,600
I will go.

44
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,740
Then I'll restart.

45
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,670
Can I show you my video?

46
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,880
- Can I go first? Because his is very intense.
- Go ahead.

47
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,920
Big hand were hilarious, weren't they?

48
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,850
What are you wearing?

49
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,320
What are you doing?

50
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,690
I was on my....

51
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,620
You always have such bad timing.

52
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:25,760
I was getting ready in the locker room and you guys started watching videos, so I came over.

53
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,830
Sorry, hold on a second.

54
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,800
I'm here looking for a kappa.

55
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,270
You are not a kappa?

56
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,600
I'm a kappa, so I came here looking for another kappa.
(Note: 1)

57
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,640
Are you looking for a kappa?
(Note: 1)

58
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,640
One of these people must be a kappa.

59
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,680
Hey, you're a kappa, right?

60
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,110
- I'm not.
- You are like a kappa.

61
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,220
- I'm not.
- You are like a kappa.

62
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,690
Yuriyan and Zako are already naked.
So...

63
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,790
You call him Zakoshisho.

64
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,820
I don't mind.
He's my senior.

65
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,890
So Yuriyan and Zako are...

66
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,160
You're stubborn.

67
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,600
Do you have a plate on your head?

68
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,730
A plate.

69
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,700
- How do you prove it?
- Yeah, I have a plate.

70
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,070
But you don't have it, right?

71
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,400
You're a kappa, right?

72
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,470
No, I am not a kappa.

73
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,970
No, I am not a kappa.

74
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,810
The zipper is not closed.

75
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,910
Because you tried to close it yourself.

76
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,580
Then you close this.

77
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,880
No, I don't want to touch the kappa.

78
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,150
I'm just a kappa.

79
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,720
You are a kappa.

80
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,960
- I'm not a kappa.
- Just come.

81
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,490
He is scary.

82
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,490
Kappa.

83
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,930
Kappa.

84
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,030
He was taken by him.

85
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,270
Shappa.

86
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,670
Shappa.

87
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,440
Since they are not there, Kubota's video should not be shown yet.

88
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,370
It can't be helped.
Let's wait.

89
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,940
- Then why don't you watch my video one more time?
- Okay.

90
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,480
But they are not here.

91
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,450
It's okay.
I just want you to look at the big hand I just mentioned.

92
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:51,880
Then please show it.

93
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,090
- So young!
- This is normal Daisuke&Hanako.

94
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,760
This may look a little strange, but this is a normal photo.

95
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,190
Let's find the three difference.

96
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,590
- Three difference?
- His forehead?

97
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,430
Yeah, correct.

98
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,530
- Her fingers are thin.
- No.

99
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,630
- Her fingers are long.
- Correct!

100
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,100
There's still one left.

101
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,300
- What's that?
- Did he get more teeth?

102
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,210
That is wrong.

103
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,570
- Want to know the answer?
- Yeah.

104
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,180
Look at his ears.

105
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,380
How small ears.

106
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,610
- Very small ears.
- You've never seen ears this small, have you?

107
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,780
He really likes ears.

108
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,850
He really likes ears.

109
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,920
Let's look at the next one.

110
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,490
This is a normal photo.

111
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,960
- Is this a normal photo?
- Yes, it is.
- He has always had a large face.

112
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,690
This picture clearly shows what Hanako always tells him, that he has a large face.

113
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,200
After all, he has a big face.

114
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,930
Remember this picture.
Three, two, one.

115
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,110
It’s very obvious that his face is huge.

116
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,440
First, Daisuke's face.
And?

117
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,810
The parts of Hanako's face are closer to the center.

118
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,980
The parts are closer to the center.

119
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,110
There is still one more diffelence left?

120
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,250
Is he wearing gloves?

121
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,480
His hand is big.

122
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,990
So let's check it out.

123
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,160
Hanako...

124
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,430
Hey.

125
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,590
They came.

126
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,100
They are wearing kappa masks.

127
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,160
- That is a very realistic mask.
- That's not good timing.

128
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,630
It's a realistic kappa face.

129
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,570
- That's not good timing.
- We are kappa, right?

130
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,470
This is too realistic.
This is not the kappa I imagined. This is scary.

131
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,280
What kind of kappa were you imagining?

132
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,010
I was imagining something like a Hanakappa.
(Note: 2)

133
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,380
I was imagining something cute, but this is very realistic.

134
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,820
We are the real kappa.
And I knew he was a kappa.

135
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,820
Kotouge, How do you feel now?

136
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,720
I'll strangle you, pig!

137
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,560
He called him a pig.

138
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,590
He called the kappa a pig.

139
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,830
You guys are kappa, right?

140
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,530
I'll strangle you!
Hey, pig!

141
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,430
Stop it!

142
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,670
- Stop it!
- It's like hell.

143
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,180
No one saw us.

144
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,620
Don't fight with other kappa.

145
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,790
- I feel sorry for Kotouge-san.
- Yeah, I feel sorry for Kotouge.

146
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,590
- Did you guys have a meeting?
- Yes.

147
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,490
Really?

148
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,660
- Fujimon, please go to the room.
- Okay.

149
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,930
- Then let's show Kubota's video.
- Okay.

150
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,370
Fujimon!

151
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,670
I'm jurous becaus you able to laugh.

152
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,210
I'm allowed to laugh.

153
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,570
I'm jerous because you able to laugh.

154
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,110
You guys are doing great.

155
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,440
I'm glad you're here.

156
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,550
- Really?
- Yeah.

157
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,050
- The atmosphere will be better.
- You make it active again.
- I'm easy to talk to you.

158
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,380
- You are easy to talk to me?
- I'm very happy!

159
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,750
You guys make me feel very welcome.

160
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,950
- Are you laughing?
- No.

161
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,660
What makes you think that?

162
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,390
Did anyone laugh while saying I'm happy?

163
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,790
- They beamed.
- Yeah.

164
00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:00,740
I have one question for you.
What did you think of Yamamoto-san and Kotouge's kappa?

165
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,140
I wondered why you guys did that.

166
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,940
Let them change into their kappa costumes one more time.

167
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,070
That was enough.

168
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,510
- Wear this one more time.
- That's enough.

169
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,350
- Please Kotouge!
- Don't do it! Kotouge, you say no to him.

170
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,810
Please!

171
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,180
I feel sorry for Kotouge.

172
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,680
I feel sorry for Kotouge.
Hey, Yama-san.

173
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,220
That was not funny at all.

174
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,990
Why did you do that?

175
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,520
No one was laughing at that in the other room.

176
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,830
You haven't done anything funny all day.

177
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,300
Today you are not funny at all.

178
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,800
Don't wear the mask as an excuse to run.

179
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,540
You're trying to get back on your feet after last time, right?

180
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,800
Yeah.
Right.

181
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,640
Then try harder.

182
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,940
Kubota.

183
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,080
Hey, that's mine, right?

184
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,050
- This is my cigarette.
- That's right.

185
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,320
I feel very sorry for Kotouge.

186
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,820
What's wrong?

187
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,450
I did not laugh.

188
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,190
- Didn't you just laugh?
- No.

189
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,760
- You are still laughing.
- No, I am just barely holding on.

190
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,660
- You're laughing right now.
- No, I am not laughing.
- You are laughing.

191
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,430
- You are laughing too.
- When I get stress my cheek twitch.

192
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,530
That counts as a laugh, too.

193
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,200
- Koge is angry.
- That's enough. Let's not do that, Yama-san.

194
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,610
He apologized, but I would not forgive him.

195
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,740
I know how Kotouge feels.
Everyone gets angry in such a occasion.

196
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,310
Get your act together!

197
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,480
Do you understand, Yama-san?

198
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,190
Oh my God.
No one laughed.

199
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,160
- I will stop blaming Yamamoto-san.
- That's good.

200
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,760
Because I understand his feelings very well.

201
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,990
Why?

202
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,730
How do you know that?

203
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,300
He is close.

204
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,370
Answer me.

205
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,030
How do you know that?

206
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,200
I know how it feels when a joke bombs.

207
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,640
Oh, you know that because your jokes often bomb too?

208
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,310
So...

209
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,880
- You know how Yamamoto-san feels, right?
- Yeah.

210
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,980
He almost laughs more than once.
I may as well give him the card.

211
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,120
- You're laughing all the time, though.
- No.

212
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,250
- You are laughing a little.
- You are laughing.

213
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,420
- Please don't point this out to me alone.
- No, you are laughing a little.

214
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,360
Right.

215
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,560
- Be careful.
- Yes.

216
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,160
Don't point this out to just me.

217
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,130
- Really don't do that.
- Even now you are laughing.

218
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,700
- Listen. Even now you are laughing.
- I am enduring.

219
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,510
I allow you this time, but from now on I will be more strict in pointing out your laugh.

220
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,480
- You are not Matsumoto-san and you don't talk big.
- Right.

221
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,050
Hey, looser.
We are winners.

222
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,250
Don't get carried away.

223
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,190
He laughed so hard.

224
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,320
He laughed so hard.

225
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,030
Hey, don't be silly, Kubota.

226
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,360
He laughed so hard.

227
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,070
What did you show him?

228
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,640
This is my favorite one.
Matsumoto-san, what should I do with this?

229
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,000
- I don't want to show this to anybody else.
- I see.

230
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,470
You laughed.

231
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,380
- Did I laugh?
- You laughed so hard.

232
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,550
Fujimon was right, you were laughing the whole time.

233
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,630
- Why did you attack me?
- I thought it was the right time. Sorry.

234
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,970
That's not fair.

235
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,740
You have been laughing ever since Fujimon came.

236
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,040
When Fujimon comes in, it becomes relaxed.

237
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,910
That was like a camp school.

238
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,340
That sounds fun.

239
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,650
Coo-chan, you are dismissed!

240
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,180
He's going to have jokes he hasn't shown them yet.

241
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,080
Is he leaving?

242
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,820
You didn't win three in a row.

243
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,970
This is Kubota's score.

244
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,700
What he showed him is still a secret.

245
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,970
I just worry about that.
You are not been fair.

246
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,510
You guys have been grinning since Fujimon got here.

247
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,440
Really so.

248
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,880
- His laughter is infectious.
- Yeah, he is laughing.

249
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,780
Because I am allowed to laugh.
That was so funny.

250
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,680
You laughed too, Yama-san.

251
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,650
I didn't laugh.

252
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,350
And you laugh at me.

253
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,260
I just laughed because you are funny.

254
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,760
Guys, it's not good to smirk.

255
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:17,990
Thank you.

256
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,290
Oh, really?

257
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,000
Thank you, Cookie-san.

258
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,760
Thank you!

259
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,400
I wish you all the best.
Good luck, Yamamoto-san.

260
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,030
- I can't.
- You can.

261
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:28,900
Thank you.

262
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,470
What did you show him?

263
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,610
I was quite caught off guard.

264
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:49,920
How could I have won if I had no defense at all?
I am the kind of person who guards with plastic board.

265
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,330
In the end, my enemy was Kubota.

266
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,100
He gave me the final blow.

267
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,330
It was Kubota who cut off my head.

268
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,240
I really do not know who will win.

269
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,370
Zakoshi is strong.

270
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,910
But Kubota might win too.
Either Zakoshi or Kubota might win.

271
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,190
Yama-san, the kappa one was terrible.

272
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,290
Here we go.

273
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,720
That was terrible.

274
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,490
The kappa one wasn't good?

275
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,860
What were you going to do with the kappa one?

276
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,260
Your jokes always lack punch lines.

277
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,300
Right.

278
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,470
I don't think about that.

279
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,440
It's fine, right?

280
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,240
It's not fine.

281
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,840
I shouldn't have gotten involved with you.

282
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,770
And so are you.

283
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,080
Why?

284
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,210
You're also fucking with them.

285
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,910
Why is that bad?

286
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,110
That's not bad.

287
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,280
Then it's fine!

288
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,580
Then it's fine.

289
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,450
But that's what I mean.

290
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,220
- What do you mean?
- That's what I mean.

291
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,860
- We are a group that fuck with people.
- Yes!

292
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,160
but still they're competent.

293
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,600
- Was I the worst?
- Honestly, you are the worst.

294
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,800
How long have you been watching me?

295
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,130
From the beginning.

296
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,030
What time did you get here today?

297
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,900
That has nothing to do with this.

298
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,670
That has nothing to do with this.

299
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,070
Let's watch the video.

300
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,210
Yeah, let's do it.

301
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,580
Okay, let's watch the video.

302
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,910
Don't keep staring at them.

303
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,750
Come, Yama-san.

304
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,820
Don't do that, Kotouge.

305
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,350
You bastard!
(Note: 3)

306
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,590
They do it because you react that way.

307
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,020
- Stop it already.
- Why did you throw this!?

308
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,160
It's best to do so.

309
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,660
Guys, stop it already.

310
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,330
Why did you throw this!?

311
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,730
Because you react that way.

312
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,630
You bastard!

313
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,800
Yama-san,

314
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,070
You have the longest career, so you should be more imposing.

315
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,470
But I have a 10 year gap.

316
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,910
You right. Sorry.

317
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,710
Please sit down.

318
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,910
- Really sorry.
- Please calm down.

319
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,120
- It's my fault.
- I feel I said too much, sorry.

320
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,420
What the hell are you looking at me!?

321
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,160
Yama-san, stop it already!

322
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,060
This guy has egg on his forehead.

323
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,960
I don't really care if it's detailed.

324
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,530
- Do we have to wash our hair every time?
- Yeah.

325
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,560
Zakoshi, you are also...

326
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,200
Every time?

327
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,200
Let's not do this anymore.

328
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,370
Hey stop.

329
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,570
Do we have to wash our hair every time?

330
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:20,940
You are scared.

331
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,140
Are you scared?

332
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,110
No, he isn't.

333
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,850
Now let's watch the video.
Yama-san, please do not talk back to them.

334
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,820
Do we have to wash our hair every time?

335
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,090
He is wrestling again.

336
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,320
Zakoshi, you're not good either.

337
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,260
This guy is so annoying.

338
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,060
You're also fuck with them.

339
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,160
Fuck with them?

340
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,890
- Should he have washed his head?
- That's enough!

341
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,300
You are both fucking with them.

342
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,630
Yeah.

343
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,800
You both are.

344
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,440
- I'm not like that, but she is.
- He is!

345
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,970
You are both fucking with them.

346
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,740
You guys are doing something you don't need to do right now.

347
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,140
So I shouldn't have done that!?

348
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,180
I've been saying that all along.

349
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,480
I've been saying that all along.

350
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,120
He's telling you not to do that.

351
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,620
It is not better to do everything.

352
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,650
But I should do that.

353
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,060
Yeah, but...

354
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,620
We should do that shushutto(≒quickly).

355
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,290
What do you mean?
What's "shushutto"?

356
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,700
You don't have to do it either!

357
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,330
So I shouldn't have done that!?

358
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,170
That's right!
I've been saying that for a while now.

359
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,870
- Kubota, can you get started on that?
- Yes.

360
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,870
I'm looking forward to it.

361
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,710
What did Coo-chan see that made him laugh?

362
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,680
This is a composite photo of someone and someone's face.

363
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,110
Yuriyan?

364
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,580
Great.
One side is Yuriyan.

365
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:35,950
How many faces did you composite?

366
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,620
Two people.

367
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,450
- Two?
- Yawara-chan?

368
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,720
No.

369
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,890
It's hanako and someone I don't know.

370
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,090
I can see that one side is Yuriyan but I don't know the other perosn.

371
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,390
Who?

372
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,390
Yamamoto-san.

373
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,690
No way.

374
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,530
If you mix Yuriyan and Yamamoto-san's face, this is the result.

375
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,600
- Let's look at the next one.
- That's interesting.

376
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,500
- I know who this is.
- Who is this?

377
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,770
It's Takashi Hosokawa.
(Note: 4)

378
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,240
- Do you know who the other person is?
- Yeah, it is indeed his hair.

379
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,580
RG?
(Note: 5)

380
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:02,840
It is not him.

381
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,780
- Then who?
- It's a characteristic baldness.

382
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,350
It's Yamamoto-san.

383
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,710
Yamamoto-san?

384
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,950
Yeah, this is Yamamoto-san's baldness.

385
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,580
It's Yama-san?

386
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,750
Yeah, this is his hairline.

387
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,290
How about this?

388
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,620
Who?

389
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,760
Is this difficult?

390
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,790
I recognized one of them.

391
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,930
Who is this?

392
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,960
Matsumoto-san, right?

393
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,470
This is Matsumoto-san's mouth.

394
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,370
I wonder who the other person is?

395
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,640
- Barack Obama?
- No.

396
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,140
The correct is Antony.
(Note: 6)

397
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,570
Ah, Antony.

398
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:34,880
I didn't get it.

399
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,910
Matsumoto-san and...

400
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,450
Oh, I messed up.
This has nothing to do with it.

401
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,950
This is Matsumoto-san.

402
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,180
This is almost Matsumoto-san.

403
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,620
- Oh, shit, I made a mistake.
- This is almost Matsumoto-san.

404
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,750
What did you do?

405
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:52,030
This is Matsumoto-san, who gained weight using an app that can make someone gain 7 kg.

406
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,530
Why did you fatten him up?

407
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,630
By the way, Cookie-san laughed when he saw this.

408
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,230
- Oh, really?
- Oh, this was it.

409
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,440
He would laugh if he suddenly saw this.

410
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,570
What the hell is that app?

411
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,510
It's an app that can fatten someone up.

412
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,780
Didn't you just laugh?

413
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,880
I am not laughing at all.

414
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,750
Hey, Kubota.

415
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:14,850
You are laughing.

416
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,120
This is a symptom of my disease.
Matsumoto-san knows this.

417
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,420
Even so, you shouldn't do that.

418
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,520
When I get stress my cheek twitch.

419
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,790
- i'll stop playing videos for a while.
- Can I show mine next?
- Yeah.

420
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,490
I will show you the rest later.

421
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,100
Hey, hey, hey...

422
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,100
What's that app that can make someone gain 7 kg?

423
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,370
- There is such an app.
- Why 7 kg?

424
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,510
If it were 7 kg, I don't think it would be so fat.

425
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,480
Did you have to say that?

426
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,010
Yes.

427
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,880
- May I begin?
- Sure.

428
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,560
Hosokawa-san?

429
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,530
[KILL YOU]

430
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,100
So scary.

431
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:06,870
So scary.

432
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,540
- I would like you to watch one more.
- Hey, what the hell is this?

433
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,870
Is this a set up for a joke?

434
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,280
It was so scary.

435
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,080
Watch this.

436
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,220
No sound?

437
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,720
- There's no sound?
- I could hear the sound.

438
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,530
So fast.

439
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,130
It's too fast.

440
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,440
It's too fast...

441
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,210
...look like its not moving.

442
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,640
It's very fast.

443
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,350
[KILL YOU]

444
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,350
What the hell.

445
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,380
Hey, what's this?

446
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,520
I don't get it.

447
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,720
Who is this message to?

448
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,790
It's too much of a leap to make sense.
What's this?

449
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,100
I will show you a better one.

450
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,260
Hey, listen.

451
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,930
I will show you a better one.

452
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,700
May I show you one more one?

453
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,570
Fujimoto-san, don't look at me because I am about to laugh.

454
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,710
Please show this.

455
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,220
[NATAYOOO]

456
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,690
"Natayooo"

457
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,450
- It's Kinoshita of TKO.
- "Natayooo"
(Note: 7&8)

458
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,560
Plastic bottle...

459
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,930
Let me watch it again.

460
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,400
Kotouge is about to laugh.

461
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,400
I want to watch it again.

462
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,270
"Natayooo"

463
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,840
He says it.

464
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,810
Where was this taken?

465
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,640
I don't really care where he's shooting.

466
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,610
Why is he repeating this part?

467
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,010
He has thrown that one many times.

468
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,950
It's getting faster.

469
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,160
It's so...

470
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:13,890
So fast.

471
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,160
So fast.

472
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,000
[NATAYOOO]

473
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,840
"Natayooo"

474
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,040
Kotouge laughed.

475
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,640
- Did you just laught at your own joke.
- No, I didn't.

476
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,850
It could be me.

477
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,720
"Natayooo"

478
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,090
Who laughed?

479
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,460
It's Kotouge.

480
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,260
It was very funny.

481
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,390
Kotouge?

482
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,800
He was patient, though.

483
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,030
Who laughed?

484
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,070
Kotouge.

485
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,240
You were so smiling.

486
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,480
Yes, that's right.

487
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,930
- You just seemed to be having fun.
- He laughed because Fujimon was there.

488
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,290
I didn't do anything to you.

489
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,930
I laugh when my eyes meet yours.

490
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,570
Why do you laugh when your eyes meet mine?

491
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,170
Is this your first time getting a card?

492
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,570
No, this is the second time.

493
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,110
This means that...

494
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,710
Oh, gosh.

495
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,210
- Fujimon, please leave with me.
- Yes.

496
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,350
And let's get someone to come here.

497
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:43,820
Are you leaving?

498
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,620
Good luck.

499
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,490
Good luck.

500
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,460
Good luck.

501
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,590
Good luck.
