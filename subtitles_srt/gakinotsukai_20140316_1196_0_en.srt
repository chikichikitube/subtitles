It's amazing, I've never heard of this before!

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,460
The title is so long.

11
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,660
Yea, the title is long!

12
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,560
So why are you doing this, Yama-chan?

13
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,570
Why you ask?

14
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,770
Well, this time I turn 46 years old.

15
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,070
You're turning 46 huh?

16
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,770
Yes, my 46th birthday has come.

17
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,510
I think it's bad if you don't try to look back on your life

18
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,180
Eh? 46 years old is your halfway mark?

19
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,310
Isn't it usually 50?

20
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,780
Shouldn't you have done it last year?

21
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,780
You're right, when you're 45!

22
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,720
Is there gonna be questions like that?

23
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,420
Is there gonna be questions like that?

24
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,990
I think so, it was 24 hours!

25
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,220
I'm sure you've all been interviewed before.

26
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,830
Isn't 30 minutes kind of long?

27
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,830
Yea...

28
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:52,360
There's nothing more to ask in 30 minutes.

29
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,760
Completely?

30
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,360
Completely.

31
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,360
I see...

32
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,730
We'll know the real Tsuki... tei Housei.

33
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,270
We'll know the real Tsuki... tei Housei.

34
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,270
We'll know the real Tsuki... tei Housei.

35
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,540
Remember it already! Seriously!

36

Morning!

46
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,930
Housei-san, we will shortly begin the long interview

47
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,930
but how do you feel?

48
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,930
but how do you feel?

49
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,130
Well... All of it...

50
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,100
I want to summon up all of my 46 years of living.

51
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,340
I want to summon up all of my 46 years of living.

52
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,470
I want to summon up all of my 46 years of living.

53
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,080
When you look from behind he looks like Hidetoshi Hoshida.

When you look from behind he looks like Hidetoshi Hoshida.

Good morning!

56
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,420
This is gonna
be long huh~

57
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,420
Isn't this
amazing!

58
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,420
I was extremely
tired.

59
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,860
In this hotel room

60
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,230
a great challenge in TV history is about to start.

61
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,170
Once the interviewer comes

62
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,170
the 24 Hour interview will start.

63
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,170
OK.

64
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,640
Good luck!

65
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,640
Alright, thank you.

66
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:19,050
This time for this challenge,

there are 3 interviewers on standby.

67
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,050
They will switch out with each other for the sake of the interview.

68
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,960
Excuse me!

69
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:31,200
Freelance Writer Kojima Kenichi

00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:31,200
Published the subculture
book "Tamori Douhon"

71
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,220
Don't worry about it.

72
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,760
I will be asking for your stories, I'm Kojima.

73
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:39,670
24 Hour Long Interview

74
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:39,670
Start

75
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,630
It's 9 AM.

76
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,270
Finally, a performer's willpower will be put to the test

77
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,670
as the 24 hour interview starts.

78
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,870
As we begin with this
so called 24 hour interview,

79
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,870
Mhm.

80
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,910
Tsukitei Housei, I plan to

81
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,910
ask about everything in your 46 years.

82
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,550
Let's start with your kindergarten years.

83
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,080
Kindergarten years huh?

84
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,450
From the time you were born.

85
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,820
Alright, let's start with from when I was born.

86
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,890
I was brought outside a lot.

87
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,090
I was brought outside a lot.

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,060
When I was brought out things like

89
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,430
"cute, handsome," I was always called.

90
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,370
When I was brought out things like

91
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,370
"cute, handsome," I was always called.

92
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,940
My father would get really happy.

93
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,210
And because he was happy,

94
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,910
that's why I was brought out a lot.

95
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:21,010
I've already given up on this.

96
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,080
So quickly!

97
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,010
But it's the first question!

98
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,010
No, no, there's more!

99
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,280
It was when I was about 3 or 4,

100
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,280
they couldn't take their eyes off me.

101
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,720
For example I was waiting for the train

102
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,190
and I thought we were getting on the next one.

103
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,960
When they looked inside,

104
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,960
I was in the train waving.

105
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,700
They screamed and then

106
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,300
they quickly searched
the next station for me.

107
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,300
Now that you're aware of it,

108
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,500
surprising people and making people laugh,

109
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,410
Well, you know...

110
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,010
looking back on it, how do you feel?

111
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,380
Well, this is
what they call
an interview...

112
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,380
Yea, you're right.

113
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,480
It's not that I'm looking back on it
but rather what I think now but

114
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,480
when I think about what a performer is

115
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,790
when I think about what a performer is

116
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,190
I think it's the feeling of trying to make people happy.

117
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,930
I think getting pleased by people is a small part of it.

118
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,830
I think getting pleased by people is a small part of it.

119
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,870
The feeling of trying
to make people happy

120
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,880
Would you say you were

121
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,880
always livening up your surroundings?

122
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,340
I'd say so.

123
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:34,090
Was it 3rd year or 4th year
of elementary school...

124
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,110
What the hell!

125
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,090
3rd year or 4th year of elementary school...

126
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,390
When class was over

127
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,060
there was about 10 minutes left extra on purpose.

128
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,330
there was about 10 minutes left extra on purpose.

129
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,390
And then

130
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,160
I said, "There's time left over today too~"

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,770
"Then do something Yamazaki."

132
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,700
I left ahead and did an imitation of our teacher.

133
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,540
And then one time I... It was my

134
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,510
3rd grade teacher, was it Mr. Oda?

135
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,670
And then one time I... It was my

136
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,670
3rd grade teacher, was it Mr. Oda?

137
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,780
When we talked about, "What I did like always"

138
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,850
I did a dirty joke.

139
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,780
From that teacher,

140
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,020
because I did that dirty joke...

141
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:15,190
I remember being told

142
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,190
"You shouldn't make people laugh with a dirty joke."

143
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,430
What the hell!

144
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,200
So this is the tone of the interview huh?

145
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,200
This atmosphere.

146
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,170
For you, is there a boundary line for dirty jokes?

147
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,010
A boundary line for dirty jokes?

148
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,810
For example, your penis...

149
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:45,620
For example, your penis...

150
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,290
If you put it out plainly, it's not amusing huh?

151
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,620
If you put it out plainly, it's not amusing huh?

152
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,260
Don't you think it's not amusing to a greater extent?

153
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,460
But...

154
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,330
if you stick it over here, isn't it amusing?

155
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,830
if you stick it over here, isn't it amusing?

156
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,570
It's not amusing if you flauntingly put it out?

157
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,940
Isn't it the opposite?

158
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,940
Of course it is.

159
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:09,110
The penis is like a spice, don't you think

160
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:09,110
The penis is like a spice, don't you think

161
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,110
if you line up penises around it's no good?

162
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,820
Poop is interesting as well.

163
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
He changed it!

164
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,560
If you have a bit here, it's funny but

165
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,520
if you had it all around, it's no good.

166
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,960
if you had it all around, it's no good.

167
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,400
What the hell is this?

168
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,530
A boundary line for dirty jokes.

169
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,570
2 hours and 50 minutes have passed since the start.

170
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,570
2 hours and
50 minutes!

171
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:36,210
You were the funny guy
in elementary school

172
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:36,210
but did a change happen in middle school?

173
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,940
But there's still
so much more!

174
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,610
I guess it was around 2nd year~

175
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,280
Puberty came~

176
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,210
Did you ever get into fights?

177
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,520
Oh yea, I fought a lot

178
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,090
Oh, in primary school too?

179
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,490
I fought 'till 3rd year in middle school.

180
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,390
Tell me about a tale of your heroism.

181
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,390
Well I wouldn't call it heroism.

182
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,460
In primary school as well,

183
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,460
people would gather and fight.

184
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,570
It seemed like you'd go to attack the school.

185
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,570
What happened after your raids?

186
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,440
Honestly...

187
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,140
When I think about it...

188
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,840
"It's getting dark," we'd quit.

189
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,280
It seems like when someone said

190
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,280
"It's getting dark," we'd quit.

191
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,650
What the hell...

192
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,920
Were you a Yankee?

193
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,920
Hmmmm...

194
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,050
Well...

195
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,960
In middle school

196
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,960
I wore one of those long biker jackets.

197
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,760
The ones biker gangs wear, huh?

198
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,560
Those jackets have a lot of kanji on them.

199
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,300
What was on yours?

200
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,100
Well, if I can remember correctly...

201
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,740
"Battle"

202
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,500
"Battle"

203
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,370
Are you sure
that's not a lie?
Is this a real story?

204
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,710
Are you joking
with us?

205
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,850
I can't really remember it...

206
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,180
I'm serious...

207
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,610
It's because it's
a long interview.

208
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,710
No this is
really real!

209
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,950
You just left
it like that!

210
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,320
And drank
some water!

211
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,750
When was your chance to quit?

212
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,990
You had a chance right?

213
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,960
The chance to quit huh?

214
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,530
It was the "Period."

215
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,890
Period?

216
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,890
The period.

217
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,930
It became the period where

218
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,930
I had to choose between what was cooler, that or surfing.

219
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:07,570
At that time I chose surfing.

220
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,470
At that time I chose surfing.

221
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,300
Coincidentally,

222
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,300
did you surf long or short style?

223
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,310
Are you serious?

224
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,310
Yes??

225
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,570
I did both.

226
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,080
But isn't there a difference
between the two? Long is....

227
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,210
Yea...

228
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,880
Look you
skipped over it!

229
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,880
Housei! Housei!

230
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,880
My throat
was dry!

231
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,090
Are you sure
it's not because
you're lying?

232
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,090
No! Not at all!

233
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,590
It's been 4 hours and 5 minutes since the start!

234
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,430
Food has been prepared for the battle.

235
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,930
And with this the interviewers change!

236
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:49,140
Film Writer Kyouko Kunigawa

237
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:49,140
Writer for Yoshimoto News
Center, experienced in
interviewing celebrities.

238
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,870
A woman!

239
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,870
Thank you for going for such a long time!

240
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,140
Excuse me. Have a seat.

241
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,140
Excuse me. Have a seat.

242
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,980
Were you popular in middle school?

243
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,280
Hmm.. Well, if you're
gonna say popular, I was but...

244
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:06,520
I was

245
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,260
You can see his
worn-out face has
come already....

246
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,520
popular since the low grades of primary school.

247
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,890
Actually, I'd say since kindergarten.

248
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:14,400
In my classes

249
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,400
I was always chosen as the cutest.

250
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,640
You were well liked huh?

251
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,340
It's been 5 hours and 40 minutes since the start.

252
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,750
The interview continues as they change venues.

253
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,280
Thank you for having me!

254
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,850
I want to continue to ask you
a story from your middle school days.

255
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,090
They're gonna do it here?

256
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,790
In middle school did you

257
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,790
have something you were addicted to?

258
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,190
Well, at least the
weather is good.

259
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,560
I know you did kendo in middle school but...

260
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,830
Well~

261
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,630
When I think about it, in middle school...

262
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,000
The thing I was addicted to
the most was kendo of course...

263
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,470
But that's just one axis of it.

264
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,540
Music.

265
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,540
Music huh?

266
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,640
Honestly, I was addicted to music.

267
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,140
At that time,

268
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,980
I was really into guitar.

269
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,820
Well, it was a lot of heavy metal.

270
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,750
Because I couldn't make a lot of noise, I bought an amp and with that amp...

271
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,790
It sounded a lot more louder.

272
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,000
What was your dream in middle school?

273
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,000
Man, that face
pisses me off~

274
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Because I was playing the guitar,

275
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,000
my dream was to make a living off of it.

276
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,000
It's my
listening face.

277
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,800
When I think about it now....

278
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,610
"When was the happiest time of my life,"

279
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,970
if you asked me that,

280
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,610
it was 2nd year of middle school.

281
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,240
This without a doubt.

282
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,080
On my first date

283
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,080
I went to go see the movie "High Teen Boogie."

284
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,580
In your
2nd year right?

285
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,580
3rd year.

286
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,450
What year was it!

287
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,450
It wasn't in your
second year!?

288
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,760
Which one is
it you idiot!

289
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,760
He's pretty
off, huh?

290
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,830
We met at Koshien Station then
went to Umeta Station and from there

291
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:59,270
Housei continues to talk about his 3rd year story.

292
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,670
we went to the movie theater then had a break...

293
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,370
Then we rode the train back to Koshien Station,

294
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,370
and said, "Bye bye."

295
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,970
We didn't say a single word.

296
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,240
It was so embarrassing.

297
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,080
When we exchanged diaries at school,

298
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,080
she wrote, "It was fun," but

299
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,850
I thought "LIAR!"

300
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Housei, what did
you think about it?

301
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,250
Me?

302
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,920
It was fun.

303
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,060
Then both of you...

304
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,790
No...

305
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,790
That was a good first date huh?

306
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,930
Well... I guess...

307
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,190
What the hell
is this!?

308
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,900
That's a once in a lifetime date.

309
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,840
7 hours have passed since the start.

310
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,240
Continuing, they go to a cafe.

311
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,080
Were you in any clubs in high school?

312
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,710
Well I joined the kendo club but I quit really quickly.

313
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,280
Well I joined the kendo club but I quit really quickly.

314
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,950
Why was that?

315
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,980
That's because

316
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,520
I was too busy with the guitar and surfing.

317
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,490
I was too busy with the guitar and surfing.

318
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,220
You really surfed?

319
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,690
Is this the truth?

320
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,030
I know after that you had a band but...

321
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,530
when was the band formed?

322
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,870
We formed in the

323
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,870
first year of high school.

324
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,500
Were you a genuine band?

325
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,540
Yea...

326
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,880
I thought of making a living off my guitar.

327
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,910
Oh, is that so?

328
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,310
Where did you perform?

329
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,020
We did it in a studio.

330
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,990
In front of
an audience?

331
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,320
Well, we didn't perform in front of an audience.

332
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,990
Well, I wouldn't say we didn't...

333
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,260
We did some film concert type thing.

334
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,660
What the hell!

335
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,060
What's that?

336
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,260
Well, we did various things.

337
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,740
Look, he's trying
to continue the lie.

338
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,210
Like what?

339
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,740
No, it's not a lie!

340
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,740
Look! This is the
face he makes
when he's lying.

341
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,050
Please go ahead and eat.

342
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,310
OK.

343
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:56,290
Speaking of the film concert, what is that?

344
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,650
Look she's
asking what it is!

345
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,160
What the hell's
a film concert!?

346
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,730
He's pretending
not to hear it.

347
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,730
Answer it
already!

348
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,230
The film concert?

349
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,230
Huh?

350
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,030
Are you joking?

351
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,030
No, he's serious!

352
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,300
What about it?

353
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,240
Well, I don't exactly understand
what a film concert is...

354
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,500
Hm...

355
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,110
Well...

356
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,550
Isn't it what the name implies?

357
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,210
There's loud noises

358
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,980
and there are performances... And then

359
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,520
because there were cameras

360
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,560
during our time in high school...

361
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,160
Yea...

362
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,630
I think that was

363
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,100
around the first year of high school,

364
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,700
cameras and videos...

365
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:48,070
Housei begins a story about recording equipment.

366
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,770
They were all over the place.

367
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,970
He didn't say
what it was.

368
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,440
Did you show your band in the film concert?

369
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,440
Hmm... Well...

370
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,510
Our band,

371
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,820
Micheal Schenker Group.

372
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,350
To what percent did you show

373
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,350
your band compared to others?

374
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,020
I don't know if I'd say percent.

375
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,590
It was the fusion of our dream.

376
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,390
It was the fusion of our dream.

377
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,360
The dream of appearing together.

378
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,360
To appear together.

379
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,100
So I don't know if I'd say that...

380
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,300
Well that, I don't really remember.

381
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,010
Well that, I don't really remember.

382
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,370
Did you do it alot...?

383
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,210
Yea, we did it quite frequently.

384
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,250
We weren't there you know, during the film concert...

385
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:32,050
We weren't there you know, during the film concert...

386
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,280
What the hell
are you going
on about!?

387
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,280
What were you doing then?

388
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,280
No, I was uhh...

389
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,290
Working backstage I guess.

390
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,920
Backstage?
Backstage??

391
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,290
Backstage?

392
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,460
What do
you mean!?

393
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,420
Backstage?

394
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,760
So you didn't perform?

395
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,060
He's finally
gonna lie.

396
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,700
Well because we were doing the film concert.

397
00:14:51,700 --> 00:15:00,510
So it was a film concert where

398
00:14:51,700 --> 00:15:00,510
you showed videos of artists?

399
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,510
Yes.

400
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,850
Housei, so you didn't

401
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,850
show your band performing?

402
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,850
Yea.

403
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,020
So it was something everyone got together for

404
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,020
to watch videos of their favourite bands?

405
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,590
Am I right?

406
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,720
Yes, yea.

407
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,820
Thank you very much!

408
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,000
It's been 8 hours and
38 minutes since the start.

409
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:24,840
As an editor for "TV Pia" he's
interviewed a lot of actresses.
Current chosen "Monthly Sukapa-"

410
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:24,840
Freelance Writer Koji Aoki

411
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,170
Returning to the hotel, the interview continues.

412
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,140
What was your impression

413
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,140
when you first saw Downtown?

414
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,580
Well the first time...

415
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:42,390
It was late at night on a manzai program,

416
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:42,390
It was late at night on a manzai program,

417
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,390
they came out as newcomers.

418
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,720
Um~

419
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,290
They did a comical skit about a doctor.

420
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,560
When I saw that

421
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,530
I thought "Eh?"

422
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,170
It surpassed my expectations.

423
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,900
"These guy's are gonna take over the world."

424
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,900
I thought,

425
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,380
Thank you very much!

426
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,650
What is comedy for you?

427
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,940
In this world comedy is on the highest culture.

428
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,650
In this world comedy is on the highest culture.

429
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:16,350
Do you have pride in your ad-lib?

430
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,980
Well isn't it obvious?

431
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,420
It's my strength.

432
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,350
Honestly, I have a lot of strength in that.

433
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,930
Why did you have this hairstyle?

434
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,930
I don't know why I thought that was good.

435
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,530
That image pisses me off!

436
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,660
Honestly...

437
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,700
How do you feel being called "Good for nothing?"

438
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,960
Somewhere it killed my soul.

439
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,700
Somewhere it killed my soul.

440
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,470
What's your favourite word?

441
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,470
It's "Soul"

442
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,470
"Soul"!?

443
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,010
I think it was...

444
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,010
If you give luck to someone you'll receive it as well.

445
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,010
Your favourite motto?

446
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,640
What does a "married couple" mean to you?

447
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,480
What does a "married couple" mean to you?

448
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,480
To be inseparable.

449
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,150
When you were picking out your kids' names

450
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,150
did you judge it with character strokes?

451
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,350
I only did it with Tenma.

452
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,150
Looks cold!

453
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,790
Because if Rara and Momo get
married they change their surname.

454
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,430
Uwa~ It looks so cold!

455
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,130
Well this is the coldest
time of the year after all.

456
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,770
15 hours and 32 minutes have passed.

457
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,140
More and more they break into the late night hours.

458
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,710
Housei.. For now...

459
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:16,910
It seems like there's a massage service.

460
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:22,120
If you want you can call them.

461
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,120
Ah, I guess I will.

462
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,720
He's calling it
in the interview
room?

463
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,920
What? What?

464
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,730
You're requesting
a massage?

465
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,160
One massage please, room 1205.

466
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,600
One massage please, room 1205.

467
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:41,670
The interview switches to asking about rakugo.

468
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:38,240
The interview continues while waiting for the masseuse to arrive.

469
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,370
The topic; the story of the change to rakugo.

470
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,610
Why did you think of switching to rakugo?

471
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,980
For a while...

472
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,680
and I thought, "Did I find it?"

473
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:53,680
I was definitely looking for something

474
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,680
and I thought, "Did I find it?"

475
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,390
Ah, the masseuse has come.

476
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:04,030
The massage Housei requested has arrived.

477
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,430
The massage has arrived to the room.

478
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,960
Thank you for requesting me today.

479
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,030
The interview continues while she prepares.

480
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:15,470
It was during the time

481
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,470
I started a regular Osaka program with Higashino.

482
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,510
I think we did it for about a year.

483
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,640
"Yamachan, have you heard of rakugo?"

484
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,540
"Yamachan, have you heard of rakugo?"

485
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,610
"Have you ever listened to Shijaku Katsura?"

486
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,620
"Sorry, I've never listened to it."

487
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,650
"If you listen to it once, you'll find it interesting."

488
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,260
Sorry for interrupting your story,

489
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,930
I need you to get changed so I can use the oil.

490
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,000
Is that ok? Yep.

491
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,000
Is that ok? Yep

492
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,330
The boxers he got from Tanaka

493
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,630
Those boxers.

494
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,630
Ahh!
Those boxers!

495
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:46,070
In an instant, he changes and gets ready for the massage.

496
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,780
Let's continue the interview where we left off.

497
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,180
You talked about how Higashino

498
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,180
recommended listening to rakugo but

499
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,080
what did you listen to?

500
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,320
No, because Higashino recommended it to me

501
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,560
I went to "ＴＳＵＴＡＹＡ"...

502
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,420
"Shijaku's Complete Works"

503
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,860
"Shijaku's Complete Works"

504
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,860
I rented a volume of it.

505
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:15,700
I said, "Rakugo is this interesting!?"

506
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,770
"Eh! This is what rakugo feels like?"

507
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,280
Because of this characteristic,

508
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,280
I began wanting to do it.

509
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,710
I thought, "Huh, now you mention it,

510
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:35,190
"I think Hachimitsu said he had an interest in rakugo."

511
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:46,430
Tsukitei
Hachimitsu

512
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,820
I called him and said, "Honestly, your rakugo...

513
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,630
"How do you do it?"

514
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,960
"Housei, I'm a professional storyteller (rakugo)."

515
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,430
"Housei, I'm a professional storyteller (rakugo)."

516
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:53,300
He said to his father,

517
00:19:46,830 --> 00:20:02,010
Tsukitei
Happo

518
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,300
"Housei wants to do rakugo."

519
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,810
And every month there was a study group thing and

520
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:02,010
I was finally able to participate in the study group.

521
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,220
What did you learn from your teacher, Happo?

522
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,120
As a teacher, it was about 2 years,

523
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
As a teacher, it was about 2 years,

524
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,990
at that time...

525
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,190
"I'll try to get you into the Kyoto Rakugo Association."

526
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,960
"Ah! Sorry, thank you very much!"

527
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,170
After I became a member

528
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,170
the surrounding families changed their discerning eye too.

529
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:32,310
After I heard about it

530
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:32,310
I realized the huge battle my teacher did.

531
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,980
A certain group were definitely opposed to it.

532
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,650
A certain group were definitely opposed to it.

533
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,720
A guy that wasn't studying fair and square.

534
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,830
But... my teacher fought a huge battle for me.

535
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:48,830
But... my teacher fought a huge battle for me.

536
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:55,630
Lastly he said,

537
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,630
"If Housei does something wrong, I'll quit."

538
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,570
Your teacher himself said that?

539
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,940
Well...

540
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,670
Until then this world...

541
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,210
Um...

542
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,250
Huh?
He's overcome
with emotions...

543
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,550
What the hell,
you're crying!

544
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,790
This is emotional,
huh?

545
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:22,130
No, entering the rakugo world and this comedian world,

546
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,400
up until then....

547
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,270
What a dirty
tear!

548
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,470
He's looking this
way while getting
an oil massage!

549
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,740
What the hell!
Enough already!

550
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,410
This is a

551
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,210
This is a
disgusting
picture!

552
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,080
Even though you say
it's an emotional thing,

553
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,620
this is definitely
not emotional!

554
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,630
He's talking about
his teacher with
half of his ass out.

555
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,700
He's already
sleeping.

556
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:05,800
Housei falls asleep in the middle of his memory of his teacher.

557
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,770
You're lying!

558
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,770
You're lying.

559
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,800
You've gotta
be lying.

560
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,340
Uwa, uwa....

561
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,070
Housei~

562
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,880
Housei?

563
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:16,280
He fell asleep while
crying about his
teacher's story!

564
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,920
Are you kidding?

565
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,320
As I thought, the memory of your teacher, Happo...

566
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,120
What a dirty
picture!

567
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,260
Housei, more and more...

568
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,760
Housei~

569
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,570
Scary...

570
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,830
Scary.

571
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,810
Uwa, uwa!

572
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,310
This is
too scary!

573
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,510
Housei-san, are you alright?

574
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,350
It's like he's
a ghost.

575
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:59,820
The massage finishes and he goes to the bathroom.

576
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,150
With this the massage is finished.

577
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,490
Like this, he goes to the bathroom.

578
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,970
How's your throat?

579
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,840
My throat hurts a lot.

580
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,300
What time is it?

581
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,010
2 AM.

582
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,010
2 AM?

583
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,740
I've been talking for 17 hours already.

584
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,780
17 hours huh.

585
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,520
NEXT WEEK

586
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,720
There's nothing more to ask?

587
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,160
The 24 hour long interview sequel!

588
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,920
What did I say?

589
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,260
Housei, can you please wake up?

590
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,830
We come close to knowing all of Tsukitei Housei!

591
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:48,810
Challenging an unprecedented record, the fate of Housei is!?

592
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,970
Challenging an unprecedented record,

593
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,970
the fate of Housei is!?

594
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,740
Oi, it's the morning.

595
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,510
Uwa, uwa...!

596
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,310
This is too scary!

597
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,310
It's like he's a ghost.
