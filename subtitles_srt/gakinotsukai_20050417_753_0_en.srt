11 years?
- That's right

35
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,100
And yet the atmosphere feels unusually heavy

36
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,160
Well it's... most times it's like this

37
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,700
How about our past scores?

38
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,000

Yeah, that's right

47
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,840
His face feels weird right now

48
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,760
You know, now we're having this sort
of opening talk before it starts

49
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,760
And this whole situation

50
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,590
It kind of

51
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,090
Feels weird, doesn't it?

52
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,050
Come on

53
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,760
You can tell Yamazaki's envy for those
who are younger than him is a real deal

Oh, I see

68
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,830
Ever done this before?

69
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,430
Not even once

70
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,790
But feel free to do it anytime

71
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,790
Are you really sure?

72
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,220
When you get them wet they're so bad

73
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,120
Yeah I know

74
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,080
I mean

75
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,200
It's not even funny

76
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,450

77
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,000

82
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,840
What if you actually don't come here for like half an year?

83
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,620
No way

84
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,220
They'll think it's a farewell

85
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,550
Or else we could

86
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,380
Leave him here and the rest of us should leave

87
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,540

00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,550
I wonder if that guy is actually fine

91
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,160
I shouldn't have put him in charge

92
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,290
Man, I'm sorry

93
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,630
It didn't go as well as I thought it would

94
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,700
It went bad again?
- I'm sorry

95

Katsura Kobunshi (the real deal)

96
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,330

罰金 = fine (1000￥)

98
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,910
I put you in charge of this rakugo show, man, do it properly

99
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,810
But it's been so long since my last time I got nervous and---

100
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,620
No way...
- It'll go better tomorrow

101
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,620
As if I'm letting you have a tomorrow
- No please, wait

102
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,920

Beep

106
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,410
He didn't even say he's sorry, geez

107
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,670
That's unfair, teach

108
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,080
Apologize, man

109
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,760
Even if you say so, I mean...

110
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,260
Bunchin would have never done that

111
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,260
Katsura Bunchin, senior rakugoka

112
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,760
That was so unfair!!

113
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,260
Yeah, man
- That's playing dirty

114
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,600
Oh boy...

115
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,500
Not fair

116
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,380
You can't bring him here, come on

117
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,800
bottom text: All the money will be devolved to charity

118
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,240
Yeah, it was such a dirty move

119
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,080
What the hell, man

120
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,710
It felt like a skit for the finale, didn't it?

121
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,630
Yeah, that's right!
- But it was his first one

122
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,830
I actually met him before recording, in the tea house

123
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,730
Really?
- Yeah, just before

124
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,250
I was like "G--good morning!!"

125
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:08,680
Is that so?

126
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,910
He was like "stay calm" but I really wasn't

127
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,830
I sort of panicked

128
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,010
So sweet~

129
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,550
Hahahaha

130
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,080
So sweet!

131
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,660
Very sweet

132
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,080
"Sweet"

133
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,080
Come on, toss em in

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,040
It was your fault, Heipo

135
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,640
Yeah, your laughter

136
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,540
Just be quieter, man

137
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,420
WORLD FAMOUS HEIPO

138
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,290
Give us a break, please
- I'm sorry

139
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,200
It was so absurd

140
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
I think he was using it wrongly too

141
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,340
Everyone's showing an human appearance here so I can't tell...

142
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:04,260
Parody of famous manga "Gegege no Kitaro - Spooky Kitaro"

143
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,670
If only they would show me their spirit appearance...

144
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,880
Shit...

145
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,800
Kitaro!

146
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,160
Yes?

147
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,010
Listen, Kitaro

148
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,200
Between them there's a spirit which tormented me

149
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,580
Got it, I'll look for him

150
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,250
Yeah

151
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,050
Oh?!

152
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,960
It's him!

153
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,330
Ah! It's him! Go get him!

154
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,030
Take him out!

155
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,030
Beat him up!

156
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,340
PRODUCER - KENJI SUGA

157
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,660
Get him for good!

158
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,360
Come on!

159
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,760
We did it, Kitaro!

160
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,370
Thank you so much, Kitaro!

161
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,770
Let's go now

162
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,870
That kid had nothing to do with it

163
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,660
You're right

164
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,330
This is incredible...

165
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,080
What's going on?

166
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,620
This guy's great
- He choose Suga, we're weak to him

167
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,620
Even his face...

168
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,260
bottom text: All the money will be devolved to charity

169
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,250
You're right

170
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,850
He was right next to me, wasn't expecting it

171
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,200
I saw him so abruptly

172
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,830
Is there something to do?

173
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,540
I wonder...

174
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,010
They're here after all...

175
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,050
Kaori! Akko!

176
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,050
Come here

177
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,000
Unbelievable!

178
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,000
Here's Downtown

179
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,200
Incredible! They're the real deal!

180
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,340
Don't be loud, they always said it's
no good to speak aloud about private stuff

181
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,000
Can we get an autograph or such?

182
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,790
Do you really think it's ok?

183
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,290
I think that's one of the thing Hitosh--- Matsumoto hates the most

184
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,370
Ok but...

185
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,720
You said you slept with him, am I right?

186
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,920
You shoudn't say that aloud

187
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,220
Comedians hate so much girls who can't read the atmosphere

188
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,920
Hitosh--- Matsumoto always said that

189
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,580
But you said...

190
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,650
You got home with Yamazaki and Tanaka last time

191
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,950
But you were with us, Jun

192
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,950
Don't talk about stuff like that here

193
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,550
Hitosh--- Matsumoto said it's not good, really

194
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,700
I also remember last time you said you got home with Endo

195
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,530
For real?

196
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,300
You're wrong! I was just talking to him

197
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,450
Are we? But...
- You said that yourself, Jun

198
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,050
Don't be so mad at me, dude, that's what I hate the most...

199
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,050
He says "ore" (pronoun only used by males)

200
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,050
Come on, Jun-chan!

201
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,040
I told you before

202
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,040
You had sex with him?
- I told you not to talk about this

203
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,830
Hitoshi---- Matsumoto, I'll see you later

204
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,030
Make up your mind, dude

205
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,230
That was hilarious

206
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,230
He normally calls him "Hitoshi"

207
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,290
Even in public

208
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,060
And now it was "Matsumoto"
- Incredible

209
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,580
That's really impressive

210
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,580
This is amazing
- He also said "ore"

211
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,050
This is incredible!
- Amazing, look at this!

212
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,670
If he keeps up this pace, he might beat Bob Sapp

213
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,670
- Yeah, he can

214
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,760
It's Rai Rai Ken

215
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,590
First ramen-house enstablished in Japan (1910)

216
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,010
We have no vegetable noodle soup for ya to eat here!!

217
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,910
It's Rai Rai Ken

218
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,460
We have no sweet-and-sour-pork for ya to eat here!!

219
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,750
It's Rai Rai Ken----

220
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,800
There's none!

221
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,200
It's Rai Rai Ken

222
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,210
No, we're not a bowling

223
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,870
It's not a bowling place

224
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Someone was faintly laughing all the way

225
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,100
It was the staff

226
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,290
Outside this office?

227
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,790
Come on, guys on the back...

228
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,910
It was funny how he gradually pronounced "Rai Ken" better

229
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,910
You noticed that? It was more clear as time passed

230
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,790
He wasn't sure about that character yet
- Must be that

231
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,330
(unrelated small talk)

232
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,330
He looks strong
- Yeah, I think he is

233
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,830
Excuse me

234
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,830
'Morning

235
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,340
I wanna beat Hamada up...

236
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,330
But I can't just do it

237
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,000
What should I do?

238
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,130
Should I ask him?

239
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,830
Oh, hello

240
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,700
Sorry to disturb you, and thanks

241
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,660
It's Komoto

242
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,840
Well, it's that...

243
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,550
I want you to beat someone up again

244
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,960
It's Hamada

245
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,010
From Downtown, yes

246
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,210
Nickname of Takahashi Teruhide, japanese actor

247
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,210
No, not "Shouei", it's Hamada, yes, sorry

248
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,870
Thank you, sorry for this

249
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, thank you

250
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,660
Thanks for coming

251
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,160
Hey, Hamada

252
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,580
Yes?

253
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,000
What have ya done to our Komoto?

254
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,540
What?

255
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,510
Have ya been

256
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,340
Fiddlin' around with his butthole...?

257
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,200
Mmnfff

258
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,840
Dontcha dare

259
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,670
Underestimate us Kansai people!

260
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,290
I'm sorry

261
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,090
Mppffg

262
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,080
Thank you

263
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,120
Sorry for the bother

264
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,450
So irritating...

265
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,450
Man...

266
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,620
He got you good

267
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,370
'Cause he came right at me

268
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,380
bottom text: All the money will be devolved to charity

269
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,070
His denture was moving all the time

270
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,960
It didn't seem attached
- It's like it didn't fit

271
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah, but it's expensive

272
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,250
(unrelated small talk)

273
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,250
I see...

274
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,200
Upsadaisy

275
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,060
This works just fine

276
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:37,840
The portable CD player is playing "Eccentric Shonen Boy" by Hamada
(from Gottsu Ee Kanji), but it keeps on looping its intro all over

277
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,330
Maybe if I touch it...

278
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,860
Just go away, geez

279
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,000
Woah, look at this

280
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,900
Woah, amazing!
- That's a lot

281
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,950
Incredible

282
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,050
It's really something

283
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,160
Do you think he made it?

284
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,300
Four, five... sixty thousand

285
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,760
It's 63'000 yen

286
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,960
JICHO-KACHO KOUMOTO JUN'ICHI:
TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY: 63'000￥

287
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
So he scored 63'000 yen

288
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,460
Incredible

289
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,290
And that means

290
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,250
He's now on first position

291
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,420
NUMBER ONE SCORE IN SHICHI-HENGE HISTORY

292
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,080
Oh, Teacher!
- Thanks for coming, teacher!

Yeah, it was incredible

303

307

Also, the way Yamazaki glanced at him as he got inside...

308
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,910
Just quit it, man
