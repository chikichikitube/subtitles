It was bound to happen

00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,200
This is where things start to change...

73
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,700
Yeah, you're right

74
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,530
Damn, that road is long...

75
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,900
Yeah it is

76
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,170
That's going to hurt...

77
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,170
There are some which really stick out too...

78
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,980
But if you're healthy and all, it doesn't hurt right?

79
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,910
But none of us are really healthy...

80
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,910
I see...

81
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,480
I see, he's going to walk alongside him

82
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,350
You can't just walk at your own pace

83
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,490
You have to walk with the Dad

84
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,820
So you can't run away

85
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,360
In order not to be a pain to the people around them, they must not make any noise

86
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,820
That's horrible

87
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,200
So the Dad will walk on that side

88
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,160
Yeah

89
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,160
Yeah

90
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,250
What the hell is this?

91
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,390
He's actually doing it pretty well...

92
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,820
Yeah I know

93
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,390
He did it pretty well...

94
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,460
You're kidding me...

95
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,200
You did well

96
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,430
You're healthy, huh?

97
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,430
Didn't it hurt?

98
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,570
A little bit

99
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,570
He didn't shout

100
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,640
Just a tiny bit

101
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,540
Amazing...

102
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,900
He didn't make a noise

103
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,140
I know

104
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,140
I would never have been able to...

105
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,270
That was like seriously...

106
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,640

141
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,580

Hey man...

150
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,640
I can't do this

151
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,640
It's dangerous to move

152
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,210
I'm feeling so much pressure from it!

153
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,170
Like seriously

154
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,810

What do I do?

159
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,880
There is quite a bit of a pause...

160
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,880
That's true

161
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,690

What...

163
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,390
I will hold him back

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,460
Why is he just...

167
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,200
The pause is just so long

168
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,370
Is there some kind of thing the timing..?

169
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,040
of the monkey?

170
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,440
Just hit me straight away...

171
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,440
See...

172
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,910
It's because you keep moving

173
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,910
This is like really bad

174
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,350
But like seriously, this is an animal

175
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,350
It's because you move

176
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,650
It's bad

177
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,450
It's because you move

178
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,450
No, before I wasn't...

179
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,320
Go down?

180
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,320
Just go down

181
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,120
Isn't that even more dangerous?

182
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,090
It'll be fine

183
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,090
Shozo, hold him from behind

184
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,090
I did it like this

185
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,730
in the no-laughing special...

186
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,700
Okay, hold my hand then

187
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,360
Okay then

188
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,370
On my knees?

189
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,370
On your knees...

190
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,670
Don't move too quickly or else

191
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,740
Damn, wait...

192
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,210
This is...

193
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,750
You've got to be quiet

194
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,580
This is yeah...

195
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,280
This is scary

196
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,550
Nothing you can do about it

197
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,360
Shall I close my eyes?

198
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,590
Sit here?

199
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,920
Don't move

200
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,890
This is scary...

201
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,100
But Shozo had to do this as well...

202
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,860
Wait, what, what do you want?!

203
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,100
Wait, who did that on my shoulder just now?!

204
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,100
It was him!

205
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,370
It was him!

206
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,370
That scared me!

207
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,570
He pushed here really hard

208
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,570
That was amazing

209
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,140
He did accidentally

210
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,410
He did it here...

211
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,960
Thank you! Sorry about him!

212
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
He looks pissed...

213
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,090
I would hate to do that

214
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,000

We haven't tampered with it or anything

We haven't done anything

Seriously

249
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,540
You took it yourself

250
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,610
If you could lie here

Yep, like that

Here you go...

00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,080
Surely this is enough...

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,950
You're right

257
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,120
Is it tight?

258

Please have a firm grasp on it

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,490
It'll all come at once

please look at this picture of pretty flowers...

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,490
Mikihisa was throwing up so much there...

267
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,360
Couldn't help it

268
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,230
That was scary though

269
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,230
You can do it however you want

270
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,140
But seriously...

271
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,770

00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,980
Yeah

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,780

Yeah. You going to choose the same one as before?

Yeah

318

It's a library, please be quiet

395
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,760
What the hell are you doing?

396
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,830
Housei-san...

397
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,830
I'm sorry

398
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,230
What the hell are you doing?

399
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,360
This is the last one

400
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,700
Old Men
Sneezing

401
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,870
Oh hell no

402
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,000
Old Men
Sneezing

403
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,100
What is it?

404
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,530
This is the worst

405
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
This is the worst

406
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,100
Old Men
Sneezing

407
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,100
This is the worst one

408
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,640
Old Men
Sneezing

409
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,370
This one is just a no-no

410
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,470
Old Men
Sneezing

411
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,070
Old Men
Sneezing

412
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,240
Let's not do this one...

413
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:45,010
Please man... This is so bad...

414
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,950
I think I hate this one the most

415
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,310
I definitely don't want to

416
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,310
Mentally, it kills you

417
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,910
But once we get this done, it's over

418
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,850
This is the last one... Concentrate...

419
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,220
Last one...

420
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,990
Last one...

421
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,990
But seriously...

422
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,320
This one...

423
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,320
Yeah, I get you

424
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,530
This one is just a no.

425
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,400
Shall we do it one at a time?

426
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,400
One at a time?

427
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
So in order?

428
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,100
Damn, you're good at this

429
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,570
Hamada

430
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,340
You're so lucky

431
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:09,400
Hamada

432
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,340
He's out

433
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,770
Who's going next? Tanaka?

434
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,240
May I go?

435
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,510
Yes!!

436
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,950
Well done

437
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,580
Tanaka

438
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:21,750
Tanaka

439
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,950
Get in!

440
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,520
Yama-chan, you want to go?

441
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,590
I'm begging you, please, please...

442
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,960
Don't get it...

443
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,960
Okay

444
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,530
Who do you want to get it?

445
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,030
Him (Endo)

446
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,600
Housei

447
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,160
Housei

448
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,570
He's done it

449
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,670
Mikihisa-san, you should go next

450
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,610
No, I don't think

451
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,610
You go

452
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,610
You just don't know now...

453
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,770
Matsumoto-san?

454
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,770
Who's going first?

455
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,680
Mikihisa...

456
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,780
Me?

457
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,580
Please just pick the card though..

458
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,620
But if he doesn't pick it here, you guys...

459
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,320
I know, I haven't had to do anything yet

460
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,320
That's true

461
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,550
But seriously, please

462
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,060
I will pick the one which I least want to pick

463
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,060
I see

464
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,220
I see

465
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,890
YES!

466

468
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,660
Wow, amazing

469
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,230
It's one or the other!

470
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,930
You don't know yet

471
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,700
Who's going first?

472
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,700
Matsumoto-san first?

473
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,270
You going first?

474
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,440
Rock, paper, scissors?

475
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,080
Rock, Paper...

476
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,080
I will

477
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,080
You're going first?

478
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,650
If you are safe, it's Matsumoto-san

479
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,520
So pick one.

480
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,520
Flip it on three

481
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,520
I'm begging you

482
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,460
Right then...

483
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,830
Yes...

484
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,830
Ready, set

485
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,430
Pick one

486
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,470
Flip it on three

487
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,470

492
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,400

493
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,640
Yes...

494
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,640

Shh

502
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,850
Get in!!!

503
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,290
Shozo, you are something else!

504
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,220
I'm so happy

505
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,920
Get in!

506
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,360
Change with me...

507
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,220
Shozo, your luck is just...

508
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,330
This one is so bad

509
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,830
Endo...

510
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,830
This is...

511
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:21,130
Endo, I will give you 10,000 Yen!

512
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,500
No

513
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,340
10,000 yen: I'm saying I will give you 10,000 yen

514
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,270
I'm saying 10,000 yen...

515
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,270
Matsumoto-san...

516
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,340
Here he comes

517
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,810
He's looking at you so much, he's locked onto you

518
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,550
What's he going to do?

519
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,650
This is so bad

520
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,420
Stood up?

521
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,930
This is...

522
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,230
This is what happens...

523
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,620
Oh man

524
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,020
Damn

525
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,130
This is just

526
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,960
This is

527
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,300
This is harsh

528
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,440
That was disgusting

529
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,050
This is mentally

530
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,220
This is the worst

531
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,150
It is

532
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,150
Mentally...

533
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,420
When you think you're going to get it, you get it.

534
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,360
I know, right?

535
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,060
You just know when it's you...

536
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,790
When you have a bad feeling, you always get it.

537
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,000
You're so right

538
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,900
I was convinced I was going to get the last one...

539
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,830
You were so against it too...

540
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,600
I just knew it...

541
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,900
That was the best final punishment...

542
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,740
In a different sense...

543
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:19,550

First up is Hamada's ghost story

553
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,290

An old woman...

558
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,470
I see...

559
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,530
An old woman...

560
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,730
And old woman and...

561
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,900
An old woman and...

562
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,640
Oh, scary...

563
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,640
That's perfect

564
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,870
A hospital...

565
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,340
Shall we choose one more?

566
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,210
Yeah, let's do three..

567
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,210
I agree.

568
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,680
As a special treat...

569
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,680
These 2 are easy to do..

570
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,250
A special treat...

571
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,750
Suspension bridge...

572
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,750
Suspension bridge...

573
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,920
Oh man...

574
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,190
But you know, let's choose one more...

575
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,190
It's a special treat after all...

576
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,190
That's right

577
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,960
A French doll...

578
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,230
This is, wow...

579
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,230
You got so much potential here

580
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,760
You can do this

581
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,760
What a treat...

582
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,400
Well...

583
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,400
It's about an old woman acquaintance of mine

584
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:16,410
It's about an old woman acquaintance of mine

585
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,880
Old woman acquaintance?

586
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,480
That's quite weird, no?

587
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,450
You're right

588
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,920
Sorry, she's this person I know's grandma...

589
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,820
So this person's grandma...

590
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,820
Oh right, I see...

591
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,620
And old woman, right?

592
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,620
Yes..

593
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,630
And she's a bit old so she's starting

594
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,000
And she's a bit old so she's starting

595
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,430
to become a bit forgetful...

596
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,300
and so she's going to a hospital kind of

597
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,970
and that kind of place

598
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,970
kind of?

599
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,340
In a hospital...

600
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,080
and her family put her in one

601
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,580
If she's at home, she wanders so it's a bit dangerous

602
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,520
If she's at home, she wanders so it's a bit dangerous

603
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,490
And so

604
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,490
that old woman

605
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,090
is always holding this French doll

606
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,760
is always holding this French doll

607
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh man, why?

608
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,560
That's because

609
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,800
She's becoming forgetful so she thinks that it's

610
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,340
her newborn daughter...

611
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,470
and she holds this the whole time

612
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,280
and she was like this at home, so that's why they put her in a hospital.

613
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,280
That's so scary

614
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,950
at the hospital, in the corridor or wherever

615
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,880
at the hospital, in the corridor or wherever

616
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,020
even when it's light out, she holds this French doll and just walks about

617
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,080
even when it's lights out, she holds this French doll and just walks about

618
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,220
and they say "Oh man, that old woman is gone again"

619
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,420
So they start being like "Oh man, she's escaped her room and wandered off again"

620
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,730
And this carried on for days...

621
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:46,330
And this one time, they searched the whole hospital, but they couldn't find her.

622
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,730
but it's a hospital in the countryside...

623
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,540
so there was this really big suspension bridge

624
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,610
and if you cross this bridge, you can go into town.

625
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,270
But they thought "Oh no, what if..."

626
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:01,480
"Surely she hasn't escaped the hospital and crossed that bridge"

627
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,550
That is dangerous

628
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,680
and when they ran to the suspension bridge to look

629
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,520
she had fallen...

630
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,890
There it is, again

631
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,860
She fell again?

632
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,620
Your character always fall over...

633
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,530
The suspension bridge isn't important then!

634
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,830
She hasn't crossed the suspension bridge then!

635
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,070
She hasn't crossed it, whilst she was crossing it

636
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,970
She fell?

637
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,970
Yeah

638
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,670
She wasn't like going up stairs though...

639
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,270
That's serious

640
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,270
What an incident...

641
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,610
Housei's ghost story

642
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,610
Unseen footage

643
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,610
Housei's ghost story

644
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,610
Unseen footage

645
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,140
Next up is Housei's ghost story

646
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,680
Tell me when to stop

647
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,620
Stop!

648
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,620
OK.

649
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,620
First up

650
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,920
A rusty door...

651
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,830
Top! Ah...

652
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,530
"Top..."

653
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,000
Erimo Misaki

654
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,070
Note: Erimo Misaki is a place in Japan but, also a song sang by Mori Shinichi

655
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,370
Erimo Misaki, huh...

656
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,870
Stop!

657
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,800
He's going for three...

658
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,810
Another suspension bridge

659
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,810
There it is again

660
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,910
It's come again

661
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,810
This is good

662
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,950
How many do you want?

663
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:11,080
I did 4, so he should do 5

664
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,080
That's true

665
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,080
Let's do 5 then

666
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,220
Stop!

667
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,150
Vinegared mackerel

668
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,150
vinegared mackerel...

669
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,860
Vinegared mackerel...

670
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,260
Stop!

671
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,260
Wow, a fifth one?

672
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,360
5 would be amazing

673
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,430
It would be amazing if you did 5.

674
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,430
That's amazing

675
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,200
Hide and seek.

676
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,200
Hide and seek...

677
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,370
That's a mix...

678
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,370
Right then, with this

679
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,270
A rusty door, Erimo Misaki, a suspension bridge, vinegared mackerel and hide and seek...

680
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,640
I mean you are

681
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,470
a rakugo-ka after all...

682
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,170
Yes

683
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,940
Please

684
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,940
So please make it a good one

685
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,210
But please make it a really scary story...

686
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,510
I will.

687
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,510
Please do

688
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,550
But not too long either.

689
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,810
I will make it a short and scary story

690
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:47,750
This is about when I went with my family to Erimo Misaki

691
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,920
Do you know of it?

692
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,730
There are loads of suspension bridges there

693
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,930
Oh really?

694
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,930
Yes

695
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:01,470
And when we got there and we crossed them

696
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,500
We were like "what shall we do?"

697
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,140
We were like "shall we play a good game of hide and seek?"

698
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,870
With your kids?

699
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,870
Yes

700
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,840
so we did

701
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,210
I became the seeker

702
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,950
because I am the father

703
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,580
I said "are you ready?"

704
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,020
and they replied "Not yet"

705
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,520
Are you ready? Not yet... are you ready?

706
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,890
We are ready

707
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,890
So I started looking for them but I couldn't find them at all!

708
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,860
But none of them were there and I was like "what's going on?"

709
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,030
huh?

710
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,940
Why aren't they here, I can't find them at all

711
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,370
And of course I won't find them

712
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,180
It was the first time I've ever been to Erimo Misaki after all...

713
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,610
What the hell is that style of story telling...

714
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,610
I know

715
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,280
That's not how you tell a ghost story...

716
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,520
And when I was walking for a while,

717
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,120
there was a door, a really rusty one

718
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,690
It was really rusty

719
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,190
So I thought "oh, my kids are definitely in here"

720
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,160
so I pushed the door

721
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,430
but it wouldn't open at all, because it's so rusty

722
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,540
So I thought "what!?"

723
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,510
I thought "if this doesn't open, I will be the seeker forever!"

724
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,010
Is that the real problem here?

725
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,810
Yeah...

726
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,880
That's a weird way to think...

727
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,350
I thought "I want to hide too, not seek forever"...

728
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,920
You really hate seeking that much, huh?

729
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,550
Eventually, I looked in

730
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,220
there were some mackerels there...

731
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,530
You're kidding me, right?

732
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,030
They were stuck

733
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,660
To that rusty door?

734
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,660
Yes

735
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,570
And then

736
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:47,470
the mackerel was caught to the door and therefore became a "Shime-saba"

737
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:47,840
(NOTE: SHIME CAN MEAN CAUGHT, HENCE THE PUN ON WORDS)

738
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,410
So the mackerel was caught and was a "shime-saba"

739
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,850
Anyone can do it...

740
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,680
It didn't escalate at all...

741
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,680
Yeah...

742
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,690
Anyone can do it...

743
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,220
I see...
