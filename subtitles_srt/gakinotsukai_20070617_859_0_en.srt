00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,760
Apparently so...

20
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,760
Surely we can't do it?

21
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,530
But if we all try our best,

22
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,560
maybe we can beat her

We can do it!

28
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,070
No no no no!

29
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,020
But you know, just with the regulars

30
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,900
it would be a bit too tough

31
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,930
Yeah

32
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:32,940
I see

33
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,850
So we

34
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,010
get Vacuum Fujiwara today...

35
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,850
Thank you very much

Vacuum-san!

41
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,100
The Vacuum!

42
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,370
Hello Vacuum-san!

43
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,050
What is the reason he is called Vacuum Fujiwara!?

44
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,340
The man who just sucks up his meals, Vacuum Fujiwara

45
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,730
Narrator Chihiro Tago

46
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,730
On the episode "Eat snacks with rice", Fujiwara...

47
00:00:44,160 --> 00:01:03,710
Aired 5th November 2006

48
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,220
Last year in November, in an episode where they had to eat loads of rice

49
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,610
Fujiwara dominated

50
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:50,860
This is good

51
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,060
I bet

52
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,490
It might taste good, but seriously, how many bowls do you want to eat?

53
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:03,710
shoved 9 bowls of rice into his stomach

54
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,540
Everyone suffered,

55
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,710
but this man shoved 9 bowls of rice into his stomach

56
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,330
And this is how Vacuum Fujiwara was born

57
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,780
Whatever happens, I always eat my meals

58
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,350
Whatever happens, I always eat my meals

59
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,220
Whatever happens...

60
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,380
Obviously...

61
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,050
He got dressed up for this occasion today to look special but...

62
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,480
he just looks like Tamori-san from the old times

63
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,750
NOTE: TAMORI IS A FAMOUS JAPANESE TARENTO

64
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,750
he just looks like Tamori-san from the old times

65
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,630
Oh yeah!

66
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,670
That's true

67
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,890
And the person they will go against this time, Gal Sone appears.

68
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,730
Food Fighter

69
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,730
Gal Sone

70
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,730
m 0 0 l 600 0 l 600 210 l 0 210 l 0 0

71
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,510
The fact this girl here eats loads

72
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,660
I know

73
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,090
I just don't see it

74
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,920
Thank you

75
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,710
On a live broadcast this morning, she was eating loads of okonomiyaki as well...

76
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:33,210
she ate 3kg of Okonomiyaki

77
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:33,210
On this morning's "Radical" (TV program)

78
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,240
My stomach is a bit out at the moment; please touch it

79
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,500
See, her stomach is out

80
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,660
Holy shit, that's so scary!

81
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,510
She's like a mermaid

82
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,660
Like "Let me come out already"

83
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,080
Gaki Team

84
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,080

Oogui Battle

86
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,500
This battle

87
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,300
is a 7 vs 1 battle

88
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:50,290
7 meals of 7kg

89
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:50,290
Whoever eats it all first wins!

90
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,530
Whoever eats all 7 meals, weighing around 7kg, first wins!

91
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:58,290
Cake

92
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:58,290

Hamburger

95
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:58,290
Okonomiyaki

96
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:58,290
Sushi

97
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:58,290
Yakisoba

98
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,790
Gal Sone will eat all 7 meals by herself

99
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,790
Gal Sone will eat all of this by herself

100
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,390
The 7 members of Gaki

101
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,390
will aim to eat 1 dish each

102
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,460
Gaki will eat in a relay style, eating one dish each

103
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:04,900
If one of them cannot eat it all

104
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:04,900
Vacuum Button

105
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:04,900
press the button and Vacuum Fujiwara will suck it up for you!

106
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:05,180
However, if you really cannot eat anymore, Vacuum Fujiwara will suck it up right for you

107
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,510
Vacuum Fujiwara is the key

108
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,510
to the outcome of this battle!

109
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,050
So, Fujiwara holds the key to the outcome of this battle!

110
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,110
But Matsumoto-san is awful

111
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,370
Why?

112
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,620
2 hours ago, he ate a meal!

113
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,570
No way!

114
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,310
I know...

115
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,150
Take this seriously, man!

116
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,280
Hamada-san had pilaf an hour ago...

117
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,760
Are you serious?!

118
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,540
What the hell is wrong with Downtown?!

119
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,310
Downtown!

120
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,160
What is wrong with you!?

121
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,420
Seriously!

122
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,360
Do you have 0 kindness!?

123
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,560
Do you have 0 kindness!?

124
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,240
You'd think that!

125
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,470
Right?

126
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,560
This isn't a show where we really give it our all...

127
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:30,930
This isn't a show where we really give it our all...

128
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:31,630
This isn't a show where we really give it our all...

129
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,000
This isn't a show where we really give it our all...

130
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,990
Don't say that!

131
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,510
We need to decide our order

132
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,050
Gaki Team decide their order of eating

133
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,890
So we can only really eat 1 dish each

134
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,350
Am I over here?

135
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,070
That's right

136
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,150
Yes

137
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,540
Hamada-san loves yakisoba though

138
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,400
That's true

139
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,140
If it's something you love, you can probably eat more than usual...

140
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,950
Don't you guys underestimate us

141
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,790
Don't underestimate the over 40's!

142
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,590
Don't underestimate the over 40's!

143
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,480
Yeah, seriously!

144
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,600
Cake

145
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,600
Curry

146
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,600
Endo Shozo

147
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,600
Gyoza

148
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,600
Hamada Masatoshi

149
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,600
Hamburger

150
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,600
Inomoto Takafumi

151
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,600
Matsumoto Hitoshi

152
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,600
Okonomiyaki

153
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,600
Sushi

154
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,600
Tanaka Naoki

155
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,600
Vacuum Fujiwara

156
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,600
Yakisoba

157
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,600
Yamasaki Hosei

158
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,910
Will they be able to eat all 7 meals?!

159
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,100
And lastly..

160
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,590
On our side

161
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,050
Yup

162
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,370
If we can't go any further

163
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,930
Uh huh

164
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,680
We can surrender

165
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:23,820
If either team cannot eat anymore,

166
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:23,820
White flag button

167
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:23,820
they can surrender and end the battle

168
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,690
I see

169
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,740
Surrender

170
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,440
But the only person to press that button should be Vacuum-san, right?

171
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,110
That's right

172
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,720
And Gal Sone, I'm sure you'll be fine but...

173
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,170
That's right, you can press it too if you can't eat anymore.

174
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,570
Okay

175
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,020
But you know

176
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:23,830
I see

177
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,540
Oogui battle

178
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,720
It looks delicious though, when you look from here

179
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,460
Oogui Battle: Start!

180
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,650
Go, Inomoto!

181
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:39,630
First dish: 35 nigiri pieces

182
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,990
The Oogui battle that 7 men challenged the 1 woman...

183
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,060
Starts with 35 pieces of sushi

184
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,150
But damn, this...

185
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,170
It's SO good!

186
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,930
There's a lot...

187
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,670
Yeah?

188
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,340
It's so delicious

189
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,710
You got this...

190
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,130
Yeah?

191
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,940
This one likes to taste her food and eat it.

192
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,370
This one likes to taste her food and eat it.

193
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,440
This one likes to taste her food and eat it.

194
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,450
She's not a super quick eater then.

195
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,920
I kind of lied to you, Matsumoto-san, I said I could eat a fair bit...

196
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,650
I eat about as much as a rabbit...

197
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,320
I eat about as much as a rabbit...

198
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,150
Are you going to be okay?

199
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,790
Do your best, man!

200
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,420
We're counting on you, man; you're the first one up!

201
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,320
Why the hell did you get cocky and go for the sushi then!?

202
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,830
This probably is the biggest plate out of the lot!

203
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,300
Yeah, definitely, it has rice too

204
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,300
Why would you choose this one?

205
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,570
She's already eaten all of the Toro (Medium Fatty Tuna)

206
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,400
Oh I see...

207
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,730
It's so good!

208
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,600
You said before she doesn't eat that fast

209
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,500
But she's not that slow at all...

210
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,870
But she's not that slow at all...

211
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,400
I know, right?!

212
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,110
Yeah...

213
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,840
Her tempo is good...

214
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,870
And that is true

215
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,780
When Gal Sone shoves one of the nigiri into her mouth,

216
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,410
she tastes and enjoys it, but breaks it down quickly,

217
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,550
and in 10 seconds, she moves onto the next piece...

218
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,620
She should be feared!

219
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,520
She's so fast!

220
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,220
1 piece is like...

221
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:37,920
Oi Inamoto. It's not decreasing at all!

222
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,120
Oi Inomoto. It's not decreasing at all!

223
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,660
Oi Inomoto. It's not decreasing at all!

224
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,890
Oi Inomoto. It's not decreasing at all!

225
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,130
Come on man

226
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,530
We're counting on you!

227
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,060
Inomoto!

228
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,730
Are you screwed in the head?

229
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,670
You're first up, come on man

230
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,670
Yeah

231
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,630
Have you come with your family?

232
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,640
Have you come with your family?

233
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,640
Eat some of the white fish too!

234
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Eat it!

235
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,470
Yeah

236
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,610
Look, she's nearly finished!

237
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,740
Eat the squid, the squid

238
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,480
Really?!

239
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,740
Holy shit, she's quick

240
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,550
Eat the salmon roe and squid

241
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,780
We're counting on you

242
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,250
And she's not drunk any water or anything

243
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,050
He's probably thinking, "You fuckers try this then!"

244
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,720
I'm sorry but this is awful

245
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,320
This is

246
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,220
He should be quicker than this

247
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,520
Inomoto, hurry up and eat!

248
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,690
Inomoto!

249
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,130
He's biting so slowly...

250
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,430
Are you at your girlfriend's place?!

251
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,590
Are you at your girlfriend's place?!

252
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,800
He'll eat even slower than this...

253
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,300
Are you worried what her parents might think?

254
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,570
Are you worried what her parents might think?

255
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,640
Excuse me

256
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,070
Shit!

257
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,100
Wow

258
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,040
Can I get some ice cream please?

259
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,110
Can I get some ice cream please?

260
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,510
It's a chaser

261
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,280
It's just filling her up more so it's not against the rules

262
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,410
That's right

263
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,180
About 25

264
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,650
Try eating 25 at least

265
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,750
please

266
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,590
She's about to eat a chaser

267
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,190
Amazing...

268
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,460
What does that do?

269
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,860
She's totally taking the piss out of us

270
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,490
It's so nice!

271
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,690
Yeah

272
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,920
If you eat a dessert mid-meal, the taste changes and it becomes easier to eat

273
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,860
If you eat a dessert mid-meal, the taste changes and it becomes easier to eat

274
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,700
If you eat a dessert mid-meal, the taste changes and it becomes easier to eat.

275
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,760
Excuse me, please get me some ice cream

276
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,760
No!

277
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,400
Think about this

278
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,500
Why!?

279
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,600
You're first up!

280
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,030
You going to be able to eat that?

281
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,300
But the gari (pickled ginger) will be good!

282
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,300
Oh yeah

283
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,130
Yeah, good idea

284
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,570
Instead of ice cream

285
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,740
It will change the taste

286
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,840
It might help with digestion

287
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,740
Don't bring the ice cream please

288
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,370
If you order ice cream and don't eat it, Vacuum-san will have to suck that up too

289
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,510
If you order ice cream and don't eat it, Vacuum-san will have to suck that up too

290
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,410
Please don't eat ice cream then!

291
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:17,220
Gaki Team: Inomoto: 11 pieces

292
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,110
5 minutes since they've started

293
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,450
Inomoto has eaten 11 pieces

294
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,280
Gal Sone has already shoved 25 in her stomach

295
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:17,220
Gal Cone: 25 pieces

296
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,080
The gap between the two keeps increasing

297
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,350
But you're full already, right?

298
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,190
Come on, she's going to finish soon

299
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,020
And she moves onto the next dish?

300
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,130
Yeah

301
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,190
Yeah

302
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,930
So we need to catch up... big time.

303
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,560
What?!

304
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:28,170
HELP ME, VACUUM-SAN!

305
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

306
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,000
Go!

307
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,030
You're kidding me?!

308
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,530
Is it okay to use him so early?

309
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,000
Hurry, hurry!

310
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,100
I can't believe this...

311
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,770
Go for 2

312
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,200
Earlier than anticipated, Vacuum Fujiwara appears!

313
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,770
After this

314
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,770
See for yourself: Vacuum Fujiwara's eating abilities!

315
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,010
This man's appetite is...

316
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,570
Vacuum-san

317
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,140
Vacuum-san...

318
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,140
You eat 2 pieces in one go, huh?

319
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,380
He's definitely going to break his body...

320
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,980
Will you be okay?

321
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,980
You're going to get a fever again...

322
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,220
He definitely will...

323
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,250
You're working tomorrow, right?

324
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,250
2 at a time, you sure?

325
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,320
She has what, 3... 2 pieces?

326
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,920
Can she not eat a bit slower?

327
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,660
Yes

328
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,930
On the other hand, Vacuum-san here is...

329
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,560
He's last anyway

330
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:05,600
35 sushi pieces: 6 minutes 38 seconds

331
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:05,600
Gal Sone

332
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,470
Hold a minute, what the hell is with this?

333
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,930
It's not even competitive in the slightest...

334
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,370
We're like barely halfway

335
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,140
Not a battle at all...

336
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,600
Come on man!

337
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,740
I told you this would happen...

338
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,740
This is bad man

339
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,540
But if you get through this, Hamada-san will destroy the yakisoba

340
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,710
Hamada-san will...

341
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:17,950
Gal Sone 2nd plate: 4 people's worth of Yakisoba

342
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,810
Yeah, let's get through this

343
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,150
He will get us right back on track

344
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,510
Let's count on Hamada-san

345
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,610
But you know

346
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,020
I love ginger too

347
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,920
Vacuum-san...

348
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,490
Give me a second

349
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,460
What's wrong?

350
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,020
Hold on a minute...

351
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,760
When we looked away for a second...

352
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,890
Are you a fucking idiot?

353
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,260
No

354
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,990
You are...

355
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,190
We should be winning, at least on speed...

356
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,730
We should be winning, at least on speed...

357
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,930
We should be winning, at least on speed...

358
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,700
We should be winning, at least on speed...

359
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,760
Definitely, we should

360
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,730
This is so delicious!

361
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,400
Easy to say!

362
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,370
Easy to say!

363
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,230
Hurry up, man!

364
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,970
Yakisoba is delicious!

365
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,840
Oh really?

366
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,010
We might give up without even finishing the sushi...

367
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,040
What should we do...

368
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,680
Be the first time ever...

369
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,780
Vacuum-san

370
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,910
Come on, man

371
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,480
All the two of you have done is eat the sushi

372
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,080
All the two of you have done is eat the sushi

373
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,990
All the two of you have done is eat the sushi

374
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,550
I know!

375
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,890
I know!

376
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,250
10 minutes since the start

377
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:03,860
Gaki Team Sushi

378
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:03,860
Gal Sone Yakisoba

379
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,190
Gal Sone is already halfway through the yakisoba

380
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:06,260
The Gaki Team just has to finish the heavy on the jaw, squid sushi...

381
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,100
Can you not just swallow it down?

382
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,440
CAN YOU DO IT?!

383
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,440
Note: Since he is Hosei's junior, shouldn't say omae as it isn't polite

384
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,000
Don't say "Omae"

385
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,670
He's your senpai, man!

386
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,210
Vacuum decides to separate the squid

387
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,310
And plans on only eating the rice

388
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,210
You're not Vacuum-san at all!

389
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:23,850
You're not Vacuum-san at all!

390
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,980
You're not Vaccum-san at all!

391
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,250
This is just normal...

392
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,990
He's not sucking up anything!

393
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,460
He's just the everyday

394
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:30,960
old guy chilling with a hostess

395
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,620
old guy chilling with a hostess

396
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,230
old guy chilling with a hostess

397
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,830
Just a normal bloke

398
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,500
He's going to finish the sushi about the same time she finishes her dish...

399
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,800
She's nearly done with the yakisoba

400
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,530
Who the hell gave you the nickname "Vacuum-san"

401
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,370
YOU FUCKERS DID!

402
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,200
Coro-coro, Coro-coro

403
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,170
Note: Talking about how he can't suck anything up

404
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,170
Coro-coro, Coro-coro.

405
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,670
Yeah he's right

406
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,370
You really are...

407
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,280
Why do you have to be such a disappointment?

408
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,180
Just the squid left now

409
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,450
She easily finishes the yakisoba

410
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:00,290
4 people's worth of yakisoba: 12 minutes 58 seconds

411
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:00,290
Gal Sone

412
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:00,180
In just under 13 minutes, she flushed 2kg worth of food into her stomach

413
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,020
Vacuum!

414
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,290
Vacuum!

415
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,190
Here comes the next one!

416
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:10,060
Gal Sone 3rd dish: 5 servings of hamburger

417
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,620
This looks delicious!

418
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,190
Damn, it's huge!

419
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,030
How is it in the centre? It better have been cooked right through.

420
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,700
It's fine, absolutely fine

421
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,100
It's so thick

422
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,870
I know...

423
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,600
Do I have to finish this?

424
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,870
There she goes...

425
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,670
Of course you do!

426
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,540
So delicious!

427
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,440
Obviously you idiot!

428
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,570
Hurry up and eat the squid, stop eating it 1 at a time!

429
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,810
Come on man!

430
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,810
Just go for it!

431
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,910
Eat them both at once

432
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,540
Come on

433
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,110
I can't eat as much squid as I thought!

434
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:24,740
I can't eat as much squid as I thought!

435
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,880
I can't eat as much squid as I thought!

436
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,750
What the hell man..?

437
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,480
Gal Sone tastes and eats the food...

438
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,620
You don't sense she is struggling at all with all this food...

439
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,060
You're putting on way too much soy sauce!

440
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,720
If there were legs, you wouldn't be able to eat that

441
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,260
The taste would be too strong

442
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,130
35 pieces of sushi: 14 minutes 23 seconds

443
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,130
Gaki Team

444
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,270
Hamada-san, we are counting on you!

445
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,630
We are counting on you!

446
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:56,140
Gaki Team 2nd dish: 4 people's worth of yakisoba

447
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:54,610
They finally finish the sushi, and now Hamada takes on the yakisoba

448
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,080
Will he be able to close the gap?

449
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,580
Go for it

450
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,780
Great!

451
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,720
This is what I am talking about

452
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,420
This right here!

453
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,890
Amazing, just as we expected

454
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,420
And... he's stopped...

455
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,790
Hang on, you had one mouthful!

456
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,630
He ate a bit too much on his first bite...

457
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,630
Come on!

458
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,800
Are you serious?!

459
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,400
That was a bit quick

460
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,500
At least this part!

461
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,500
He just took a bit too big a bite on the first one, give him a second...

462
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,370
That was a bit quick...

463
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,240
A bit quick to be drinking water...

464
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,440
Yeah, isn't it?

465
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,210
You shouldn't drink too much water

466
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,110
Just before, I had a beef pilaf with Suga-chan...

467
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,640
Just before, I had a beef pilaf with Suga-chan...

468
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,280
Just before, I had a beef pilaf with Suga-chan...

469
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,710
Just before, I had a beef pilaf with Suga-chan...

470
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,080
What the hell...

471
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,910
Why did you eat a beef pilaf?

472
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,450
Suga-san, why didn't you stop him? You knew we were going to do this today...

473
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,450
I know...

474
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,990
It's not going down that slowly...

475
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,520
It's good

476
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,560
Oh dear...

477
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,560
He put his chopsticks down...

478
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,960
He put it down...

479
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,500
He looks like he's in hell...

480
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,300
He looks like he's in hell...

481
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,970
You cannot press the button whatever happens...

482
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,300
That's right

483
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,800
You already ate that much?!

484
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,500
That's amazing...

485
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,570
Your lips are so  fucking shiny...

486
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,080
Your lips are so fucking shiny...

487
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,540
Honestly, it's quite disgusting to look at...

488
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,580
You guys eat this then! You'll get shiny lips too!

489
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,250
Naa...

490
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,320
20 minutes in

491
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,620
Something happens to Gal Sone's body

492
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,490
Here, something strange happens to Gal Sone's body

493
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,260
You're going to undo your belt?

494
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,260
Yes, just loosen it a bit

495
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,320
Just take your pants off

496
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,860
Maybe it IS tough for Gal Sone-chan too...

497
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,230
Maybe it IS tough for Gal Sone-chan too...

498
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,530
Maybe, yeah.

499
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,630
I wonder, let's just observe for a while longer.

500
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,840
Yeah, let's do that

501
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,770
He's got the weird sweats...

502
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,600
Holy shit

503
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,040
I totally feel you

504
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,240
He's sweating so much

505
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,470
Yeah...

506
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,770
The weird sweats...

507
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,410
This hamburger is so nice!

508
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,440
He said, "I can't"

509
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,210
Don't look him in the eye...

510
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,710
Yeah, don't

511
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,980
Don't look at him

512
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,280
Don't look at him, Inomoto!

513
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,020
Don't look him in the eyes.

514
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,350
Don't do it!

515
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,280
He was saying something.

516
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,520
Don't!

517
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,990
He touched me!

518
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,150
He touched me!

519
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,220
Something touched me right here...

520
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:51,820
No no...

521
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,790
Shit, it stinks!

522
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,590
Just your imagination

523
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,060
Maybe put some mayonnaise on.

524
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,100
It won't do anything!

525
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,200
You've only eaten one person's worth...

526
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,770
Yeah

527
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,270
You really are...

528
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,700
That's good, if I ate one person's worth

529
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,700
That's not enough

530
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,710
What the hell is wrong with this? It's not coming out that well!

531
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:10,980
What the hell is this?!

532
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,710
But if you put too much on...

533
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,650
She's nearly finished the hamburger, just the carrots left

534
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,950
Don't you ever say you love yakisoba again...

535
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,960
He was saying "I'm going for it" at the beginning..

536
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,830
What happened to the pace at the start?

537
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,100
5 servings of hamburger: 21 minutes 19 seconds

538
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,100
Gal Sone

539
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,800
Gal Sone eats 3kg worth of food in less than 22 minutes.

540
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,200
This...

541
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,200
There's no way we can win

542
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,430
This is bad

543
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,310
HELP ME, VACUUM-SAN!

544
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,000
HE'S PUSHED IT!

545
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,040
Okay!

546
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,410
Here's where it really begins, Vacuum!

547
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,570
Go get it!

548
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,110
His second appearance, Vacuum Fujiwara reappears!

549
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,120
Gal Sone 4th dish: 3 people's worth of curry

550
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,820
Gal Sone tackles the 4th dish, 3 people's worth of curry.

551
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,890
Uh oh...

552
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:57,760
The image of Vacuum I've become accustomed to seeing

553
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,530
The image of Vacuum I've become accustomed to seeing

554
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,420
This freezing part right?

555
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,030
I see him like this often

556
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,230
But Vacuum-san, isn't the yakisoba really easy to eat?

557
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,860
But Vacuum-san, isn't the yakisoba really easy to eat?

558
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,860
Is it?

559
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,570
Your answer isn't "Yes, you're right"?

560
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,370
Damn, this is amazing

561
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,370
Look at the pace she is going at!

562
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,080
This is seriously bad!

563
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,810
She's getting into it

564
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,750
Yeah...

565
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,150
The curry has lots of meat and veg in it, so it's delicious

566
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,180
The curry has lots of meat and veg in it, so it's delicious

567
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,650
For real?

568
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,820
Is she serious?

569
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,820
Amazing...

570
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,590
Vacuum-san!

571
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,120
He's like seriously...

572
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,050
Vacuum!

573
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,090
Vacuum-san!

574
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,520
Vacuum Fujiwara not functioning at all

575
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,620
Vacuum!

576
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,890
Vacuum-san

577
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,330
he's just scooping it up and putting it back

578
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,160
This is it

579
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,360
I got it, let's just keep rotating then

580
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,900
Yeah

581
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,100
Eat a bit, and then

582
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,800
Then rotate

583
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,940
Gaki Team

584
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,940
Change the rules so they can keep rotating

585
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,970
Gaki Team changes the rules so they can keep rotating so the battle goes on.

586
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:53,480
After this

587
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:53,480
Matsumoto makes a miracle happen!!

588
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,080
And finally, Matsumoto appears. Will a miracle happen?!

589
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,410
Get out, Vacuum-san. Matsumoto-san, go

590
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,580
Let's have Vacuum rest.

591
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,790
They change the rules, and Matsumoto goes for his first attack

592
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,850
Will they be able to make a miracle happen here!?

593
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,650
Just as expected...

594
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,360
Here we go

595
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,560
Amazing

596
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,490
We need to hurry up, she's already done with her hamburger

597
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,030
I know

598
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,660
Should we eat till we're full?

599
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,560
We just keep rotating

600
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,360
Rotate?

601
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,500
Yeah, otherwise we can't win

602
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,100
Yeah, let's do that

603
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,240
You're not that fucking fast!

604
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,310
He got SO angry at him!

605
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,210
OI

606
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,340
Do you have to get that angry?

607
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,110
Apparently so...

608
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,650
You're lips are fucking shiny too!

609
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,420
It &£(*£(*...

610
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:31,950
What?

611
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,690
It won't go down...

612
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,890
She's finished the curry!

613
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,290
The curry!

614
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,390
She's basically done

615
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,160
Shit

616
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,490
Yama-chan, swap in

617
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:41,760
Zaki-san!

618
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,060
Let's just keep rotating

619
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,600
It's hard.

620
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,570
I see...

621
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,510
You're just moving your hands!

622
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,010
Come on...

623
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,210
There's no point in gathering it all to the centre

624
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,940
There's no point in gathering it all to the centre

625
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,050
You got to eat all of that!

626
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,480
Is there a point in doing this?

627
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,950
He's trying to show he's doing something

628
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,620
He's trying to make it look like...

629
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,350
That was delicious

630
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,920
She's already done

631
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,330
3 people's worth of curry: 24 minutes 50 seconds

632
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,330
Gal Sone

633
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,220
Can we not just eat the next dish together?

634
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,260
Didn't the curry disappear like really quickly?!

635
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,630
To counter the super speed Gal Sone ate the curry

636
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:21,530
Rule change- they can all eat together!

637
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,370
Gaki Team changes the rules and eat the food together!

638
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,870
Gal Sone seems comfortable and starts on the 10 people worth of cake

639
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Gal Sone 5th dish: 10 pieces of cake

640
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,870
Good

641
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,340
You're doing well

642
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,410
Cocorico are doing well

643
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,740
Okay, great.

644
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,180
We're done

645
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,580
4 people's worth of yakisoba: 25 minutes 49 seconds

646
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,580
Gaki Team

647
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,540
Good

648
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,150
Endo, sit and keep eating!

649
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,850
There it is

650
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,250
Go, Endo!

651
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,120
His mask slips...

652
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,820
Go, Endo!

653
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,350
Come on, cut it up

654
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,950
Cut it up, okay.

655
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,160
Yeah, cut, cut

656
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,790
Gaki Team 3rd Dish: 5 servings of hamburger

657
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,290
Go go.

658
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,360
It's huge!

659
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,560
Cut it so it's easier to eat

660
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,990
This is really big!

661
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,790
Make sure it's easy to eat

662
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,100
Let's go one piece per person

663
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,170
Let's go one piece per person

664
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,200
Yeah?

665
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,070
Please?

666
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:03,040
Gaki Team - Hamburger

667
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:03,040
Gal Sone - Cake

668
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,210
Still..

669
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,040
That isn't the last dish right?

670
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,110
We've still got curry

671
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,340
Go for that one.

672
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:04,810
Why is Vacuum-san not eating at all?

673
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,480
Why is Vacuum-san not eating at all?

674
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,150
Why is Vacuum-san not eating at all?

675
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,080
Vacuum!

676
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,010
What the hell?

677
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,320
Yama-chan, don't take the small pieces, take one of the huge ones

678
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,120
I've got a small mouth...

679
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,950
I've got a small mouth...

680
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,060
I'm eating so much of this...

681
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,090
What the hell...

682
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
Let's go

683
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,190
Damn, they're fast

684
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:22,930
Really?

685
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,890
Half each then

686
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,600
I'm getting really full now...

687
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:28,600
You finish up

688
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,370
You can do this

689
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,330
Endo, keep going

690
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,370
Me?

691
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,200
Go

692
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,170
We're done

693
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,070
5 servings of hamburger: 27 minutes 30 seconds

694
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,070
Gaki Team

695
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,210
Gaki Team, finally finish their 3rd dish

696
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,040
Here we go

697
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:40,880
Shozo, go alone for now

698
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,210
Shozo, go alone for now

699
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,950
Let us rest up for a second.

700
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,250
Gaki Team 4th dish: 3 people's worth of curry

701
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,350
I feel like I'm doing Vacuum's job

702
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,490
No no...

703
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,420
That's true

704
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,920
Come on, man

705
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,820
Come on Endo

706
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,960
He's taken over

707
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,260
Endo-san, you eat a lot, huh?

708
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,460
You know,

709
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,960
I actually did this 8 years ago (Oogui)

710
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:56,890
Just eat.

711
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,230
Jesus, man, who cares if I just explain it quickly?

712
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,760
Jesus, man, who cares if I just explain it quickly?

713
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,270
Jesus, man, who cares if I just explain it quickly?

714
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,600
Endo-san, come on

715
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,770
30 minutes since the start

716
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:13,540
Gal Sone's pace hasn't slowed down

717
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:13,180
Gal Sone's pace still hasn't decreased, and she's eating the cake very quickly

718
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,910
She really does eat a shitload...

719
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,380
Does this woman's stomach not have a limit?

720
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,850
Vacuum, swap in for me.

721
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:27,660
HELP ME, VACUUM-SAN!

722
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,090
You should still be okay to go

723
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,190
You can just eat this real quick

724
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,420
Yeah

725
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,590
It should all just go in real quickly

726
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,630
You need to show us your worth here

727
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,760
I was so full before...

728
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,660
Like literally

729
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,470
Hey, if you leave that much rice, is the balance going to be okay? (between rice and sauce)

730
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,370
Hey, if you leave that much rice, is the balance going to be okay? (between rice and sauce)

731
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,700
Hey, if you leave that much rice, is the balance going to be okay? (between rice and sauce)

732
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,640
Right?

733
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,370
You do love your rice

734
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,670
Come on

735
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,540
She's really something else though...

736
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,140
I know

737
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,840
It's nice to watch.

738
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,880
Yeah, it really is

739
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,780
That all goes in her...

740
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,310
He stopped again...

741
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:50,850
Not again...

742
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,020
Vacuum-san stopped again...

743
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,650
Just some random boy now.

744
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,250
Keep going, man

745
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:55,790
You look like one of theold men outside...

746
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,250
You look like one of the old men outside...

747
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,520
You look like one of the old men outside...

748
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,120
He's completely ignoring the potatoes

749
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,830
What are you planning on doing, leaving all those potatoes to the side?

750
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,230
He threw it to the side...

751
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,000
You're never going to be able to  escape from the reality of potatoes

752
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,970
You're never going to be able to escape from the reality of potatoes

753
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,540
You're never going to be able to escape from the reality of potatoes

754
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,840
It's bad our pace has gone down now

755
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,310
Who?

756
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,350
Who?

757
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,010
Who?

758
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,810
You're Vacuum-san!

759
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,880
Who?

760
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,610
You're giving the sunglasses?

761
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,420
Vacuum-san!

762
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,190
You don't become Vacuum-san if you wear the sunglasses you know?!

763
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,750
Come on, finish it

764
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,390
He started eating again...

765
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,690
Of course

766
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,260
Of course, this is awful

767
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:35,930
That whole cake...

768
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Let's go

769
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,230
Hold on?

770
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:37,800
What?

771
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,800
Next is Okonomiyaki

772
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,630
Just okonomiyaki and gyoza...

773
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,200
Just them

774
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,730
She really eats so much

775
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,470
Yeah

776
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,370
Amazing

777
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,810
This isn't fake like at all as well...

778
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,640
Nope

779
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,440
Amazing

780
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,880
It's delicious

781
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,410
Yeah?

782
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,880
Delicious?

783
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,040
Still at this point?

784
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,910
It's amazing she can still say that

785
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,710
She can still say that...

786
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,380
Gal Sone eats the 10 people's worth of cake with no problem

787
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,850
10 people's worth of cake: 33 minutes 42 seconds

788
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,850
Gal Sone

789
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,750
Meanwhile, Vacuum, who is not responding...

790
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,590
What are you going to do?

791
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,060
Are you serious?

792
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,360
Vacuum-san?

793
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,360
Are you serious right now?

794
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,690
Amazing..

795
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:14,870
Gal Sone 6th plate: 5 people's worth of okonomiyaki

796
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,200
Oh yeah

797
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,700
She's killing us

798
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,870
Put whatever you want on

799
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,640
Good good

800
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,300
Oh here we go

801
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,540
He's just moving his hands about loads

802
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,970
I know

803
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,240
So true

804
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,640
I know

805
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,140
He's just trying to show he's eating a lot...

806
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,180
He just looks fast...

807
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,620
So many unnecessary movements...

808
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,420
Yeah

809
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,320
That's no good!

810
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,350
Don't muck around!

811
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,990
Don't!

812
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,450
We can't have that!

813
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,190
Yama-chan, you won't hold out like that

814
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,960
You've only had 3 mouthfuls...

815
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,160
I'll eat all the rice

816
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,260
All the rice?

817
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,760
Wow, good stuff

818
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,230
Man, whilst we were talking, she's like nearly halfway through hers...

819
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,630
Damn

820
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,930
Amazing

821
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,330
Right, here we go

822
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,070
Good

823
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,270
Damn, the cake will be tough

824
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,340
I don't like cake...

825
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,810
Good stuff

826
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,080
Finished?

827
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,710
3 people's worth of curry: 36 minutes 43 seconds

828
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,710
Gaki Team

829
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,350
Yamasaki does well and finishes the curry

830
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:09,520
Gaki Team 5th plate: 10 people's worth of cake

831
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,520
Tanaka loves cake

832
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,820
Oh really?

833
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,450
Yep

834
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,360
You're just moving your hands and not eating that much!

835
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:12,960
Oh yeah

836
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,960
You're just eating the cream

837
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,530
Come on, eat up

838
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,100
40 minutes from the start

839
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,340
Gaki Team's "altogether" tactic is working and, even though only a bit, the gap is starting to decrease

840
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:27,140
Cake 1/5

841
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:27,140
Cake DONE

842
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:27,140

843
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:27,140
Curry DONE

844
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:27,140
Gaki Team

845
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:27,140
Gal Sone

846
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:27,140
Gyoza

847
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:27,140
Gyoza

848
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:27,140

849
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:27,140

850

Yakisoba DONE

855
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:27,140
Yakisoba DONE

856
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,900
However...

857
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,040
Gal Sone's pace has not dropped, even now

858
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,080
You've only eaten like 2 or 3 pieces at this point...

859
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,360
Inomoto, you go

860
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,690
Inomoto, go

861
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,400
Damn

862
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,860
After that, Yama-chan will go

863
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,800
Inomoto, eat it all

864
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,100
You can do this

865
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,140
You can do it all!

866
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,040
Vacuum-san hasn't said a word in about 20 minutes

867
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,640
Vacuum-san hasn't said a word in about 20 minutes

868
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,270
Vacuum-san hasn't said a word in about 20 minutes

869
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,580
Vacuum-san hasn't said a word in about 20 minutes

870
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,240
Are you okay?

871
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,480
Vacuum-san?

872
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,040
Vacuum-san?

873
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,010
She's only one mouthful away...

874
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,410
Wow!!

875
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,780
Shall we eat altogether?

876
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,480
Yeah, let's

877
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:16,220
5 people's worth of okonomiyaki: 42 minutes 6 seconds

878
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:16,220
Gal Sone

879
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,850
Gal Sone, in just over 40 minutes, has eaten 6kg worth of food

880
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,890
Amazing

881
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,690
Yeah

882
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,890
One mouthful is so nice

883
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:27,630
Gal Sone 7th plate: 7 servings of Gyoza

884
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,790
Gal Sone moves onto her final dish

885
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,060
Jumbo Gyoza!

886
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,400
However, here...  A problem arises.

887
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,800
It's a bit too hot, I can't eat it yet

888
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,100
It's a bit too hot, I can't eat it yet

889
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,200
Right?

890
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,970
It's really hot

891
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:38,610
They've found her weakness!

892
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,740
A strange weakness is found on the final dish!

893
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,580
This is the final chance for the Gaki Team

894
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,940
Gaki Team's final chance!!

895
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,150
Oi oi!

896
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,220
Hold on...

897
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,890
What's this?

898
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:49,990
Seriously, what's with him?

899
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,160
Yeah man

900
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,360
After this

901
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,360
Can the Gaki Team produce a miracle?

902
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,660
He was doing some show in the other studio, no?

903
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,460
Whilst Gal Sone is waiting for the Gyoza to cool down

904
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:04,100
10 people's worth of cake: 44 minutes 49 seconds

905
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:04,100
Gaki Team

906
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,930
The Gaki Team finish their 5th plate

907
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,470
Damn, this gyoza is amazing

908
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,540
This is amazing, filled right up

909
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,740
Damn

910
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,540
This is amazing

911
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,440
That is tough

912
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,210
This is really amazing

913
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,040
Damn that looks tough

914
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,410
This is amazing

915
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,650
And now, Gal Sone

916
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,420
has started eating the final dish

917
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,220
Gaki Team 6th plate: 5 people's worth of okonomiyaki

918
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,090
Fujiwara reappears for Gaki Team's 6th plate, okonomiyaki.

919
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,600
Go, Vacuum!

920
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,130
Go go!

921
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,700
Vacuum-san?

922
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,740
What the hell are you doing?!

923
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,440
You definitely haven't eaten like 9 bowls worth of food today...

924
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,850
I have...

925
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,050
He's angry again...

926
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,650
Are you angry again?

927
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,620
But you know, I am done now...

928
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,490
Me too

929
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,760
Me too

930
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,090
All that's left is if he pushes this button or not

931
00:22:59,090 --> 00:22:59,490
All that's left is if he pushes this button or not

932
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,930
All that's left is if he pushes this button or not

933
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,030
I see

934
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,530
Oh yeah

935
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,130
Either that, or she finishes

936
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,630
Or the white flag

937
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,300
I see

938
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,460
I see

939
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,600
I wonder if she'll finish

940
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:19,040
BATTLE OVER

941
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:19,040
GAL SONE WINS!

942
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,610
Wow wow wow wow...

943
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,550
What??

944
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,780
What about our feelings?

945
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:23,750
Yeah

946
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,180
What about our feelings?

947
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,990
I don't give a shit about your feelings...

948
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,390
Were you at your limit much earlier on?

949
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,560
I was pretty damn full after the sushi...

950
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,830
After the sushi?!

951
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,590
That's the first one!

952
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,560
The first one?!

953
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,530
Seriously, don't you EVER say you're a vacuum to me again

954
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,500
Yeah man!

955
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,700
Give us a break!

956
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,870
Quit now on that stupid dream of yours!

957
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,740
It ends here!
