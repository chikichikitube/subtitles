00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,000
The Future Century
Squadron: The Five Rangai!

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,640
Coming.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,620
Wait. I don't come here
to molest you today.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,300
I come here to meet some people.
-You do?

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,760
But why in my apartment?
- Please.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,260
It's 8:30.
They'll be here in any minute.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,140
I'm watching TV.
- I'm sorry.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,900
There's no way around.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,940
I have to attack you.
Otherwise they wouldn't be here.

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,500
That's ridiculous!
-Sorry, I have no choice.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,780
Gotcha!

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,980
Help!

13
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,360
Stop it!

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,180
Red Rangai!

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,180
Yellow Rangai!

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,360
Green Rangai!

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,560
Citrus Rangai!

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,440
Citrus!

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,200
Our powers combined!

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,780
The Five Rangai!

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,380
Come on! Run now.
- Thank you.

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,940
Hey Citrus!

23
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,160
Yeah.

24
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,180
Our powers combined!

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,420
The Five Rangai!

26
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,020
No, you're not.

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,520
You are so wrong.
You don't get it!

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,640
What hell is this?
-Citrus

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,660
You?
Citrus Rangai!

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,040
At least you are a Rangai.

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,840
You are not even a Rangai.

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,780
Right.

33
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,860
Obviously, you weren't listening to
what I said last week, were you?

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,780
What? -You heard me.

35
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,620
Red, Yellow, Green,
you guys are OK.

36
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,040
Zip up!

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,000
No problem with 3 of you.
What the hell are you doing?

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,440
You're the one who said
we need to change. Deal with it.

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,860
Who do you think
you are speaking to!

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,300
Sit your ass down.

41
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,740
Sit!

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,020
All I'm asking is
just doing the job!

43
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,960
We aren't even
near fighting stage.

44
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,700
But you said we shouldn't look
the same last week, right? - I did.

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,140
None of us 2 look the same this time.
-You 2 are the same!

46
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,000
2 Citrus!
- No, Citrus and Citrus Rangai.

47
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,600
Ok. Let's forget the fact 2 of you
look like a twins for a moment.

48
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,060
What about the tights?

49
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,340
Hello? What about you?
- Shut up!

50
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,540
Should I wear tights too?
- No, you idiot!

51
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,320
Please just tell me what you want.
-You are all right, Green.

52
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,560
Didn't I tell you that
you shouldn't look the same?

53
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,980
Hey!

54
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,120
What you're saying
is, like...

55
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,660
Citrus Rangai should've
come out first and I last?

56
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,160
That's not what I'm saying!
I'm saying you can't look the same.

57
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,360
That's not what I heard. Your fault.
- Don't give me that sass!

58
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,360
What did I do...

59
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,860
You didn't get it
last week.

60
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,860
You were only pretending.

61
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,920
What? You mean...
I'm the one to be blamed?

62
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,320
Because you are the leader.

63
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,300
Oh, are you the leader?

64
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,720
You are Red.
- He is the leader.

65
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,000
So you are the leader.
Then you have to be Red.

66
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,080
But what about me?

67
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,700
No. I'm talking about...
Are you retarded?

68
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,000
Red is the leader.
That's the rule for this kind of show.

69
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:06,100
From my experiences,
Red is usually the leader.

70
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,900
And you are not, right?
- No.

71
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,900
So he should be Red.

72
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,040
Then...I should be... Citrus?

73
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Forget Citrus.

74
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,560
So. You're saying
I should be Red?

75
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,740
Exactly.

76
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,680
I haven't told you this because
I don't know how you'd take it, ...

77
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,980
but we intended to
differentiate by our weapons.

78
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,860
Really?

79
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,060
We decided we express ourselves
by using different weapons.

80
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,460
That is true.

81
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,060
Some people seem to like that.

82
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,780
They do?

83
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,720
Why don't you show me
your weapons then?

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,160
Let's start with that. - OK.

85
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,700
What you got?
- I have this. A boomerang.

86
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,960
I like this. Not bad.
Not bad at all.

87
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,980
How about you?

88
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,440
An bow.

89
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,460
Why green?
- Same as the leaf.

90
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,100
You?

91
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,520
A heart.

92
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,480
Why green!
Why heart green!

93
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,640
Next!
- Red Rangai.

94
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,600
Green again!
This is insane!

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
You! Show me.

96
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,860
What the hell is this?

97
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,880
A stick.

98
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,600
I know what it is.

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,460
All right! We painted
all our weapons green.

100
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,120
Why do you have to be
such a stinger?

101
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,200
Who do you think
you are talking to!

102
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,200
Why?

103
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,200
No same color!

104
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,780
You broke...

105
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,780
You got something?!

106
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,560
I'm giving you advice.

107
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,400
Differentiate!

108
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,000
You have to think it through again,
or we'll never fight.

109
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,860
This is a waste of time.

110
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,760
I'm talking to you.
Look at me!

111
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,440
No Citrus.

112
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,220
I'm afraid
I can't do that.

113
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,200
This is not a suggestion.
No Citrus!

114
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,880
You can't fight
with this thing on.

115
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,560
You jerk!

116
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,100
Say that again?
You throw this out!

117
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,520
Cut it!
Enough.

118
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,240
Just cut it.

119
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,900
Have a discussion
one more time!

120
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,840
- Stop. You're really hurting Citrus.

The Future Century Squadron: The Five Rangai!   To be con't.
