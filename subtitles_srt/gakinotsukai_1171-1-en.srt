00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,760
August 14- With the heatwave of 35°C,

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,320
one of the show's harshest project was taking place.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,000
Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende presents the 1st,

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,000
"It doesn't make sense not to live positively!"

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,760
Negativity Prohibited Tour!!

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,880
DOWNTOWN

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,880
Hamada Masatoshi

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,880
Matsumoto Hitoshi

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,040
I don't get any of this.

10
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,660
Hot,

11
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,660
hot!

12
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,660
So hot!

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,740
That's what we mean...

14
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,180
We've got complaints

15
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,290
COCORICO

16
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,290
Endō Shōzō

00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,290
Tsukitei Hōsei

22
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,200
from various people.

23
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,480
Eh, no way!

24
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,480
I've never even made a complaint before,

25
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,480
idiot.

26
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,140
And he just keeps on going!

27
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,150
Considering their career,

28
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,150
the amount of negative remarks is just amazing.

29
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,800
We've collected some proof

30
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,040
and put together in this short clip,

31
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,040
please take a look!

32
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,540
These are events that happened before the show's recording.

33
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,220
It's slightly cold

34
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,220
in here.

35
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,920
I always feel like

36
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,920
I'm going to catch a cold

37
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,620
by staying in this room.

38
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,840
He's really at it.

39
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,840
Totally~

40
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:01,160
While he could have stopped at "it's slightly cold",

41
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,160
Matsumoto just keeps on complaining.

42
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,940
Matsumoto keeps on complaining about the temperature during other recordings as well.

43
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,330
Ah, so hot

44
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,330
and humid.

45
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,000
It's so friggin' dry in here.

46
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,900
So dry.

47
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,420
It's the season...

48
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,330
And even about other things too...

49
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,680
Matsumoto-san is really at it.

50
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,240
Got any water-?

51
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,280
Seriously,

52
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,280
speaking of water

53
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,880
you don't really give me any until I ask for it.

54
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,560
I only ask 'cause they don't give em.

55
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,560
I'm only pointing out the truth here.

56
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,940
So cramped in here.

57
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,020
As such, the members' negativity is undeniable!

58
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,200
We four have nothing to do with this!

59
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,200
It's only Matsumoto-san.

60
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,360
I always think about you guys when I ask for the water!

61
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,620
If I don't ask for it...

62
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,560
Take Endo for an example,

63
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,560
I just feel so sad for him.

64
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,000
Endo could ask for himself.

65
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,140
Endo could ask for himself.

66
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,420
Endo's way too shy for that.

67
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,000
Shy?

68
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,080
Negativity Prohibited Tour is where only positivity is allowed.

69
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,900
While dealing with the various negative traps,

70
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,580
they have to obey to the instructions and visit various places.

71
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,100
At the end of the tour, the person that was the most negative

72
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,340
will undergo a harsh punishment!

73
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,040
So, what about

74
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,040
"So hot!", for example?

75
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,180
"So hot!

76
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,180
but a perfect weather for recording!," for example.

77
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,180
or like, "It's summer time."

78
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,120
Hamada-san, hands in your pocket will be

79
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,120
counted as

80
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,120
negative.

81
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,920
That's quite right.

82
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,920
So this is a negative.

83
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,580
Yes, it's an indication that you're not so positive about today's recording.

84
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,780
Ah alright, so that's a no then.

85
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,420
That was negative too while you were explaining,

86
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,420
Why?

87
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,380
when he was all "Ehhh".

88
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,380
No, no, no.

89
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,040
My apologies.

90
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,900
Yes, that's the way.

91
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,680
That's how you do it!

92
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,740
Well then, for the 1st order...

93
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,200
Here it is.

94
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,500
Change your clothes and get into the car.

95
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,500
Command #1

96
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,540
To take these off so quickly,

97
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,940
wouldn't it be such a waste?

98
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,240
But I'm super happy

99
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,240
about

100
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,240
the change of clothes.

101
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,420
That was great!

102
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,500
Everyone, we'll be starting now.

103
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,580
Here goes!

104
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,780
Negativity prohibited tour!

105
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa

106
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,700
No, no, no...

107
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,020
Is this for real?

108
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,660
That's a nice color.

109
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,120
I love em.

110
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,900
This is making me excited.

111
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,520
I don't even

112
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,520
wear these during winter!

113
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,740
Ah, that was good.

114
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,920
That was good?

115
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,420
Yes, it was positive.

116
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,100
So it's ok for us to put these on?

117
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,680
Let's put these on quickly!

118
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,460
That's great.

119
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,020
It's a nice thing to go first!

120
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,180
I'm showing my motivation.

121
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,960
How nice...

122
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,480
Uwaa, this feels nice.

123
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,740
This is quite a first for us...

124
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,000
doing this...

125
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,680
With the down jackets on,

126
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,620
the three winners of rock-paper-scissors

127
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,860
will get to positively wear a hat, gloves and a scarf!

128
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,900
Well then, please get in the car and begin the tour!

129
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,160
Was it 35°C today?

130
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,600
Yes, it's 35°C.

131
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,500
But isn't this

132
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,500
a bit harsh?

133
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,940
We're sitting wherever we want?

134
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,940
Yes.

135
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,720
Whoa!!

136
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,840
What's wrong?

137
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,900
What's wrong?

138
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,060
I meant, Whoa~ it's huge

139
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,060
inside.

140
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,620
Isn't it the same as always?

141
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,340
Well, I have an idea...

142
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,980
It's really spacious in there.

143
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,580
That's quite the heat.

144
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,580
Ugh, I'm in the middle...

145
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,140
Everyone, please get in!

146
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,280
I'm pumped for this.

147
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,000
Whoa,

148
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,000
wait a sec...

149
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,380
By the way,

150
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,760
I should probably buckle my seat-belt.

151
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,380
it's 40°C right now.

152
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,680
40°C, huh.

153
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,200
We can

154
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,200
do this, right?

155
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,420
Well...

156
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,020
You sure we can do this, right?

157
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,020
Seriously,

158
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,020
can we?

159
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,770
I'm being real here.

160
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,420
This is friggin'

161
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,420
harsh.

162
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,500
You just clearly said it!

163
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,620
He totally said "harsh".

168
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,140
Do we have to put on the seat belts?

169
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,080
Yes, please.

170
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,980
Just say it, then.

171
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,300
That was scary, wasn't it?

172
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,380
Scary, right?

173
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,380
"Just say it", he said!

174
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,140
Whoa.

175
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,140
Damn,

176
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,140
that was so natural!

177
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,300
Hold it.

178
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,900
It's not even negative anymore,

179
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,340
he's just being himself.

180
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
DAMNNNN!!

181
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,540
This'll haunt me in my dreams,

182
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,540
can't believe they're making middle-aged comedians do this.

183
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,800
The sweat from these two,

184
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,800
can you see it?

185
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,780
Hamada-san...

186
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,200
His face is all shiny.

187
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
That's quite the Hamada juice there.

188
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,330
Well, it kinda feels good.

189
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,880
This, this, this... this is the real deal.

190
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,620
The car stops at Yotsuya, while the members take a look at the second command.

191
00:05:51,980 --> 00:06:01,990
Command #2

192
00:05:51,980 --> 00:06:01,990
Walk to Go! Go! Curry and eat lunch there.

193
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
I just love Go! Go! Curry.

194
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,200
It's really delicious.

195
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
There it is.

196
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,000
We're coming in.

197
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,620
Ugh,

198
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,620
stairs...

199
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,160
You don't like walking up the stairs?

200
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,140
The members obey to the command and eat the shop's recommended curry.

201
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,680
However...

202
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,260
Sorry about the wait,

203
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,260
here's your Katsu Curry.

204
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,480
Looks yummy.

205
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,980
Thank you.

206
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,420
And here is our special offer, the extra-spicy Curry.

207
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,180
Looks great.

208
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,200
Please take your time.

209
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,460
Can I?

210
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,500
Go ahead.

211
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,080
Bon appétit.

212
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,560
I'm so thankful for this, I haven't had anything to eat since morning.

213
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,940
Hmm, it's good.

214
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,000
It's good.

215
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,080
So spicy.

216
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,000
Are you being negative?

217
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,400
I mean, so good!

218
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
So it's spicy?

219
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,580
What's so spicy about it?

220
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,060
The sauce.

221
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,180
Is it different from ours?

222
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,860
Totally.

223
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,740
Really?

224
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,200
How different is it, then?

225
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,020
Try a bit of it.

226
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,080
How is it?

227
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,640
So good!~

228
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,480
I know, right.

229
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,040
Bon appétit.

230
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,100
Are you from the New Japan Pro-Wrestling?

231
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,240
You're quite something, aren't you?

232
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,460
Or are you from All Japan Pro-Wrestling?

233
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,560
Moved to another association?

234
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,460
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

235
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,940
I mean, seriously.

236
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,140
Did you put something on?

237
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,340
I haven't put anything on.

238
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,980
The shine is just amazing.

239
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,660
I can't finish this.

240
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,500
Did you apply varnish on yourself?

241
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,740
The members finish eating their lunch and take a look at the next command.

242
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,140
The next command is here! It's the third one.

243
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:24,820
Command #3

244
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:24,820
Ride the car and drive to Odaiba. By the way, you may take off your clothes during the trip.

245
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,820
So far...

246
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,100
Did you hear him?

247
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,400
I did, I did.

248
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,400
"So far", he said.

249
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,120
That was totally negative.

250
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,120
It's not far at all.

251
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,860
Odaiba is just close by.

252
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,080
I said "So far".

253
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,400
Kinda like "So far"!

254
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,440
That's just, "So far"...

255
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,620
You just keep on saying it.

256
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,000
Thank you!

257
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,260
Thank you!

258
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,340
We offer you our heat-and-eat curry.

259
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,440
Please eat it with everyone!

260
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,520
Thank you.

261
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,150
Whoa!

262
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,740
There's heaps of em.

263
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,380
Thanks a lot.

264
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,840
The way you just went "Whoa!" was a kinda...

265
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,100
No, I just meant "Whoa, there's heaps of it".

266
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,600
Please be careful with it.

267
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,220
You've gotta hold it tightly.

268
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,960
It's actually quite heavy.

269
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,660
Thanks for giving us so much.

270
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,060
...enough to be this heavy.

271
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,950
Isn't it hot?

272
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,950
It's so hot!

273
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,420
What happened?

274
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,360
He just completely said "it's so hot"!

275
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,020
That's being negative!

276
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,120
Really negative!

277
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,240
You can't be serious.

278
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,680
The florist asked him "Isn't it hot?" and

279
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,680
he just replied with "It's so hot!".

280
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,140
That's a negative.

281
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,280
Just when everyone is all positive...

282
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,790
Couldn't they just park

283
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,790
the damn car here

284
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,790
while we were eating at Go! Go! Curry?

285
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,790
There it is!

286
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,240
No, I meant that there must be people thinking like that around!

287
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,980
There it is.

288
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,860
1 hour and 30 minutes in since the start and Matsumoto has something to say.

289
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,000
I think this project

290
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,000
is really great.

291
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,160
But seriously,

292
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,050
how about something like rest-time,

293
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,050
don't we get any?

294
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,300
Yes, rest-time...

295
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,920
Can we really get it?

296
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,780
Can you give us just 2 minutes

297
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,780
of rest-time?

298
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,780
Is it alright?

299
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,680
Very well, then rest time for 2 minutes.

300
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,020
The hell is with these boxes at my feet, it's so annoying!

301
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,740
It's so fucking hot.

302
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,960
I mean seriously, this is harsh.

303
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,880
Can we really do this?

304
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,300
My curry was freakin' spicy!

305
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,980
Yes, it was.

306
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,860
I couldn't eat it.

307
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,900
Don't they sell it like that usually?

308
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,740
I think so, but the staff went out of the way...

309
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,540
...made you a special one.

310
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,100
Lemme ride on top on top.

311
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,660
We've been down here the whole time.

312
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,340
on the highway...

313
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,100
Let's go on the highway.

314
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,040
...while riding on top.

315
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,000
You always choose the worst time to do these recordings, idiots!

316
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,820
Stop it already!

317
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,980
So hot.

318
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,340
Sorry but your 2 minutes are up.

319
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,660
Well, however...

320
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,900
But really, what a refreshing tour this is!

321
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,340
Feels so nice.

322
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,840
And the car heads towards Odaiba.

323
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,840
Just what sort of command awaits them there.

324
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:17,880
Command #4

325
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:17,880
Head to the Ferris wheel.

326
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,720
Let's go.

327
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,120
The members obey to the command and walk to the ferris wheel.

328
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,600
However, that man is waiting for them!

329
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,680
This way, this way.

330
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,580
I'll be filming from here on.

331
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,600
This way, this way.

332
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,660
Heipo-san...

333
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,680
Can you really be able to film us properly?!

334
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,680
Yes, no problem.

335
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,080
The members get on with Heipo.

336
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,820
No, no, no!

337
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,840
Get over here already.

338
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,200
It's so cramped.

339
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,880
I'm scared too.

340
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,400
So hot...

341
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,400
125m is crazy.

342
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,600
He totally said it just now.

343
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,880
He said it so casually.

344
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,880
Heipo, can you just record already.

345
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,040
Alright.

346
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,040
I'm filming Hamada now.

347
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,080
Tanaka, I'm sorry but

348
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,140
can you film it instead. I just can't.

349
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,860
I'm scared of looking below.

350
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,780
No, no, I'm

351
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,520
not the one to be filming but....

352
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,000
Since you're especially here for it.

353
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,960
Yes, because you're here for it.

354
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,740
So hot~

355
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,940
I'll just stop filming.

356
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,680
Just now...

357
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,600
He's been complaining this whole time.

358
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,600
Heipo, properly record it.

359
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,240
"So hot.. So hot..."

360
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,640
He's been at it the entire time.

361
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,480
I was wondering what he was on about and

362
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,480
"So hot.. so hot.." is what he's been saying.

363
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,920
You're saying it too, Matsumoto.

364
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,960
You're wrong, idiot!

365
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,080
See, see, see.

366
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,760
This sucks.

367
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,840
Damn, it's scary!

368
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,460
Please take a look below, everyone!

369
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,400
I'm totally fine with looking below.

370
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,720
It's nothing, really.

371
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,880
And the ferris wheel finally reached the top.

372
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,500
Hamada, I can't.

373
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,480
DAMN,

374
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,480
so scary!!

375
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,780
Ah, help me.

376
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,480
Oh shit.

377
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,520
It's really dangerous.

378
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,860
Just stop.

379
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,840
Poot

380
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,320
Poot

381
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,340
Ugh, it stinks!

382
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,840
Please stop it!

383
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,460
You shittin' me!

384
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,330
Uwaa, it stinks!

385
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,780
Just stop it, for fucks sake!

386
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,220
You just

387
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,220
suck!

388
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,820
You can't be doing this!

389
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,540
You can't be doing this!

390
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,540
It's unacceptable!

391
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,280
Damn, it stinks.

392
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,500
STOP IT!

393
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,500
STOP IT!

394
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,500
STOP IT!

395
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,500
STOP IT!

396
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,500
STOP IT!

397
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,720
Uwaa, it stinks!

398
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,560
No manners!

399
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,340
Yeah, no manners at all.

400
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,700
It stinks

401
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,700
and we're so high up.

402
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,780
Help me!

403
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,260
Just amazing.

404
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:54,440
Hahahahahahaha,

405
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,440
I can't take it anymore.

406
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,560
Are you crying or laughing?

407
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,440
Stop, it's scaring me.

408
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,620
Quickly...

409
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,620
what the hell are they doing below?

410
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,720
I wanna get off.

411
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,020
Fuckin'

412
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,020
STINKS!

413
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,660
God, that stinks!

414
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,580
Let me off.

415
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,560
We're going down now.

416
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,560
It's 'cause people are getting off one by one.

417
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,360
Can I get down, please?

418
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,360
I'm so scared.

419
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,400
No, no, no...

420
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,720
Watch out.

421
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,160
What're you doing?

422
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,120
I'm scared.

423
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,900
Have a seat.

424
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,720
It's dangerous..

425
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,220
If you don't sit...

426
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,220
Fuckin'

427
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,220
STINKS!

428
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,660
Stinks so bad.

429
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,550
The fuck is this!

430
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,900
It can't be that bad.

431
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,760
God, that stinks.

432
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,880
It stinks and I'm scared. I hate this.

433
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,660
The hell're you doing Heipo?

434
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,400
I can't see below. I'm still scared!

435
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,100
Please stand up.

436
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,750
I can't not stand up.

437
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,660
Can't not stand up?

438
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,440
Can't not stand up?

439
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,280
What d'you mean?

440
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Are you Fujiyama Kanbi or what?

441
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,240
"I can't not stand up."~

442
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,660
I'm scared.

443
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,780
"I'm scared."

444
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,000
Heipo didn't film anything.

445
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,220
That's right.

446
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,600
Please be careful while stepping out.

447
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Please get off.

448
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,300
Please get off!

449
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,260
Matsumoto-san, please!

450
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,580
You bet I'm getting off.

451
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,480
Help! I hate this.

452
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,180
I can't do it.

453
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,000
God,

454
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,000
that was so annoying!

455
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,620
I'm serious!

456
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,620
Open it!

457
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,820
He's really going again.

458
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,120
I can't do this.

459
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,020
The 5 members get in the car again, and take a look at the last command.

460
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,340
Command #5

461
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,340
Eat Chanko-nabe in a restaurant.

462
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,340
Chanko?

463
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,420
My stomach...

464
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,940
Huh?

465
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,140
What d'you mean?

466
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,180
I simply said "my stomach".

467
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,180
That's why I'm asking why you're saying as such.

468
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,120
Sorry, we've got an additiona
command from Liscence.

469
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,180
Additional?

470
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
Where did they go?

471
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:57,660
Additional command!

472
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:57,660
Play shiritori with only positive words.

473
00:15:51,260 --> 00:16:56,360
Note: Shiritori is a word-chain game. It ends when a player says a word that ends in 'n' character because there are no words that start with 'n'.

474
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,550
Best

475
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,550
sa-i-ko-u

476
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,550
Happy

477
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,550
u-re-shi-i

478
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,770
Nice

479
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,770
i-i-ne

480
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,380
ne?

481
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,620
Taking a long time there.

482
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,680
3,

483
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,960
H-H-Hold on...

484
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,680
2,

485
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,500
With ne?

486
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,680
1

487
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,360
So long.

488
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,440
Sleepy...

489
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,440
ne-mu...

490
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,240
Sleepy?

491
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,200
So negative.

492
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,160
There's more...

493
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,960
There's more to it.

494
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,440
Sleepy?

495
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,960
'Sleepy' ain't good.

496
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,480
Endo. that's...

497
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,980
I did stop at 'sleepy' but there's more to it.

498
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,000
Really?

499
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,160
What is it?

500
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,450
Not sleepy at all.

501
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,450
ne-mu-ku-na-i

502
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,520
Ugh, that recover sucked.

503
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,200
Hold on...

504
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,700
That was shit.

505
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,780
What the hell was with the recover?

506
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,960
Are there any word that starts with ne?

507
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,420
I hate negativity!

508
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,420
ne-ga-ti-bu-wa-i-ya-da

509
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,360
I can't believe
you used
"negative"
there.

510
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,120
This guy sucks!

511
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,440
But this one is probably on the same level as everyone else.

512
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

513
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,080
It was so bad.

514
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,540
Note: ...because Endo used an English word "negative" to start his sentence just earlier.

515
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,220
How about in Japanese?

516
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,890
A cat's ears...

517
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,890
ne-ko-no-mi-mi-ni...

518
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,080
What?

519
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,700
How ironic!

520
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,700
ne-ko-ni-ko-ba-n

521
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,700
How ironic!?

522
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,360
Shit, it ends in n.

523
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,600
Oh shit!

524
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,140
You lost the game.

525
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,280
You ended the game.

526
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,500
If that was me, I'd kill myself.

527
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,960
3 hours since

528
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,960
the start of the tour.

529
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:38,080
The positive shiritori is still on-going, with Endo, fighting for last place.

530
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,120
They'll be given their last command in this restaurant.

531
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:47,990
Eat Chanko-Nabe at Saganobori.

532
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:47,990
Last Command

533
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Thanks for waiting.

534
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:58,290
Until the nabe is ready,

535
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,290
please enjoy this raw horse-meat from Kumamoto.

536
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,940
That's awesome.

537
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:06,400
Isn't there any

538
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:06,400
Soy sauce?

539
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,400
I'm sure there is.

540
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,360
Excuse me!

541
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,400
Yes~

542
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,120
Did you call me?

543
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:20,800
Ma'am, how to put it... do you have any kind of Soy sauce to eat with this?

544
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,460
Oh, sorry, Soy sauce. I'll bring it right away.

545
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,590
The hell you sayin'.

546
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,420
You can't say things that like, Hamada-san.

547
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,540
This isn't even about being "negative" anymore,

548
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,800
it's about having good manners.

549
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,500
Ah, I see now.

550
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,700
It's the staff's plan,

551
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,700
to make us say stuff like that.

552
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,200
Did you just hear that?

553
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,580
"It's the staff's plan"

554
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,820
I heard it.

555
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,840
"It's the staff's plan"!

556
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,180
Sounded just like a pirate.

557
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,580
You could just imagine him with a hook instead of his hand.

558
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,340
So scary...

559
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,140
Can't be helped.

560
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,550
She's so slow.

561
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,440
He just said it.

562
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,380
He's at it again.

563
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,720
I mean, come on... it's just Soy sauce!

564
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,340
You can't be saying that.

565
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,960
Judge, please take all of this into account.

566
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,060
That was just...

567
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,100
That was just a normal...

568
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,200
I mean...

569
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,580
I'm not even saying anything special.

570
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,940
The waitress finally brings the Soy sauce,

571
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,940
and the crew begin enjoying the horse-meat.

572
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,500
I can't even feel my fingers anymore.

573
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:46,180
What the... that's so negative, I don't even!

574
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,780
No, no, no, no...

575
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,260
You're just full of complaints.

576
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,860
Hasn't the complaints been increasing since we came here?

577
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,500
Yeah, we should'nt be doing so.

578
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,800
Ah, it's tasty.

579
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,560
Sorry to have made you wait!

580
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,740
And the Chanko-nabe finally makes its appearance!

581
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,620
Ah, thanks.

582
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:08,180
This is what we do best,

583
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:08,180
Curry Chanko-nabe!

584
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,180
But we just had curry earlier.

585
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,640
Seriously,

586
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,640
you're non-stop.

587
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,100
It's just repeating.

588
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,780
That was just amazing.

589
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:21,080
The crew uses their remaining strength and enjoy the Curry Nabe.

590
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,220
It's kinda tepid.

591
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,080
Not really.

592
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,760
Tanaka, please put some more in for him.

593
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,660
I don't know why, but mine was really tepid for some reason.

594
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,440
Give him from the bottom.

595
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,040
It's still

596
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,040
tepid there.

597
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,320
He's going at it like a machine-gun.

598
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,880
Why is he only taking the meat

599
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,880
that looks the worst?

600
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,600
Do your best, Tanaka.

601
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,990
It's alright to put some soup too, for fucks sake!

602
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,040
Why would you take out the soup?!

603
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,400
Do your best!

604
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,560
Hang in there Tanaka.

605
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,320
You were planning on the soup for the last, right?

606
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,390
If that's the case, then why

607
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,390
did you go and separate the soup?

608
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,890
You're freaking slow.

609
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,760
Umm...

610
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,540
I swear...

611
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,770
You're so annoying!

612
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,300
You're really pissing me off!

613
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,880
It's getting scary in here.

614
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,290
You just love that damn horse-meat, don't you?!

615
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,750
What's with you? Right from the start,

616
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,750
you've only been picking on the horse-meat!!

617
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,880
I love them.

618
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,720
Pour him the damn soup already!!

619
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

620
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,770
How long are you gonna take?!

621
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,520
Time to announce the results.

622
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,960
These two have been saying quite a lot of things while cameras weren't recording!

623
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,600
Yes, we have taken everything into account.

624
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,820
Today, the person that was the most negative was...

625
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,860
Matsumoto-san!

626
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,500
Thank you.

627
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,100
What an amazing sight!

628
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,520
First place is Matsumoto!

629
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,060
The other four members couldn't even come close to his negativity.

630
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,380
Ugh,

631
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,380
stairs...

632
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,340
Ride the car and drive to Odaiba.

633
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,340
So far...

634
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,300
That was totally negative.

635
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,540
It's not far at all.

636
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,440
Couldn't they just park

637
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,440
the damn car here

638
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,440
while we were eating at Go! Go! Curry?

639
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,440
There it is!

640
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,980
God,

641
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,980
that was so annoying!

642
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,920
You

643
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,920
just love that horse-meat, don't you?!

644
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,490
What's with you? Right from the start,

645
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,490
you've only picking on the horse-meat!!

646
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,600
And for the most negative person today...

647
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,580
Are you drunk or something?!

648
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,340
No I'm not.

649
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:39,160
While wearing the same clothes, ride the car with the heater on and drive home!

650
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,840
There's no helping it anymore.

651
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,260
Stop it...

652
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,300
Please go home.

653
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,580
since you were the most negative.

654
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,060
What d'you mean?

655
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,180
Since the time at the restaurant...

656
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,080
It was just amazing.

657
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,180
You've gotta be kiddin' me.

658
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,300
Watch out, we're closing the door.

659
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,040
I've drank quite a bit, is it really alright?

660
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,300
So hot...

661
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,580
Great work~

662
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,980
See ya~

663
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,520
It was really hot in there.

664
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,480
As for the rest of us, let us be more careful from now on,

665
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,580
not to make complaints all the time.

666
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,240
I wasn't even

667
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,240
complaining that much.

668
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,640
I was only playing the traditional comedic role

669
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,640
Note: 'tsukkomi' is the role as the 'straight-man' in Japanese comedy duo as the role usually requires one to retort, criticize, verbally and physically abuse the 'boke', the idiot (the other half of the duo).

670
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,340
as the tsukkomi.

671
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,840
It's not even a complaint or anything.

672
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,320
It's not negative at all.

673
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,000
Actually, tsukkomi is a positive thing.

674
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,840
I'm making people laugh with that tsukkomi after all.

675
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,200
And I believe making people laugh is a positive thing.

676
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,400
And they're making it look negative...

677
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,360
then, is tsukkomi negative?

678
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,580
I guess we're not thinking the same way.

679
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,960
So hot in here...
