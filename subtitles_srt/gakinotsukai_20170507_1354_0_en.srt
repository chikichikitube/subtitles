1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,380
A Battle Of Nakedness

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,340
This.........is who I am.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,320
We saw that shocking scene at the New Years Eve Show

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,420
The big applause for actor Harada Ryuuji

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,020
Tonight, he will be one of the chief judges,

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,000
A different face for the comedy industry!

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,740
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende:

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,680
Ryuji 100% Grand Prix!

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,400
This is the second Grand Prix,

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,480
2nd Grand Prix after Sunshine Ikezaki's

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,480
Ah, yes, in that sense it is

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,230
Ryuji is here

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,360
You mean Ryuji is taking part again?

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,360
Indeed

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,240
Ryuji, and Akira ...

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,220
They've been raking it in since last year

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,080
Harada Ryuji and I meet at work a lot

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,960
Maybe even more than Hamada?

19
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,190
Amazing

20
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,830
Tanaka-san?

21
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,080
Where is your partner?

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,080
Yes, it seems he's not here

23
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,060
I think, perhaps,

24
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,640
That guy...

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,200
Can't we force him to take a vacation?

26
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,960
First, the main judges of this competition

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,060
These gentlemen, enter!

28
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,580
In the criminal underbelly of Tokyo, one man strives for peace

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,660
Officer, good work!

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,690
Please, don't forgot about that time with me

31
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,500
Being naked is a marvelous thing

32
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,970
When that convenience store got robbed

33
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,750
Master!

34
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,590
They're doing it

35
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,460
Ryuji Harada

36
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,460
Senpai, what's situation at this scene?

37
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,420
Everyone, I ask you for your cooperation in this matter,

38
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,600
I am...

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,240
A man of these credentials
TN: That's a police badge

40
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,380
I am Detective Marugoshi

41
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,380
Hold on a sec,

42
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,510
Something fell there, pick it up!

43
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,020
Blonde hair...

44
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,770
There's one there too!

45
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,350
Why's this here?

46
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,260
Does he need to jump like that?

47
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,260
Can you think of any blonde haired men?

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,230
What's that? That part-timer who quit had blonde hair?

49
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,120
Senpai, he's the criminal!

50
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,030
Wait a second!

51
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,030
There's someone there!

52
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,740
Stop! Criminal!

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,060
Don't think you can get away

54
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,100
Stop!

55
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,040
Throw away the gun!

56
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,860
I'm not sure what to make of this

57
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,710
Peace Secured!

58
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,860
So that was our two judges - This way please

59
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,790
I wish I had a meal to enjoy this with

60
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,080
Dinner Show

61
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,020
I would go to a restaurant like that

62
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,550
Could you tell us some things to look out for in this contest?

63
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,680
Yes, the gracefulness of the movements,

64
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,460
The originality of the dialogue,

65
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:57,340
And that sense of "Can I see it or not?", that's an important aspect for comedy. That's something that will be judged

66
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,890
But, what about Ryuuji here,

67
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,260
You've got a lot of work this year?

68
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,660
Often, I,

69
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,790
Hitoshi-san and I,

70
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,750
You call him Hitoshi-san? Not Matsumoto-san?

71
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,940
Only you and my wife call me "Hitoshi"

72
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,940
What an amazing relationship you have

73
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,680
2nd Ryuuji 100% Grand Prix!
Who will be the first challenger?

74
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,640
In the criminal underbelly of Tokyo, one man strives for peace

75
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,520
Officer, good work!

76
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,550
I'm Watanabe Yuta, a second generation actor

77
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,220
Akinobu Shinagaya,

78
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,560
and Nishina Masaki, both turned this job down,

79
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,290
I got this offer at the last minute

80
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,880
As befitting a second generation actor of the lowest calibre

81
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,500
You know, a burglary occurred here

82
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,430
His ass is snow white!

83
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,270
What a turn of events, this white ass

84
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:13,840
The victim, Tokomitsu Masayuki

85
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,200
Unemployed until 30 years old

86
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,620
That boy used the hell out of his father's connections,

87
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,820
He came in like a cat burgular

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,440
The MC of "Goji ni Muchu!"

89
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,460
On TV Tokyo's "Ladies 4"

90
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,460
Ah, very nice

91
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,960
Housewives didn't watch either show!

92
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,360
You could call this a graduation,

93
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,570
Although he was just fired

94
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,380
This is the father of that man

95
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,510
So that was touching your dick the whole time?

96
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,680
Kazuo Tokumitsu

97
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,320
Since then, that man took part in another show

98
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,460
And he got married to a female announcer

99
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,860
In a - Marvelous - Hall - in the City

100
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,400
Using his father's money

101
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,300
In any case, he will keep going till his sneakers melt off

102
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,280
Even now, he still gets New Years Money

103
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,840
Wait a minute... who's that over there?!

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,050
On that suspicious man's position - ZOOM IN!

105
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,960
There's no doubt he's the criminal! Stop, criminal!

106
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,900
Don't think you'll be able to get away!

107
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,740
Stop right there!

108
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,740
Throw away the gun!

109
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,780
Stop!

110
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,460
Peace Secured!

111
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,680
Thank you very much!

112
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,760
As expected of an announcer

113
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,560
I'm tearing up

114
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,630
What emotions?

115
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,020
What do you mean?

116
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,290
The rehearsal was so arduous

117
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,290
Was it really?

118
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:21,060
That director Takahashi ... he was honestly working me to death!

119
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,670
We're well aware how difficult it is working under Takahashi

120
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,210
Don't cry!

121
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,360
Does your father know about this?

122
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,110
I haven't said anything about this

123
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,980
If I messed this up,

124
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,040
My dad might stop getting commercial offers,

125
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,460
So I had that pressure as well

126
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,460
Stop crying!!

127
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,620
Surely his musuko's musoko won't put him out of work?

128
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,620
TN: Matsumoto is making a pun here; Musuko = Son and also Musuko = Mistake

129
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,860
Chief Judge?

130
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,860
It was brilliant

131
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,800
The tears that came out,

132
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,570
It was the results of your hard work

133
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,000
If you're gonna cry that much, why do this in the first place?

134
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,720
2nd Ryuuji 100% Grand Prix!
The next contestant is this guy!

135
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:16,980
In the criminal underbelly of Tokyo, there is one man who strives for peace

136
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,980
He should have been the 2nd one

137
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,880
Detective! Good Work!

138
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,070
He's got a nice body now

139
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,970
Last time, I only got laughs because I was unfunny,

140
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,500
I really bombed, so this time,

141
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,540
I came here to get my revenge

142
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,040
Was it here that the robbery occurred?

143
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,480
I looked into it myself

144
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,800
The victim, Endo Shozo, 45, Comedian

145
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,980
Recently he's been dieting,

146
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,200
He's dropped all excess intake from his diet,

147
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,030
And lost his funny looking body type

148
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,840
And his position in the comedy world is falling rapidly too

149
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,640
I get that

150
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,480
And, his partner Tanaka,

151
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,210
Last year he appeared in 5 dramas,

152
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,150
And in the fall he will be ZIP's new MC

153
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,380
I see

154
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:22,680
The gap between these two partners is amazing

155
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Acting skills

156
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,300
Culture

157
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,030
Favourability Rating

158
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,140
While Endo's only talent is hooking up with cheap women

159
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,340
The talent his partner has,

160
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,400
He envies all those attributes

161
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,000
Now that I think about it, his self analysis is spot on

162
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,850
However, that Endo has recently been trying to become more like this person,

163
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,960
Former NHK Current Affairs reporter, Ikegami Akira-san

164
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,200
You're gonna get told off

165
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:04,680
Endo has apparently been invited quite a lot onto that person's show,

166
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,240
However, maybe because he doesn't understand that show's topics,

167
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,440
He was talking nonsense, but with a face like he knew,

168
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,010
He only asked questions that were way off the mark

169
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,280
He even pretended to take notes! To make himself look smarter!

170
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,450
What? Something ran over there!

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,470
What's with that acting

172
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,930
Stop! Criminal!

173
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,160
Don't think you're gonna get away

174
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,820
This is the tricky part

175
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,120
Wait! Stop!

176
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,710
There's a bit near the bottom

177
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,780
I can see it!

178
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,150
Peace Secured!!

179
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,420
So Tanaka-san?

180
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,530
I saw a little *Laughing Bag thing sticking out the bottom

181
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,530
TN: A Laughing Bag is a small drawstring bag with a speaker inside.

182
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,320
No no I covered that

183
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,730
It's all good

184
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:19,230
I was amazed by how you were able to keep it covered with that trick,

185
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,920
When you spun around. I thought that was brilliant.

186
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,110
You practiced a lot?

187
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,110
Yes I did

188
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,980
And beside me Tokomitsu-san was getting destroyed by Takahashi

189
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,070
Seriously, like he was getting destroyed!

190
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,490
So you're saying, you rehearsed in the same hall

191
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,600
That is hilarious

192
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,030
How was this compared to last time?

193
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:45,480
I felt that I got my revenge!

194
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,340
He took that criticism into account

195
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,700
Wait really?

196
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,660
Honestly I thought it was too long

197
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,660
Again?

198
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,500
After this, an unexpected Handsome Actor!

199
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,940
"If Ninjas still existed, what jobs would they do to earn money?"

200
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,220
But you know, they do exist still

201
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,310
Ninjas are here right now

202
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,580
Where are they?

203
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,920
They're Ninjas so of course they're hidden

204
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,280
If they're hiding then we wouldn't know they exist!

205
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:39,350
If I tell you where they're hiding in here, I guarantee they'll Shuriken me

206
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,350
100%

207
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,120
It will be a really nasty Shuriken-ing!

208
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,700
Well since I've never seen before, I apologise,

209
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,700
You're saying you've seen them before right?

210
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,700
Yes, that's why I'm saying this

211
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,300
I mean of course Ninjas exist. *Ningyo have always-

212
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,300
TN: Ningyo = Japanese Doll

213
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,030
Ningyo?

214
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,450
Ningyo also exist!

215
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,400
There's Ningyos and Ninjas!

216
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,700
Of course they'll stay hidden in this complicated modern world, they want to fight after all

217
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,470
They wanna stay hidden? But you said if you point them they'll shuriken you, so they're here aren't they?

218
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,880
The Ninjas can hear me, they're Ninjas after all

219
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,500
They can hear you?

220
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,500
They can

221
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,200
So they're here somewhere?

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
They are indeed

223
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,220
There's one beside that wall like this

224
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,620
There's one by that wall,

225
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,420
But actually he's not there, actually it's that wall

226
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
So by saying that...

227
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,800
It's dangerous I told you

228
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,640
Everyone but you thinks they don't exist, so I was just shocked

229
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,900
After this shoot wraps up, since I've been spilling the beans about Ninjas, I guarantee you,

230
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,130
They'll leave me a voicemail

231
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
You guys are really good friends then

232
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,400
It's fine then if it's just a voicemail

233
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,100
They won't Shuriken you

234
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,610
"Hello? You told me you won't say anything"

235
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,450
Then there's a beep

236
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,610
But they've already recorded it!

237
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,600
"You said you wouldn't say- BEEP"

238
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,440
Why?

239
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,440
There's 2 messages

240
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,500
Maybe it didn't record properly the first time

241
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,200
So he thinks it didn't record the first time, and for the second recording,

242
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,800
He records it with a "Let me tell you again" vibe

243
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,250
Well you guys are great friends so you'll be fine

244
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,500
You need to start seeing like I do

245
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,110
How badly do you want to avoid seeing Ninjas?

246
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,270
TN: Makibishi = Sharp spiky trap

247
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,270
You're gonna hate it when there's a Makibishi in front of your door!

248
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,140
Well I can just go over it like this

249
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,600
But after that is really terrible, like,

250
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,900
They're so visible!

251
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,080
You can't see them, you can't see them but you can hear them "pitter patter"

252
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,480
But that's not good either! You shouldn't be able to hear them

253
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,580
But I shouldn't have told you this

254
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,740
Cause of that you're gonna see your partner die from a Shuriken

255
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,740
It's a bad image

256
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,600
It'll be stuck in my head in my portrait

257
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,340
Why would you-

258
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,340
They'll take a picture of it being stabbed in?

259
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,230
There's gotta be a better picture

260
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,340
"Come see his face"

261
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,100
They're not gonna put you in the coffin like that

262
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,700
When they cremate me the Shuriken will be left behind

263
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,040
My bones and the Shuriken

264
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,860
What will they feel when they see that?

265
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,930
The Grand Prix so far,

266
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,460
Tokumitsu & Endo have gone so far .. and behind the scenes...

267
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,930
Time for the second half ... First off is this man;

268
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:39,000
Criminal

269
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,880
Detective, good work!

270
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,120
They were looking for "a handsome man to do some dirty work", for real

271
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,400
"There's no way a useless naked detective like that can exist" you say?

272
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,720
Alright, I'll show you the proof

273
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,420
These are my credentials

274
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,800
There's no doubt I'm a policeman

275
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,130
So this is it isn't it? The home invasion crime scene

276
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,930
I came here to investigate

277
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,460
The victim, Nakamura Masaya 30 years old

278
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,800
An actor

279
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,340
Thinking of the actor Hayami Mokomichi,

280
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,470
He joined the show "PON!"'s cooking segment,

281
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,570
as a useless assistant

282
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,930
That's how he graduated from "PON!", or should I say fired.

283
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,670
He wanted to be reborn, in his hometown he had a "poverty-character"

284
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,560
His specialty was a "Basketball-character"

285
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,600
His hobby was a "Pachinko-character"

286
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,400
Even though struggled to rebrand himself

287
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,810
TV Tokyo didn't really like him

288
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,810
What are you gonna do with that?

289
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,340
That looks hard

290
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,610
He currently has 0 regular shows,

291
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,080
If you type "Nakamura Masaya" into Yahoo,

292
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,650
It says I've disappeared!

293
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,890
Apparently his life is hell right now

294
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,760
Actually amazing!

295
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,060
Someone ran there!

296
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,970
Is he the criminal? Stop criminal!

297
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,040
Don't think you can get away from me

298
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,680
Throw the gun. Throw the gun!

299
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,090
Peace Secured

300
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,620
Thank you very much.

301
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,700
How does it feel, after all this time?

302
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,280
There were so many props

303
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,280
Indeed

304
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,400
There was one unfortunate thing.

305
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,410
When you flipped that disk over,

306
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,510
I wish your ex-wife was on the other side

307
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,480
I'll prepare that for next time

308
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,130
I gave up everything for this

309
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,520
I was moved by that, a bit

310
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,020
Do you think I can go on without him?

311
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,890
Do your best please!

312
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,200
Ryuji, what did you think?

313
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,830
That "Ball on Balll" was great

314
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,170
He's not Shirai! (Japanese Gold Medalist)

315
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,200
Ryuuji 100% Grand Prix - This man is the last one up

316
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,200
In the criminal underbelly of Tokyo, one man strived for peace

317
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,920
Detective, good work!

318
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,530
His knee is distracting

319
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,720
I'm detective Marugoshi, here to revive this project

320
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,900
His knee is distracting

321
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,910
This it huh? The break in crime scene

322
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,720
I came here to investigate

323
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,130
His ass is so flabby

324
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,830
Your ass looks like Chinese Steamed Buns

325
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,430
It's full of soup isn't it?

326
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,430
That was my big break

327
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,930
I debuted as a child actor

328
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,200
In the past, I appeared in a lot of CMs,

329
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,300
For over 10 companies

330
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,110
My highest income, somehow,

331
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,580
30 million yen, in 4th grade

332
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,680
However, after I left show "Appare-san Madai-sensei",

333
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,950
I lost my income,

334
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,320
In addition, I was a high school dropout,

335
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,660
What are you doing?!

336
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,460
I lived a simple life after this transition

337
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,330
Naturally,

338
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,630
Certainly,

339
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,970
You forgot your line?

340
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,100
Hmm? Hold on!

341
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,110
Is that the criminal?!

342
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,240
Stop! Criminal!

343
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,380
Don't think you can get away from me!

344
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,020
This is standard move

345
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,320
Throw the gun, throw it!

346
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,510
Peace Secured. Thank you!

347
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,370
TN: I'm not sure I got this line

348
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,370
This guy is an old lady!

349
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,000
Yamasaki-san, what did you think?

350
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,940
It was good, but he did forget his line

351
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,530
I didn't forget it, I just thought it was unnecessary

352
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,800
You skipped it?

353
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,430
You're gonna get scolded by Takahashi later

354
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,010
You didn't move much

355
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,240
That's true

356
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,290
You were like the annoying guy in the neighbourhood

357
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,230
I was a little distracted by his knee, it hampered my focus a bit

358
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,270
Is that Kitsune? (Fried Tofu)

359
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,410
It's not fried tofu

360
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,920
What about the Steamed Buns on your ass?

361
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,840
They look like Steamed Buns

362
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,740
Soup will come out if you split them

363
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,740
Ryuuji 100% Grand Prix - Who will snatch victory?

364
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:59,300
The winner is.............Nakamura-kun!

365
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,600
Indeed 100%

366
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,260
So can I be known as "Masaya 100%" now?

367
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,120
Ask the master

368
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,890
As long as you don't surpass me

369
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,650
Don't shake things up

370
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,400
What did you think Ryuuji?

371
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,890
If you ever bring shame to the master,

372
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,810
I'll pull out his eyeballs

373
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,000
Tokumitsu-kun worked really hard

374
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Those tears

375
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,880
I'd rather not talk about it

376
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,520
He was crying back stage

377
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,960
Takahashi was really hard on him

378
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,920
I'm middle-aged!

379
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,700
I've never been yelled at that much

380
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,440
We rehearsed really hard the past 2 weeks

381
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,200
It's not about winning

382
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Yes indeed, that feeling is important
