1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,830
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai Ya Arahende!

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,830
Let's play with table games from around the world!!

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,460
I've already said it, but isn't this going to be a discarded episode?

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,240
Downtown

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,240
Hamada Masatoshi

6
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,240
Matsumoto Hitoshi

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,800
Discarded episode?

8
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,800
Is it?

9
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,760
It must be, right?

10
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,470
Tsukitei Housei

11
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,760
Is that so?

12
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,660
No way that's how it is!

13
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,540
Cocorico

14
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,540
Endo Shozo

15
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,540
Tanaka Naoki

16
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,470
I mean we don't have much time to do this

17
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,530
We have to try at least

18
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,130
We must do our best here

19
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,730
I'm excited for this!

20
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,330
So, we've gathered all those game here, right?

21
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,660
Right, from all around the world

22
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,640
What a lame ass hairstyle you have

23
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,640
Give me a break

24
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,640
Please don't say it's lame

25
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,940
I have them shaved only on this side

26
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,560
You know, on last week's episode of "Yamehende"

27
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,130
I thought it could be funny or make them laugh

28
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,700
And so I cut them a bit here

29
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,870
It was funny, right?

30
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,630
Is that the sound a cooler makes?

31
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,960
The air conditioner?

32
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,300
He said "cooler"

33
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,000
Can you hear that?

34
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,500
"Cooler"

35
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,300
He must be like "shit, I said cooler"

36
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,330
Wouldn't "air conditioner" be better?

37
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,330
Air condtioner, right?

38
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,360
It's a matter of period

39
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,160
Times have changed

40
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,570
His household character just surfaced

41
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:10,870
Let's play play with table games from around the world~!!

42
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:10,870
Play with the game which caught your attention between the

43
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:10,870
note: voice = same as black text

44
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:10,870
the 16 collected from around the world!!

45
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,830
If there's something you'd like to know

46
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,630
Yes

47
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,630
Feel free to ask Naoki Tanaka

48
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,130
Naoki knows them?

49
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,700
I've learned them, more or less

50
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,840
Tanaka understood and learned the rules beforehand from an expert

51
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,560
You mean...

52
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,960
The games from the world, yes

53
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,760
I must say

54
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,660
Some of them seem pretty entertaining

55
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,730
There surely are

56
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,730
Is there some of them you'd like to try?

57
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,530
You know them all for real, Tanaka?

58
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,400
Yeah, I kinda know how to explain their rules

59
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,030
The hell is this?

60
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,600
This one's floating for real!

61
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,430
It is

62
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,060
Aladdin?

63
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:35,600
It's floating!!

64
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:35,900
Yeah that's it

65
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,560
It's a game from the Netherlands

66
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,680
From the Netherlands?

67
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,230
There's a magnet here

68
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,230
The S pole and the N pole

69
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,660
Are pulling each other here

70
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,930
You can barely see that

71
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,230
So, there are various items here

72
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:55,440
Each one will place a treasure in turn, the person who will make it fall will lose

73
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:55,440
It's a game about placing the treasures over the flying carpet

74
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:55,440
Netherlands  Aladdin's Flying Carpet

75
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,730
One by one, we'll place them over the carpet

76
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,730
And the person who'll make it fall

77
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,160
Cause it can't withstand the weight, will lose

78
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,430
I see

79
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,260
It's pretty simple

80
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,600
It is, really

81
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,700
It's a simple balance game

82
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,100
Yes

83
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,200
Why is there this wire thingy attacched here?

84
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,260
If there was no wire, the carpet would just collide with the magnet

85
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,460
It's pulling it away from it

86
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,840
So it's not floating

87
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,770
The wire is pulling the carpet to stop it at the very limit

88
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,940
That's not really interesting anymore...

89
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,940
Huh? Why?!

90
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,940
That's not the interesting part of it!

91
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
That's not it!

92
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,830
"Toilet trouble"

93
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,060
Right

94
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,800
This looks fun

95
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,060
You spin this roulette here...

96
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,930
This one raises the bar

97
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,160
If it stops here, you press the level three times

98
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,900
Under

99
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,900
stood

100
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,660
At some point of time, the washlet will be activated

101
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:33,310
Flush the toilet as many times as the number on the roulette shows

102
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:33,310
Once it will reach the randomly set number of times, it will spray water on the loser's face

103
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:33,310
U.S.A.  Toilet Trouble

104
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,660
And you'll get your face wet

105
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,500
I see

106
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,860
So it's a russian rosh-- washlet

107
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,130
Exactly

108
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:33,560
Right

109
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,540
It's a Wushian Washlet...

113
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,800
So, Matsumoto-san

114
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,560
Yes

115
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,530
Let's just leave everything to Tanaka-san

116
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,300
Let's do it

117
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's have him bring here his own recommended ones

118
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,130
We're going to have a positive vibe about this

119
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,130
Of course

120
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,130
Alright

121
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,000
I really want us to have fun today

122
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,500
With all our might

123
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,360
Yes, positively

124
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
Please be positive about this

125
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,860
We can't say something like "this is stupid"

126
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,760
Yes, you're right

127
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,930
Yeah let's avoid such things

128
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,110
Let's avoid that

129
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,840
We have to think of it as being a troublemaker for the show

130
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,840
Exactly

131
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,340
Like, avoiding "what the hell!" or such

132
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,030
I see, positive about it

133
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,900
Got it, a good vibe

134
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,910
You're the most-likely-to-say-it type, though

135
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,230
From the start

136
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,300
You've been complaining all day about this!

137
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,500
Which is our first one?

138
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,700
The one we've been talking about before

139
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,950
The one from the Netherlands...

140
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,140
That was the most non-enjoyable-looking among them

141
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,140
Don't say that!!

142
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,860
Can't we just stop this?

143
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,500
Don't say that!

144
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,260
Say what?

145
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,260
What yo

146
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,260
u said

147
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,510
So it's not ok to that degree either?

148
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,510
Of course it's not

149
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,060
We said "positively"

150
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,660
We haven't started yet and you're already complaining

151
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:43,810
Each one will place a treasure in turn, the person who will make it fall will lose

152
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:43,810
It's a game about placing the treasures over the flying carpet

153
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:43,810
Netherlands  Aladdin's Flying Carpet

154
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:43,810
note: narrator voice = same as text

155
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,410
I can't see them (the objects)

156
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,830
Yes, we're not supposed to know what we'll get

157
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,300
Oh, I see!

158
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,160
Makes sense

159
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,400
It'd be more fun this way

160
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,060
Sounds fun!

161
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,230
So, how about we start a round from here?

162
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:53,760
Nu-huh

163
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,300
Huh?

164
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,400
Let's start from here, clockwise

165
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,130
Yeah that's important

166
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,380
So, from Yama-chan?

167
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,110
No, make it start from me

168
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,110
Wait a moment

169
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,360
Isn't that strange?

170
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,600
It's way too weird to leave me out like this

171
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,300
So, from Tanaka w-

172
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,560
If we can't see them, the person beside should hold it

173
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,910
Oh, so we just have to stick our hand inside

174
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,910
Oh, I see, good point

175
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,000
As if it's closed

176
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,960
Starting from here, ok?

177
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,800
From Tanaka

178
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,660
Clockwise, ok?

179
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,810
Let's have Hamada holding the bag

180
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,970
Let's have Hamada holding the bag when Tanaka has to extract one

181
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,630
W-wait wh-

182
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,970
Why must there be rules for both this game and for this bag?

183
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,760
He's right, that will complicate things

184
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,960
Wouldn't it be good?

185
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,060
Well...

186
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,200
Let's--- let's just make a round this way

187
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,730
Enough, let's start from there even though it bugs me

188
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,360
Just like this

189
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,530
So, from Endo

190
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,250
From Endo..?

191
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,100
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'll quit it

192
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,860
I'm ready now!!

193
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,630
It's fine from Tanaka

194
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,530
But I hate things like that!!

195
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,100
I'm done, come on Endo

196
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,890
Alright alright

197
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,270
If it falls will it-- wait

198
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,430
First off we have...

199
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,430
A treasure box

200
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,230
Is this going to be hard?

201
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,430
This should be easy

202
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,230
Ok, it's my turn

203
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,060
It didn't budge

204
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,600
How much will it take to make it fall?

205
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,240
Yeah

206
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,210
Here comes the presbyopia...

207
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,560
It's a jar

208
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,260
I think

209
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,800
Anyway, it looks like it

210
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,530
Yes

211
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:09,960
Done

212
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,800
So that's how it goes

213
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,010
Hurry up and take it

214
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,010
Me?

215
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,870
He should...

216
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,870
Yeah but the person beside should hold it

217
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,870
I'm talking about the bag, hold it so I can extract

218
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,130
I see

219
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,930
You just said it

220
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,810
Let's stop acting this way please!

221
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,660
Let's stop talking this way

222
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,610
The atmosphere is so friggin' stiff!

223
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,150
Let's stop with such conversations!

224
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,460
It's not like it, I mean---

225
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,610
Geez

226
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,860
That's what you just said!

227
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,660
I mean

228
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,130
It was you who suggested to have the person beside to hold the bag

229
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,120
He has always been right beside me and had no clue

230
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,460
Looks like a gem

231
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,430
It's a jewel

232
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,130
It seems so

233
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,130
It's getting riskier

234
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,260
Yes, the problem is where to place it

235
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,660
Ok Matsumoto-san

236
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,300
He just got a sort of beetle

237
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,830
It's a beetle

238
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,930
It's a sign of good luck

239
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,930
I must balance it

240
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,660
Yes, it's getting heavier

241
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,930
The carpet is even spinning around

242
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,800
And there's also the air conditioner

243
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,030
I see

244
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,600
Alright

245
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,160
Looks safe

246
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,630
They easily manage to place 13 treasures over the carpet

247
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,000
They kept on placing the treasures

248
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,430
And gathered them all without making it fall!

249
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,130
What? It holds them perfectly fine

250
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,800
It's perfectly safe

251
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,030
What the hell?

252
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,400
I'm going for it

253
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,130
See? Perfectly fine

254
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,560
It's shaking though

255
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,500
We had each type

256
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,800
What if we end up placing them all?

257
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,660
Yeah what if?

258
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,240
They have placed 26 treasures on it! Only 5 items left...

259
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,600
Even more items are placed without problems, only 5 remains

260
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,730
We kinda placed em all

261
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,460
Should this happen?

262
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,430
Really

263
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,100
What's this?

264
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,330
Never played it before so I don't know

265
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,760
Here comes

266
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,460
You placed it so fast

267
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,500
Like, "plop"

268
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,000
You can do it that way?

269
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
Of course

270
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,530
This one looks bad!

271
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,530
This one seems to be pretty heavy

272
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,500
There it is, must be it!

273
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,660
This one is risky, Matsumoto-san

274
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,400
Here we are

275
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,030
This is bad

276
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,760
There's not even much space left

277
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:07,160
Why would you fall on me?

278
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,840
You did good to this point, come on

279
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,810
This carpet can't sense the mood at all

280
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,630
The next game Tanaka chose is

281
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,510
Catch the right answer before anyone else!

282
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,510
Ghost Blitz - Germany

283
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,460
Let me set this

284
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,760
This one

285
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,460
Already looks more enjoyable

286
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,130
What is this?

287
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,760
There's a bottle and...

288
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:28,700
...a ghost?

289
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,030
Yes

290
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,230
Also a chair, a book and a mouse

291
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,460
Yeah, it's a mouse

292
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,910
You have to memorize each shape and color of them

293
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,530
After that, cards like this one will be flipped over

294
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,530
For example, we have a red sofa here

295
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,960
It's exactly as that

296
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,530
Right

297
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,300
In case like this, you just go for it

298
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,700
Who grabs it first wins

299
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,030
This element makes it pretty similar to Karuta

300
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:52,960
Exactly

301
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:53,830
However

302
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,060
So that's how it works

303
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,700
There are other direct cards like this red sofa one

304
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:57,930
Yes

305
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,600
And these

306
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,420
Bottle and book

307
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,500
A red book

308
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,360
A red book

309
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,930
And a gray bottle

310
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,260
So it's not this

311
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,500
Right

312
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,530
This bottle is green

313
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,130
In cases like this

314
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,830
First of all, which one is red? It's the sofa

315
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,060
Yeah it's the sofa

316
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,860
And which is the book? it's blue, but it's still here

317
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,130
It's on the card

318
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,100
The bottle's color is different too, but it's still on the card

319
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,800
And which one is grey? It's the mouse

320
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,860
So, which is the only one missing?

321
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,430
I see!

322
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,400
It's the white ghost! 'Cause there's no white and no ghost!

323
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
This is...

324
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,330
Nice choice!!

325
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,330
Thank you so much!!

326
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,750
It makes you use your head

327
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,750
Thank you so much

328
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,750
It seems so good!

329
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,560
I wonder if we can make it

330
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,560
I love this type of games!

331
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,700
You have to use your brain

332
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
It's good, it's good!

333
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,500
The missing one?

334
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,130
For example, in the case of the bottom-left card

335
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,360
There's a blue book among the five pieces

336
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,900
So you must grab the blue book piece to win

337
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:56,300
However, in case like this one where there isn't
anything matching both color and shape of the pieces

338
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,660
By choosing the mouse, whose shape and color doesn't appear in the card, you win

339
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,160
Focus on shapes and colors

340
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
It's only one?

341
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,300
Yes, just one

342
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,660
Can't happen to have 2 of them?

343
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,660
Can't happen

344
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,970
The answer is always in a single object

345
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,970
Alright, let's do this!

346
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,970
I'm pumped!

347
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,260
You join us too, Tanaka?

348
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,600
Yep

349
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,000
Yes

350
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,900
Where are you placin--

351
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,230
Ouch that hurt

352
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,500
Can't be helped

353
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,930
We're fighting each other

354
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,660
You grabbed the back of my hand so firmly

355
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,430
This game is going to be intense

356
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,430
This is the matching piece, right?

357
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,300
Yeah, the mouse is white, can't be it

358
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,630
You were pretty quick

359
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,000
Ok

360
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,730
Here comes

361
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,500
Ready, 2, 1, here!

362
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,360
Which one is it?

363
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,800
What is it?

364
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,600
It's not this one, right?

365
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,200
It's this

366
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:50,760
Here

367
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,160
I think that's wrong

368
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,760
The book is green

369
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,660
But it's not there

370
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,300
The bottle

371
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,860
But there's green, the book is green

372
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:56,860
You're right

373
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,000
It's red

374
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,000
It's red!

375
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,000
It's red

376
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,160
It's the red sofa

377
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,160
This is...

378
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,400
It was that one

379
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,100
Red, right?

380
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,100
It's missing!

381
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,710
We're such a bunch of old geezers !!

382
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,830
True

383
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,730
We all froze up!

384
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,730
Even Tanaka's judgement was slow

385
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,400
Alright alright

386
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,200
Let's go!

387
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,130
Here

388
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,860
It's this

389
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,660
Oh, right

390
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,560
It's that, right?

391
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
It's the mouse
- The mouse

392
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,060
There's no grey either, that's it

393
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,160
Right! It's the grey mouse

394
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,430
This one's not there either

395
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,130
The bottle?

396
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,000
Wait a moment...

397
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,830
It's the bottle!

398
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,180
The bottle!

399
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,000
Wait a second

400
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,200
Must be
the bottle

401
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,370
(staff) The right answer is the ghost

402
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,370
The ghost!?

403
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh, it's the ghost!

404
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,300
Is it?

405
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,830
That's right

406
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,700
It's the ghost

407
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,160
It's in plain sight too

408
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
It's the ghost!

409
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Wait a moment...

410
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,800
You're playing dirty!

411
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,230
You should have told me when I was like "look at how good I am!"

412
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,830
None of our heads realized that

413
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,330
This is pretty hard!

414
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,230
Yeah it is

415
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:01,860
It's fun

416
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,560
It is

417
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,960
Ready? Here we go

418
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,360
This one, right?

419
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,360
What are you lookin' at?

420
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,530
It's that one

421
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,660
The ghost

422
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,800
I'm not following this

423
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,360
The ghost is the same as the card

424
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,260
Exactly the same

425
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,660
Yes

426
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,230
I see

427
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,260
You only picked up ghosts !!

428
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,700
Only ghosts on his side

429
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,300
You're right

430
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,200
Two cards two ghosts

431
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,200
I got it, I got it

432
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,460
No it's n-- oh that's it

433
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,460
Endo got it

434
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:29,960
Yes

435
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,830
Yeah that's it

436
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,210
You just took the ghost again

437
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,710
You must be thinking "whatever, just lemme take my ghost"

438
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,860
But I see

439
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,130
Yeah, that's what this german game's about

440
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:40,600
It's fun

441
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,430
After this, even more

442
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:46,970
Even more bizarre overseas games will appear !!

443
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,800
Unthinkable games from outside Japan will be presented!

444
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:53,810
Lay face down your cards without being find out!

445
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:53,810
Schlafmütze - Germany

446
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,530
The next game Tanaka chose is Schlafmütze, from Germany

447
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,760
Let me explain the rules a bit

448
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,800
There are several kids

449
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,800
wearing night caps

450
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,940
Each one of you will receive 5 cards

451
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:11,910
And the first one of you

452
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:11,910
who will line up 4 cards

453
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,910
with different colors of kids wearing the same hat

454
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,210
Without shouting "I've lined them up" or such

455
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,440
Must just quietly lay their cards face down

456
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,300
So...

457
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,810
After that

458
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,570
Those who notice the player who layed em down

459
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:28,410
Even if they haven't lined up the 4 cards

460
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,410
Have to quietly lay their own cards face down too

461
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:34,210
And in the end

462
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,210
The last one who can't lay them down will lose

463
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,210
What the hell?

464
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,460
I don't understand it

465
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,960
Is it a deceiving game?

466
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,660
Seriously, I have no clue

467
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,960
It's a deceiving game

468
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,800
It's fun, I promise

469
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Trust me, you won't notice if someone lets them down quietly

470
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,900
Are you for real?

471
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,870
I totally would notice it

472
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,850
For example, if someone

473
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,670
Finds out Hamada-san layed them down

474
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,810
Can lay theirs down too, even if he hasn't matched anything

475
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:59,010
And Housei-san who saw him laying them down, can do the same

476
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:04,230
And if for example Matsumoto-san doesn't notice and

477
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,230
lays them down last, he'll lose

478
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,540
However, last thing

479
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,240
We don't have to play it quietly

480
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,870
We'll pass each other the cards

481
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,760
So it's a deceiving game

482
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,870
while having a normal conversation

483
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:22,760
Collect 4 cards with the same type of hat and lay them face down

484
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:22,760
If you notice the first one to do so, you can face down yours too

485
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:27,870
Germany  Schlafmütze

486
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,500
Gather 4 cards with the same type of nightcap

487
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,860
And lay them face down

488
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,300
The last one to notice that will lose, it's a bizarre game

489
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,870
The last one who doesn't lay them face down will lose

490
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,300
However it can unexpectedly turn out to be full of climaxes!

491
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,060
Can we look at them?

492
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,530
Sure

493
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,310
It could be you already have them now

494
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,310
It may be

495
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,900
Here

496
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,700
Can I see it?

497
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,200
Yes, place it with yours, discard one and pass it to Hamada-san

498
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,760
I'm taking the one you don't need

499
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,310
You see, we're

500
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,070
supposed to play it while chatting

501
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:45,860
Right, right

502
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,400
While we talk, huh...

503
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,960
It is necessary, right?   - Yes

504
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,330
Is your hairstyle ok?--

505
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,530
Don't you think this year's been kinda dry?

506
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,760
Yeah it has been   - Right?

507
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,930
It's been pretty arid

508
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,160
The humidifier I have in my house

509
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,230
Yes?

510
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,930
Is not really helping that much

511
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,000
Oh I see

512
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,530
So, only one can't do the job?

513
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,030
I guess that applies to Yamazaki's house

514
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,560
Are you for real?

515
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,800
I heard it's pretty big

516
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,300
What? Are you for real?

517
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,260
What are you saying?

518
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,460
I'd love to visit your house once

519
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,200
Right, I'd love to see it myself

520
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,200
I think we can schedule an episode set in his house

521
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,760
Let's do it

522
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,530
Can we?

523
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,160
I want to

524
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,500
I'd love to see it, really

525
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,100
I mean, if we have to do this

526
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,360
Wouldn't it be better at Tanaka's house?

527
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,860
No way no way no way

528
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,100
You can't just "nowaynoway" us

529
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,800
We're talking about houses after all

530
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,200
You can't back off

531
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,230
That's Tanaka for you

532
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,530
He wouldn't let us in?

533
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,600
Hm, yeah

534
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,360
No way

535
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,760
You mean his house?

536
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,160
His wife would get mad

537
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,300
Yeah she would

538
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,030
I never saw her mad though, I wouldn't know

539
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,030
Wait a sec... I have now 1, 2, 3...

540
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,800
This is actually my sixth card

541
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,260
What?

542
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,760
Gimme a break

543
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,660
(counting)

544
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,060
(staff) You have them right

545
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,950
Something's wrong

546
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,060
If he passes one, he's back to five

547
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,330
He would have 5, it's ok

548
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,160
If he passes one

549
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,760
And I have to get 4 of them    - Yes

550
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,000
Come on, Endo...

551
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But we have to get 4, right? 4 is ok?

552
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,330
Yes

553
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,630
That's all there is about the rules

554
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,060
You make me wanna quit this

555
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,200
Haven't you got the rules?

556
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,230
That's not it

557
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,600
It's just, that's hard

558
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,830
We haven't matched anything yet

559
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,160
Yeah, that's the timing for the game

560
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,600
It's pretty hard

561
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,330
Could it be that we end up stuck in a loop?

562
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,160
Yeah, me too, this...

563
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,160
...oh, I see

564
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,060
Come on, stop it!

565
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,830
Stop it!

566
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,740
WHAT THE HELL !!

567
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,840
He didn't notice at all!

568
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,360
Wait a minute, wait wait wait

569
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,360
What's so funny about it ?!

570
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
He shouted "of course I'll notice!" before!

571
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:58,830
He did

572
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,230
How is this funny?

573
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,900
What are you saying?

574
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,760
Someone got 4 right? You can't place
them down otherwise, right?

575
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,200
I did, I---    - He's the first-

576
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
So being that someone got them

577
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,060
I ended up losing, right?

578
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,030
Can I...?

579
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,900
I've gathered these 4 cards

580
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,200
And I got this spare one

581
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,200
So you closed the round

582
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,960
He layed them down

583
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,200
Yes, I was done

584
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,060
It's ok

585
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,560
And after him Hamada-san layed them down, right?

586
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,260
Yes

587
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,130
I saw that and

588
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,840
I was like "oh shit"

589
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,810
Me too, I saw Hamada's face going like "oh shit"

590
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,110
And went "oh shit" myself

591
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,600
That's how it is

592
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,140
What the hell is this game ?!

593
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,400
That's a bit...

594
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
What the hell is this game!

595
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,000
It's not like we can make it clear we won

596
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,160
Exactly, just lay them down

597
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,030
You have to get it

598
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,730
Let's try again, one more time please

599
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,800
That's amazing

600
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,100
But really

601
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,970
Why haven't you noticed we layed them face down?

602
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,910
I was really getting into the conversation

603
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,760
5 cards each

604
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,960
It went so smoothly

605
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,660
I was absorded in our chatter

606
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,000
I wasn't focusing on the game

607
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,040
Schlafmütze - Round 2

608
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,600
And so they're ready for a second round

609
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,240
Let's start from me, ok?

610
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,110
He's so friggin' motivated now

611
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,000
I see, we don't have them

612
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,500
Yeah we just started, it's all about the timing

613
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,260
We should have all different types now

614
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,560
Third Round

615
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,700
You know I'm surprisingly good at Othello?

616
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,400
Me too actually

617
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,030
For real?

618
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,360
Yup

619
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,900
Nah, I'm positive I'm better

620
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
I let the corners be mine

621
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,600
That's normal

622
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,630
That's the game

623
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,100
You let them be yours?

624
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,800
By the opponent?

625
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,120
Yes

626
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,520
You do?

627
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,260
Is that so?

628
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,260
That's how it is

629
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,260
And you can win by that?

630
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:35,830
I can

631
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,530
Normally that's what they'd aim

632
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,360
It's to find a way to win

633
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,460
Can you win by that?

634
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,700
I could

635
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,900
You'd just be convinced you are winning

636
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,860
Really...

637
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,930
I may be left with tons of them

638
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,860
And you win by that

639
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,860
What do you mean by making me win?

640
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,200
I mean, leading me to victory

641
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,700
Oh, that?

642
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,260
Yep

643
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,710
That was frightening! It startled me!

644
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,410
Who was it?

645
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:15,800
Hamada?

646
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,730
Was it Hamada-san?

647
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,830
Yes, it was Hamada-san!

648
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,200
You're right

649
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,730
Yup, he got 4 of them

650
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,610
You're all good at this

651
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,260
You rushed pretty hard before

652
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,130
It was quick

653
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,670
I broke my coldest sweat

654
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,760
Makes you wanna rush

655
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,570
My heart was racing like crazy!

656
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,710
The hell is this game!? It's so weird !!

657
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,710
It's so fun

658
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,060
I'm glad we did this, but it was really strange

659
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,660
I like it

660
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:44,270
Toilet Trouble - U.S.A.

661
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:44,270
Your face is gonna get sprayed with toilet water!

662
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,360
Their next challenge will be U.S.A.'s Toilet Trouble

663
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,560
Here it is, I knew it

664
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,360
It was about time to try the U.S.A.'s

665
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,930
How close to it?

666
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,700
A bit more, close to the roulette

667
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,360
Do we spin it?

668
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:51,760
Yes

669
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:53,960
Two

670
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,400
Two times, huh...

671
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,430
So he must press it twice?

672
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,400
Yeah that's it

673
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,130
Here I go

674
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,400
Go

675
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,300
Wait...

676
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Ok, it's safe

677
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It splashes after the sound?   - Yes

678
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,200
Ok safe, Endo-san is safe

679
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,030
For now

680
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:11,900
Hamada-san is next

681
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,530
Me!?

682
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:12,960
Yes

683
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,200
I don't think it was that surprising

684
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,330
I thought Tanaka would do it

685
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,600
It's anti-clockwise from me

686
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,760
No need it to spin it so much

687
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,660
This is?

688
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,530
It's three

689
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,800
What a moron

690
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,460
Here he goes

691
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,090
Here?

692
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,360
Yes, should be fine there

693
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,960
First one is safe

694
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,260
I wonder if the water

695
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,360
Will splash him

696
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,900
The second flush is safe too

697
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,900
Third time

698
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,160
What the-?

699
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,460
Wow!

700
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,930
He's quite lucky!

701
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,360
No doubt about it

702
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,800
Matsumoto-san, please

703
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,400
He did good

704
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,960
Three, it's three times

705
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,100
Like this?

706
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,700
A bit closer

707
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,100
Go

708
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,780
Oh, here it comes

709
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,500
Did it?

710
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,540
I mean, it was so fast I don't even know

711
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,560
It splashed just a bit

712
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,000
What a bad timing

713
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,770
It wasn't

714
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,770
even

715
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,770
that funny...

716
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,160
Next up will be a famous game from Russia!

717
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,040
It's time for a popular russian game !!

718
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,600
What is this?

719
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,070
Give a name to everyone! Can you remember them all?

720
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,070
Nanja-Monja - Russia

721
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:25,830
This is

722
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,830
"Nanja-Monja"

723
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,900
There are 12 types of characters  - Ok ok ok

724
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,000
In order, we flip a card like this

725
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,340
And we gave a nickname to the character on it

726
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,130
Each one of us will do so in round

727
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,700
And one by one we keep on giving nicknames

728
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,000
To the characters we draw

729
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,330
And you have to remember them

730
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,660
Remember them?!  - Yes

731
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,530
So for example

732
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,540
If you draw

733
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,940
The same card on the table

734
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,870
The first one to say its nickname

735
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,530
First one to say it wins

736
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,870
wins the round

737
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,730
Ok, let's do this

738
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,000
So we must remember them?

739
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,800
Yes   - Ok, good

740
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,030
Just make up some names

741
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,860
give a nickname to the character on the card you draw

742
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:08,870
Nanja-Monja - Russia

743
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:08,870
note: voice = roughly same as black text

744
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:08,870
from the deck, the first one to say its name will win

745
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:08,870
when a card with a character you've already named is drawn

746
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,260
We're placing the deck here

747
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,030
And flip them

748
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,530
Ok

749
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:13,530
Ok

750
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,060
"Coldy"

751
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,340
COLDY

752
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,060
Coldy

753
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,700
Coldy?

754
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,930
Coldy...

755
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,230
No wait, "Okubo"

756
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,770
OKUBO

757
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,060
Wait a moment...

758
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,630
I thought it was "Coldy"

759
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,560
"Coldy Okubo" then

760
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,500
Coldy Okubo?!

761
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:33,570
COLDY
OKUBO

762
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,060
That's long!

763
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,430
Coldy Okubo

764
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,860
What the hell

765
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,230
Coldy Okubo

766
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,100
May I?

767
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,480
Yes

768
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,260
From here?

769
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:35,600
Yes

770
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,700
This is "Homa-son"

771
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,740
HOMA-SON

772
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,530
Homa-son...

773
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,360
Here I go

774
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,200
Googala

775
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,890
GOOGALA

776
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:49,660
HOMA-SON !!

777
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,960
COLDY-OKUB-- No wait

778
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,260
Coldy Okubo? Really?

779
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,260
He said Coldy Okubo!

780
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,560
What should I do? Should I take this?

781
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,560
The first one who said it wins

782
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,500
I said it, didn't I?

783
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,200
I said it! It's Homa-son

784
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,000
You said it?

785
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,460
Homa-son

786
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,160
Ok, Housei-san

787
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,800
Let's reset it, shall we?

788
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,600
Ok, reset

789
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,960
I don't like the way he comes up with nicknames

790
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,400
It's not easy to understand clearly what he's sayin

791
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,600
You speak that way so only you can understand?

792
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,500
He's right

793
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,030
Shall we start from me?

794
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,430
Ok

795
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,730
Here goes

796
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
"Ichimaso-chan"

797
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:26,760
What?

798
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:38,070
ICHIMASO-CHAN

799
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,600
What?

800
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,230
Ichimatsu?

801
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:40,000
note: they're complaining over the fact that Ichimaso isn't a real name, while Ichimatsu is

802
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,160
Ichimaso-chan

803
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,580
IchimaSO?

804
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,300
Ichimaso-chan

805
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
Come on, this is irritating!

806
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Wouldn't Ichimatsu do it?

807
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,700
The hell is "Ichimaso"?

808
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,400
I-chi-ma-so-chan?

809
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,930
Ichimaso-chan?!   - Ichimaso-chan

810
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:38,800
I-chi-ma-so

811
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,600
The hell is the deal with "Ichimaso"?

812
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,100
I'm going

813
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,500
ICHIMASO-CHAN !!

814
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,230
You didn't even say it

815
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,600
He said it, Ichimaso-chan

816
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,260
He's the only one who didn't say "Ichimaso-chan"

817
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,830
I couldn't see it!

818
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,730
You covered it with your hand!

819
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,160
Everyone said it but he couldn't say "Somaso-chan"

820
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,760
The hell is Somaso-chan now?!

821
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,940
They'll challenge the russian pie game !!

822
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,900
That one caught my attention, how about we do it?

823
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,950
The one from U.S.A.?

824
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,870
Pieface! - U.S.A.

825
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,870
Pies fly on your face in this heart-throbbing game!

826
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,700
Which one?

827
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,460
U.S.A. made loads of games, huh

828
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,460
Oh, that one?

829
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,260
Let's start from Yamazaki, we never did it before

830
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:13,900
Alright

831
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,230
Oh, that's the deal?

832
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,230
This will be our last one, I'd hate it if it sucks

833
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,230
I bet this is going to be disappointing

834
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,530
You're right, we're about to end

835
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,960
I don't want this

836
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,700
This is something

837
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,600
Move your head there and pull the lever

838
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,230
Here I go

839
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,260
Two

840
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,960
Pull it

841
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,100
The other way

842
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,160
One...

843
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,000
Good   - Mh

844
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,130
The eeeeeeeeeend!

845
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,000
WE DID IT !!
