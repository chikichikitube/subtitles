1
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,520
What do you think about Zakoshisho being the favorite?

2
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,590
If I were a fortune teller, I would say this.

3
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,790
"Kubota will come back here as the winner."

4
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,830
This is a worst-case scenario.

5
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,770
I have a secret plan to defeat the enemy.

6
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:53,010
I worry that Kubota will plant more jokes than I do.

7
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,250
Make me an disciple!

8
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,280
Excuse me, can I get by?

9
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,590
The worst part is that I ran out of all of my jokes.

10
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,030
Zakoshisho without jokes is worth nothing.

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,500
But I am not really thinking about winning.

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,630
I would enjoy this again for a long time.

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,070
This is my best stage.

14
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,400
Documental - Season 10
Episode 5  “Champion is Strong”

15
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,570
"Rassun Gorerai"
"Rassun Gorerai"

16
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,170
He laughed!

17
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,410
Yellow card.

18
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,910
- It's the first time, right?
- Yes.

19
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,510
Don't stir this with your nipple, aaaaahhhhh!!

20
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,920
She laughed.

21
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,320
- He is laughing.
- Yeah.

22
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,430
Kotouge, you are dismissed.

23
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,370
Here we go.

24
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,910
There is 1 hour and 56 minutes remaining.

25
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,810
- Kotouge is gone.
- There are less than two hours left.

26
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,210
4 people.

27
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,250
- Can I do that?
- What?

28
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,520
I will do an impression of Excitebike.
(Note: 1)

29
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,390
- The NES one?
- Yes.

30
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,720
- What's that?
- It is a NES game software.

31
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,720
- Excitebike on the NES?
- Yeah.

32
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,610
That’s all.

33
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,250
This was definitely an Excitebike.

34
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,320
- I used to play with that too.
- Yeah.

35
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,660
What's that?

36
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,330
I'm Dean Fujioka.
(Note: 2)

37
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,960
- Dean Fujioka?
- Yes.

38
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,170
I'm Dean Fujioka.
And...

39
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,270
I am a motorcyclist.

40
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,140
Deeeeeeaaaaaaan....

41
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,710
Fujioka.

42
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,940
Deeeeeeaaaaaaan....

43
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,880
I wouldn't laugh at that.

44
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,980
I've had enough of Fujioka.

45
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,680
You can't make me laugh at that.

46
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,820
He is cold.

47
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,260
- There are not many jokes left of me anymore.
- Yeah.

48
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,330
They seem to be running out of jokes of their own.

49
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,400
Junior, do you want to go to that room?

50
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,800
I don't know what we can do though.

51
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,900
I'm going to physically examination you all.

52
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,400
Physically examination?
Okay.

53
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,840
Let's do it.

54
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,380
You are okay.

55
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,080
What?
Why?

56
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,780
This means you are fine.

57
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,290
If you are ok, this will sound "Ding Ding".

58
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,060
Then I'm next.

59
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,160
- Am I alright?
- Yes.

60
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,570
"Apologize, apologize. apologize, apologize!"
(Note: 3)

61
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,900
"Apologize!!"

62
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,710
No.

63
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,850
Junior-san.

64
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,520
- They don't laugh when I do this.
- I see.

65
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,020
"If pushing doesn't work, try pulling."
(Keep trying different ways.)

66
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:25,790
Pulling?

67
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,920
Try a toned-down impression of the mayor of Nagoya City.

68
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,430
Okay, toned-down impression of the mayor of Nagoya City.

69
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,400
More like, won't you exaggerate?

70
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,770
This is a normal impression of the mayor of Nagoya city.

71
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,040
And this is a toned-down impression of the mayor of Nagoya city.

72
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,940
Not much has changed.

73
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,880
That's toned down a lot.

74
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,750
What other exaggerated impression can you do?

75
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,490
I have a lot of them.

76
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,450
He brought his joke list.

77
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,260
- A toned-down impression?
- Yeah.
- Okay.

78
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,460
I can do Shupei of Pecopa impression.
(Note: 4)

79
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,460
First, do you do a normal impression of it?

80
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,730
Yes, see this first.

81
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,430
This is normal one.

82
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,440
"I'm Shupei."

83
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,870
And this is the exaggerated Shupei impression.

84
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,250
"I'm Jupei."

85
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,550
You said Junpei.

86
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,320
- Jupei.
- You said Junpei.

87
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,880
- It's Jupei.
- Jupei?

88
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,190
If you exaggerate Shupei, does it become Jupei?

89
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,890
- Try a toned-down impression of it.
- Yes.

90
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,530
I'm Shupei...

91
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,730
It's toned down.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,870
- It's toned down.
- Yeah.

93
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,870
Nobody laughs.

94
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,470
- I'm new to this, can I try that?
- Sure.

95
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,210
Junior-san, do you have any requests?

96
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,580
- Zakoshi, what was that impression you did a while ago? "If you do, you can eat shit."
- It's Timon D.

97
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,150
Try an exaggerated impression of Timon D first.

98
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,190
"We're Timon D!"
"I'll eat ball!"

99
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,790
"I'll eat this!"
"Strike!"

100
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,030
Zakoshi was close, wasn't he?

101
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,400
Try that in the Kyoto style.

102
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,640
- Try that in the Kyoto style, please.
- Kyoto style!?

103
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,580
Kyoto style...

104
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,580
"I'll eat this ball!"
"We're Timon D!"

105
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,160
"This ball is so tasty!"

106
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,960
"Ookini"
(Thank you)

107
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,030
What's the hell is that?

108
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,530
- It's Kyoto style.
- You just said "Ookini" at the end.

109
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,830
That's right.

110
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,770
I've never done this before either, can I try?

111
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,070
Of course.

112
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,810
Try an exaggerated impression of Katopan.
(Note: 5)

113
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,410
In New York.

114
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,350
"I eat in New York!"

115
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,190
Oh, I see.

116
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,800
Try that in a Chinese style.

117
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,670
"I eat in Sichuan!"

118
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,470
That was bound to happen.

119
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,040
Yes, the location will change.

120
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,550
- Yamamoto-san, would you like to try it?
- Okay, I'll try to do the same.

121
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,350
I've never done this before either, but I'll give it a try.

122
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,350
- Then try an impression of Fuwa-chan..
- Okay.

123
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,020
First, do a normal Fuwa-chan impression.

124
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,500
"Guys, don't be so serious!"

125
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,600
He does not know her.

126
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,010
Next, do an exaggerated impression of Fuwa-chan.

127
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,510
Okay.

128
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,750
Heigh-Ho! Heigh-Ho! Festival!
129
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,254
Festival! Festival!

129
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,820
That has nothing to do with Fuwa-chan.

130
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,890
Yeah.

131
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,020
So what do you want me to do?

132
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,530
To do that, you have to add the essence of normal impression.

133
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,360
- Sometimes Zakoshi doesn't add that essence, either.
- Yeah.

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,900
Do a normal impression of Hamada-san.

135
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,240
- Hamada-san?
- Yes.

136
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,710
This is a normal impression of Downtown's Hamada-san.

137
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,510
"Announcement of the results!!"

138
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,580
And this is an exaggerated impression of his.

139
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,550
Cock, cock, cock-a...

140
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,550
Cock-a-doo-cock-a-doodle-doo!!

141
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,920
There was no essence in that one.

142
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,090
He's the one who talked about the essence, right?

143
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,460
Then, try an impression of Hamada-san in the Heian period (10th century).

144
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,100
Cock, cock, cock-a...

145
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,170
Cock, cock, cock-a-doo-de gozaru.

146
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,980
His ones still have the taste that was present in normal impression.

147
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,520
Then may I practice that?

148
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:33,030
Then try to impression the less energetic Sota Fujii.
(Note: 6)

149
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,500
- The shogi player's?
- Yes.

150
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,040
- Sota Fujii.
- First, I'll do an toned down impression of his.

151
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,710
"I resign."

152
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,320
- He must have lost.
- I'm sure that happens to him too.

153
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,120
Then try to an exaggerated impression of Sota Fujii.

154
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,960
Oute!
(Checkmate)

155
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,460
Then try to an impression of returnee Sota Fujii.

156
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,610
GET!

157
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,680
Who's that?

158
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,250
Whose impression were you?

159
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,120
I think that was good.

160
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,320
You said "I resign" at the first one, so you should say so all the same.

161
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,590
Indeed.

162
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,260
Why is that guy talking about comedy theory?

163
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,470
- That's your way, isn't it?
- Yes.

164
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,640
That is exaggerated impression.

165
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,610
You guys did a lot of different things and it was hilarious.

166
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,080
- Let's chill out and chat a bit.
- Sounds good.

167
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,710
Let's sit down.

168
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,450
- One hour and 30 minutes left.
- Yeah.

169
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,860
I don't know what is going on with me anymore.

170
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,990
What am I supposed to do?

171
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,930
I don't know.

172
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,600
- The match has not finished yet.
- Yeah.

173
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,170
- There is still more than an hour to go.
- Yes.

174
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,970
We are not enough with our own jokes.

175
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,700
What should I do?

176
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,910
What are your memories of your first kiss?

177
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,580
I see. Let's talk about that.

178
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,450
They had not yet talked like this.

179
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,850
Kubota, can you talk first?

180
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,320
My first kiss?

181
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,760
When I was in the ninth grade.

182
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,360
I went to a lame clothing store that sold everything from women's clothing to youth clothing with female friend.

183
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,970
We were browsing clothes.

184
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:59,640
She went into the fitting room and I waited.

185
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:05,510
"Not yet?"
"Wait a second."
I opened the door to the fitting room and there she was, beautifully dressed.

186
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,220
"This is good, buy this."
She closed the door.

187
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,790
"Are you changing now?"
"Yeah."
But I couldn't resist, so I opened the door and kissed her.

188
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,560
In the fitting room?

189
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,290
I kissed her deeply in the fitting room.

190
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,190
I have never heard this kind of story from Zakoshi.

191
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,530
When did I do that? Hmm.

192
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:31,170
At that time I had a buddy and I lived with him.

193
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,040
One day, Messenger's Kuroda-san brought a woman he picked up to my house.

194
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,780
Kuroda-san had sex with her.

195
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,920
Then Kuroda-san asked, "Do you want to do that too?"
So I did.

196
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,090
Worst story ever.

197
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,590
That's when I had my first kiss.
I had always been a virgin.

198
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,660
How old were you then?

199
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,500
I was about 24 at the time.

200
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,760
Isn't that too late?

201
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,870
Did you have a high sex drive?

202
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,070
- Sex drive?
- Yes.

203
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:07,840
Was my sex drive strong again?

204
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,980
But I used to jerk off a lot.

205
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,150
I jerked off again and again.

206
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,150
I did enough to make it to the Olympics.

207
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,690
This is the story with Seshita of Tenjiku-Nezumi.

208
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,760
He has a strong sex drive.

209
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:26,830
More than 10 years ago, I was invited by him to join him because two women were coming and he asked me if you would like to come too.

210
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,030
When I went to his house, he was reading a comic book.

211
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,300
Later, two women came to the house.

212
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,440
We drank.

213
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,540
I can say this because it was a long time ago, but four of us had sex.

214
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,740
I am ashamed to say that I am a premature ejaculator.

215
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,820
I came first, so I was in the bathroom washing my cock.

216
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:55,560
Then I heard Seshita's voice saying, "He's a pathetic senior."
He seemed to be getting cocky.

217
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,930
And I left the bathroom.

218
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:04,060
He had a woman on his lap, his right hand rubbing another woman's boob and his left hand turning the pages of a comic book.

219
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,770
That's incredible.

220
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,700
They still don't laugh at this.

221
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:17,540
As I mentioned earlier, when I worked with her, I found a 0.01mm condom in her bag.

222
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,810
- You haven't had sex, have you?
- I have!

223
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,390
No, you haven't.
So I wondered.

224
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,790
But it doesn't matter if she has it.

225
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,490
You've had that one for quite a while, haven't you?

226
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,890
Yes.

227
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,230
You only had one of those, how long have you had it?

228
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,430
One week.

229
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,430
You've had it for a week?

230
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,770
One week ago....

231
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,580
- It would be difficult to say anything private.
- If you don't want to tell us, you don't have to.

232
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,780
But I will tell you.

233
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,650
Really?

234
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,850
I have my first boyfriend.

235
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,090
Oh, really?

236
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,560
But....

237
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,460
I broke up with him a week ago.

238
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,060
I feel sorry.

239
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,600
You broke up?

240
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,970
I tried to convince him, but he said it was impossible.

241
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:16,970
So finally....

242
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,510
I told him to just let me lick his dick.

243
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,340
That's not good!

244
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,180
Why aren't they laughing!?

245
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,890
It's crazy that they don't laugh at this.

246
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,560
So I told him to just let me lick his dick.

247
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,300
- I was told no by him.
- She was turned down by him.

248
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,470
"Why not?"

249
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,500
He was wearing shorts at the time.

250
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,470
I spread my little finger as wide as I could and touched his balls.

251
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,380
I put my hand in the gap between his shorts.

252
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,220
- And you broke up?
- Yes.

253
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,590
Then finally you could touch his.

254
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,160
You didn't have sex with him?

255
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,360
I only dated him for a month.

256
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,100
So you had that condom with you at one point?

257
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,770
- Yes.
- So you've never used it?

258
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,200
- I used it once before I started dating him.
- Really?

259
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,110
I had no idea...

260
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,980
Why didn't he let me lick his dick at the end?

261
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,010
That's impossible.

262
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,850
What was so wrong about Yuriyan?

263
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,030
He told me, "I just couldn't get myself to love you."

264
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,530
- Did something happen to him?
- I have no idea.

265
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,400
You've lost weight, though.

266
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,840
I see.
But let's forget and move on.

267
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,770
I would like to hear Yamamoto-san's story as well.

268
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,240
So, tell us about the time you were naughty in Hokkaido.
(Note: 7)

269
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,480
- Have you been naughty?
- Naughty?

270
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,880
Sugarcoat it and talk about it.

271
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,450
Sugarcoat?

272
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,820
Words that cannot be said directly should be said in place of the name of the dessert.

273
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,260
For example, "17 year old cream puff".

274
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,330
- That could just be an internet hoax.
- Yeah, we want to know the truth.

275
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,070
That day...

276
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:43,320
There was an amateur baseball game the next day, so we, as players, had to stay at the hotel.

277
00:18:44,180 --> 00:19:07,410
I didn't leave the hotel because the next day was a game and there was a fireworks display in front of the hotel and lots of people.

278
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:19,290
Some of the younger players went to pick up women because of the fireworks display.

279
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,760
- Are they young comedians who are not that famous?
- Right.

280
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:33,170
Then I got a video call.
They said to the girls, "Look, it's Yamamoto-san."

281
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:43,940
They said, "Yamamoto-san, they are good girls, why don't you join us in the room for a drink?"

282
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,650
I ask them, "Are you guys old enough to drink?"

283
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,990
"Of course!", they replied.

284
00:19:53,390 --> 00:20:02,200
So I allowed a few people to come to my room.

285
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:08,240
She asked me, "Can I invite my friend?"
I said yes.

286
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,870
Then two girls entered my room.

287
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:18,050
Apparently there was a problem with those two girls.

288
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,650
The girls were wearing yukata.
(Note: 8)

289
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:38,470
We were in a very good mood.
So I said, "I think it's time for each of us to go into our individual rooms in pairs and talk separately for 20 mins."

290
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,040
They said let's do it!
We split up into each of our own rooms.

291
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:49,140
But the girls stayed in my room.

292
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,250
It's a 20-year-old cream puff.

293
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
20 cream puffs?

294
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,750
20-year-old cream puff?
No, this is different.

295
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,620
How can I put it?

296
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,030
Is is tiresome?

297
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,770
- The story is fucking long!
- Fucking long!

298
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,870
And if you're going to talk that long, don't say the name of the dessert!
We can't tell you to "Say the name of the dessert!"

299
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,110
You really suck at this!
Did you forget all your skills in Miyazaki?

300
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,340
It's okay even if it's a lie, compare it to a meat wrap rice ball.

301
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,780
If you won't say the name of the dessert, don't say the end!

302
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,820
We can make jokes about it!

303
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,180
Fucking long!

304
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,450
It's just like the old lady's wartime story.
Your story is fucking long.

305
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,790
Fucking long.
You're a fart.

306
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,930
- You're a fart.
- It stinks!

307
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,400
That's no surprise

308
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,870
Fucking long.
What the hell was that?

309
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,570
"20-year-old cream puff."

310
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,340
What did he sugarcoat?

311
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,910
- That was a little long.
- Fucking long!
- I’m irritated.

312
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,880
That's all.

313
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,280
Is it finished?

314
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,210
- Zakoshi, can I see your joke list?
- Sure.

315
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,790
- That's a lot of stuff.
- Yeah.

316
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,490
- Do an exaggerated impression of Nagano.
- Nagano.

317
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,290
This is an normal impression of Nagano.

318
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,430
"If Kuwabata-Ohara is here, then this is Osaka."

319
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,660
And this is an exaggerated impression of Nagano.

320
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,340
- What was that theory this guy just mentioned?
- Where's the essence in this?

321
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,440
- He ignores all the theories.
- There's no semblance of normal impression in this.

322
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,580
What he said earlier and what he is doing are completely different.

323
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,080
- He was lecturing them on theories earlier.
- They don't laugh.

324
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,050
These guys don't laugh easily.

325
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,090
Yeah.

326
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,260
They have come this far, I don't think they will laugh anytime soon.

327
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,590
- Are there any videos you haven't shown us yet?
- Yes, would you like to watch it?

328
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,000
Let's watch that.

329
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,560
I brought a lot of videos.

330
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,370
But you guys won't laugh when you watch this.

331
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,340
- You guys don't laugh at easy things.
- Let's relax for a moment and watch this.

332
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:04,850
This is a subliminal effect video made for a solo live performance.

333
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,710
- If you watch this, you will lose your mind.
- Here we go.

334
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,150
"Subliminal Effect."

335
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,800
"Hi."

336
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:30,840
"I'm Piss shhh shhh Saburou."

337
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:36,840
"Huh?"

338
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,050
"That is a lie."
"Hello, I am Hollywood Zakoshisho."

339
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:55,900
"The solo show to be held this time is Season 12."

340
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,900
This is in the way.

341
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,170
Subliminals are shown repeatedly?

342
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,940
- Yes, this is an exaggerated subliminal video.
- Yeah.

343
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,970
- This is no longer subliminal.
- Yes.

344
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,740
The subliminal video is longer.

345
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:17,680
"This year we managed to put on a show."

346
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,490
How does he feel when he speaks?

347
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,270
Come on!

348
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,210
Don't slow down the video you fast-forwarded on your own.

349
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,220
- This is so messed up.
- I'm losing my mind.

350
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,960
This looks like a curtain pattern.

351
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:11,840
"I will do it with the same quality as usual, so I hope everyone who comes to the venue and you who are in front of your PCs will enjoy the live performance."

352
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,740
I hate this.
I hate this the most.

353
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,950
This one started doing those things.

354
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,490
- I hate this.
- Really so.

355
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,790
"This is a subliminal effect, right?"

356
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,900
"Yeah, it's a subliminal."

357
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,200
"It's a subliminaaaal."

358
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:47,540
"It's a subliminal, subliminal, subliminal, subliminal, subliminaaaaaaal."

359
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,340
"Subliminaaaaaaal."

360
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,110
Here it is again.
I hate this too.

361
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,050
- Me too.
- Yeah.

362
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,660
- It was a long video.
- You guys endured this.

363
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,890
- I'm losing my mind.
- You guys endured this.

364
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,290
- I'm losing my mind.

365
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,860
If anyone has a video you can play it.

366
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,170
- Doesn't Kubota have a video?
- I don't have a video.

367
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:18,000
- Then I'll play another one.
- I want to watch another one.
- Yeah.

368
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,770
- We can watch this.
- Yes, we can just enjoy this.

369
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:26,050
Entertainers sometimes hold apology conferences.

370
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,950
I made an apologetic video in my own way.

371
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,990
- Is that what you made it for, in case you did something wrong?
- Yes, please watch this.

372
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:38,560
"Apology."

373
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,630
This is important.

374
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,230
You must sincerely apologize for these things.

375
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,940
- You should never joke around in these occasions.
- Of course.

376
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,580
- Is this an apology video?
- Yes.

377
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,920
- You have feces on your head.
- That's an apology.

378
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,150
That's an apology.

379
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,290
Is he not speaking because he is so emotional?

380
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,490
I see.

381
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,030
He looked forward.

382
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,470
Again?

383
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,730
This again?

384
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,840
I saw this earlier.

385
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,280
This is an apology from me.

386
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,810
This is my heartfelt apology.

387
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,480
This is my apology.

388
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,620
This is my apology.

389
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,760
Fucking long!

390
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,090
This is my heartfelt apology.

391
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,330
What part of this is an apology?

392
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,270
Why does it change color?

393
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:56,040
Why the change of color when you apologize?

394
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,840
There can be no apology by the sound of this.

395
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,880
Nice, nice!

396
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,910
Nice, nice!

397
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,420
You guys don't laugh.

398
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,920
This is not an apology.

399
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,820
This is how it is.

400
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,520
Let him apologize.

401
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,790
He has apologized most of all.

402
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,730
Me!?

403
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,800
You have apologized many times.

404
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:56,660
I am very sorry for what I have done to you.

405
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:30,030
When I was offered the chance to participate in this time's Documenl Champion Tournament, I wondered how I could make everyone laugh more than they did.

406
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,570
But I can't think of that at all.

407
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:55,260
At the meeting stage with the staff I told them I couldn't do it.

408
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:09,400
So I decided to at least have fun.
I figured I was going to leaving soon anyway.

409
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:21,550
However, since I was there, I decided to do something before leaving.

410
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,050
But only time passed.
I am truly sorry!

411
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,020
He apologized firmly.

412
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,690
What an honest man he is.

413
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,160
- He told us everything without disguise.
- That's good.

414
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:43,870
- One hour left.  Good luck to everyone.
- Thank you.

415
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,140
- See you guys.
- That was a good apology, though.

416
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:52,980
He has come this far with that in mind.

417
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,820
- The dessert thing was also terrible.
- 20 year old cream puff.

418
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,390
"20 year old cream puff.....No, 20 cream puffs."

419
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,330
- It didn't make sense.
- Yeah.

420
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:10,560
What will the four of them do in the remaining hour?

421
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,340
"What kind of work do you do?"
(Note: 9)

422
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:21,310
This is an impression of Akko-san done by Shachihoko.
(Note: 10)

423
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,280
"What kind of work do you do?"

424
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,710
"What kind of work do you do?"

425
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:32,250
I work part time in a Chinese restaurant.

426
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,760
Is that so?
Then that's good.
I didn't know that.

427
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:40,830
"What kind of work do you do?"

428
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,730
What kind of work do you do?

429
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:47,800
- I sing songs.
- Really? What kind of songs do you sing?

430
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,140
I sing songs.
What kind of work do you do?

431
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,540
- I do not know your song.
- What kind of work do you do?

432
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,580
- Don't touch me.
- What kind of work do you do?

433
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,930
What would I be able to do if I went in that room?

434
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,140
- Matsumoto-san is going to that room?
- But should I stop doing that?

435
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,470
Wow, it's great.

436
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,070
- I'll do something you might like.
- Really?

437
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,980
- I'll do an impression of Kaminuma-san.
- Don't do that!
(Note: 11)

438
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,550
- Kaminuma-san.
- Don't do that!

439
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,810
This is a normal impression of Kaminuma-san.

440
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:40,550
"Miki is very hilarious!"
"They are really hilarious!"
"I like their comedy."

441
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,560
And this is an exaggerated  impression of Kaminuma.

442
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,700
Desaane.

443
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,940
Kaminuma-san is not like that.

444
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,380
What?
This is an exaggerated one.

445
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,780
- Shall I do an impression of Kaminuma-san?
- Please.

446
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,550
- Normal impression of Kaminuma-san.
- Normal Kaminuma?

447
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,880
Please say Kaminuma-SAN.
When I hear that name, I panic.

448
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,850
This is an impression of Kaminuma when she is on Chatting Cooking.

449
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,820
What am I supposed to do!?

450
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,160
What am I supposed to do?

451
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,360
Do you realize that this is a Champion tournament?

452
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,870
Then I'll go over there.

453
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,600
- I don't know what I can do.
- This is the first time.

454
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,340
- Okay, I'll leave the card here.
- Yes.

455
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,010
- This is the first time this has happened.
- I wonder what is going to happen.

456
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:44,180
They will be very surprised.
They will not understand the situation at first.

457
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,150
They will think he probably came to tell them something.

458
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,390
Oh, never mind.

459
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,030
You guys are hilarious, though.

460
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,730
They will not be able to grasp this situation.

461
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,970
They will have suspicions.

462
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,440
It's a...

463
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,280
Shall we play Shiritori then?
(Note: 12)

464
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,680
Ah, Shiritori.

465
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,020
The air of the room has changed.

466
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,460
Let's play Shiritori with the names of fictional Hollywood stars.

467
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,360
Fictional Hollywood stars.

468
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:32,700
Don't say the name of a real person.
Please tell me the Hollywood star's name who could exist.

469
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,800
Who to start with?

470
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,200
Okay, let's start with Kubota.

471
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,310
Let's say it at the right tempo.

472
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,510
Hollywood stars...

473
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,610
Polsed Lucamaniya
(ぽるせっとるかまにや)

474
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,680
- Huh?
- Polsed Lucamaniya.

475
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,590
Polsed....Lucamaniya.

476
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,120
Avil Cage.
(あびるけいじ)

477
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,890
You are wrong.
That's a "や" for the last letter.

478
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:01,960
Sorry.

479
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Yavil Cage.
(やびるけいじ)

480
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,130
Okay, Yavil Cage.

481
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,770
Next is "じ".

482
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,200
Jun Chicken.
(じゅんちきん)

483
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,970
That's a "ん" for the last letter.

484
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,880
This is a Shiritori.

485
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,280
Why did you say the word ん in the last letter?

486
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,150
Chickenback.
Jun Chickenback.
(じゅんちきんばっく)

487
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,520
- What's with that family name?
- Chickenback.

488
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,890
Is there such a person?

489
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,020
Of course.

490
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:35,630
If you need to deliberate as you are doing now, please also tell us what the actor has performed.

491
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,600
Jun Chickenback?
What movie was he in?

492
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,770
The movie he appeared in was...

493
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,640
"A Newborn Lion."

494
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,840
- Did he win any awards for that work?
- Yes.

495
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,210
- He won the award for Best Supporting Actor.
- Really?

496
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,780
- Jun Chickenback?
- Yes.

497
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,250
Next is く.

498
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,590
Kusekusse Kusee
(くせくっせくーせー)
(Note: 13)

499
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:03,120
- Hey, that's wrong.
- That's wrong, Zakoshi.

500
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,090
- Kusekusse Kusee?
- Yes.

501
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,460
- Next is せ.
- Names beginning with せ...

502
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,730
Sempotarchi Tapo.

503
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,100
Sempotarchi Tampon.
(せんぽたーちたんぽん)

504
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,240
Sempotarchi Tampon.

505
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:19,910
That's an "ん" for the last letter.

506
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,010
Sempotarchi Tapo.
(せんぽたーちたぽ)

507
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,080
Sempotarchi Tapo.

508
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,310
That is not a name like a Hollywood star.

509
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,220
Is that so?
He was in a good movie.

510
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,020
Tapo?
Next is Po.

511
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,820
Paul Paul Paular.
(ぽーるぽーるぽーらー)

512
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,360
Paul Paul...?

513
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,630
Paul Paular?
Paul...?

514
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,930
Paul Paul Paular.

515
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,500
Paul Paul Paular?

516
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,500
Next is ら.

517
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,200
Lant Hihi.
(らんとひひ)

518
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,370
Isn't that a Mantohihi(Hamadryas baboon)?

519
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,710
The movie he performed in is Mantohihi(Hamadryas baboon).

520
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,450
The movie he performed in is Mantohihi(Hamadryas baboon).

521
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,320
The name and the name of the work happen to be similar?

522
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:08,320
His name was similar to Mantohihi, so he was appointed.

523
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,860
- Is he playing the part of a Mantohihi?
- Of course.

524
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,030
- Is the movie interesting?
- Yes.

525
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,500
How many hours is the film?

526
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,270
This is a short film.
So this is about an 8 minute film.

527
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,040
This film is available in several short story anthologies.

528
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,770
It is drawn from the scene of his birth in this film.

529
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,270
Lanto Hihi.

530
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:29,880
Next is ひ.

531
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,280
Hiku Hiku John Polnareff
(ひくひくじょんぽるなれふ)

532
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,820
No, no, no...

533
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,150
There are people with those names.
(Note: 14)

534
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,490
- Hiku Hiku? He's an unusual name.
- Yes.

535
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,730
Can I switch to wrestling moves?

536
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,060
Sure.

537
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,500
Then start with Zakoshi.

538
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:58,740
- What is the first letter?
- Say a wrestling move that might exist.
- Okay.

539
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,340
Don't tell me the wrestling moves that exist.

540
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,480
Piss Lock.
(しょんべんがため)

541
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,950
Piss Lock...

542
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,980
Yeah, that doesn't exist.
Next is め.

543
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,890
Let's say it at the right tempo.

544
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,260
Smear Feces to the Eyeballs and Press.
(めんたまぬりぐそつぶし)

545
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,130
Smear feces?

546
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,600
Smear feces to the eyeballs.

547
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,500
This is a technique that heel wrestlers do.

548
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,140
Next is し.

549
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,110
Feed Them to Shiba Dog.
(しばいぬくわせ)

550
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,010
- You're going to feed your opponents to dogs?
- Yes.

551
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,350
- The opponents are fed to the Shiba Dog.
- Yes.

552
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,550
Feed Them to Shiba Dog!?

553
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,490
This move involves calling a Shiba dog and having the dog eat the opponent.

554
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:49,860
That's scary!

555
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,860
Next is せ.

556
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,100
"45 minutes for you to touch my back."
(せなかまでよんじゅうごふん)
(Note: 15)

557
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,200
That last letter is ん.

558
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,100
Again?

559
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,070
Why?

560
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,100
"45 minutes for you to touch my back - Lock."
(せなかまでよんじゅうごふんがため)

561
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,610
Next is め.

562
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,380
Hey, what kind of wrestler's moves is that?

563
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,010
Destiny Shiba Dog.

564
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,720
You are influenced by hers.

565
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,120
Is Feed Them to Shiba Dog one of...

566
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,590
That is one of Destiny Shiba Dog's moves.

567
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,060
That's what she said earlier.

568
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,890
You are influenced by Shiba dog one.

569
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:29,200
It was pretty fun.

570
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,160
- It was a meaningful time.
- Oh, no one laughed.

571
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,900
It may finish with no one laughing anymore.

572
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,440
What will they do in the last 30 minutes?

573
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,000
Good luck.

574
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,480
- See you.
- Thank you.

575
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,040
Only 30 minutes left!

576
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,310
- Gosh!
- Yes, you have 30 minutes left.

577
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,020
They really don't laugh, do they?

578
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:58,260
They have to do it with all the limiters off.

579
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:02,160
They didn't laugh at all.

580
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,930
Perhaps there is no such thing as laughing in their thinking.

581
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:10,000
- There were several funny points.
- Yeah.

582
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:14,240
- He's come.
- He came again.

583
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,910
What do you want?

584
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,940
Ouch.

585
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,610
What are you doing!?

586
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,850
In the end, Fuwa-chan didn't say anything.

587
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,390
he is using words she won't normally use.

588
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,660
He probably doesn't know much about her.

589
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,790
Wht's this?

590
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,160
I'll do an impression of Noda Crystal.
(Note: 16)

591
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,160
"I don't want to grab the strap!"

592
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:42,300
"I don't want to grab the strap!"

593
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:50,510
Hey, your soles are too dirty!

594
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,020
He laughed!?

595
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,020
You laughed.

596
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,020
I would like him to watch the replay.

597
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,930
This needs to be checked.

598
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:11,830
Did Yama-san or Kubota laugh?

599
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,770
I would like him to watch the replay.

600
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,710
I didn't get a good look at it.
So I will check.

601
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:24,980
Who laughed?

602
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,180
Yamamoto-san laughed when I said "Hey, your soles are too dirty!"

603
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,250
Sorry if I'm wrong.

604
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:55,740
This is alright.

605
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,340
This was alright.

606
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:04,220
You don't do Fuwa-chan jokes?

607
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:10,760
This joke is incomplete.

608
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,390
- Is it still  incomplete?
- Yes.

609
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,190
That's not good.

610
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:23,540
Fucking long!
If you're going to talk, talk quickly!

611
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:27,140
So, was it alright this time?

612
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,210
Yes.

613
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,380
Anyway, Yamamoto was alright.

614
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,250
Here we go.

615
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,450
There are only 20 minutes left.

616
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:44,390
I do an impression of the clerk in Ganbare Goemon(NES).

617
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,690
The clerk in Ganbare Goemon(NES).

618
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,240
- There was a guy like that.
- Yeah.

619
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,940
There was a guy like that.

620
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,710
But now that guy is gone.

621
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,180
Hey, you're scaring me.
What are you doing?

622
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,820
- Hey, your mouth is bleeding!
- Don't bleed from the mouth!

623
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,820
- Yuriyan?
- Are you okay?

624
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,560
Lots of blood.

625
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,890
That just turned me off!

626
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,700
This is a mouth ulcer.

627
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,800
- You bleed too much from your mouth.
- Did you bite your tongue?

628
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,100
- This is a mouth ulcer.
- You were coughing up blood like when you bit your tongue.

629
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,310
If I were Chidori Nobu, I would say this.
(Note: 17)

630
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,380
Squid, squid!

631
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,950
Squid, squid, squid, two squid sushi!

632
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,620
He never says that.

633
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,550
Two squid sushi!

634
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:54,390
Squid, squid, squid, two squid sushi!

635
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:59,430
- They're awesome.
- How tough.

636
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,100
They are tough.

637
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,270
I'll do an impression of Viking.
(Note: 18)

638
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,940
Nishimura: "I haven't been to this school in a long time, so I miss it."

639
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,110
Nishimura: "Oh, that's Kotouge-sensei, who was my homeroom teacher!"

640
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,920
Nishimura: "Kotouge-sensei, long time no see!
It's Nishimura!"

641
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,050
Kotouge: "Who are you?"

642
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:23,320
Nishimura: "Don't you remember me?
It's Nishimura!"

643
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,390
Kotouge: "I don't remember you."

644
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,530
- That was like him?
- Yeah.

645
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:34,100
What if you exaggerate it?

646
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,430
Enough exaggeration already.

647
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,600
An exaggerated impression of Viking.

648
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,980
An exaggerated impression of Viking.

649
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,380
Is this alright or out?

650
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:51,650
Is this alright too?

651
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,150
I'll do an impression of the person in charge after I bombed on the local stage.

652
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:58,360
A comedian bombed on stage.
Afterwards, the person in charge came to the dressing room.

653
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,130
The person in charge is angry.

654
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:03,000
"Thank you very much!!"

655
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,330
"Thank you and see you next time!!"

656
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,770
- He is angry.
- Who does that?

657
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:13,110
I'll do an impression of the school principal who greeting the students.

658
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,240
He suddenly becomes louder.

659
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,550
"I hope you all know...."

660
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:25,750
"what a great school THIS is."

661
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,920
There is no one like that.

662
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,620
Can I try it?

663
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:37,760
New Year's greeting from a head of yakuza I saw on Youtube.

664
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:41,270
He suddenly spoke louder.

665
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,310
"Today is a celebratory day."

666
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:49,270
"I'm glad you guys are alive."

667
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:54,810
"It's a life or death world, so we have to work with gusto this year."

668
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,350
"Don't get carried away.
You know what I mean?
Then grab a glass."

669
00:45:58,350 --> 00:45:59,180
CHEERS!!

670
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,320
Fuck, this is piss!

671
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,390
Someone tell me that in advance!

672
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,160
If I told you that, you would say, "Don't ruin my joke."

673
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,600
Someone tell me that in advance!

674
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,440
We all knew that!

675
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,270
They still don't laugh at this!

676
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,140
They never laugh?

677
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,110
Are you okay?

678
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,450
- Stop saying that every time.
- Are you okay?

679
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,510
Don't say that to me every time.

680
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,650
Why is he so angry?

681
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:32,820
Like last time, stop worrying after I make a joke.

682
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,790
"I'm Sumiko Sumioka!"
(Note: 19)

683
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,190
No, it's not.
It's Nishioka.

684
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:41,930
Nishi in Nishioka.
Sumi in Sumioka.

685
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:46,970
They eventually became one and Sumiko Sumioka was born.

686
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,070
Draw!!

687
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,900
Ippon!

688
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,470
- I'll do an exaggerated impression of 2700.
- What?
(Note: 20)

689
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,740
First, I'll do a normal impression of 2700.

690
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,910
"Right elbow and left elbow.
Look at these alternately."

691
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:05,080
And this is an exaggerated impression of 2700.

692
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,450
"Right piss and left piss.
Piss these out alternately."

693
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,890
"Right piss and left piss.
Piss these out alternately."

694
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:13,830
- Stop flailing your dick.
- So?

695
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:16,700
- Please top flailing that.
- What are you asking for?

696
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,370
Say something!

697
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,070
Does it make sense to fix the microphone with a compress?

698
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,410
- What's this?
- I'm putting a compress right here.

699
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:32,080
- Really?
- Yes.

700
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,280
It's to keep the skin from getting rougher, isn't it?

701
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,420
- It's to keep the skin from...
- Shut up. What are you talking about?

702
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,750
- It's to keep the skin from getting rougher, isn't it?
- You've been loud all along, you stupid bastard.

703
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,990
- What the hell are you?
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

704
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,960
Hey, someone cut a hole in my chest and tie this mic on!

705
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,060
- Then I'll drill a hole in it like this, shall I?
- Do it!

706
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,130
That's enough!

707
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,500
Are you okay?

708
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:54,070
"Are you okay?"
What the hell are you saying?

709
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:55,500
"I'm fine!"
(Note: 21)

710
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,440
You aren't fine.

711
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,040
"I'm fine!"

712
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,900
Don't go next!

713
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,740
- "Let's go next!"
- Don't go next!

714
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:03,140
I've got a video of "I'm fine", so watch it.

715
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:05,080
Is he showing the video at this time?

716
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,310
Show me that.

717
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:09,780
- About 10 minutes left.
- A video of "I'm fine"?

718
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:11,720
Please show this.

719
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:13,690
Thanks.

720
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,320
"I'm fine."

721
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,590
Did you put a mirror in the middle of his face?

722
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,290
"I'm fine."

723
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:22,530
"I'm fine."

724
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,800
- "I'm fine."
- I'm fine.

725
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:36,170
Fucking long!

726
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,110
Why does it take this guy so long to say it?

727
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,650
Why he...

728
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:41,950
"I'm fine!"

729
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,720
- This is scary.
- Are you scared?

730
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:49,250
There are more.
Would you like to watch the others?

731
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,060
How about this?

732
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:51,920
Please show this.

733
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,260
- Quiz: Balls are Show by Shoubai?
- Jyow by Jyobai.
(Note: 22)

734
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,860
Let's get started!
Guess what he is making!

735
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:06,740
- What's he making?
- What's he making?

736
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,880
- Surely this is something obscene.
- What's he making?

737
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,480
There is a blur on something.

738
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,510
What's he making?

739
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,480
The correct answer was soy sauce.

740
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,450
It's soy sauce.

741
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,460
- Isn't this the juice from your ass?
- It's soy sauce.

742
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,590
It had nothing to do with the clues video.

743
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,500
- There are only 7 minutes left.
- And...

744
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:35,800
The anime has a preview of the next episode.

745
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,800
I made a video that I put together just a preview of the next episode.

746
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:40,440
Watch this.

747
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,580
The next preview of the anime.

748
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:52,990
Preview of the next episode
"Chimbou man came back to shit and piss, dangling Chimbou."

749
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,820
"Now a new legend of poop is revived."

750
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:00,330
"Next time, Fist of the Chimbou.
[The Saviors Hold Chimbou!]"

751
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:04,260
"You already have a pepper stuck in your urethra."

752
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:12,100
Preview of the next episode
"Finally, Chinko of the Balls General, the user of the piss-shit fucking stinks fist, began to shit."

753
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:20,750
- "Next time, Fist of the Chimbou [My balls were crushed!  Dick! Crush all the balls in a vise!!]
- Is this just a compilation of the previews for the next episode?
- Yes, this is like Fist of the North Star.
(Note: 23)

754
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:26,920
"Your Chimbou has already been run over with a road roller."

755
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,690
"Chimbou incarnated, Chimbou Reverse!"

756
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:34,460
"How does Chimbou-ro stand up to giant balls with amazing smells?"

757
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:41,300
"Next time, Fist of the Chimbou.
[Fist of shit!
Once I start shitting, I can't stop!!]"

758
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:46,170
"Let me put a pepper in your urethra."

759
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:47,410
"Let me put a pepper in yours."

760
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:50,180
- Wasn't that already put in there?
- No.

761
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,410
No one laughed at that either.

762
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,550
Does anyone laugh at this hour?

763
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:55,880
- It was funny.
- Right?

764
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,620
What's this?

765
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:05,320
What are you going to do now?

766
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,600
I'm fan lady. I will do Fan Lady at this time.
(Note: 24)

767
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,570
Turn on the faaaaan.

768
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,180
We are Rice.
Turn on the faaaaan.
(Note: 25)

769
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:24,980
Rice-san?

770
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,210
I'm Fan Lady.

771
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:30,020
Introduce me to a womaaaan.

772
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,320
Turn off the faaaaan.

773
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:37,090
Put lava in my urethra.

774
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:40,460
Put airsoft pellets in my urethraaaaa.

775
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,390
Put me in your urethraaaaaa.

776
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,500
Put a fortune in my urethraaaaa.

777
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:48,870
- You shudder when pull that fortune out of your urethraaaaa.
- Its fortune is excellent luuuuuck.

778
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,440
Let me tie that fortune to your urethraaaaa.

779
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,070
Now it is your turn to say.

780
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,850
Make that fortune a small fortune from a big fortune.

781
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,220
That's nothing match....

782
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,520
There are only two minutes left.

783
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,060
Look!

784
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:19,000
What should I look for?
What are you doing?

785
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,270
What are you doing?

786
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,440
What the hell is that?

787
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:31,880
- What the hell is that?
- Did you just wet your bangs?

788
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,110
Did you just wet your bangs?

789
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:37,580
I will do an impression of AMEMIYA.
(Note: 26)

790
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:46,560
"I have tried this since early spring until I was satisfied with the taste of this just in time for summer."

791
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,790
"And today."
"And today."

792
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,900
Why does he exaggerate that phrase?

793
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:54,130
- And today.
- You just repeat that part?

794
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,050
Is that all you do?

795
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:28,470
30 seconds left.

796
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:34,810
They have great stamina.

797
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:39,580
- Where are you going?
- Ouch!

798
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,250
We have to kill each other now!

799
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,430
It's over!

800
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,310
Great!

801
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,940
- It's over.
- I'm tired.

802
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,040
I was the most tired I've ever been.

803
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,550
I can't do it.
Champion is strong!

804
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:17,320
So strong!

805
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,120
- Everyone is strong!
- Everyone is not laughing!

806
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,820
Nothing works!

807
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,390
But I fought!
I have no regrets!

808
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,990
Thank you!

809
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:38,000
- You guys are awesome!
- Nice fight!

810
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,770
You guys have great stamina.

811
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,910
It was a masterpiece.
You guys fought well for 6 hours.

812
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,150
So...

813
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:51,180
The winner of the Grand Champion competition is....

814
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:56,820
Zakoshi!

815
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,460
Hell yeah!

816
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,490
Is it serious!?
Thank you!

817
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:10,240
You had a great number of moves.

818
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,340
He did not run out of stamina until the end.

819
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:17,640
Really?
Kubota was strong.
So I didn't think I could win.

820
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,750
- No,no.
- Your moves were tremendous.

821
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,250
You had a lot of moves and Chimbou.

822
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:26,750
This is a show where Chimbou is allowed.

823
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,950
I never said I would allow Chimbou, though.

824
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:32,760
- But maybe it is allowed.
- Thank you.

825
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,130
Kubota and Yuryan also did well.

826
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,200
Yamamoto didn't work that hard.

827
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:41,370
- I am so sorry.
- What's wrong with you?

828
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:48,340
I can only say that I am truly sorry.
Let me say one thing.

829
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:52,110
I am not trying not to laugh that hard.

830
00:55:52,380 --> 00:56:03,560
I'd try to make some jokes, but my mind just went blank.
So I couldn't think about offense or defense.

831
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,360
Fucking long.

832
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:10,530
You were warned about the cream puff one, weren't you?

833
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:14,500
I am really sorry.

834
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:18,170
- I am so sorry everyone.
- Fucking long.

835
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,470
Matsumoto-san, I am so sorry.

836
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,740
You haven't made a single joke yet.

837
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:33,220
So the winner of the Grand Champion Tournament is Zakoshi!

838
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,190
I'm so happy!

839
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:37,190
- Perfect!
- Thank you!

840
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:43,530
I got this!

841
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,870
This is the third time I have won 10 million yen!

842
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,870
I am really tired.

843
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:51,840
They didn't laugh when I did that.

844
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,210
And Yuriyan...

845
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,190
Whenever I made a joke, she would always join in.

846
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,100
So I hated her.

847
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,840
I don't always score points if I make jokes.

848
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:31,910
- But it was good.
-It was perfect.

00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,250
Niiiiiice.

850
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:41,150
- Thank you for the 6 hours.
- Thank you.

851
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:51,560
It was amazing.
Especially in the second half we enjoyed it a lot.

852
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:02,710
This is a quality that I think the viewer will be fully satisfied with.

853
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:06,180
They were really great defensively.

854
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,130
He won 30 million yen for a show.

855
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:30,870
Yeah.
But I think it's good.
It's hard to find someone who can do that.

856
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:49,320
He's not on a five-day weekend tomorrow, is he?

857
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:54,630
He probably has work tomorrow.

858
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,860
That is unthinkable.

859
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:12,040
Dedicated to all Gaki fans
