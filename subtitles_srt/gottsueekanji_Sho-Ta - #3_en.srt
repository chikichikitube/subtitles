1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,000
Sho-ta!

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,680
Honey, I can't believe
it's already been a month.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,850
Seems like yesterday.

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:18,050
Sho-ta! - Hey, keep it together.

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,310
(Not now.)

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,410
It's so boring down here.
- It's gonna be boring for a long time.

7
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:37,180
I hadn't done anything for a month.
- It's going to be that way for a long time

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,710
Let's play. - No.

9
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,880
Please. - Keep it down.

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,780
I want to play. - No.

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,850
How about karaoke? - No way.

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,480
Here, let's do it.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,080
I can't do it.

14
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,780
Funky guts man!

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,910
Funky guts man!

16
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,550
This flame of my life, Funky guts man!

17
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,850
For all the friends I love!

18
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,080
What are you doing? - I'm
sorry for what he did.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,980
Say "Funky guts man!" - Imada, hold him.

20
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,050
You don't wanna fall behind the times,
do you?

21
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,480
Itao, cut it out. - So very sorry.
- What the hell are you talking about?

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,980
It's 49th day anniversary of Sho-ta. - Yes.

23
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,650
Cut that crap. - I just thought
that will raise...

24
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:45,010
What's wrong with him? - I'm so sorry.
Itao, don't do that again. - I won't. Sorry.

25
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,380
Please go on.
- No more crap, OK?

26
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,880
If you don't need me here just say it.
- I'm terribly sorry, please go on.

27
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,210
Your padding went off.
What's so funny?

28
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,880
So you want to play now?

29
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,580
No. That's enough.

30
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,310
Why? - Just 30 minutes.
Just be still for 30 minutes.

31
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,210
How about this?

32
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,750
That's out of the question! - Why?

33
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,880
It would be fun. - It would be a booming roar. How can I possibly cover it up?!

34
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,380
Hey! Stop it!

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,280
Pan!(=Bang!) Pan!

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,180
Hey, you panpan(=prostitute)!
How much is it?!

37
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,710
Just tell the damn price!
- What the hell are you doing?!

38
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:03,310
The price! - What did you call her?! - Just what are you trying to do?!

39
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,950
That's enough! Cut it out!
Put that away. - I'm sorry.

40
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,680
Are you out of mind?

41
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,750
That's way out of line! - I'm sorry.

42
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,050
Obviously he doesn't want me here.
- No. Please.

43
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,250
For my son. - I understand that.

44
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,810
Enough already!

45
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
Why can't we play?

46
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,910
No. - Why? - Because I said so!

47
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,010
Why? - Just be still!

48
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,250
Oh, I got a good idea.
How about knocking this down?

49
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,780
Knocking what? - The tombstone.

50
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,010
Would be fun. - No.

51
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,410
This thing is absolutely nonsense!

52
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,650
What do you think you're doing?
- What is nonsense? - Nonsense!

53
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,480
Imada, stop him.

54
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,650
Are you OK? - Stop it!

55
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,550
What is he thinking?! I'm leaving!
- Wait!

56
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,610
Look at me!
