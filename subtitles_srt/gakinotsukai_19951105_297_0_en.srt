1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,970
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,500
Yamazaki Housei

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,970
Yamazaki Housei's seven transformations!

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,270
To be honest we already did this, I did

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,080
Hamada Masatoshi

6
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,170
I did it and it was quite a success

7
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,580
Matsumoto Hitoshi

8
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,240
Then I thought about

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,470
How will it turn out if you did it too yourself

10
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,850
Thanks a lot

11
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,650
I've observed you

12
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,780
And studied a lot

13
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,190
And I've been thinking a lot

14
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,950
To come up with hilarious skits

15
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,890
The problem is I don't think everyone will laugh

16
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,190
Nah, you can't say that for sure

17
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,630
Is that so?   - By now...

18
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,700
Everyone thinks of me as a bull's-eye

19
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,000
'Cause they're kinda aiming at me, you know

20
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,100
I'm fun--

21
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,600
I have no idea what the hell "aiming at me" could mean

22
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,310
'Cause its grammar is weird

23
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,580
You know I'm like a bull's-eye for them

24
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,210
Like, the core essence of comedy

25
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,680
Are you saying you are usually
the one who laughs at other's jokes the most?

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,280
No, that's not it

27
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm saying I hit their spots with what I do

28
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,350
But it could happen that no one laughs

29
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,120
Yeah

30
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,420
I'd say more like they won't be able to laugh

31
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,320
Unable to laugh

32
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,390
No way they won't laugh!

33
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,860
They just have to resist, right?

34
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,130
In case someone laughs

35
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,370
EACH TIME ONE PERSON LAUGHS, THEY'LL PAY 1000 YEN

36
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,370
RULES EXPLANATION:

37
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,370
THE COLLECTED MONEY WILL BE DONATED TO THE KOBATO FOUNDATION

38
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,160
Yes, what about them?

39
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,230
In the worst case    - Yes?

40
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,370
They'll have to pay a penalty

41
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,770
How many years have been since you know us?

42
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,940
Well, It's been 7 years since I've met you two

43
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,940
7 years    - Right

44
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,750
In this time span I've never laughed at your jokes

45
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,180
Of course you did!

46
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,080
You've laughed few times!

47
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,650
He said "few times"    - "few"

48

THIS IS A NO-PROFIT FANSUB, MADE BY A FAN FOR OTHER FANS

53
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,560
PLANNING MEETING

54
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,990
Let's just try to figure this out

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,630
I wonder why it's always so hard
to decide when it comes to Yamazaki

56
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,770
I wonder why

57
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,570
In the end I think

58
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,510
We should find a partner for Yamazaki

59
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,210
Maybe something like
Yamazaki-Jimmy or Yamazaki-Degawa

60
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,410
Who?

61
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,710
I see

62
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,450
But not them

63
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,280
We had enough

64
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,820
The question is: who?

65
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,850
I think Suga-chan suits Yamazaki well

66
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,920
I mean Suga-chan is...

67
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,160
KENJI

68
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,160
SUGA

69
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,160
producer

70
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,920
I'd be fine with it

71
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,090
Is that so?    - Yeah

72
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,260
You know, when paired up with Yamazaki

73
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,430
Everyone ends up going home in low spirits

74
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,030
Most of them end up calling Noriyasu on the telephone

75
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,910
NORIYASU HIROMITSU

76
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,910
YAMAZAKI'S FORMER PARTNER

77
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,740
And they ask him "what should I do now?"

78
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,240
Someone will give in

79
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,670
That's not for sure

80
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,940
Or maybe just some cougar

81
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,750
I mean, as his partner

82
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,520
I wonder if a woman would fit in it

83
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Nah, it would be hard

84
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,660
Maybe we're overthinking it

85
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,360
Are we?

86
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,200
If we don't have nothing let it be

87
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,870
So?

88
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,710
You shouldn't look behind

89
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,000
Matsumoto got away with it

90
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,170
He tilted his head in a flash

91
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,720
I averted my eyes because I mean

92
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,050
That was just the first one

93
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,220
You're right, I see what you mean

94
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,260
I mean, I think I've doubted his skills

95
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,460
Yeah me too

96
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,490
But really, what should we do now?

97
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,160
What could it be?

98
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,060
If we have to find a partner,
maybe we can try to do a one-on-one

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,070
How many people do we need?

100
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,170
I think 5 would do the job    - Right?

101
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,470
And switch them in case

102
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,410
All at once, right?

103
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,710
So, stick him with 5 guys?   - Yeah

104
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,210
Let's start

105
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,130
PENALTY

106
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,720
That's the plan, right?

107
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,330
There aren't much actors for this

108
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,030
That's right

109
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,010
You just shouted, didn't you?

110
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,610
This one was merciless

111
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,420
By this time

112
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,700
I think we have nothing left but doing as we thought

113
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,000
What should we do?

114
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,920
PENALTY

115
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,130
PENALTY

116
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,300
It was hard to endure his face when he entered

117
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,830
You're doing great today

118
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,830
Actually I'm like

119
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,300
How about a second episode of the
popularity contest including Yamazaki?

120
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,940
With Yamazaki alone?    - Yeah

121
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,940
I wonder if it'll make him popular

122
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,540
A copy, please

123
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,380
A popularity contest...

124
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,700
Hello?

125
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,600
Hello?

126
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,360
Oh...

127
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,530
Was it George?

128
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:49,800
Ok

129
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,900
Michael?

130
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,200
Ok

131
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,320
Bye bye

132
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,860
PENALTY

133
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,750
You know, a looong time ago

134
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,330
There were tons of tv shows with office lady-like girls

135
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,190
Each of them?

136
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,190
No but, like, lots of them

137
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,200
Starting from "Ohayo Asaten"

138
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,430
You're right

139
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,870
How about we all get a tattoo?

140
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,170
Not the tattoos, please

141
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,400
Why is that?

142
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,040
Don't say that, I have one myself

143
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,910
Oh, I'm sorry

144
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,430
I have no idea what to do...

145
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,230
PENALTY

146
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,660
We don't want to do lame stuff

147
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,920
PENALTY

148
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,050
Any suggestion?

149
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,650
I really have no idea

150
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,220
I don't even know what can be funny

151
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,050
No idea

152
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,590
What should we do?

153
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,690
That was so unfair

154
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,690
Why one by one?

155
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,860
I have no idea

156
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,660
I lost it at Suga-chan's beating

157
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,990
That was the best part

158
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,370
PENALTY

159
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Maybe something fun could
happen if we all put Yamazaki in a bag

160
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,670
Sounds weird but alright

161
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,700
Even more than one

162
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,840
More?

163
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,920
PENALTY

164
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,300
Can we come up with something?

165
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,010
PENALTY

166
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,470
Nothing yet?

So irritating...

174

If anything, you got Matsumoto 5 times

175
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,850
Did I laugh 5 times!?

176
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,450
I've paid only 3 times

177
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,690
Oh
