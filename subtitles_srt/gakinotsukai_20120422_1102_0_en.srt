1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:06,040
It's time for the Murakami Shoji's class series no one asked for

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,890
On his latest episode, the feudal lord class,
he set a new record with his low 5.5% ratings

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,410
Not only that...

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,510
Huh? What's that?

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,810
Another feudal lord?

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,560
Real feudal lord - Tokuma Nishioka

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,730
What are you doing here? Why don't you come to my class instead?

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:32,370
It ended up with the real feudal lord
Nishioka taking over his entire class

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,540
I'm a feudal lord and I'm feud up with all of this!

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,540
Which will be today's class about?

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,280
Downtown (Matsumoto Hitoshi & Hamada Masatoshi)
Cocorico (Endo Shozo & Tanaka Naoki)     Yamazaki Hosei

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,640
We came after all

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,650
Are you a granny?

14
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,980
Is this "granny classroom"?

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,310
If so, you'll get a full score on it

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,410
Are you in charge of this?

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,250
You seem to be our master

18
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,890
That's not it

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,520
We already have one

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,570
Actually

21
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,700
I heard that he disappeared without explanations

22
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,210
But really, I wonder what is this?

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,660
I want to know

24
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,430
Same costumes

25
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,940
Today will be...

26
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,580
"Michael Jackson classroom", it seems

27
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,900
I think it will be better than learning from Michael himself

28
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,210
Is it okay to say this?

29
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,420
I wouldn't want him to abuse me, you know

30
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,420
It's our senior but I guess you can say it

31
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,300
Anyway, during our meetings he always says
"I want to do this and this and this..."

32
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,530
And that's amazing

33
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:30,930
Yeah

34
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,800
But when we're actually filming, everything becomes half-assed

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,490
Such a waste of spirit

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,880
Murakami Shoji's Classroom Series!

40
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,880
Nothing will ever happen today!

41
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,350
On their way to the park where they'll meet

42
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,840
To be honest I don't know much about Michael

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,100
Unfortunately

44
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,310
But you do, right Yamazaki?

45
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,760
Yeah I actually like him a lot

46
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,020
Really?
- Yeah

47
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,010
Why is he making us join him?

48
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,290
There's a sign

49
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,880
We don't even know much

50
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,700
"Michael Jackson Classroom - wait here"

51
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,930
"koko de wait"

52
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,800
Is there really no one else besides us?

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,900
Right, now that you mention it

54
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,160
Someone should do this

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,860
Yeah, like some young comedians
- That's right

56
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,030
I think Fruit Punch or such would do this

57
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,430
That's undoubtedly him

58
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,370
He's here

59
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,650
Murakami Shoji

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,970
That's the real deal

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,710
No doubts

62
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,110
That's him from back then

63
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,040
I don't know much about him but I heard about this earlier

64
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,040
He moved while staying so stiff

65
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,090
That was unexpectedly quick

66
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,620
So fast

67
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:57,780
Please, do not expect much from today's episode

68
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:57,780
nothing in particular is going to happen overall.

69
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,340
Is that it?

70
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,500
I wonder

71
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,210
You can tell he practiced

72
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,400
He laughed at himself

73
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,930
No good, I made one mistake in a dance move

74
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,600
If Michael was

75
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,600
avil

76
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,600
liv...

77
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,600
still alive to this day

78
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,600
He would have been so mad right now!

79
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,590
Eh? What?

80
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,060
What was that?

81
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,240
But now he's peacefully resting

82
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,240
I can tell you're surprised

83
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,540
Like, "weren't you dead?!"

84
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,130
I'm the second generation

85
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,340
Janet called me and told me the next Michael should be me or such

86
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,150
His little sister?
- Yes, Janet Jackson

87
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,420
Yes, his daught--

88
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,420
little sister

89
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,420
"Daughter"

90
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,420
He said it

91
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,350
You know

92
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,650
This is exhausting for me too

93
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,820
I'm traveling nonstop by myself

94
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,420
I see

95
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,530
Few days ago

96
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,000
I had this double booking for Singapore and Wakayama

97
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,100
I only went to Wakayama in the end, though...

98
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,660
I'm already 57, man

99
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,070
My legs hurt, my back hurts

100
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:05,580
Lately the only

101
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,580
thing I've been doing since morning is eating fried rice

102
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,280
Why fried rice?

103
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,670
Hey!

104
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,370
The hell are you doing?

105
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:18,090
Learn how to dance

106
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:18,090
Michael Jackson Classroom - First Lesson:

107
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,780
First off, they'll have to learn

108
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,650
Some easy dance moves, indispensable for Michael

109
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,080
Do you know what's Michael most peculiar dance move?

110
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,130
Can I say it?

111
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,300
It's the moonwalk

112
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,700
What's up with you getting it right so easily?

113
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,500
Whatever

114
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,260
We don't need gags for today

115
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,260
Ok
- Oh, really?

116
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,000
Matsumoto, try to do the moonwalk

117
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,970
Here?

118
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,900
Yeah, try it

119
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,780
Hey, are you bullshitting me, you dick?

120
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,680
Sorry but I have no idea how to dance

121
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,900
Your turn, Endo

122
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,780
I never tried it before...

123
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,930
That's the right posture!

124
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,320
Really?

125
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,100
That was so good! I'm shocked!

126
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,720
Was that your first time?

127
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,160
Yes

128
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,970
Whaaat?!

129
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,370
Did you see that?!

130
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,010
We did, yeah

131
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,560
That was really good

132
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,970
But I think Endo is not accustomed to it yet

133
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,950
Yes
- That's obvious

134
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:18,750
Here

135
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,250
We'll use this

136
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,990
That's what Michael used when he was learning the moonwalk

137
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,640
Come on, Endo & Tanaka

138
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,290
Alright

139
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,290
Alright

140
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,060
He really likes drawers, doesn't him?

141
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,760
Endo & Tanaka are challenged!

142
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,060
Hey! Watch this!

143
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,580
Yes

144
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,760
This is how you learn how to moonwalk

145
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,190
Move it until the sign with "until here"

146
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:36,720
Sure

147
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,600
Until there

148
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,160
I see

149
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
sign: "until here!!"

150
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,790
Move it in a moonwalk-like style

151
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,600
"Like"?

152
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,330
Alright

153
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,890
Oh, that's good!

154
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,790
Just like that!

155
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,300
Try to go a little faster

156
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,670
Raise your feet up, just like that

157
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,330
Looking good, well done

158
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,870
Now, opposite direction

159
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,640
Turnabout
- It's reverse now

160
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,270
Tanaka!

161
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,640
That's not how you do it

162
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,170
You're not moonwalking at all

163
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,100
Have you seen Endo's?

164
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,680
I did not

165
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,280
Did--- oh, you couldn't see him
- Yes

166
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,710
Alright, whatever

167
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,650
Put it down

168
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,020
So it's just Endo...

169
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,950
Endo is good at it

170
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,020
Ok, Matsumoto & Yamazaki

171
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,550
Yes

172
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,420
You're next
- Ok

173
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,430
Yamazaki & Matsumoto are challenged!

174
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,860
Counting on you

175
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,600
Alright, ready, set, go!

176
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,090
It's like shuffling

177
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,160
You have to slide better

178
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,500
Raise your feet more or else you can't do it

179
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,500
Reverse!

180
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,100
Got it

181
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,480
Matsumoto

182
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,010
Your axis is way too tilted, what are you doing you idiot?!

183
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,980
What a sharp tongue

184
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,380
Raise em up, low em down!

185
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,560
He's so rude

186
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,560
I had enough

187
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,520
Watch out!

188
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,050
Dangerous

189
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,030
And so rude
- That was scary as hell

190
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,820
Let's have Endo do it

191
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,090
You're not suited for this

192
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,790
Isn't Endo enough for you?

193
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,090
You want me to do it?

194
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,290
Michael!

195
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,500
Be sure to watch this

196
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,000
His name is Michael too?

197
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,160
So confusing

198
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,100
He's my relative

199
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,510
Oh I see, it's so clear

200
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,150
He's more related to my sister actually

201
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,500
Alright

202
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,250
Here we go

203
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,640
Michael, let's go

204
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,810
He's running

205
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,480
Change!

206
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,080
Can he do it?
- He's too fast

207
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,580
I mean, he's teaching us

208
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,880
He's good
- He's really good

209
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,530
The best one

210
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,300
He's the best one!

211
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,700
Your sister's relative is so good

212
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,190
Look how good he is

213
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,460
Put it down!

214
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,070
Your sister's relative has talent

215
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,380
Just read the mood

216
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,520
You idiot!

217
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,940
I'm always saying that

218
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,400
Geez...

219
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,250
You got it? More or less?

220
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:46,220
Shall we head to our next training while the weather is still nice?

221
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,220
Are... we done here?

222
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:53,230
Learn the way he sings

223
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:53,230
Michael Jackson Classroom - Second Lesson:

224
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,080
Next up they'll learn Michael's singing technique

225
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,380
Which bewitched the entire world

226
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,360
Listen up

227
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,900
When we talk about Michael, we talk about his shafts

228
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,330
When we talk about Michael, we talk about his shafts

229
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:57,730
"Shouts"

230
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,170
It's "shouts", actually

231
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,170
Shafts

232
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,970
The "shout" is that thing on boats

233
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,530
What do you w-- I mean, come on, feel it

234
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,330
Alright

235
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,400
Each time he made those screams

236
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,550
The audience would completely go insane

237
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,820
How about we try it?

238
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,190
Try it out, Hamada

239
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,780
That "PPOOH!" thing, ok?

240
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,540
Ok

241
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,750
Do your best

242
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,510
Like this, try it

243
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,510
I must say, it was impressive

244
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,320
Go for it

245
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,050
That was really good!

246
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,460
Now you try, Matsumoto

247
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,560
Maybe a bit higher pitch?

248
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,390
Ok, Endo

249
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:34,930
Sure

250
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:37,970
Yours...

251
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,240
Your shout was like... you know, like that thing...

252
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,880
Your shout was like... you know, like that thing...

253
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,880
Oh well, whatever

254
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,880
Like what...?

255
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,490
Are you trying to worsen my headache?

256
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,490
Ok, Yamazaki

257
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,380
Good, very good

258
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,720
But you were all no good

259
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,150
Let's practice

260
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,150
We'll practice it while listening to a song we all know

261
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,320
We're ready

262
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,610
POH! POH! POH! The pigeon goes POH! POH!

263
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,450
This is horrible

264
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,450
Hey, we're gonna do it

265
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,950
Get ready, we're all doing it

266
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,050
[music] let's all eat em together~♪

267
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,140
Get ready!

268
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,420
Almost there

269
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,050
Go!

270
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,710
POH! POH! POH! The pigeon goes POH! POH!

271
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,820
Not even close

272
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,180
Stop it!

273
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,120
But teacher...

274
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,120
That was so bad

275
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,660
You know

276
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,970
Once you'll become Michael you can live in Neverland Ranch

277
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,730
Yes I get how you feel

278
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:48,310
Me too, I can finally live here in Neverland Ranch thanks to this

279
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,310
In here...?

280
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,010
I've talked to the original owner of Neverland

281
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,240
He said he wouldn't listen to me though

282
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,300
Who cares

283
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,240
Here we go

284
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,050
Don't be shy

285
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,720
Huh?

286
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,890
I thought it felt strange

287
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,290
I thought "maybe he forgot to rewind the tape"

288
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,970
Ok, enough with this

289
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,300
But we haven't learned anything yet!

290
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,890
Listen

291
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,890
More than Michael Jackson...

292
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,310
You should

293
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,880
Know more about his life, or else you won't understand this

294
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,880
He's right

295
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,950
Let's start from Jackson Five!

296
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,950
Jackson Five, ok

297
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,450
Jackie

298
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,390
Jackie

299
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,840
Yes?

300
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,120
I said let's start from Jackson Five and I said "Jackie", ok?

301
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,830
Yes

302
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,100
You're the older brother!

303
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,850
I see, Jackie, the older brother

304
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,900
Tito

305
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,270
Tito

306
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:51,970
Yes---

307
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:52,660
Too slow

308
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,460
Yes, sorry

309
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,340
It's you, isn't it?
- Tito, yes, sorry

310
00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:01,210
Enough,

311
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,210
you can't do it

312
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,210
You can't even do "Jackson Five"

313
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,210
Oh come on, let's do it

314
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:06,550
Don't you think you're cutting everything too short, teacher?

315
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,270
Too quick!

316
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:04,930
Let us do it

317
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,930
You can't quit climbing halfway

318
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,630
What's wrong?

319
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,120
Pros like me know it

320
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,760
Only by that?
- Yeah

321
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,420
Jackson Five was too much for you now

322
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,660
Should we go for Finger Five instead?

323
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,660
note: Japanese pop band from the 60s

324
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,660
Finger five...    - Isn't that unrelated?

325
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,560
No, Michael used to listen to them

326
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,790
That's a news

327
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,230
Oh, this one?

328
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,430
He went "WOOOW" here

329
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,000
song playing: Finger Five - Koi No Daiaru 6700

330
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,140
She just said "wow"

331
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
So late

332
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,190
Take notes!

333
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,520
Tomorrow is our graduation ceremony ♪

334
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,130
[music] And it will be my last chance ♪

335
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,960

336
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,670

338
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,670
Number!!

339
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,570
Is 090 [censor] 28 [censor] 1

340
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,150
Telephone numbers sure became long since mobiles were made

341
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,010
I can only remember my phone in Osaka

342
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,320
It was 06 [censor] 34 [censor] 5 or such

343
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,690
Wanna quit this?

344
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,800
I have no idea, really

345
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,420
I have no idea what you want to show us

346
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:33,770
Learn his attitude

347
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:33,770
Michael Jackson Classroom - Third Lesson:

348
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,390
Next up is a training to become like Michael on a mental side

349
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:43,210
Please, do not expect much from today's episode

350
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:43,210
nothing in particular is going to happen overall.

351
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,300
Listen, let's just stop moving around for now

352
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,760
We're all tired, let's set it aside

353
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,020
Let's do a Michael training using our head, shall we?

354
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,240
Yes

355
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,910
I'm now going to show you some of Michael's famous pictures

356
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,240
Let's make it like a quiz

357
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,590
I'll give a prize to whoever gets it right

358
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,250
Alright?

359
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,310
So

360
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,580
Do you know this picture?

361
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,000
That's his signature pose

362
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,460
Yeah

363
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,230
Isn't that the "POH" we just did?

364
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,650
Oh right, that

365
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,230
It's the "POH"!

366
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,000
Not even close

367
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,860
I'll give you a hint, he was in Korea

368
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,640
It's like he's saying "so spicy!", right?

369
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,610
Maybe he was eating Jjigae?

370
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,100
Something spicy...

371
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,610
No, it's not Jjigae!

372
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,540
Kimchi?

373
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,540
That's it!

374
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,310
But

375
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,280
It was a home-made Kimchi made by a korean mom

376
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,750
He's saying something

377
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,920
Something like "WOOOOOOW!"

378
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,310
And that means "it's spicy"?

379
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:29,820
Tanaka

380
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,550
You won something

381
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,920
You're weak, so I'm giving you this

382
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,260
Take it

383
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,190
Try to hold this

384
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,860
Hold it tight

385
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,840
It was that banana

386
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,500
Nice, right?

387
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,510
I got this from Mah-kun

388
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,180
note: Masahiro Tanaka, baseball player

389
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,180
You mean Masahiro Tanaka?

390
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,140
A guy who works in a yakitori shop

391
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,700
Not our Mah-kun

392
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,380
Alright, next one

393
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,710
He liked kids, right?

394
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,540
That's right

395
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,410
That's true, but this dude is not a kid

396
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,120
He's not a kid

397
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,160
It's an old dude

398
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,160
Yes

399
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,880
It's from an exhibition in Japan

400
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,450
An exhibition in Japan...?

401
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:10,960
Is it?

402
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,460
Yes, it's from the backstage

403
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,600
That's a picture from when he met Minoru Shiraki

404
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,600
note: a very short japanese actor (1,40m)

405
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,040
Such a shame none of you got it

406
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,740
What about this one?

407
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,880
Is he spotting someone from the audience?

408
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,880
Damn, you were so close!

409
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,980
Think about something he puts on

410
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,480
Come on

411
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,150
Something...

412
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,580
Sunglasses?

413
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,580
That's it!

414
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,150
He forgot his sunglasses, these are impromptu hand-sunglasses

415
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,150
You're amazing, Endo

416
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,120
I'll give you this

417
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:47,500
That's a hat I got from a hostess in Ebisu 2 years ago

418
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,300
Alright, Matsumoto try harder ok?

419
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,870
You're right, I will

420
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,270
This one

421
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,830
That's the picture from when he met Minoru Shiraki

422
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,640
Oh, my mistake

423
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,670
Here, Matsumoto, this...

424
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,870
You got it right, so here

425
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,980
This is...?
- A bag for you

426
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,580
Alright

427
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,750
One more thing

428
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,320
As an extra prize, I'll have you hold this, Matsumoto

429
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,320
You had that too?!

430
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,020
That's huge

431
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,950
This is

432
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,180
What's this?

433
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,550
It's a movie

434
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,890
"Crow's thumb" by Tadafumi Ito, 2012

435
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,890
Coming out this fall

436
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,890
Is this really coming out?

437
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,000
Yes, it is

438
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,990
Is it a prop or is it real?

439
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,630
No, this is real

440
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,330
I have more if you want to see them

441
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,530
Like this one

442
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,980
It seems so fake somehow...
- What's with this pose?!
- You sure it's not a prop?

443
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,980
I mean look at it, it looks so fake

444
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,870
What's this?

445
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,120
I swear it's true

446
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,610
What's with this expression?

447
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,320
Well, I'm sort of the main character

448
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,620
"Crow's thumb"...?

449
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,090
Yeah

450
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,320
I also have this

451
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,350
Looks so fake though

452
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,350
Is this true?     - You gotta be kidding me
- It feels weird

453
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,050
I don't know what to say about this

454
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,600
But it looks true

455
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,600
I'll bring this up again later

456
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,600
I'll go get em

457
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,460
Alright

458
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,560
Next training

459
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:09,740
Learn his steps

460
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:09,740
Michael Jackson Classroom - Fourth Lesson:

461
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,900
Here's their final training

462
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,500
It's time to learn Michael's incredible steps

463
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,740
I think it become clear

464
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,410
What to do with the third generation

465
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,420
Is that so?
- Yes

466
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,350
But let me say this

467
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,620
You're not ready to be Michael Jackson yet, it's impossible

468
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,480
That's why I think I should show you Michael's greatness

469
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,060
Some more

470
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,330
Alright?

471
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,190
Take these

472
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,890
Huh? What's that?

473
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,040
He really likes those too...
- True

474
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,470
These are ash bombs

475
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,470
Back then when I used to live on the countryside

476
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,830
I used to put ash inside bags and throw em

477
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,210
To old dudes on the fields

478
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,900
Ash bombs?
- That's their name?

479
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,380
Yeah we called em like that

480
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,340
If they hit you, they cause some damage

481
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,180
Of course they do
- If they hit

482
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,620
But now I'm going to avoid em all while dancing

483
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,420
If he manages to do it he's even better than Michael, isn't him?

484
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,320
Wanna try it?

485
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,560
Sure

486
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,090
Woah, ash bombs...

487
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,760
Throw em as they are

488
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,520
Impressive

489
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,790
Let us know when you're ready

490
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,760
It's ok, throw em

491
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,460
What are we gonna do after this?

492
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,460
I think that's it

493
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,860
Are we going?

494
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,450
Well, I think we...

495
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,260
Come on, let's go

496
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,100
Don't worry, I'll pay for everything

497
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,300
If it's money---

498
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,940
Huh?

499
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,370
Huh?

500
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,370
Huh?

501
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:52,870
Hmm?

502
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,810
I'm sure I...

503
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,730
Huh?

Macchan it's just like we said during the meeting

516
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,870
He even shouted "thriller"!

517
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,410
You were laughing so much during our meeting!

518
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,610
Endo! Come here and apologize!

519
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,500
Enough
