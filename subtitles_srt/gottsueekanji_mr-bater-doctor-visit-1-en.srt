Translation/Timing: eChie

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,120
Excuse me? Sorry to bother you..

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,770
Oh dear I am no good, really...

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,020
I doubt I am so poor in health.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,200
I haven't been feeling very well.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,300
Well, please listen.. today in fact,

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,300
I need to go to a party.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,400
I'm afraid I probably have caught a cold.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,800
And then, you know,

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,750
I am ok if I am sick by myself, but..

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,150
I shouldn't spread my cold to everybody at the party, right?

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,450
If you ask me if it is OK or not,

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,520
the answer is definitely not, right?

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,270
I really would like to avoid that.

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,270
So, what I would like to ask you today is,

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,350
What does Doctor do?

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,220
Well, in other words, what can you offer me to trust you?

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,320
I would say,

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,100
Lots of experience,

20
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,070
extraordinary specialized knowledge, and then

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,320
some caring and compassion!

22
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,520
You understand it, right? I am here for that!

23
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,370
I am counting on you, OK? You are a doctor, so

24
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:25,120
please don't disappoint (Gakkari) you patient, OK?
Gakkari, Gakkai (Academic conference) ...

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,470
I meant Medical conference.. it should
be understandable enough.

26
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,920
He must be laughing his ass off, so let me check..

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,300
Wow, he is thinking about girls!

28
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,220
Wrong. What are you doing! That is wrong!

29
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,220
Give me a break, OK?

30
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,870
I am feeling a chill, I need to do something about this...

31
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,850
All right, please make it quick as I need to go to a party!

32
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,820
Oh dear, in this cold season we tend to fall sick..

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
Yes yes yes, that's it.

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,650
Yes like this and that, and hold this, then..

35
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,870
Don tah-tah-tah, don tah-tah-tah...

36
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:15,620
Deden-de-den, Deden-de-dede-dedede...

37
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,970
Namamugi-namagome-namatamago
(Japanese  tongue twister)

38
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,970
Nonsense!

39
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,450
I didn't know what I was doing, I didn't even meant do this.

40
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,220
YOU STUPID!

41
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,370
I didn't want to wear such a jacket
at all even if I said I had a chill.

42
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,050
That's wrong. Come on! I don't have much time.

43
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,270
Don't fool me.

44
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,870
I am not here to get the stupid jacket.

45
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,420
How can I say..well you are wrong.

46
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,200
A regular doctor would use.. what you call it..a stethoscope.

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,950
You don't even have a stethoscope. That is strange.

48
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,870
Like a regular doctor..please check me with the stethoscope.

49
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,870
I am checking on you, so please check on me, please!

50
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,550
Hurry up and bring your stethoscope. No time!

51
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:14,170
Well, he is crazy or something..what is he thinking?

52
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,170
Oh, he's back.

53
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,470
Yes yes yes, I hold this and wear this, then...

54
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,520
Alright, alright, alright...

55
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,920
Choshinki (Stethoscope), Choshinki, Jyonan-denki.

56
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,270
"He is pretending to be a president of Jyonan-denki (Jyonan
electronic) who was popular on TV shows in the past".

57
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:34,870
Totally different. Choshinki and Jyonan-denki
are totally different.

58
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,720
How much does it cost for me to perform like this?

59
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,220
Give me a break! Choshinki and Jyonan-denki
are not even close!

60
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,070
Too awful..you better cut it out already..

61
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:58,450
Don't get carried away (Choshi-ni-noru)
about Choshinki..Choshinki...

62
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,620
He must be laughing his ass off. Definitely. Let me see.

63
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,370
Yes, he is.

64
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,520
I know you loved my joke. Well, you should end this really.

65
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,000
I am getting pissed, this is not OK.
We had enough for choshinki.

66
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,700
What should I do? Ok, let me explain how I got sick like this.

67
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,270
OK.

68
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:24,300
Well, it was about 2 weeks ago.

69
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,170
At first, I felt something wrong with my throat.

70
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,000
But I was not taking it seriously and I just had some troches,

71
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,570
But then, my nose started running and my nose..

72
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,670
What are you doing?

73
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,650
Why are you just listening to me?

74
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,220
A regular doctor would be writing down something.

75
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:53,920
We are not a working youth and a grandma. This
conversation wouldn't help my sickness.

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,420
A regular doctor would write down the
process in German or something.

77
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,170
WRITE IT DOWN!

78
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,220
Don't you have a chart? Bring it now!

79
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,150
HURRY UP!! GO!!

80
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,250
What kind of doctor is he? Pissing me off!

81
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,250
Bring a chart!

82
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:23,350
Yes yes yes, that's it. Like this...and that...

83
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:33,770
Well...it's been 3 years...since I went into the mountains
alone after I was defeated by Onitsuka..

84
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:42,120
I won in the spring tournament, and lost in
the winter tournament. If I don't win the next
tournament, it means I lost everything.

85
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:50,420
Anyway..How can I overcome Onitsuka's
rokkaku-chop? How can I?

86
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,850
Da-da-da-dan Da-da-da-dan

87
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,920
When you beat him up

88
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,000
Nonsense!

89
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,770
Why are you writing down on the chart?

90
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,500
You wrote nothing.

91
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,200
Give me a break! End it!

92
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,100
No wonder your *** and *** got in trouble!

93
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,850
SHUT UP! I don't care if you just met them!

94
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,470
I don't care!

95
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,400
It's your fault! I don't care!

96
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,520
My parents just called me the other day!

97
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
Shut up!

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,400
No seriously...

99
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,520
That's enough! You are pissing me off!

100
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:48,870
Alright then...you sit down here! I had enough of this already.

101
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,520
*Roentgen = X-Ray

102
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,520
Let me have a roentgen.. roentgen. Get ready!

103
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,150
I will take it to another doctor, so hurry up!

104
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,720
I really come to the wrong hospital.

105
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,050
This roentgen brings me back my
memories! I used to love it..but..

106
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,820
This is more like Dento-gei (Traditional play).

107
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,920
