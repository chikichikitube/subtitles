00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,540
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,160
Let's get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,340
It's Koyabu

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,740
Yoshimoto's guy

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,280
Yoshimoto's guy, aren't everyone around you?

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,400
Ok

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,110
Today involves the names of people on the street

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,230
It's a brand new project.
-New project!

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,090
Please take a look:

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,760
Street Passerby Name Cooking

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,860
Sounds interesting

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:50,800
The program team provides food corresponding to the name of a passerby to carry out a culinary duel

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,070
For instance, you meet Kakimoto-san, then you have to use Kakio (persimmon)
-Understood

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,380
Ebihara
-You'd have to use shrimp (ebi)

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:03,760
The project involves two teams follwing this rule to make three dishes each with the collected ingredients

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:12,350
Finally, the uninformed judges choose which team's is more delicious

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,460
Personally, I think this project can be made into an actual show

18
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,730
BS Yoshimoto

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,970
Don't put us in the same category as such a casual TV station

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,970
â€»Yoshimoto's satellite TV station has programs such as "Tetsuo Laughing Rice's Interesting Temple Tour" and "Wakayoshi Sekishiro's Aimless Walk"

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,370
Inexplicable young entertainers chattering away all the time

22
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:51,160
Street Passerby Name Cooking

23
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,160
This must take a while

24
00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:00,670
Everyone is divided into red apron and blue apron teams for the cooking competition

25
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,970
Fukuda is the red team's leader

26
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,560
That's why i've got a hat

27
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,540
Very good cook

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,780
The blue team is led by Beppu

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,810
I used to be a chef, I can handle it

30
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,320
Worked in a hotel before

31
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,240
Hotel staff for 4 years

32
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:25,820
The red and blue team members are shown above

33
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,030
10 hours from now

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,330
10 hours?

35
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,900
After 10 hours?

36
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,430
Way too long!

37
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,400
It's too much!

38
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,700
10 hours?

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,070
As if 10 hours is normal

40
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,410
It would take that long.
-Yes, yes, yes

41
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,380
After 10 hours, they'll have made three dishes with the collected ingredients

42
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:54,950
The uninformed Lady Devi will decide which team's is better

43
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,760
What kind of ingredients does Fukuda?
-Yes, yes, yes.

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,260
Commonly used ingredients such as fish and meat, and then the rice

45
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,800
Don't ask too much, okay? We're the ones in charge of finding the ingredients

46
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,130
I want seasoning

47
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,000
Now there's only sugar and soy sauce

48
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,140
Only sugar and soy sauce

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,880
What do you want most?
-Touban (soybean) and sweet pasta sauce or something like that

50
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,480
No one calls it "touban", right?
-No

51
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,490
Do you have water? Here?

52
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,850
Only sugar and soy sauce

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,320
Water is usually a given

54
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,850
Gotta look for water?

55
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:35,160
So the two teams first went to areas with a lot of people

56
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,390
The difficulty is quite high

57
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,150
They can make something if they have seasoning at least

58
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,660
Let's go!

59
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,870
Ask one by one and win by numbers

60
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,600
It's all about quantity

61
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,880
The first one found was this bicycle man

62
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,840
Please tell me your name

63
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,350
Hidehira Fujii

64
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,410
No food

65
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:02,890
In this way, it feels as exciting as gambling

66
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,560
Hello, can I interview you?
-Yes

67
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,360

72
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,810

Please tell me your name

78
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,020
Maiko Akabane

79
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,290
"Feather" isn't doable, right?

80
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,400
Chicken wings have "feathers"
-No

81
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,030

There you go. Great. There you go

87
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,430
Cooking with pears
-Can you?

88
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,390
Has "pear" in the name

89
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,450
Great! So quick!

90
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,110
How do you plan to use the pear?

91
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,320
It's rare that pears is used for a dish

92
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,550
Dessert?

93
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,960
It can be used as a side dish for cold noodles

94
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,430
But pears must be used

95
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,530
Yes, it is not always good to get one

96
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:19,430
Food obtained must be used

97
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,840
Have I ever cooked with pears in my life?

98
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,920
Do you have to use them all?

99
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,170

110
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,420
In fact, we are comedians

00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:50,030
My stage name is Kitani Curry

113
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,030
Stage names don't count.
-Can't be counted

114
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,430
Stage name doesn't count

115
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,540
Is there anyone named "Ushiyama Dolphin"?

116
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,540
So, please reveal
-One... Two...

117

Okay, there's nothing in these names

118
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,880

One, two

123
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,000
Not easy

124
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,100
Rice
-We have rice

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,070
Wow, here we go!

126

-Komeda? Great!

127
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,240
Just the second group i've asked!

128
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,080
If you have rice, you can at least make a rice ball

129
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:49,720
So, as soon as the project started, both teams received one ingredient each

130
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,590
What is your name?

131
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,590

00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,610
Fukuda said he can't cook without water

138
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,140
So this is a great result!

139
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,740
Also

140
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,770

00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,440
Canola? Only canola?
-Yes

151
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,510
Isn't it a baby bok choy?

152
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,980
Canola only
-Canola only?

153
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,190

Great, that's... that's a big step!

159
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,160
You can make a raw mix if you have pears

160
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,340
Yeah, right

161
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:13,010
After two hours, the red team have obtained six ingredients

162
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,440
Fukuda is awesome

163
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,110

OK
-Okay, okay, okay

180
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:58,080
Vegetables with "hana" (leaves) can be used

181
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,080
Can you choose any kind of leaf?

182
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,190
Sorry to bother you, but I have a question

183
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,620
Which kind of vegetable with leaves should we choose?

184
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,930
Can you choose any of them?
-Any of them?

185
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,760
Yes, both.
-Which one do you prefer, Beppu?

186
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,630
Green perilla would be best

187
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,110
After two hours, the blue team have 5 ingredients

188
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,250
Not enough to make a dish

189
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,250
At this time

190
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,000
A fellow comedian happens to wander past

191
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,820
Matsuo Atoomae Police Station

192
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,780
A junior

193
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,390
What is your real name?

194
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,890
Tell me your name

195
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,150
My name is Matsuo Toshiji

196
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,020
Sushi

197
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,960
What? How do you pronounce this?

198
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,650
Toshiji

199
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,500
Toshiji?
-Yes

200
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,640
Must be an ingredient

201
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,640
Ah not usable

202
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,700
Must be an ingredient

203
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,700
Meanwhile, a similar situation is happening here

204
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,290
We are Wednesday Downtown

205
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,420
Hello

206
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,750
Koda, can I interview you for a while?

207
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,500
What? Really?

208
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,150
Yes, Koda, what is your name?

209
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,700
Tell me your real name

210
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,690
No way!

211
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,740
None

212
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,230
No what?
-Not so good

213
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,760
Yes, not a single one

214
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,100
There is nothing
-There is only a "field"

215
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,000
What are you talking about?

216
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,100
Why's he got his hat just half on?

217
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,310
Little blue hat

218
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,740
3 hours after the start additional competition rules are introduced

219
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,850
Thank you for your hard work!

220
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:41,450
From now on, not only the people you meet on the road, but also the words on the door and signboards count

221
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:47,430
Company names such as "â—‹â—‹ Shop" and "Kuriyama Business" are also acceptable

222
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,400
So

223
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:57,970
Ogata, you should go to a residential area to look at the names on the houses

224
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,410
Why me?
-You have the spirit!

225
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,040
How come I'm the only one who has to move?
-Because you are more suitable

226
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,810
No, I look like an errand boy

227
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,510
I can't just show up to people's houses unannounced

228
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,680
Ogata, you have a gentlemanly nature so it'll be easier for you

229
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,250
Ugh, how come I have to go to find door signs... to the residential area...

230
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,720
It's wrong

231
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,540
Each of the two teams select the member responsible for doors and signage

232
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,270
The first is Ogata

233
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:36,070
Kaji

234
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,780
Plum

235
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:46,280
If they confirm with the people, they can get the ingredients, what will happen?

236
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,090
Go for it!

237
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,420
Noone there, gotta keep looking

238
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,730
Chestnut!

239
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,310
However

240
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,260
No one home

241
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,870
Hello?

242
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,970
Again, no one is home

243
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,850
At this point, the man in charge of signs

244
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,740
Signage is good

245
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,700
Salt

246
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,250
Good, good!

247
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,850
We've got the important seasoning here

248
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,250
But we need to confirm with them, right?

249
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,860
Hello
-Please come in

250
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,190
Sorry, i'm coming in, sorry to interrupt

251
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,660
Hello, I'm a comedian
-Hello

252
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,200
Hello, how are you?

253
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,070
Please show it, thank you

254
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,740
Good! Good!

255
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,300
On the other side, Beppu is in charge of door signs

256
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,780
Oh, wait a minute

257
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,790
Look, the sign is "Sakemoto"

258
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,660
Sorry to disturb you suddenly

259
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,110
Can be used for cooking

260
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,730
Wine is good.
-Very useful for fishy things

261
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,730
I am Beppu, a comedian

262
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,900
Afterwards

263
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,340
Please tell me your name

264
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,800
Shinya Sakemoto

265
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Wow, here we go. Good job. Thanks

266
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,850
At this point, 4 hours have passed

267
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,550
Please tell me your name

268
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,750
Kaiko Sakaguchi

269
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,560
Seafood

270
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,560
And

271
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,610
Kumasaka

272
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,500
Bear

273
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,260
Bear

274
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,220
Wild game

275
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,370
Do we have bear meat?
-Yes

276
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,340
Yes, here we go

277
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,100
Horse and bear

278
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,340
Horse and bear

279
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,340
"Got bear"

280
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,980
The stench is super strong, right?

281
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:01,990
In that case, the meat must be steamed with wine to make it softer

282
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,280
It smells bad, doesn't it?
-You need wine to remove the smell

283
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:10,000
Next, Nishimoto found this couple, one of whom is a foreigner

284
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,310
Nakano Daichi

285
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,800
Nakano Daichi

286
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,830
Please tell me your name

287
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,720
Niel Khon

288
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,720
â€»Khon sounds like 'corn"

289
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,770
Corn

290
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,380
Where are you from?

291
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,510
Cambodia
-Ah, Cambodia

292
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,150
In this case

293
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,600
I guess so

294
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,690
The rules were originally limited to kanji only

295
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,010
Corn is ok

296
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:37,960
Corn is ok?
-Yes

297
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,160
Corn is great!

298
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:47,430
After further discussion, it was decided that katakana ingredients can be obtained from foreigners

299
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,530
She's called corn

300
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,850
Then, we continued a interview in Shinjuku

301
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,770
Met so many!

302
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,220
Because of the proximity to Yoshimoto's theater

303
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,830
Magical Lovely's Murakami appears

304
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:03,040
Bound to happen being outside for 10 hours

305
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,040
So they asked him

306
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,050
Suzuki Takahiro

307
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,520
Yes, his name is not Murakami

308
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,790
Murakami, your real name is Suzuki

309
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,890
Its a bit complicated
-Overcomplicated

310
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,560
Sorry
-No no no

311
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,940
Also

312
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,060
Oswald

313
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,960
Lets ask

314
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,200
What is this?

315
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,700
I don't know your full names

316
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,770
You don't know?
-Yes

317
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,780
Shunsuke Ito

318
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,540
Ito Shunsuke, then you are

319
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,370
Yu Hatake

320
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,140
Hatake Yu?

321
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,580
Sounds like a male actor

322
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,680
You two get out of here

323
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,250
How did we let you down?
-Just go to the Lumine

324
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,790
Wait a minute, I'm so curious

325
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,020
What is this?
-That's my line!

326
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,760
Please show them one by one

327
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,960
Please tell me your name

328
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,680
Ebi Yasufumi

329
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,680
â€»Ebi - shrimp

330
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,800
We got shrimp, a good one!

331
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,200
The best target of this project has appeared. Thank you

332
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,070
Please tell me your name

333
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,400
Umeda

334
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,280
Umeda! (ume - plum)

335
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,040
Kikuchi Ginga

336
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,550
Kikuchi
-Ginga

337
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,150
Ginga, what a name

338
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,590
Is chrysanthemum (kiku) okay? Great!

339
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,090
Kin (gold)! Kin! Can sprinkle the dust on top

340
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,530
Really really!

341
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,460
Please tell me your name

342
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,990
Isogai Yu

343
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,800
Kai! (shellfish)

344
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,870
Can any kind of shellfish be used?

345
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,070
Can choose shellfish

346
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,140
Thank you, if its shellfish, I choose scallops

347
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,410
One by one, the two teams get the ingredients

348
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,180
Ogata got none

349
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,010
Only Ogata has yet to get anything

350
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,290
Hello, hello, hello

351
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,890
Do you live nearby?
-Yes

352
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,660
We are shooting on location

353
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,500
Can I ask your name? Don't say it yet!

354
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,200
You'll never guess

355
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,240
I'm not guessing, rest assured

356
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,880
"You'll never guess" must be a good opportunity

357
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,080
Please tell me your name

358
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,610
Cow!

359
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,860
Cow!

360
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,180
Really?
-Really

361
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,970
How do you pronounce it?
-Gorai Hayato

362
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,130
Gorai Hayato?

363
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,430
A miracle!

364
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,140
A miracle!
-Terrific

365
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,870
Hello?
-Hey, its Ogata

366
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,310
What's up?

367
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,080
I got cow.
-Eh?

368
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,750
Cow
-Cow! Thanks!

369
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,250
You're too muted in your response.
-Wait a minute

370
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,850
I tried to hard to find something

371
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:03,560
Is this really the attitude you should have toward getting a cow?

372
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,620
7 hours after the start

373
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:13,820
The red team has gotten 14 ingredients, including horse meat, bear meat, beef and other meat-based ingredients

374
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,420
But not all of these can be used, right?
-Yes

375
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:23,680
And the blue team got a variety of ingredients such as rice, shrimp, a total of 19

376
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:31,690
Everyone, we have enough ingredients for 3 dishes

377
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,360
That's great.
-Yes

378
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:40,730
But the only thing I really want is oil

379
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,530
Oil ah no oil ah

380
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,940
If there are more ingredients, I can't handle it

381
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:54,180
Try not to look for new ingredients
-Easy for you to say!

382
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,920
You can't talk like that. We're almost dead looking for this stuff
-Indeed

383
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,080
We can't control it.
-It's not good for you to say that

384
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,950
It's not nice to talk like that
-We're working hard

385
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,520
I'm almost ready to go to the kitchen

386
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,460
I'm off to do the dishes

387
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,400
Here the two groups of culinary leaders have gone to the kitchen to prepare the ingredients

388
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,800
Finally, it's time for the cooking session

389
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,480
Okay, this is Beppu, here we go

390
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,200
Finally only 2 hours left

391
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,410
2 hours is very short

392
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:37,000
The rest of the members will look for ingredients until the last moment

393
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,240
At this time

394
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,260
Hello, this is Beppu

395
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,730
I got pork without any problems

396
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,160
Pork? Good, good, good

397
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,770
Pork can be used for oil
-Pork

398
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,700
Yes, actually

399
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,270
Dad's name is

400
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,260
Butakku Ryan Akira

401
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,110
Acquired pork in the name of a foreigner

402
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,110
â€»Pork is pronounced Buta

403
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,480
In addition

404
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,060
Butakku Mia Cola

405
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,320
Shinichi unexpectedly also gets Cola

406
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,720
Cola can be used with meat

407
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,010
In addition

408
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,630
Beppu

409
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,140
I got chicken

410
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,930
Chicken? Chicken?

411
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,000
That's tough

412
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,840
That's about the end of it

413
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,640
That's enough, don't look anymore

414
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,390
That's right.
-Too much is not good

415
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,860
At the same time

416
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,550
i got yellowtail
-No way!

417
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,280
Buri, who is called buri?

418
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,740
Buri!

419
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,190
They also succeeded in obtaining yellowtail from foreigners here

420
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,000
In addition

421
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,630
Wow, they really got it!

422
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,100
What is your name?

423
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,370
Yuuki

424
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,870
Great!

425
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,000
The desired oil!

426
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,230
There is not much time left for the cooking showdown

427
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,520
Tastes good

428
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,960
What kind of dishes did the two groups make?

429
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:24,660
After 10 hours

430
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:24,660
The ingredients were found and cooking complete

431
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,330
After 10 hours

432
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,330
Ingredient search and cooking complete

433
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,300
The final showdown takes place in this restaurant

434
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,810
The other members watch the showdown in a separate room

435
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,540
Thank you

436
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:46,230
Lady Devi thinks she is attending a regular food project

437
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,550
Serious comedian cooking duel!

438
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,620
The showdown finally begins

439
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:00,500
A serious duel between 2 professional chef-level comedians without laughs

440
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:06,040
The judge for both dishes is Lady Devi

441
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:10,540
Separate 3-course meal from both teams Comprehensive evaluation

442
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,770
Professional level?
-Yes

443
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,540
No way!

444
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,940
First is Fukuda's first course

445
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,510
Okay, come on, Fukuda, show your confidence

446
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,350
Wow, I'm looking forward to it

447
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,320
Please see the first course

448
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,060
What is this?

449
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,130
Raw Scallop and Horse Meat

450
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,800
Here it comes
-Scallop and horse meat

451
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,720
Do horse meat and scallops go together?

452
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,570
Horse meat?
-That's a big deal

453
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,130
Horse meat?
-What does it mean?

454
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,980
Made with raw scallops and horse meat

455
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,370
Horse meat
-Right

456
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:49,410
I topped it with a fruit sauce, and I used pears in the sauce

457
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,590
Eat it raw, please

458
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,560
Not bad

459
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,860
Can it be considered delicious?

460
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,200
It's delicious.
-Great

461
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,770
I'm really happy

462
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,590
I'm amazed!
-Great

463
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,370
I just underestimated you.
-Underestimated, so straight forward

464
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,410
Devi is very strict

465
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,010
Delicious

466
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,250
Right? Look, it's good, right?

467
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:23,800
Delicious

468
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,280
Appetizer standard

469
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,750
The first course just right
-Lighter in taste

470
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,920
Perfection

471
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,070
This is the taste that adults like

472
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,490
Chrysanthemum is a big help

473
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,360
Next is the first course for the blue team

474
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,330
Please take a look

475
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,530
Looks good

476
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:47,500
Stir-fried shrimp, clams, chicken breast, bamboo shoots, cauliflower and plum meat

477
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,780
What is this? Shrimp. You got shrimp!

478
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,520
Too many ingredients

479
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,240
Shrimp was mine

480
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
However

481
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,620
It looks like it's all dry

482
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,040
Super dry

483
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,520
No moisture

484
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,160
Looks all dried out

485
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,690
The situation is already bad just by looking at it

486
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,260
It tastes good, right?

487
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,920
How does it taste?

488
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,700
Sorry, it's not good

489
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,210
Very direct

490
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,210
Not good?

491
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,410
It's not good at all.
-Really?

492
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,510
Sorry

493
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,280
It's delicious.
-Especially delicious!

494
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,720
Taste is also very good

495
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,650
It's good.
-Yeah

496
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,390
It's delicious!
-Suitable for bento

497
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,790
If my dog smelt it they'd walk away

498
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,640
Harsh

499
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,490
Dogs wouldn't like it either?

500
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,980
The first course was an overwhelming victory for Fukuda

501
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,560
Next, the second course

502
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,200
Please take a look

503
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,400
What is this?

504
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,480
"Greetings from the Land of Bears."

505
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,450
Please be ok

506
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,650
The rare ingredient bear meat

507
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:10,590
Was stewed together with bamboo shoots and cauliflower

508
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,300
How does it taste?

509
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,130
The meat is soft

510
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,600
That's a compliment.
-Good impression

511
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,310
Did you use only salt for the seasoning?
-Yes

512
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:34,480
Next is the meatball made with yellowtail, however

513
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,250
So salty.
-Is it?

514
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,080
I only taste salt

515
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:46,860
As she said, the only seasoning used was salt

516
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,060
Next is the blue team

517
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,510
Please take a look

518
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,230
Just now criticized as worthless

519
00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:00,640
Boiled pork and bear cutlet with fruit sauce and gold shaving

520
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,840
Bear
-Right

521
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,640
You got bear, too.
-Yes

522
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:10,010
Just had bear, now another bear

523
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,790
Bears, horse and pig.
-Horse meat at the beginning, right?

524
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,760
An unusual combination of horse and bear

525
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,890
Not a fan at all

526
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,290
Unclear theme

527
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,410
Just now the bear meat was a big hit

528
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,370
So hard

529
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,600
The tone of voice

530
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,540
100 points for "so hard" tone

531
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,060
Next is the last course for the red team

532
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,320
Golden peach sauce sirloin

533
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,890
Cow
-Cow?

534
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Used peach

535
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,100
Not bad

536
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,200
Not bad, not bad at all

537
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,840
This is the highest rating

538
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,900
Ok ok ok

539
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,170
Cows are good!

540
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,210
So came the last course for the blue team

541
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,000
Here we go!

542
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,490
Aromatic fish and snapper super rice ball

543
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,960
Aromatic fish, I love aromatic fish

544
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,560
Wait. Aromatic fish?
-Great!

545
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,230
Who got that?
-Me

546
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,410
That was mine!

547
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,070
A favorite ingredient appears

548
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:40,850
The blue team got the snapper

549
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,240
Can choose the type of fish

550
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,240
There's fish! We've got it!

551
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,040
What is the result?

552
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,170
What?

553
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,890
More snapper?

554
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,560
It's not bad.
-Really? Thank you

555
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,220
Not particularly tasty either

556
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,400
But it's not bad. It's good. It's good

557
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:13,740
This is the end of the tasting of the 6 dishes, what is the result?

558
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:18,110
Your first course was very good.
-Thanks

559
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,710
Beppu's last rice ball was also good
-Thank you

560
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,580
Do I have to choose one?
-Yes

561
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,350
Please!

562
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,820
Please, please, please, please

563
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,150
It won't end if you can't choose

564
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,490
Then I choose the last

565
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,380
Rice balls

566
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:50,740
In Summary
The winner is the blue team

567
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,010
What do you think?

568
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,250
Lady Devi is really straightforward

569
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:06,790
Despite them having to cook for her she still said what she thought

570
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,860
Its very difficult to still be able to taste when trying lots of different food

571
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,130
Was the meat really that hard?

572
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,800
The phrase "so hard", it's like she was eating a stone

573
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:20,440
The tone of "so hard" was too funny

574
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,810
I'll have to rewind and watch it again when it comes on.
-I do want to watch it again

575
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:31,110
Next is everybody's theories

576
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,620
Tonight's presenter is...

577
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,890
It's been a long time!

578
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,320
It's Kenji Tamura

579
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,060
Hello everyone, long time no see

580
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,320
It's been a long time.
-Yes

581
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,190
I thought you were snowed in

582
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,060
Indeed

583
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,830
If I have offended you, please say so!

584
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,710
Why would you have?

585
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,900
I'll surely apologize

586
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,080
So
-Reorganize your mood

587
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,880
Yes, do you know the singer Yutaka Oe?

588
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,570
Yes

589
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,220
Have you ever been on stage together?
-Yes

590
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,350
Yes? Of course, Hamada-san...

591
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,280
Yes, he came to our show

592
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,620
Was he nice?

593
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,190
A nice guy, yeah

594
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,340
What is it?

595
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:15,630
Today we bring you this hypothesis about Yutaka Oe

596
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:21,970
If Yutaka Oe turns out to be bad in private, people will be accept it without much discomfort

597
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,370
What does it mean?

598
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,580
Even if he's very scary?

599
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,070
His whole person seems to be that of having a wild aura

600
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,780
Not really...

601
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,280
He seems like a normal person

602
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,810
That's why there are contrasts

603
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,020
Why is this program aiming their sights at him?

604
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:45,120
Take for example manga, they often have a kind of smiling monk

605
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,690
But in private, they are actually very bad
-I guess

606
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,880
The real Yutaka Oe is such a monk

607
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,330
What?

608
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,150
So even if he's scary in private

609
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:02,270
You may also think that this person is really like this and believe it

610
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,070
Don't understand

611
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,040
But the acting and singing world does have some scary people

612
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,970
People in the enka circle are especially bad

613
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:13,920
What're you talking about "bad"?

614
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,720
If he is very, very scary

615
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,590
Unimaginable

616
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,020
Parking wherever

617
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,090
Parking is pretty bad

618
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,130
If you park wherever, your license will be revoked

619
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:37,740
If Yutaka Oe turns out to be bad in private, people will be accept it without much discomfort

620
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:46,080
Therefore, Yutaka Oe was brought in as a helper to play the role of a very scary person

621
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:53,700
And the target who will witness this in a fake show is

622
00:31:55,110 --> 00:32:00,130
The man who is prone to encountering scary people Chance Oshiro

623
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,100
Hello

624
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,030
Our first meeting

625
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,940
I am Yutaka Oe, a singer and actor of Kitajima Music Agency

626
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,310
Looks like a nice guy

627
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:13,880
I'm not very good at talking

628
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,010
I'm sorry if it's a problem for you

629
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,410
No, no, I'm the one who isn't good

630
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,850
Very humble

631
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,550
This is the normal Yutaka Oe

632
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,570
However, soon...

633
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:32,060
Please welcome the singer who is going on a journey with us today

634
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,760
It's Yutaka Oe

635
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,440
Our first meeting

636
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,070
This is out first meeting, I'm Aerosmith

637
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,840
Hello, i'm so happy

638
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:49,380
Yutaka Oe completely ignores the Aerosmith joke

639
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,280
The 1st bad thing is...

640
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,820
Yutaka Oe, this is Choshi, Chiba Prefecture

641
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,220
Have you been to Choshi?

642
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,730
Oe, brackets, answer

643
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:09,230
1st Bad Thing

644
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:09,230
Can't read the teleprompter board

645
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,600
Very interesting

646
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,230
You are very interesting ah

647
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,370
No, no, that... Choshi

648
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,540
I asked if you have ever been to Choshi

649
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,870
Have you been here?

650
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,070
Oe, brackets, answer

651
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,610
Ah, uh...

652
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:24,350
Well, this is his first location shoot

653
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,520
That... it seems to be the his first location shoot

654
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:33,260
This is where the staff comes in to explain the meaning of the teleprompter board

655
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,860
Ah, I see, so I answer

656
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,930
Yes, yes, just answer Chance's question

657
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:44,000
Answer... ah sorry

658
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,500
I'm sorry, 'll say it again

659
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,090
Ready Chance, countdown 5 4 3 2

660
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,410
Oe, this is Choshi in Chiba

661
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,910
Have you been to Choshi?

662
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,620
Oe, brackets, answer

663
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,850
Why?

664
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,190
Why?

665
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,260
Let's move on to the next topic

666
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,610
A little angry

667
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,680
Therefore

668
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,120
Festival, festival, festival

669
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,720
Oe is set up so that he only sings without mistakes

670
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:25,410
Sings as soon as the situation arises

671
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:25,410
2nd Bad Thing

672
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,360
Thus the scence is forced to end

673
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,810
Ok, cut, thank you

674
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,090
What a great song!

675
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,410
Awesome

676
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:39,220
Unusually thirsty after singing

677
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:39,220
3rd Bad Thing

678
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,890
To hear so... so close

679
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,630
Too close is scary

680
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:46,160
You can't get a ticket this close, right?

681
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,060
Coming over like you want to hit someone

682
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,800
The pause is also scary

683
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:57,040
From the start, Oe makes frequent and strange actions

684
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:00,210
Chance who saw these...

685
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:03,650
He's probably in some kind of trouble

686
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,880
Looks strange

687
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,520
There must be something going on with him

688
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,520
Nice people

689
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:15,920
Something appears to be wrong, but he is unsure what it is

690
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,940
The next strange thing is...

691
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:27,600
Chance's Lounge

692
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:27,600
Pretending to be an agent

693
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:25,100
Hey, you!

694
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,600
Is this a joke?

695
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:33,380
Fierce to agent

696
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:33,380
4th Bad Thing

697
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,090
Do you want to do it?

698
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,410
What are you thinking about?

699
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:42,890
Chance will also think I'm a fool if I don't do it right

700
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,820
Do you understand?

701
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,460
He's scary when he's angry

702
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,760
Sorry

703
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,560
Are you kidding me?

704
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,630
Because of you, it's a problem for everyone

705
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:59,250
In the tense atmosphere, Chance holds his breath and the tea in his mouth

706
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,270
Do you want to do well?
-I want to

707
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,540
I'm asking you if you want to do a good job!

708
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,980
I do!

709
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,380
How many times have you said you're sorry?

710
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,290
I've been saying it all along, right?

711
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,960
Hey, I'll kill you!

712
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,320
I'll kill you

713
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,260
It's really rude to everyone

714
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,460
It's really annoying

715
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,870
But also quite protective of Chance

716
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,840
Finally gone

717
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,240
Only just swallowing now

718
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:45,450
Seem to have been waiting for a while

719
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,720
Just now...

720
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,590
What's going on?

721
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,420
Oe...

722
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,260
He seems to be angry with his manager

723
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,960
Eh?

724
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,260
Super angry

725
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,230
So scary

726
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,770
I think he was born in Kishiwada

727
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,970
He must have been in a gang in Kishiwada

728
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,780
A real Kishiwada punk

729
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,710
Ah, that's right

730
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,450
Is Kishiwada such a place...

731
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:24,620
Kishiwada 9 is full on gangsters

732
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,080
No its not!

733
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:31,960
Because of the fury, he begins to think of all of Kishiwada as a dwelling for gangsters

734
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,890
Later outside

735
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,460
Several different terrible scenarios have been prepared

736
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,840
Hello, this is our first meeting

737
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,710
I am a singer and actor at Kitajima Music Agency

738
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,750
I'm Yutaka Oe

739
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,780
Memory loss with each break

740
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,780
5th Bad Thing

741
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,550
Scary, scary, scary.
-It's scary

742
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,820
Many different terrible aspects

743
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:06,960
5th Bad Thing

744
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:06,960
Memory loss with each break

745
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,560
But Chance did not specifically retort and instead ignored this fact

746
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:14,310
Afterwards, Chance begins to think that Oe is acting strangely because his heart is troubled

747
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,600
On the location shoot...

748
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,920
Also sharing an umbrella

749
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,780
Can I say, Oe

750
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,780
There's shit there

751
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,320
If you step on it like this

752
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:31,220
Just wash it off and you'll be fine

753
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,760
Although at that time, dog shit will be on the sole of your shoe

754
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,260
Like this

755
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,690
You don't need to actually do it!

756
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,430
Right?

757
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,430
What are you doing?

758
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,360
But what I'm trying to say is...

759
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,400
What's he trying to say

760
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:48,270
Just wash it off and then everything will be fine

761
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,280
Right? It'll be clean

762
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,010
What is this?

763
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,010
That's what I'm trying to say

764
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,350
Eh? What do you mean?

765
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,180
Just that...

766
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,290
The meaning is unclear

767
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,610
But it was clear that Chance was trying to do something to encourage Oe

768
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,570
Just act like a normal person

769
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,290
Just trying to do something

770
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,060
He wants to help out

771
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,630
Here too...

772
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,570
Here we go again

773
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:30,180
With cutting trees

774
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,770
Singing is good

775
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:38,290
Hey hey ho, hey hey ho

776
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,920
What is it this time

777
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Ok, cut

778
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:49,200
Drinking after singing is the most important

779
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:49,200
6th Bad Thing

780
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,000
This is scary

781
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,330
Drinking and crushing at the same time

782
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,820
The same as drinking jelly

783
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,670
You sure sing very well

784
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,770
Especially powerful

785
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Once again, it was time for a break...

786
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,530
Have you washed your shoes?

787
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,480
Do you have towels?
-Ah!

788
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,220
Not now

789
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,990
Wet wipes are fine

790
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:16,490
No wet wipes either

791
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,000
What are you thinking? Are you sick?

792
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,230
I'll beat you up!

793
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,900
Sorry

794
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,970
I'm gonna beat you, come outside

795
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,410
I told you to come outside!

796
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,510
Excuse me, can I interrupt?

797
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,380
Fine

798
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:41,320
Sorry

799
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,720
Okay I got it

800
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,460
Oe-san was so angry

801
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,390
He's fired up?

802
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,290
Super scary...

803
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:52,700
So annoying, he was so angry

804
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,400
Really angry?

805
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:02,100
Maybe it's not a problem, he may just be a nasty person

806
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,100
What kind of expression is this?

807
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,840
Sorry, sorry

808
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,010
Sorry I'm late

809
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,640
Hello, its our first time meeting

810
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,120
I'm Oe, the singer of Kitajima Music Agency

811
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:16,290
Memory loss with each break

812
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:16,290
7th Bad Thing

813
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,290
Ah, yes, hello, hello

814
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:22,990
Every break he gets angry and then starts shooting again with no memory

815
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:26,260
This is the enigmatic cycle of Oe

816
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,270
In the next food review section...

817
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,380
After eating the crab in the seafood rice bowl with his hands

818
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,720
This should be eaten quickly

819
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,480
This is a family meal, right?

820
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,350
Eats with his hands

821
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,350
8th Bad Thing

822
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,420
Only eating the crab

823
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,900
What's wrong with that guy?

824
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,970
Tsk. Ha-

825
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,400
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk

826
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,880
Because of the pressure, Chance keeps ticking

827
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,430
It's going bad

828
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,420
Ha-

829
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,540
To calm down he smokes 3 quit sticks

830
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,000
Is this magic?

831
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,600
What is this little magic trick?

832
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,540
Suddenly 3 sticks appear

833
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,000
Finally, the last shoot of the day

834
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,080
I'm Oe of Kitajima Music Agency

835
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:52,750
Memory loss with each break

836
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:52,750
9th Bad Thing

837
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,850
Ah, its not the first time

838
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,480
Not the first time

839
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,750
Finally said it

840
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:52,750
Ah...

841
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,060
What'll happen in the closing scene in the middle of a beautiful view

842
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:07,130
We found a good location to shoot

843
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,730
Go back a little more

844
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,900
Don't push me. Don't push me

845
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,240
Eh?
-Don't push me

846
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:17,770
Symptoms of delusions of victimization

847
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,770
10th Bad Thing

848
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,310
Don't push me

849
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:22,040
If you try it, I'll do it first

850
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,380
Scary!

851
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,110
Face this way. Watch the distance

852
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,420
Look at the camera

853
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,320
Don't push me

854
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,690
What do you mean by "don't push"?

855
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,520
Don't push me

856
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,390
Of... of course I wont

857
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:39,430
Of course

858
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:42,570
Even if it is a joke, do not say so

859
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,870
Can you take a step closer to Oe?

860
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,040
Don't push me

861
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,910
You cannot push me

862
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:51,510
You touched me

863
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,580
Oh, sorry.
-You touched me

864
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:58,710
What do you mean? If you want to do it, just come on!

865
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,970
Countdown 5 seconds 4 3 2

866
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:07,790
Okay, everybody, the view is beautiful.
-Yes

867
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:15,800
I feel like i've lived until today just to see this view

868
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,470
If the sun comes out

869
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,630
Don't push me. Don't push me

870
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:19,940
You trying to kill someone?

871
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,800
What?

872
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,770
I will not die alone

873
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:26,110
I'll definitely take you along

874
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,050
That guy is really dangerous, this guy... really scary

875
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:34,280
He's gone crazy

876
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,620
He's really that type

877
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,620
Terrible, terrible

878
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,720
Super scary!

879
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,090
I'm not listening to that guy's songs anymore

880
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:47,330
In summary
The possibility that he's scary can't be ruled out

881
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:49,320
Who knows?

882
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,070
The theory was tested

883
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:54,440
Is this how a verification works?

884
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,970
What is this? What have I just watched?

885
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:00,840
Of course, Oe is not that kind of person

886
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,250
He took it so seriously

887
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:06,520
No, that's who he is, isn't it?

888
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,600
Yeah, right.
-Yes

889
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,590
He's too good at it, right?

890
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,490
Yes, yes

891
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:14,060
The performance is too good, very scary

892
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,660
After playing that character, Shiro Sano was also treated as that kind of person...

893
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,660
â€»Shiro Sano played an Oedipal character in the TV series "Always Love You"

894
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:19,760
Acted too well

895
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:23,070
It's drama, if you will

896
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:26,570
He was following the instructions of the program team to act like this

897
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:27,840
It's an act

898
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,800
But

899
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,610
He's actually that kind of person

900
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:32,440
No, no, no

901
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:34,880
Let me be clear, he's not

902
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,450
Although I know this is an act

903
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,280
I can't listen to his songs anymore either

904
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,650
Please listen!

905
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,850
Everyone please keep listening!

906
00:45:42,520 --> 00:46:14,850
