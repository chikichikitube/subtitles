[Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!]

00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,780
Before the recording of 'Gaki No Tsukai'.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,320
The guys are hanging out as usual...
But that man is nowhere to be seen...

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,300
-We can all hang out here instead...
-What the heck are you saying?

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,450
That's right.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,960
I think it’s because of the generational gap.

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:15,890
Good morning.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,540
Hi.

9
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:16,970
Hey.

10
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,610
Ehm... I have another letter from our guy, Matsumoto...

11
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,660
Enough already.

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,890
'Our guy' Matsumoto?

13
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,450
We all know him...

14
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,090
For real...

15
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,260
It's been a while since we last got a letter.

16
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:29,810
Right?

17
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,740
And he's using such good paper... What a waste!

18
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:41,000
"You lot are just a bunch of lowlife celebs who can't hold it in your pants."

19
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,210
"It's so painful to see how you act like the Yokozuna in the room."
(EN: Highest title rank in sumo)

20
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,210
There he goes again...

21
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,820
So who is the true technician?

22
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:56,340
The guardian of the nipples, the nipple biting god...
We will find out who the real father is...

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,520
Hitoshi Matsumoto.

24
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,440
The map...

25
00:00:59,130 --> 00:00:59,860
Is there a map?

26
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,460
There is.

27
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,200
Look at this.

28
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,940
It's apparently on a scale of 1/2500.

29
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,150
We can see Ucchan's house, Degawa's house and Maseki Geinosha.
(EN: Teruyoshi Uchimura & Tetsuro Degawa)
(EN: Maseki Geinosha is a Japanese talent agency headquartered in Tokyo.)

30
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,950
So you turn and it just says 'here'...

31
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,950
There's also Keiko Utsumi's house.
(EN: Actress/Manzai comedian).

32
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,770
It's his teacher's house.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,980
Why is Maseki Geinosha so far out the map?

34
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,210
The people at Maseki wouldn't even know where this is.

35
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,320
Didn't he lose last time we did this?

36
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,000
-That's right.
-He did.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,050
It was either you or Matsumoto.

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,130
Last time we measured the time it took the guys to suck out raisins from nipples.

39
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,260
Matsumoto had a hard time, which landed him in last place!

40
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,120
He had to take the punishment.

41
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,290
His task was to be filmed by a weather camera yelling in a crowded place.

42
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,640
He was humiliated like never before.

43
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,290
I'm in Shinbashi!

44
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,680
I'm in Ginza!

45
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,840
-This place is totally different from the map.
-You're right!

46
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,690
A hundred quintillion and one.

47
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,080
A hundred quintillion and two.

48
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,280
A hundred quintillion and three.

49
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,630
-A hundred quintillion and six.
-Hundred quintillion?

50
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,930
Isn't that a crazy number?

51
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,020
A hundred quintillion and seven.

52
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,540
He's made it to the quintillions.

53
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,810
A hundred quintillion and eight.

54
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,910
A hundred quintillion and nine.

55
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,740
A hundred quintillion and ten.

56
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,830
A hundred quintillion and eleven.

57
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,080
What's wrong with him?

58
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,320
You bastards!
You're late!

59
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,330
Getting to one quintillion would be crazy.

60
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,410
It's a lot.

61
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,590
For sure, for sure.

62
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,570
Get in line! You bashtwards!!

63
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,070
-Huh?
-What?

64
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,340
-Bashtwards?
-What?

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,730
Get in line! You bastards!!

66
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,910
-Get in line...
-What's wrong with you?

67
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,250
How have you guys been doing lately?

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,450
Have you been getting along with your partners?

69
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:38,740
My wife?

70
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,500
Your wife or your girlfriend!!
I'm asking whether you've been getting along!!!

71
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,770
Go ahead, glasses.

72
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,220
-Ehm... There's no one with glasses...
-Yeah, no glasses here...

73
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,080
Anyone! You!
You're glasses.

74
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,590
-You go!
Have you been doing alright?
-But he doesn't wear glasses...

75
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,990
Well, my wife and I are doing just fine.

76
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,090
But how?

77
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,360
Have you been doing ‘the dirty’ with your partner?

78
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,060
I mean, we've been married for 10 years so doing ‘the dirty' is not accurate...
But we get along fine.

79
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,310
So tell me, are you the type to 'suck' or 'bite'?

80
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,060
Huh? What?

81
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,870
Nipples!!

82
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,120
-What's wrong with you?
-You're pretty pissed...

83
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,550
Alright, you guys have to tell me.

84
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:21,830
Say your age, your zodiac sign and whether you 'suck' or 'bite'.

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,770
For example, I would say: "48, Rabbit, Suck"!!

86
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,030
Go!!

87
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,770
48, Rabbit, Both.

88
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,210
Both?!

89
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,400
I suck and bite.

90
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,590
Alright, fine.
Next!!

91
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,960
I'm 43 years old and my Zodiac sign is Monkey...

92
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,560
Don't say 'age' or 'Zodiac sign’!

93
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,650
-Go again!
-So strict...

94
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,960
-Just keep it simple.
-Sure.

95
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,210
43, Monkey, Suck.

96
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,680
-Right, that's good.
-Okay.

97
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,010
Keep it simple!!

98
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,420
Sorry...

99
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:57,870
Go next.

100
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,450
40, Wildboar, Bite.

101
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,420
Alright.

102
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,310
Next.

103
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:03,940
'Bite'...

104
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,950
40, Wildboar, Suck.

105
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,870
Do we have to do this?

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,840
This is so embarrassing.

107
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,610
-It's so embarrassing.
-Yeah.

108
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,660
34, Snake, Bite.

109
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,700
33, Horse, Bite.

110
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,800
Who said 'bite'?
Put up your hand!

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,200
Don't bite off more than you can chew!!

112
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,710
You have to be gentle and know when to let go of your bite!

113
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,120
Sure.

114
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,880
I called you over to show you how it’s done!!

115
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,900
-Scary!
-That's scary!

116
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,060
-Scary! Scary! Scary!
-That's so scary.

117
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,200
You're Nagabuchi!
(EN: Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi: Singer-songwriter)

118
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,750
That's the same as Nagabuchi!

119
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,710
Alright!

120
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,350
Let's see who can best pleasure a woman's nipples!!

121
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,000
This is "The Ultimate Nipple Biting Contest"!!

122
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,820
Come on!

123
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,420
"The Ultimate Nipple Biting Contest!"

124
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,640
Each contestant will have an opportunity to bite the doll's nipple.

125
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,960
And try to swing it the farthest without using their hands!

126
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,170
Two tries per person.
The lowest score will get a harsh punishment.

127
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,130
It's always the same thing, so Shozo, just go.

128
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,620
Me?

129
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,830
-I don't really know how to do it...
-Right...

130
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,180
You're the 'biting' type, right?

131
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,260
You have two tries so you can see how it goes then try again.

132
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,130
-Show us how it's done.
-I'm going then.

133
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:32,970
It's a rule.

134
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,880
You can't use your hands.

135
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:35,880
Can't use hands.

136
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,060
-You bite the nipple, spin around, and when you think it's time... you step forward and release.
-I see.

137
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,440
Are you starting from a sleeping position, Shozo?

138
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,960
Can I do it my way?

139
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,370
-Of course, it's easier if you go all in.
-Yes.

140
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,890
You do you.

141
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,510
The rules are too ambiguous!!

142
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,530
No way!

143
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,440
I've never seen them like this.
Go ahead and call her!

144
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,140
-Please start.
-Alright!

145
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,660
Our top batter is Endo.

146
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,380
What kind of performance will he show us in these uncharted waters?

147
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,310
Let's see... What nipple will he choose?\

148
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,670
Right.

149
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,250
Of course, the mood is also important.

150
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,500
I wonder how far he'll throw it.

151
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,380
We don't have a baseline yet.

152
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,020
You can take your time.

153
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,100
-You'll get an advantage the more you spin.
-Right.

154
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:32,920
Alright.

155
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,530
-There he goes.
-Whoa!

156
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,660
-Whoa!
-Nice!

157
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,640
-He's good, he's good!
-Here it comes!

158
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,660
Oh no!

159
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,590
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

160
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,170
That was terrible.

161
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,000
-This is bad.
-So bad.

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,880
It's surprisingly hard!

163
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,230
What's the score?!

164
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,300
60 cm.

165
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,880
Hold on!

166
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,530
No way, no way!

167
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,820
-You didn't pleasure her at all.
-It didn't even reach the second line.

168
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,060
This is so hard.

169
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,250
-Someone else has to go now.
-Yes, please.

170
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,590
Then let's get Tanaka.

171
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,930
Alright.

172
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,870
-Tanaka is always last.
-That's right.

173
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,580
I don't wanna take a bite after someone else.

174
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,620
I totally get you.

175
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,130
We'll get a new doll, right?

176
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,740
Your real partners have been with someone before!!

177
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,510
Is that so?

178
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,860
-Right... Right...
-Yeah...

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,470
With 4 out of 6 losses, this is our resident loser.

180
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,600
Will he manage to turn his reputation around?

181
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,150
Alright Tanaka, let's go!

182
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,030
Alright!

183
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,730
Go, go.

184
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,900
-You can also spin too much and lose momentum.
-Right...

185
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,740
Here I go.

186
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,750
He's going in.

187
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,030
That's very aggressive.

188
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,410
You can't do that!

189
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,240
That's not the nipple!

190
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,650
You're just biting the breast!

191
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,920
Also, you cannot bite twice.

192
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,290
Only the nipple.

193
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,950
-Yes, only the nipple.
-Sorry...

194
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,420
-You'll get some penalties.
-Okay!

195
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,510
That's no-good either.

196
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,580
-That's good.
-Alright!

197
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,330
Whoa!! That's how it feels?!

198
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,060
What do you mean?

199
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,590
Haven't you done this before?

200
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,710
What do you mean?

201
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,000
It sounds like you've never done this before.

202
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,540
Why's he making those sounds?

203
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,740
-Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
-That was bad!

204
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,960
It's a foul!

205
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,940
What the heck was that?!

206
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,030
Out!

207
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,120
That's the worst case scenario.

208
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,800
The worst.

209
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,910
Can you let me go next?

210
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,960
-Alright, go ahead, Hamada.
-I'll just go.

211
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,310
I'll show you.

212
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,830
You seem very confident.

213
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,750
For some reason, Hamada is very confident in his nipple biting skills.

214
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,660
How will he fare?

215
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:36,860
Here I go!

216
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,270
I'm going all out.

217
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,790
This would be okay in SunTV (EN: Commercial television station)

218
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,100
On a DVD or something like that.

219
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,560
Or an adult book.

220
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,240
Something like that.

221
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,610
Oh, he's going already.

222
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,170
That's fast!

223
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,940
It flew straight up!

224
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,170
Are you kidding me?!

225
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,940
Let's see how he did.

226
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,790
What's the score?!

227
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,600
3m 50cm.

228
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,510
Amazing!

229
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,430
New high score!

230
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,370
He's a genius.

231
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,990
You were doing this in your student days, weren't you?

232
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,410
As if!

233
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,590
But with real nipples.

234
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,920
-You're a pro already.
-Fujiwara, go next.

235
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,620
Sure, sure.

236
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,650
34 years old!

237
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,540
-Go!
-Alright!

238
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,440
The young comedian, Fujiwara.

239
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,210
He wants to impress his elder, Hamada.

240
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,300
This thing...

241
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,570
Huh? Hold on...

242
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,050
You can't be doing that.

243
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,580
-You can't do that.
-What are you doing?

244
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,640
Just go ahead!
Quick!

245
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,590
-Go quick!
-One shot!

246
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,620
I can't prepare myself?

247
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,320
Of course not!

248
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:31,840
Hurry up.

249
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,910
Are you crazy?!

250
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,450
It's all about the flow...

251
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,310
Hey! I told you, you can't do that!

252
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,840
You only have one shot!

253
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,530
Stand as soon as you bite it.

254
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,310
If you didn't grab it then that's too bad.

255
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,340
Yeah, that's your fault.

256
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,610
-He's taking too long.
-Yeah, hurry up.

257
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,940
This guy is already messing up.

258
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,120
I'm getting pissed.

259
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,590
What's with that spin?

260
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,920
He's just standing there.

261
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,870
He's so confused.

262
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,730
Right.

263
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,050
-Whoa it flew!
-That’s quite the distance.

264
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:00,840
It flew!

265
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,130
-That was so far.
-That's a nice score.

266
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:03,880
That pisses me off.

267
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,650
4m 8cm.

268
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,180
That's so good!

269
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,120
4 meters?!

270
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,120
-But I don't know how I feel about that one...
-Right...

271
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,560
-Inomoto, go next.
-Yes!

272
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,440
Inomoto!

273
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,040
Inomoto, the top class athlete.

274
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,990
How far will his doll fly?

275
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:23,640
That's fast.

276
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,070
-It is.
-Pretty fast.

277
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,540
-That's good!
-Just like that!

278
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,210
Fast worker!

279
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,160
That's good!

280
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,280
You can't fall off though!

281
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,290
You can't fall off?!

282
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:33,650
That was close!

283
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,840
-You can't fall off?!
-What the heck?!

284
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,960
Why didn't you tell us sooner?!

285
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,880
Of course you can't fall off.

286
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,410
So close!

287
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,660
3m 90cm.

288
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,540
That's amazing!

289
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,700
License is pretty good!

290
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,210
-I guess it's all about youth.
-Youth is really a factor here.

291
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,990
Everyone is locking their jaws already.

292
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,820
In that sense, Cocorico is doing so badly.

293
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,140
It's so bad... Terrible!

294
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,400
-Don't touch it!
-Don't touch it!

295
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,230
Who's nipples do you think those are?!

296
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,040
You idiot!

297
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,220
Those are everyone's nipples!

298
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,280
Everyone's nipples?!

299
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,220
They're not just your nipples!

300
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,300
Alright, alright.

301
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,530
Surprisingly, Yamasaki hasn't lost a single time throughout this series.

302
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,930
But we're still worried about his performance.

303
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,030
Go ahead.

304
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,040
His movements are fast.

305
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,910
That's good!

306
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,520
-This is the crucial part.
-Alright!

307
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,630
Come on! Come on! Come on!

308
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,490
That's a very boring score.

309
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,240
Nor good nor bad.

310
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,570
It's an average score.

311
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,280
3m 46cm.

312
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,360
Whoa!

313
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,720
It's average.

314
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,200
That's amazing.

315
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,570
Everyone but Matsumoto has completed their first throw.

316
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,850
The Cocorico duo have had the worst scores.

317
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,430
However, they can still get back on top with their next throw.

318
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,200
Who will have to stomach the bitter taste of defeat?

319
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,890
I'll go last.

320
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:52,970
Is that so?

321
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,230
-Your second one?
-That's right.

322
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,690
Then I'll go ahead.

323
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,920
-Go ahead, Shozo.
-Yeah, I'm in trouble here.

324
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,190
You really are.

325
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,040
Let's go!

326
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,390
Alright!

327
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,620
It's hard.

328
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,830
He's quick on this one.

329
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,020
Alright, Shozo.

330
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,270
The confused look from before was a detriment.

331
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,330
Oh, as expected.

332
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,240
Oh, it flew!

333
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,390
-That's amazing!
-Yes!!

334
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,490
That's crazy!
The second attempt went straight up.

335
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,050
Thank you!

336
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,260
5m 77cm.

337
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,230
That's amazing.

338
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:23,590
Thank you!

339
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,340
-I'll go next then.
-Go ahead.

340
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,850
Huh? I didn't think anyone would go over the 5m line.

341
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,570
Start!

342
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,250
What's with this guy?!

343
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,550
He went for the other nipple.

344
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,140
He's all excited, this guy...

345
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,650
Look!

346
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,080
Look at him go.

347
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,830
-3m 68cm.
-Whoa, it's higher.

348
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,520
It's better.

349
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,210
The second try will always be better.

350
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,680
-He did pretty good.
-Yeah.

351
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,070
Next up, the comedy duo License.

352
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,770
They got even better scores...
And now, Yamasaki.

353
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,380
He's facing our way.

354
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,480
Huh? What was that just now?

355
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,830
It's dangerous... He's gonna fall.

356
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,280
Look, look...

357
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,490
Go, go, go.
Go!

358
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,150
I think you've messed up.

359
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,160
You've messed up.

360
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,220
This has to be the worst one.

361
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:15,380
Yamasaki currently sits in last place.
Tanaka has one try remaining and Matsumoto has two.

362
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,420
Which one of these three will get the punishment?

363
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,320
-Alright!
-Go ahead.

364
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,310
-So after this everyone else has 1 try left, right?
-Yes.

365
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:23,950
That's right.

366
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,450
Yeah.

367
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,590
So it's either Matsumoto or Tanaka, right?

368
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,070
But Yamasaki is also pretty low.

369
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,570
Yamasaki is also in trouble.

370
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,740
That's a very different starting position.

371
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,180
Huh?

372
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,180
That's very different.

373
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,330
These nipples are different from what I have experienced.

374
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,160
Have they always been like this?

375
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,410
What did you think they were gonna look like?

376
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,040
I thought they would be more solid.

377
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,020
No, no.

378
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,480
These nipples are very fluffy.

379
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:45,950
That's right.

380
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,430
Biting them is kinda gross, right?

381
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,300
Let's go!

382
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,570
Matsumoto, start!

383
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,870
That's fast.

384
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,540
-Oh, so fast.
-As expected.

385
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,240
Whoa.

386
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,130
-Huh?
-What? He just tried to go the other way.

387
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,720
That was terrible.

388
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,580
This was so bad!

389
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,260
1m 22cm.

390
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,810
This is bad.

391
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,780
Hold on.

392
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,340
It's the same as getting a foul.

393
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,140
Aren't the nipples on my doll different?

394
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,580
-No way, they're the same.
-It's the same.

395
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,250
They're all the same.

396
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,830
Tanaka got a foul on his first try....
How will he do next?

397
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,230
Let's go, Tanaka's second try!

398
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,090
Start!

399
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,950
Tanaka, just avoid a foul.

400
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,390
Tanaka, just give up.

401
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,050
-Just let me have this.
-Focus, focus!

402
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:33,650
Focus!!

403
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,170
That's good!

404
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,580
-You should spin more...
-That's good.

405
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,240
That's very good.

406
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,990
Good... Focus.

407
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,820
I'm telling you... You have to turn more.

408
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,150
That's it!

409
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,530
What's the score?!

410
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,080
3m 86cm.

411
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,620
What?!

412
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,890
-He beat Hosei.
-It's between you two.

413
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,950
-No way!
-You're in trouble now, Matsumoto.

414
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,210
That's crazy.

415
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,460
Do I have to go?

416
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,550
Of course!

417
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,340
I'll just win...

418
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,390
You'll have to forfeit if you don't go now.

419
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,400
Matsumoto's second try.

420
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,420
Can he beat Yamasaki's score?!

421
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,190
Alright, let's go, Matsumoto!

422
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:09,860
Start!

423
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,660
Come on!

424
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,210
3m 59cm!

425
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:13,730
Hey! Hold on!

426
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,800
-Hey! Isn't that cheating?!
-Hold on!

427
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,350
No, no, no, no.

428
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,790
The nipple!

429
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,060
What?!

430
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,140
You bit more than you could chew!

431
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,540
I didn't!

432
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,420
You were biting the white parts.

433
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,520
What are you saying?!

434
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,340
The rules are too ambiguous!

435
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,420
You set the rules!

436
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,410
You set them!

437
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,200
-You can only bite the nipple area.
-I was.

438
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,340
You were definitely biting the white parts.

439
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,510
You bastards are only this attentive when it comes to me.

440
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,670
No, no, no, no.

441
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,400
It's been the same for everyone.

442
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,100
Go ahead.

443
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,200
-Guys, watch him.
-Yeah.

444
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,700
He'll cheat.

445
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,470
-Look!
-Nah, nah, nah!

446
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,570
-What do you mean?
-You're trying to cheat again!

447
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,970
I'm not!

448
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,410
I've always done it like this!

449
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,930
You can call and ask her!

450
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,670
Who are we calling?!

451
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,500
Who should we call?!

452
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,720
I'm telling you, I always do it like this!

453
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,260
You can only bite this part.

454
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,850
Only the nipple.

455
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,280
Okay.

456
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,700
You guys...

457
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,730
He's just stalling.

458
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,500
He knows what he's doing.

459
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:09,670
Here I go.

460
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,280
-Okay.
-Alright.

461
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,310
Okay.

462
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,510
I hate this!
This is definitely weird.

463
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,350
What?

464
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,920
He's just a peeping Tom!

465
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,690
I can't work like this!

466
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,240
This shouldn't be allowed!

467
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,740
Then just bite the nipple.

468
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,690
I'm getting self conscious so please go over there.

469
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:28,930
Over there.

470
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,710
No cheating.

471
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,590
-Let's go.
-Alright!

472
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,360
Okay!

473
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:34,900
-That's good.
-Good.

474
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,740
Let's go! Start!

475
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,020
This is bad.

476
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,470
-Let's go.
-Alright!

477
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,230
Let's go! Start!

478
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,560
This is bad.

479
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,360
It didn't fly at all.

480
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,690
That was so bad.

481
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,370
This is awful.

482
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,420
Terrible.

483
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,190
How much?

484
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,790
2m 30cm.

485
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,370
Hold on, hold on, hold on...

486
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,550
That's too bad.

487
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,440
It really is a shame.

488
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,850
What do you mean?
What's happening?

489
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,590
-Well, you're getting punished...
-That's right.

490
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,620
You'll get a harsh punishment.

491
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:28,770
What's the punishment?

492
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,970
Hold on, hold on, hold on...

493
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,570
But... Really... What are we doing?

494
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,120
What?!

495
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,470
Stop it!

496
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,150
Who are you trying to convince?!

497
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,020
Let's get real here.

498
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,830
About what?!

499
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,270
What's the punishment?!

500
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,130
Hold on, hold on, hold on...

501
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,140
Hitoshi Matsumoto is the loser!!

502
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,880
Hold on.

503
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,470
I'm telling you to hold on.

504
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,090
What is it?

505
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,690
You lost already.

506
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,430
I mean, I get that but...

507
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,880
Yes?

508
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,210
But for real now... What are we really doing?

509
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,550
What do you mean?

510
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,460
Can we really air this program?

511
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,040
-Of course we can.
-Totally.

512
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,190
Of course we can.

513
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,450
But it's gonna be too harsh for me.

514
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,310
-Huh?
-What?

515
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,660
You know, my daughter is going through puberty and all...

516
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,560
She's still just a baby!

517
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,590
Guys, let's just go home.

518
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,170
Hold on, for real!
Wait!

519
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,130
Hold on, hold on.

520
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,840
What is it?!

521
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,930
-For real...
-Oh, there it is.

522
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,420
"Pretending to Sleep while holding 'Weekly Nipple' in town".

523
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,080
That's harsh.

524
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,310
Matsumoto, this is 'The Weekly Nipple'.

525
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,650
That's what you'll be reading.

526
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,600
Hold on, for real!
Wait!

527
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,150
Hold on, for real!

528
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,260
Hold on, for real!
Wait!

529
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,570
-No way I'd do that!
-That would be horrible!

530
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,910
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

531
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:47,950
Hold on, hold on.

532
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm at a disadvantage in this game!!

533
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,650
-Huh? Why? Why?
-What do you mean?

534
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,080
It's your game.

535
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,170
'Weekly Nipple'!

536
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,550
There's lots of nipples!

537
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,010
I was at a disadvantage!!

538
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,650
What's with that magazine...

539
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,390
For real... Let's roll it back.

540
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,580
Hurry up and take it.

541
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,030
Hurry up.

542
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,110
You do it then.

543
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,060
Hurry up.

544
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,670
-You do it then.
-Take it.

545
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,160
-You...
-Let's just go home!

546
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,810
Run!

547
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,110
-He's coming!
-He's coming!

548
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,580
Hold on...

549
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,380
Hamada, you do it!

550
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,740
Hamada!

551
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,200
You do it!

552
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,270
Hamada!

553
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,030
You do it!

554
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,670
Hamada!!

555
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,320
You do it!!!

556
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,100
Alright.

557
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,590
It's gonna be on Twitter.

558
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,820
It's gonna spread like a wildfire.

559
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,430
A lot of stuff goes viral on there.

560
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,290
I wonder how far down the line it will haunt me.

561
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,130
I probably won't ever escape this.

562
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,400
That's the worst.

563
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,480
Hamada!!

564
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,310
You do it!!!
