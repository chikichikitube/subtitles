00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Toll Booth

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
http://zurui.blogspot.com

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,120
We finally arrived
- This is the toll booth

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,550
Is this it?
- This is it

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,550
It's written here, 16km

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,220
Here right?
- Yes, this is where we pay

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,250
They're eating...

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,620
But it says "Toll booth"
- Are you sure?

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,640
Oh yeah, the price is 600 yen

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,190
Excuse me!

11
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,500
Excuse me!

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,070
They just talking...

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,600
Excuse me!

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:35,970
Hello?

00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,470

16
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,340
Not too many cars here
- Yeah, cause this is the country side

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,450
Hey, hey, hey wait a minute!

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,550
Excuse me!

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,190
Hello?

20
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,990
She looked at us right?
- Yeah

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,090
Excuse me

22
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,090
Try and ask her

23
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,340
This has to be toll booth

24
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,600
Yeah?

25
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,670
Excuse me, this is the toll booth right?

26
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:08,970
Yeah

27
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,420
600 yen?
- Yeah, 600 yen

28
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,590
Ok, here you go, thank you

29
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,190
She closed the curtain

30
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,590
Excuse me!

31
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,190
Excuse me! Hello!

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,370
I can see her shadow!

33
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,440
We see your shadow
- You're there right?

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,740
We can see your shadow

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,470
What is it?

36
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,200
Um.. it's 600 yen right?

37
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,100
600 yen

38
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,170
Can I have my change?

39
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:41,900
Hey!

40
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,270
Seconds!

41
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,570
Can I get my change?
- We gave you 1000 yen

42
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,540
Our change

43
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,890
She's giving him a second helping

44
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,290
Excuse me, my change!

45
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,120
Hello!

46
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,250
Please give us our change!

47
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,420
What?
- Please give me 400 yen change!

48
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,820
Change? What change are you talking about?

49
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,620
We just gave your 1000 yen right?

50
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,190
It should be 600 yen
- I don't have your 1000 yen

51
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,940
I just gave 1000 yen to you

52
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,300
I didn't get it

53
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,370
We gave it to you

54
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,500
We gave it to you
- Oh, there it is, the 1000 yen

55
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,220
That 1000 yen is ours

56
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,320
What are you saying?

57
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,990
No, that's our 1000 yen on the table, right there

58
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,240
I didn't get 1000 yen from you

59
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,750
We gave it to you...

60
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,820
YOU DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ME!

61
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,150
Pay her again

62
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,290
What are you saying?

63
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,920
Don't try to fool me

64
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,720
Never mind about them

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,420
This is the toll booth right?
- What time do you think it is?

66
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,170
This should be open 24hrs

67
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,270
Don't be so harsh

68
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,490
Thank you

69
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,540
Ok
- Yes

70
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,740
I only have large bills...

71
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,840
You have to pay 600 yen, that's why
I'm telling you to give me 600 yen!

72
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,770
Ok, here you go, but I only have a large bill!

73
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,540
Please

74
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,570
Can't see what she's doing when
she closes the curtain

75
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,290
Are they eating?

76
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,390
excuse me, hello?

77
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,990
Hello!

78
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,990
Excuse me!

79
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,070
Excuse me

80
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,670
They took our picture

81
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,140
Excuse me!

82
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,440
Our change!

83
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,340
WHAT NOW?!

84
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,700
Give us our change

85
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,200
Hey, you talk to them, I don't
know what they're saying!

86
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,240
I don't know!

87
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,040
I don't understand about this new generation

88
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,090
What is it?

89
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,020
We gave her 10,000 yen but we didn't get our change

90
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,590
Before that we gave her 1000 yen

91
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,550
Did you get it?
- No I don't

92
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,050
You just took it from us, right?
- It's the first time I'm seeing you

93
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,920
First time she's seeing us?

94
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,890
Ok whatever, but give us back 9600 yen

95
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,540
Our change, 9400 yen

96
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,140
What are you saying?

97
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,370
Never mind about the 1000 yen, just give
me back the change for the 10,000 yen

98
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm really sorry

99
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,740
Hey, wait!

100
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,390
Hey, please open the window!

101
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,490
What?

102
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,790
We are in rush, so please give us back our change!

103
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,450
There's cars behind us too

104
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,520
My husband.. isn't feeling too well

105
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,970
Don't cause too much trouble

106
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,370
When we get our change, we'll leave

107
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,900
He's been bedridden, but was feeling
better so he come out to eat

108
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,840
Please leave him alone

109
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,600
Just give us our money back

110
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,640
Give us back our 9400 yen

111
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,740
You have family right?

112
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,270
Yes

113
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,840
Then please leave us alone

114
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,040
I understand, but we just want our change

115
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,050
The 10,000 yen over there

116
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,050
Here, give it to them, it's ok

117
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,790
Ok, here it is, now leave

118
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,020
No, we aren't talking about this 1000
yen, we want the 10,000 yen

119
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,790
You're Yakuza right?

120
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,770
No, we aren't

121
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,440
We're college students

122
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,000
College students

123
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,370
We want change for the 10,000
yen, forget about the 1000 yen

124
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,070
You guys don't understand huh?

125
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,540
No we don't

126
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,020
What you're doing is the same as stealing from us

127
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,190
Scary, so scary

128
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,090
Give me a break

129
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,920
Dear
- Yeah

130
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,020
Can you go and call the police?

131
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,990
What for?

132
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,490
Let them take care of this

133
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,140
Good, let them call the police.
- We can talk to them too

134
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,190
I don't know what you're talking about

135
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,770
We paid you right?

136
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,000
You're Japanese right?
- Yes we are

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't understand

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,770
We're just asking for change

139
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,840
What's the problem?

140
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,750
They're giving us trouble, are you the police?

141
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,190
Yes

142
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,050
You're the old man that was eating in there!

143
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,420
That's just wrong!

144
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,920
They're giving us trouble

145
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,770
Police?

146
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,940
That's for the American police

147
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,140
That's completely wrong

148
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,140
You're not the police

149
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,100
Did you pay?

150
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,900
Yes we did!
- No you didn't

151
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,470
If you want to call the police, call the police

152
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,300
We paid 10,000 yen!

153
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,470
Call the police

154
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,920
We are just regular folk, and they
came suddenly asking for money

155
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,890
Driver's license

156
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,540
Why should I show it to you?

157
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,290
What kind of attitude is that?

158
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,390
Show me your license!

159
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,850
What are you doing?!

160
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,820
She took a picture of us

161
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,290
Now I have evidence

162
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,470
What evidence?

163
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,690
Evidence of violence

164
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,520
That's not good

165
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,790
Let's go, let's go

166
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,370
My husband is sick

167
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,100
Ok, I'll give you money!

168
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,640
My husband is sick

169
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Your husband is young!

170
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,540
You're young! What happened?!

171
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,000
That's gross!

172
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,240
Let's get out of here!

173
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,220
Idiots!

174
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,420
Stupid!

175
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,590
Stupid idiots!

176
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,520
The next car's here, get ready!
