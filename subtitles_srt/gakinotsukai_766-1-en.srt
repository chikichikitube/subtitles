4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,490
In the green room before shooting

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,190
In the green room before shooting,

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,960
Yamasaki and Cocorico wait for Downtown's arrival.

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,920
However, only this man arrived.

8
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,920
However, only this man arrived.

9
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,230
Hey.

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,800
Who is this?

11
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,570
"Who is this"? It's me.

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,640
Hello.

13
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,870
Oh, hello.

14
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,970
Hold on a second.

15
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,970
You're dressed up like a pervert.

16
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,880
You're dressed up like a pervert.

17
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,040
I'm dressed as a kuroko*.  If you see me wearing this,

18
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:37,040
Note*: A kuroko is a traditional Japanese theater stagehand. Kurokos dress in all black to imply to the theater audience that they are supposed to be invisible and not part of the onstage action.

19
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,040
you should be able to tell what I've come for.

20
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:34,510
Could it be that thing that we've done a few times before?

21
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,250
Could it be that thing that we've done a few times before?

22
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,720
What is the dream that Matsumoto envisioned!?

23
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,050
The event that Matsumoto set his sights on this time is...

24
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,720
The event that Matsumoto set his sights on this time is...

25
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,720
Swimming

26
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,720
swimming.

27
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,260
The 100 meters freestyle world record at the time was 47.84 seconds

28
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,500
The 100 meters freestyle men's world record at the time was 47.84 seconds.

29
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:50,500
The 100 meters freestyle world record at the time was 47.84 seconds

30
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,730
What is Matsumoto's challenge!?

31
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,160
And Matsumoto's challenge is...

32
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,730
And Matsumoto's challenge is...

33
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,770
This time he wants to swim 25 meters and go under 10 seconds.

34
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,700
This time he wants to swim 25 meters and go under 10 seconds.

35
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,700
Impossible, that's gotta be impossible.

36
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,840
That has to be an impossible time.

37
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,640
Matsumoto is saying he wants to do it.  So help him.

38
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,080
But...

39
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,810
What's your problem?

40
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,380
Are you going to do it or not?  Be clear about it.

41
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,080
I will do it.  After that

42
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,090
He's waiting at the hall!

43
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,090
No, no, I'll do it.

44
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,150
Then, why don't we

45
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Yes.

46
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,150
get ready.

47
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,620
You guys get changed, too.

48
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,860
Oh...

49
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,660
This, this thing here - they've been prepared for you.

50
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:20,830
Ok.

51
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,230
Ok.

52
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,260
The four kurokos have risen again.

53
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:28,370
Freestyle Swimming

54
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:28,370
Matsumoto Hitoshi

55
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:28,370
Swim 25 meters in 10 seconds!!

56
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,460
Matsumoto Hitoshi: Swim 25 meters in 10 seconds!

57
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,370
Matsumoto Hitoshi: Swim 25 meters in 10 seconds!

58
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,870
For now,

59
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,300
Yes.

60
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,770
let's just do what we can.

61
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,740
Yes, yes.

62
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,770
That's always what it comes down to, anyway.

63
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
Yes.

64
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,510
Understood.

65
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,840
Huh?

66
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,240
He almost slipped there.

67
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Yes, he almost slipped.

68
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,650
Hey.

69
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,080
Hello.

70
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,620
Hello.

71
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,080
Hello.

72
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,850
Everyone

73
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,120
pretty much agreed

74
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,120
and showed up.

75
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,290
Whoa.  Pecs?

76
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,390
Whoa.  Pecs?

77
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,390
He's moving his pecs!

78
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,960
But it's not that much.

79
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,360
Why is he moving them?

80
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,830
I feel like

81
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,430
you all are thinking that I don't want

82
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,600
you all are thinking that I don't want

83
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,730
to break a record.

84
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,900
But I do want to break a record.

85
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,040
But I do want to break a record.

86
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,470
Which is why,

87
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,210
I ask that you help me out here.

88
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,240
I ask that you help me out here.

89
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,550
*Note: Matsumoto is doing an impression of Takada Nobuhiko, a former pro-wrestler, MMA fighter, and PRIDE (an MMA organization) executive.  See video: http://bit.ly/1O9wt1C

90
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,550
Come on out!*

91
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,750
He might be a little scared.

92
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,260
That's true.  The goggles are also really...

93
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,130
Frankly,

94
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,130
I have no idea what's going to be done to me.

95
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,000
But, I mean... right?

96
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,000
You'll be fine!

97
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,500
Matsumoto's 1st Attempt!!

98
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,500
Matsumoto's first attempt!

99
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,400
Please, thank you.

100
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,770
Let's make it happen in one shot.

101
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,270
That'd be nice.

102
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,800
Set him up, first.

103
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,280
Whoa.

104
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,850
He's already gone limp.

105
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,050
Just do it.

106
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,850
Let's make it happen in one shot.

107
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,920
Yup.

108
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,380
Here we go.

109
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,880
There we go.

110
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,380
Let's make it happen in one shot.

111
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,020
10 seconds, all right?

112
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,020
Let's go!

113
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,020
Yes, let's go!

114
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,660
Ready, start!

115
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,960
Ready, start!

116
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,720
All right!

117
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,360
Let's go!  Hurry!

118
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,630
Hamada, Hamada, please hurry!

119
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,630
Ok, flutter kick!

120
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,970
All right, it's good, it's good!

121
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,630
There we go, there we go!

122
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,510
It's deep!

123
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,280
Forget it! Forget it!

124
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,680
Forget it! Forget it!

125
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,580
It's too dangerous!

126
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,350
My feet can't reach the bottom anymore.

127
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,580
Get out of here!

128
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,950
That was dangerous.

129
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,420
Yeah, that was.

130
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,460
That was deep!

131
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,930
This pool becomes gradually deeper towards the goal area.

132
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,190
Didn't know that was the deal.

133
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,260
Are you even trying?

134
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,470
It's just...

135
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,000
If you're gonna abandon me when it gets deep...

136
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,570
If you're gonna abandon me when it gets deep...

137
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,080
Matsumoto's 2nd Attempt!!

138
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,370
With caution for the depth of the pool, the second attempt.

139
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,080
With caution for the depth of the pool, the second attempt.

140
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,510
Tanaka.

141
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,580
Here we go. Yes.

142
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,510
Endo, too.

143
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,510
Yes.

144
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,450
Here.

145
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,550
Yes.

146
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,450
Here.

147
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,650
Yes.

148
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,550
Yes, got it.

149
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,920
Yes. We got it.

150
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,750
Yes. We got it.

151
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,790
Ready... Go!

152
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,390
Ready... Go!

153
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,290
No way, this is impossible

154
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,290
Let's go.

155
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,830
Time's running.

156
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,100
Time's passing.

157
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,100
Ok, here.

158
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,500
Ok. Ok.

159
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,530
Ok. Ok.

160
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,400
Keep going, keep going.

161
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,440
Come on, Hamada!

162
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,740
Come on, Hamada!

163
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,540
Come on!

164
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,540
After he gets on, all right?

165
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,540
Set him on a shopping cart and use the force of a rubber cord to swim

166
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,810
Don't pull! Don't pull yet!

167
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,810
It won't attach!

168
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,580
All right? Go!

169
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,820
Ok, go!

170
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,580
All right? Go!

171
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,320
Go!

172
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,360
What?

173
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,090
That's strange.

174
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:47,070
He gets separated from the shopping cart and the plan unfortunately fails

175
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,030
Wait, what?

176
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,830
Come on, you gotta do a better job pulling it.

177
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,000
Come on, you gotta do a better job pulling it.

178
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,430
Can we, one more time...

179
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,730
Hey.

180
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,570
Huh?

181
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,540
One more time.

182
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,570
Let's try it one more time.

183
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,740
You know, he was drowning the whole time when we were setting up.

184
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,250
That's why...

185
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,250
He was drowning?

186
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,950
Let's go and tell them we want to try it again.

187
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,950
Yes.

188
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:18,800
The result wasn't so good, but if we can get that belt attached firmly to you,

189
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,660
Yes. Yes.

190
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,000
it should be able to make it to this side

191
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
It would've made it.

192
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
at a pretty good speed.

193
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,640
Yes.

194
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,670
600.

195
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,840
600?

196
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,840
What do you mean?

197
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,010
The amount of water I swallowed.

198
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,140
*Note: Matsumoto means in milliliters.

199
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,140
It seems I straight up swallowed 600 water.*

200
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,580
Yeah.

201
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,650
What's that?

202
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,790
Tajima?

203
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,190
The thing is,

204
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,460
Assistant

205
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,460
Tajima Yuichi

206
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,860
to be honest, um

207
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,860
to be honest, um

208
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,630
the velcro

209
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,630
really hurts.

210
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,070
But if only that would stay firm, then

211
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,340
Huh?

212
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,540
That sort of, oh

213
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,110
That sort of, oh

214
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,610
Tajima, this piece is done cooking.

215
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,310
Tajima, this piece is done cooking.

216
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,310
Yes. Thank you.

217
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,550
That sort of consideration from you is completely lacking.

218
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,550
That sort of consideration from you is completely lacking.

219
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,520
The male side of the velcro is right on my skin,

220
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,720
The male side of the velcro is right on my skin,

221
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,320
not the smooth side, the really jagged side,

222
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,360
is completely locked on to me.

223
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,560
is completely locked on to me.

224
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,070
Matsumoto's 3rd Attempt!!

225
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,300
Building on top of the past failed result, the third attempt.

226
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,070
Building on top of the past failed result, the third attempt.

227
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,800
Thank you.

228
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,770
Thank you.

229
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
Got it, thank you.

230
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,880
Use the power of radio-controlled boats to swim

231
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,710
Ok.

232
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,670
Let's go.

233
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,280
Ready, go!

234
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,780
Ready, go!

235
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,140
Let's go!

236
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,780
Ok, thank you.

237
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,420
Put him on top.

238
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,280
Put him on.

239
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,750
Ok.

240
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,220
Ready, and

241
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,220
Ready, and

242
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,620
Steady. Ok.

243
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,520
Steady. Ok.

244
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,060
There.

245
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,260
Ok.  The other way.

246
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,390
Argh!

247
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,590
What the hell are you doing?

248
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,390
It's supposed to be the other way.

249
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,390
Oh, just do it from that side.

250
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,360
Let's go.

251
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,560
Ok.

252
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,860
Ok.

253
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,900
Wait, stop, stop.

254
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,470
Good.

255
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,370
Whoa.

256
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,470
Ok, still ok.

257
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,500
Pull Tanaka, just pull more.

258
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,700
Ok.

259
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,640
He's fallling, he's falling.

260
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,010
What the hell.

261
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,280
Here.

262
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,880
There you go.

263
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Ok.

264
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,980
Ok.

265
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,000
We got it.

266
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,200
We got it.

267
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,080
The other way?

268
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,120
The other way.

269
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,720
This is for the feet.

270
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,720
Ok.

271
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,720
All right.

272
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,660
Make this straight.

273
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,390
Go there.

274
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,390
Yes.

275
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,390
All right!

276
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,760
Go!

277
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Go!

278
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,600
All right!

279
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,370
Yes, go!

280
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,530
Go!

281
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,400
Yes, go!

282
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,400
Yes, go, go!

283
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
It's going.

284
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,470
It's going, it's going.

285
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,280
It's going, it's going!

286
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,410
It's going!

287
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,250
Keep it up!

288
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:57,260
Fast forwarding

289
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,590
Almost there!

290
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,460
A little more.

291
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,090
Hey, almost there, almost there.

292
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:03,860
Hey, almost there, almost there.

293
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,960
Hey, almost there, almost there.

294
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,500
Go. Go. Go.

295
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:06,970
Go. Go. Go.

296
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:07,970
Go. Go. Go.

297
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,500
Goal!

298
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,770
Goal

299
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,340
He's probably full with emotion.

300
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,840
Yeah, you're right.

301
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,840
Yes.

302
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,840
We're good.

303
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,980
He's coming now.

304
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,450
Watch out for the boats.

305
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,450
Make way.

306
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,160
How many minutes was that?

307
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,960
Someone smacked my inner thigh.

308
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,700
Someone smacked my inner thigh.

309
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,070
Someone smacked my inner thigh.

310
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,070
Someone did that, right? Who was that?

311
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,100
It was you?

312
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,370
You smacked my inner thigh, didn't you?

313
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:48,940
That kind of stuff really hurts.

314
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,940
That kind of stuff really hurts.

315
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,110
Sorry.

316
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,920
Saying things like "This guy,"

317
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,920
"Do it right, dumbass."

318
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,390
No more verbal abuse at me.

319
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,430
Matsumoto's 4th Attempt!!

320
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,460
They pull themselves together for the fourth attempt.

321
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,430
They pull themselves together for the fourth attempt.

322
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,160
Let's make this one work.

323
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,160
Let's make it work.

324
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Please!

325
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,300
Please!

326
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Please!

327
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,250
Use the power of wrestlers to swim

328
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,250
Shall we?

329
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,550
Ready...

330
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,020
Here we go.

331
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,320
Here we go!

332
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,320
Ok, go!

333
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,890
Swim fast!

334
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,790
Here we go!

335
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,190
It's fast! It's fast!

336
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,190
It's fast!

337
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,790
Here we go!

338
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,960
Whoa!

339
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,060
Let's go!

340
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,060
Let's go now!

341
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,060
Keep it up!

342
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,740
It's good!

343
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Go!

344
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,800
Good, good!

345
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,810
Keep it up!

346
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,140
Let's go!

347
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,440
It's fast!

348
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,110
Keep going!

349
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,950
You can do it!

350
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,290
Keep it up!

351
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,660
Keep it up!

352
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,690
Keep it up!

353
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,690
You can do it.

354
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,230
That was close.

355
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,230
That took a lot of time.

356
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Right.

357
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,840
Wasn't this faster?

358
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Would it have been better if we had more people?

359
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,310
That might be right.

360
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,310
Should we go see him?

361
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,370
Yes.

362
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,210
Yes. Yes.

363
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,040
Let's go, again.

364
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,040
Yes. Yes.

365
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,780
The group go to Matsumoto's dressing room to apologize

366
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,580
Excuse us.

367
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,080
Excuse us.

368
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,580
Excuse us.

369
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,380
*Note: A reference to the manga and anime Dokonjo Gaeru.

370
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,890
You probably get it

371
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,030
without me having to say anything.

372
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,130
Well, uh,

373
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,930
in the one before the previous one, talking about the velcro, I mentioned it right?

374
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,930
That I can't stand that jagged sensation.

375
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Oh, yes.

376
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,700
Right?

377
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,340
There was a guy in there who had a stubble

378
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,880
There was a guy in there who had a stubble

379
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,880
that was crazy.

380
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,740
At first I thought someone was wearing a fake beard.

381
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,280
Those jagged sharp edges.

382
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,680
It's tedious just having to mention this.

383
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,620
So, what I'm saying, you see,

384
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,890
So, what I'm saying, you see,

385
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,390
is that none of you think about those sort of things for me,

386
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,090
*Note: A reference to the manga and anime Dokonjo Gaeru.

387
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,090
so I'm scared as hell when I'm going through it.

388
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,730
Yes.

389
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,730
All right?

390
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,940
It's ridiculous.

391
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Hello.

392
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,770
Sorry, Hiroshi is giving a scolding right now.*

393
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,110
Sorry, Hiroshi is giving a scolding right now.*

394
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:41,310
*Note: A reference to the manga and anime Dokonjo Gaeru.  Hiroshi is the character in the manga that Matsumoto dressed as.

395
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,280
Yes, Hiroshi is.

396
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,150
He's attempting to achieve a new record.

397
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,190
He's attempting to achieve a new record.

398
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,650
But Hamada's directing is awful.

399
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,990
But Hamada's directing is awful.

400
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,030
Will you give us another chance?

401
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,790
Let's finish this on a strong note.

402
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
Yes, let's do that.

403
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,100
Let's go.

404
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,100
Let's go.

405
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Matsumoto's 5th Attempt!!

406
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,930
Will they finally succeed? The fifth attempt!

407
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,600
Will they finally succeed? The fifth attempt!

408
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,140
If this here works out, it'll be really fast.

409
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,300
If this here works out, it'll be really fast.

410
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,010
Yes, that's right.

411
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,840
Yeah.

412
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,970
It might go under 10 seconds.

413
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,910
Yes, it should.

414
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,610
I think this will.

415
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,910
It'd be really nice if it did go under 10 seconds, after how far we've come.

416
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,610
Let's do this.

417
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,710
He's really making sure not to slip.

418
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,310
Walking very cautiously

419
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,910
Walking very firmly.

420
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,150
Yeah, he's walking very firmly.

421
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,650
Won't his eyes hurt?

422
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,060
I really want to make this the last one.

423
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,090
Yes.

424
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,060
I really want to make this the last one.

425
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,100
Yes. Apologies for that.

426
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,900
Of course.

427
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,030
I'm counting on you.

428
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,030
Yes.

429
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,630
Ok, get it ready.

430
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,840
Please, thank you.

431
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,670
All right.

432
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
All right.

433
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,170
All right, let's bring it out.

434
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,170
Let's seriously make it with this one.

435
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,510
Thank you.

436
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,780
Thank you.

437
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,320
This equipment is called a "Zorb"

438
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Ok, it's good.

439
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,420
Please, thank you.

440
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,850
Here we go.

441
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,890
All right.

442
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,130
Use the Zorb and the power of the wrestlers to swim

443
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,360
This will go fast.

444
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Yeah, this will.

445
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,430
Ok.

446
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,500
Let's go all out on this on.

447
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,270
Ok, let's do it.

448
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,270
Ok, let's do it.

449
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,670
Let's go!

450
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,570
Ready...

451
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,180
Good, good.

452
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,980
All right.

453
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,780
All right.

454
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,480
Yeah!

455
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,150
Go!

456
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,750
Yeah!

457
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,190
Go!

458
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Go!

459
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,430
Turn it, turn it!

460
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,970
We ran out of time

461
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,140
Ah yes, we did

462
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,640
It was turning really fast.

463
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,910
Yes, it really was.

464
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,180
Matsumoto?

465
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,610
Matsumoto!

466
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,180
Matsumoto.

467
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,990
He left again.

468
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,990
Yes, he did.

469
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,290
That's all we can prepare, though.

470
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:08,160
The group go to Matsumoto's dressing room to apologize, again

471
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,490
It can't be helped. Well, we did what we could.

472
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
*Note: "ZEEBRA - Big Big Money ft. Hiro" is the original hip hop track.

473
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:43,090
My name is Tajima Yuichi,

474
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:43,090
*Note: Yoshimoto is the talent agency that represents Downtown.

475
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:43,090
number one bad boy of Yoshimoto.*

476
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:43,090
Gonna make you hear

477
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,260
my awesome rap, listen.

478
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,090
my awesome rap, listen.

479
00:14:50,900 --> 00:15:02,650
Matsumoto is pretty furious.

480
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:02,650
Your (mumbled) is being considered thus.

481
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:02,650
You 4 as entertainers are worthless.

482
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,650
Hamada's lips: hilarious.

483
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:26,800
Matsumoto is amazing with his kindness.

484
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:26,800
The last chance he's giving you is this.

485
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:26,800
You 4 as entertainers are B-list.

486
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,600
Besides that, Hamada's lips: hilarious.

487
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,800
Besides that, Hamada's lips: hilarious.

488
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,110
This is the last one, so

489
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,840
Yes.

490
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,010
All right?

491
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,010
Yes.

492
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,350
I'm really counting on you for this last one.

493
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:34,710
Yes. That's totally... right?

494
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,550
Yes. That's totally... right?

495
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,550
Yes.

496
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,580
This is the last one, all right?

497
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,980
Yes.

498
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,030
Why the hell are my lips hilarious?

499
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,030
I have no idea.

500
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,530
Matsumoto's 6th Attempt!!

501
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,630
This is the last chance. The sixth attempt!

502
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,530
This is the last chance. The sixth attempt!

503
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,070
He really is making sure not to slip.

504
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,540
We've overcome some issues we had,

505
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,940
and the program is getting near to the end.

506
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,640
and the program is getting near to the end.

507
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,240
Yes.

508
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,380
If we don't make it work here

509
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,410
We understand.  We do understand that.

510
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,510
people will think we're idiots.

511
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,510
Yes.

512
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,510
Let's go! All right!

513
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,150
All right!

514
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
Let's go!

515
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,920
All right!

516
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,090
Let's go!

517
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,090
All right!

518
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,090
Ok.

519
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Ok.

520
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,930
Ok.

521
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,530
Velcro

522
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,030
This will definitely hurt. This will definitely hurt.

523
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,900
This will definitely hurt. This will definitely hurt.

524
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,300
This will definitely hurt.

525
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,010
The rope already has a dangerous color.

526
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,010
The rope already has a dangerous color.

527
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,450
Is everything good?

528
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,890
Make him swim by pulling on a rope from the goal area

529
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
We're good.

530
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
We're good.

531
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,890
We're counting on you.

532
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,620
All right.

533
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,620
All right.

534
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,560
Ok. Ready...

535
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,060
Ok. Ready...

536
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,430
Here we go.

537
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,060
It's fast! This is good.

538
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,060
It's fast! This is good.

539
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,200
We can make it!

540
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,400
We can make it!

541
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,970
We can make it!

542
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,240
Goal

543
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,640
There it is!

544
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,010
There it is!

545
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,280
9.80.

546
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,120
A Great Success!?

547
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,120
Swim 25 Meters in 10 Seconds!!

548
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,650
After overcoming many trials and tribulations,

549
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,150
finally, success

550
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,290
in swimming 25 meters in an amazing record of 9.80 seconds.

551
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,690
A new legend was born today in the world of swimming.

552
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,530
Matsumoto Hitoshi,

553
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,660
you are a true gold medalist.

554
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,660
you are a true gold medalist.
