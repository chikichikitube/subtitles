00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,650
You know...I'm actually
pretty good at this.

3
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,530
Isn't it hot?!

4
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,450
I never thought Nana-chan
would give me a run for my money.

5
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,130
She's ruthless.

6
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,440
She gets to me every time.

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,070
I was thinking, this
show is truly terrifying.

8
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,130
I don't want to come on this show anymore.

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,120
It's so scary!

10
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,770
The first one out is...

11
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,900
Shizu-chan!

12
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,180
Was I moving?

13
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,080
And the other person...

14
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,070
Iwao!

15
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,830
It wasn't just hot. That
hand pushed me to the side!

16
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,190
Let's go in.

17
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,460
Let's do it.

18
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,580
Oh dear, oh dear.

19
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,310
What?!

20
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,130
- What's this?
- It's already soaked.

21
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,030
- You've gotta be kidding.
- It's full of water.

22
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,410
What about our shoes? Do we take them off?

23
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,900
Can we take them off?

24
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,800
These shoes are
actually kind of expensive.

25
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,940
It's full of water!

26
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,820
What should we do about the shoes?

27
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,790
That startled me!

28
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,800
Why are you scaring us?

29
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,290
Alright everyone, welcome!

30
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,490
Thank you!

31
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,320
It's already full of water.

32
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,170
That's right, you'll have to
take off your shoes in this room.

33
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,460
Please sit down with your bare feet.

34
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,420
You can leave your shoes at the back.

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,140
Where should we sit?

36
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,420
You can choose for yourselves.

37
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,180
Where should I? Maybe there.

38
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,780
It doesn't matter. You won't have
any advantages or disadvantages.

39
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,620
- I'll sit here then.
- I'm all fired up today.

40
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,620
- By the way, how is my pulse doing?
- So cold!

41
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,750
Morohoshi-kun, your heartbeat...

42
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,890
- It's been beating fast all along.
- Fast?

43
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,590
Really?

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,820
It's super fast.

45
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,580
I feel like I've been running a marathon.

46
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,680
I wonder why it's so fast.

47
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,680
It's so cold!

48
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:21,400
- What's gonna happen?
- Please plant your feet firmly
on the ground when you freeze.

49
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,620
And Suzuki-san, you changed
your clothes, didn't you?

50
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,900
Yes, my previous outfit got dirty.

51
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,690
So I changed.

52
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,690
That's such a normal answer...

53
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,280
I also fixed my makeup.

54
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,220
Alright, let's start the 3rd stage!

55
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,780
- What?
- It's starting already?

56
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,090
No! What's gonna happen?!

57
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,280
So suspicious.

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,160
No, no, no. Hold on. I'm so scared.

59
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,070
Right...

60
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,770
Isn't it so hard?

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,160
You don't know where
to focus your attention.

62
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,020
Right, let's get started.

63
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,870
I'm sorry!

64
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,060
I'm sorry!

65
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,540
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared.

66
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,220
This is really scary!

67
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,120
The snakes are slithering around.

68
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,880
Is it really that scary?

69
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,920
I thought they'd be fine with this.

70
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,700
So scary...

71
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,300
No, it's too scary!

72
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,040
This guy's just looking straight ahead.

73
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,230
Oh no!

74
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,980
I'm sorry, I'm so scared.

75
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,800
These two are amazing.

76
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,560
Yukai is awesome.

77
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,240
Release!

78
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,150
- What the heck?!
- What are they?!

79
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,080
- Aren't there too many?
- They're not eels.

80
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,510
It's not eels.

81
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,620
It's snakes.

82
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,810
Look at their faces. They're snakes!

83
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,810
I can't!

84
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,070
My shoes! My shoes!

85
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,420
I can't stand up!

86
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,140
- I can't stand, I'm too scared!
- They're all over the place!

87
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,450
They'll come to you if
you keep making noise.

88
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,240
I can't, I can't.

89
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,750
Look, they're all up in those shoes!

90
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,350
Matsumoto-san, what about our shoes?

91
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,670
I can't deal with this.

92
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,620
That stage was so dangerous.

93
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,070
The snakes came out of nowhere.

94
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,300
It was like being in a nightmare.

95
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,320
I was pretty scared.

96
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,840
To tell you the truth...

97
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,090
I was pretty scared.

98
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,320
Yeah.

99
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,210
That was unbelievable! So crazy!

100
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,850
I don't even want to remember it.

101
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,470
Since the floor was full of water,

102
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,620
the snakes kept moving
and swimming around!

103
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:58,740
A ton of them started
trying to cling to our feet!

104
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,820
That was so unpleasant.
I couldn't handle it.

105
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,640
I'm getting a panic attack
just thinking about it.

106
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,030
I just wanted to get out of that room.

107
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,270
Here we go.

108
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,960
The temperature's rising.

109
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,200
Bobby's already out.

110
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,630
Suzuki's doing great this time.

111
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,250
Oh no, it's starting to fog up!

112
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,600
So steamy...

113
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,030
Whoa, Morohoshi is amazing.

114
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,920
It's about 50°C (122°F) now.

115
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,840
We can barely see.

116
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,690
We can barely see them.

117
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,750
What was that?

118
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,020
So hot!

119
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,270
- Crazy!
- We got soaked.

120
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,320
Soaked!

121
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,860
What was that?

122
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,440
- It was cold water at first, wasn't it?
- Yes.

123
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,230
Why did it turn hot?

124
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,710
It was pretty hot.

125
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,880
Hot water didn't come out last time.

126
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,640
You look like Roppo-san!

127
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:09,640
(Translator note: I have no idea who he's referencing.)

128
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,860
- Who is that?
- You look like him!

129
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,040
- You look like Roppo-san!
- I'm Yukai.

130
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,630
He's changed!

131
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,910
Give me a break!

132
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,900
It was pretty hot.

133
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,980
I didn't think they would go this far.

134
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,360
What was the deal with the sprinklers?

135
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,720
Cold water was coming out,
then suddenly it got super hot.

136
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,490
What was the purpose of that?

137
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,400
To clean us?

138
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,520
I wanna get out of this room.

139
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,610
Here we go.

140
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,070
Diamond Yukai is so funny.

141
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,680
Shall we continue?

142
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,710
I can't see Yukai-san anymore.

143
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,690
This is nice.

144
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,520
Let's throw in the yellowtail.

145
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,470
- What was that?
- What was that?

146
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,000
That's so funny!

147
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,300
It's gone to the side.

148
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,120
I look like a poodle.

149
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:08,840
WHO MADE IT TO THE FINAL ROUND?

150
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,240
Where should we sit?

151
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,330
Wherever is fine.

152
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,170
- Someone else is coming.
- What?

153
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,930
- Someone else is coming.
- Someone else?

154
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,790
- Then, should we sit on the sides?
- Sandwich them?

155
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,120
But then you'll be in front of me.

156
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,640
- I'll laugh if I sit in front of you.
- Why?

157
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,280
- Why?
- I'll sit here.

158
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,480
I was too scared, so I
gave up at that stage.

159
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,110
I was so tired from the 3rd stage.

160
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,360
I mean, normally I'm
not such a scaredy cat.

161
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,200
Alright, the losers are back!

162
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,370
- What?
- Excuse me.

163
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,460
It's been a while.

164
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,200
We're finally back here.

165
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,520
Where should I sit?

166
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,930
Here?

167
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,120
Alright.

168
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,780
We have a great mix of
celebrities and variety show guests.

169
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,350
We made it.

170
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,870
- Who will win?
- I wonder if the artists are better at this.

171
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,660
The artists are strong.

172
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,580
Have they always been good?

173
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,340
They're so amazing.

174
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,890
They're not normal.

175
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,810
Isn't it hot?!

176
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,870
The artists are so strong.

177
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,100
You guys changed.

178
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,130
You're right!

179
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,390
- Yes.
- This is her third outfit.

180
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,820
- What?
- I didn't have any changes left.

181
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,630
- No changes left?
- Yes, no clothes left.

182
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,280
- I see, did you have to...
- He's here, he's here.

183
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:24,470
Alright everyone, sorry for making, um...
Here's what you've been waiting for.

184
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:31,920
A lot has happened, but the winner
of this stage will advance to the finals.

185
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,080
Alright.

186
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,710
One person here still has a
chance at the 1 million yen prize.

187
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,850
Please give it your best shot.

188
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,960
I'm definitely going to win.

189
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,540
But you guys are
already used to this, right?

190
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,770
I don't think you'll be
surprised by what's next.

191
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,870
Kuro-chan and I lost
on the first stage, so...

192
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,700
- We were clueless.
- We were so scared in the
waiting room.

193
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,690
I see.

194
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:04,370
And you already know
the finalists are strong.

195
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,190
They're too strong.

196
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,830
Those two are not normal.

197
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,010
- But we still want to win.
- Give it your best shot.

198
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,040
We'll try our best!

199
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,270
I'm so scared! I'm so scared!

200
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,880
It's kinda cramped in here.

201
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:30,770
Cramped?

202
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:35,370
- For the number of people.
- It was way more cramped last time.

203
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,500
What's gonna happen?!

204
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,410
- But you guys seem pretty used to it now.
- No way, I'm so scared.

205
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,420
- I don't want to get used to it.
- I can't get used to it.

206
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,510
Right, you can't.

207
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,010
I can't, I can't, I'm so scared.

208
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,170
This is nice. It's been a
while since we've been here.

209
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,250
It feels like a long time.

210
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,060
But you could say everyone's
been "sharpening up".

211
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,400
They've honed their
skills, and even their poses.

212
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,020
This is good.

213
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,900
Let's go.

214
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,300
He's so interested in Shizu-chan.

215
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,200
She's in trouble.

216
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,210
Someone's gonna end up laughing.

217
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,100
Shizu-chan was so close.

218
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,700
Shizu-chan and Non-chan too.

219
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,780
Shizu-chan and Non-chan.

220
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,810
They might be in trouble.

221
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,620
Now he's approaching Kuro-chan.

222
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,170
He's smelling them one by one.

223
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,260
Such a good boy.

224
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,540
You know, this is more
of a laughing test...

225
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:17,000
Compared to the usual jump scare test.

226
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,840
He really is going one by one. So smart.

227
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,530
This one might be a
bit of a drawn-out battle.

228
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,380
I wouldn't want this.

229
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,300
Hold on, this isn't that kind of show.

230
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,190
But in the end, he
didn't look at Non-chan.

231
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,940
Huh? He's back to Shizu-chan?

232
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,960
What's going on?

233
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,490
It's over.

234
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,530
They're already laughing.

235
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,550
- He peed! He peed!
- Don't laugh!

236
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,150
Of course I'd laugh!

237
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,420
I couldn't keep a straight face!

238
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,690
- He peed!
- A little bit.

239
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,380
Did he?

240
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,150
- He chose that spot.
- Why there?

241
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,760
What was he looking for?

242
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,280
He was marking his territory!

243
00:20:44,300 --> 00:21:09,550
