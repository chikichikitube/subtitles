1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,640
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,660
Comedy Guidelines Decision Meeting!

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,840
Good evening

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,690
Downtown

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,690
Hamada Masatoshi

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,690
Matsumoto Hitoshi

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,340
See, lately when it comes to variety shows

8
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,650
Tanaka Naoki

9
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,770
Cocorico

10
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,770
There are lots of batsu games and such like always

11
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,770
Endo Shozo

12
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,610
But in a way

13
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,210
Saying "this is comedy" or "this isn't comedy"

14
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,210
is becoming difficult

15
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,210
I see

16
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,010
I mean, sometimes they do more than they should

17
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,010
Yeah, like injuries

18
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,810
Yes, those too

19
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,920
That's why we in Gaki

20
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:37,250
Comedy Guidelines Decision Meeting~!!

21
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:37,250
Today we'll decide the correct comedy guidelines

22
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:37,250
of various "comedy" which could appear on Gaki no Tsukai!

23
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,800
Decided to make some guidelines about what's comedy

24
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,040
We'll decide em?

25
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,280
That's the plan     - I see

26
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,170
So, we'll have our guinea-pig-comedian...

27
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,400
Guinea pig?

28
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,100
That's him

29
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,800
You shouldn't call him like that, come on

30
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,570
You'll make him sad

31
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,920
Anyway, please come here!

32
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,920
Thank you!

33
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,210
Comedy Guidelines Judge

34
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,210
Yamazaki Housei

35
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,800
Lookin' young

36
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,210
It's a pleasure

37
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,240
It's a pleasure

38
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,210
Good evening

39
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,700
So if you judge something as "non-comedy", we'll never do it on Gaki

40
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,370
If Yamazaki decided that something "is not comedy"

41
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,370
Rules

42
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,370
That will be banned forever from Gaki no Tsukai

43
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,270
I see

44
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,370
Not anymore

45
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,610
What kind of comedian are you?

46
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,930
I'm a guinea-pig-comedian

47
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,850
He willingly accepted it

48
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,360
That's why I'm all white

49
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,650
He recognized it

50
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,050
More like a lab rat

51
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,520
Yeah, a rat

52
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,570
I don't need colors

53
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:23,810

56
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,810
Is this comedy ?! Or is it  not comedy ?!

57
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,810
Yamazaki will decide the correct comedy guidelines!

58
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,320
First off we have:

59
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,680
"Where's my mouth?"

60
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:32,450
Where is my mouth!?

61
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,600
"Helping Hands Wasabi Sushi"!

62
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,450
Helping Hands Wasabi Sushi~!

63
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,680
So, Matsumoto-san

64
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,640
This is an easy one

65
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,700
Well, this one

66
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,700
I think everyone knows it

67
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:44,090
Eat wasabi sushi aided by helping hands

68
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:44,090
Helping Hands Wasabi Sushi

69
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:44,090
Let's see if it will be judged as "comedy" or "not comedy"  !

70
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,700
But we haven't thought about it seriously

71
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,650
I see

72
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,890
So, Yamazaki will be in front

73
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,090
Yes

74
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,730
And then we'll have our "foremost satisfaction of comedy" behind

75
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,650
So we'll have Hamada-san

76
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,930
Sitting behind him

77
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,520
Alright

78
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,330
Idiot    - They'll have wasabi sushi

79
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,880
So you're saying that it has to be Hamada after all, right?

80
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,240
Well, we're talking about guidelines, so

81
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,690
We want a full swing on it

82
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,030
It's easier that way

83
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,640
Right

84
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,250
Well

85
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,570
I'de be fine with Tanaka doing it though

86
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
I'm not the best at it

87
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,170
Do you want to do it with Tanaka?

88
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,170
Yeah, Tanaka's good

89
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,610
But our "satisfaction" is the best one there is

90
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,610
What the hell is this "satisfaction" crap?

91
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,600
We've been told before that's dangerous

92
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,210
To mix Hamada and wasabi together

93
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,840
And so

94
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
Will "Helping Hands Wasabi Sushi"

95
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,730
Helping Hands Wasabi Sushi:

96
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,730
Will it be comedy !?  Or not comedy !?

97
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,360
Be labeled as comedy or not?

98
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,730
Be sure

99
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,610
To judge this only after the camera draws near you

100
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,610
After the camera comes?

101
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,800
How am I supposed to...?

102
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,200
We'll let you know, don't worry

103
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,770
Please do your best

104
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,670
Basically I'll eat sushi, right?

105
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,440
Yes

106
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,640
Hamada-san?
- That's it

107
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,320
With his hands

108
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,010
Shall we begin?

109
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,120
"Where's my mouth? Helping Hands Wasabi Sushi"

110
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,850
Start!

111
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,920
That's how it's done

112
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,720
That's fair enough

113
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,230
Makes me wanna eat sushi too

114
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,440
Oh, thank you

115
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,840
Looking good
- Looks delicious

116
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,240
His hands are dirty

117
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,280
Delicious
- Looks good

118
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,640
Thanks

119
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Good, good

120
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,480
Second one

121
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,800
That's too much

122
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,730
Hamada-san? Hey!

123
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,480
Good
- It's too much

124
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,360
Too much wasabi

125
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,080
But we have to test it, so it has to be like this

126
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,440
Oh, like that, nice

127
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,320
Come on, some more

128
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,720
Just like this, a bit more

129
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,720
Keep this pace

130
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,920
Like this, come on

131
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,880
Good, good

132
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,200
That's perfect

133
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,720
How about we go for the verdict?

134
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,720
So...

135
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,760
Your verdict?

136
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,440
How do you judge it?

137
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,800
What happened?

138
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,120
What's wrong?

139
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:54,050
please do not attempt to imitate him

140
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:54,050
this is a performance Yamazaki is doing as a professional comedian

141
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,200
Was it that bad?

142
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,000
What's wrong?

143
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,120
He pushed

144
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,250
his finger way too inside

145
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,520
He pushed it too much?

146
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,170
That... sounds terrible

147
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,010
We could never do something like that

148
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,010
That's unthinkable for us

149
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,690
Just say it
- His finger?

150
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,410
It went through my esophagus

151
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,410
That's impossible

152
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,410
You were just eating sushi

153
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,760
I think I got injured

154
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,360
You injured your esophagus?

155
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
For real

156
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,330
I got injured for real

157
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,560
So it's no good?

158
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,730
It's not comedy?

159
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,850
It's messed up

160
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,350
How far did you insert it?

161
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,850
My voice isn't coming out anymore

162
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,570
You voice hasn't changed, it's your vocal cords

163
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,890
He fiddled with em

164
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,130
Was that the quantity of wasabi?

165
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,170
I don't know anything about wasabi

166
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,130
The problem was his finger...

167
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,930
What's up with that voice?

168
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,680
My vocal cords...

169
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,000
Something's definitely off
- It is

170
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,370
Maybe

171
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,170
Maybe he changed channel inside you

172
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,850
Try to shout

173
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,610
He tampered with em

174
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,250
He sounds like a trumpet shell

175
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,450
Are you really ok?

176
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:05,410
IS NOT COMEDY !!

177
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:05,410
VERDICT: HELPING HANDS WASABI SUSHI

178
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,200
"Put em on, take em off! Face panty hose"!!

179
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,330
Put em on, take em off!

180
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,330
Face panty hose~!!

181
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,090
Well...

182
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,010
Are you ok Yamazaki-san?

183
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,120
What's wrong?

184
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,010
Are you ok?

185
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,080
Well it's that

186
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,410
I have to stretch this part

187
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,690
'Cause you've been injured already, right?

188
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,690
That's right

189
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,160
So, about this

190
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,100
We've seen lots of panty-hose on faces before

191
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,200
You did it before too, right?
- I did

192
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,210
But right now we'd like to do something different, together

193
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,250
So we'll make you wear one and take it off and so on

194
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:44,330
Let's see if it will be judged as "comedy" or "not comedy"  !

195
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:44,330
Put em on, take em off! Face panty hose!

196
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:44,330
Wear panty hose and have them get off in succession

197
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,250
Oh, I see

198
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,000
I'll have you help me

199
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,960
So we'll make it in succession

200
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,330
I think it'll be hilarious

201
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,050
You mean his face?
- Yeah, even his face

202
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,130
It does sound like something good for reactions

203
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,210
I think that

204
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,610
It'll be a complete success

205
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,920
You'll get plenty of comedy medals for this

206
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,770
"Comedy medals"?

207
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,410
I want those!

208
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,730
That's your chance for redemption
- I have to take them

209
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,930
I really want them

210
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,360
So, we'll

211
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,060
Go in order, like

212
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,880
First Endo, then me, and so on

213
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,650
Alright

214
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,640
Let's at least aim for 10 of them, or even 100

215
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,050
That hurts

216
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,930
Alright, let's begin

217
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,760
"Put em on, take em off! Face panty hose": start!!

218
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,860
Lookin' good

219
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,460
Just like this

220
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,600
That's it, good

221
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,880
Let's do it in succession

222
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Nice
- Let's go, let's go

223
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,540
That's enough

224
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,540
Nice, nice

225
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,490
Come on come on

226
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,560
It hurts---

227
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,540
Let's keep this up

228
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,760
Let's go let's go let's go

229
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,600
We can do this

230
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,240
Go go go

231
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,120
Lookin' good

232
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,360
Let's go, let's go

233
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:19,000
["let's do this" "good" and "come on" all over]

234
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,960
M--- my eyes! You got my eyes!

235
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,260
Ouch

236
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,520
Here comes

237
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,130
Your verdict?

238
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,970
THE HELL ARE YA DOIN' ?!

239
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,970
THE HELL ARE YA DOIN' ?!

240
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,930
Could it be not comedy...?

241
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,090
Which is it? Is it comedy or not?

242
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,690
HOW CAN THIS BE COMEDY ?!

243
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,690
HOW CAN THIS BE COMEDY ?!

244
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,840
"No way", he said
- For real?

245
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,640
It was not...

246
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,690
What have you done?

247
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,850
The atmosphere felt good
- It did

248
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,150
Midway

249
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,370
In the middle of it

250
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,810
I started feeling intense pain here

251
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,050
It's not strange, it's all about this

252
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,730
You hit me to the utmost, right?

253
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,090
No way we could do it
- No way

254
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,490
Some of you did punch me with all his strength, I'm sure of it

255
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,310
But this is "face panty hose"...

256
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,560
They're your juniors

257
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,760
No way we'd do that
- We wouldn't dare

258
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,440
As for myself

259
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,010
I'd never hurt my beloved junior

260
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,410
Who was it?

261
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,560
What do you mean?

262
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,930
Who did punch me like that?

263
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,210
I did like anyone else, just normally

264
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,010
Yeah but while doing it, you kicked me, right?

265
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,210
Was it you?

266
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,250
No way I would do that to my senior

267
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,840
Why treating me like that?

268
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,890
I think if we pull this a bit more, he'll make a funnier face

269
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,840
This is hilarious!
- Isn't this comedy?

270
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,120
What do you think?

271
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,880
This is good, it's hilarious!

272
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,370
It went "bam!" as it came off

273
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:44,370
IS NOT COMEDY !!

274
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:44,370
VERDICT: PUT EM ON TAKE EM OF - FACE PANTY HOSE

275
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:49,200
"Middle-aged men sneezes on face: 10 hits"!!

276
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:50,730
Middle-aged men sneezes

277
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,730
10 hits on face~!!

278
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,640
So, what's this about, Matsumoto?

279
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,680
We can say this is something

280
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,160
New to this industry

281
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,160
We'll have some middle aged men

282
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:07,490
Have some old dudes sneeze on your face in succession

283
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:07,490
Let's see if it will be judged as "comedy" or "not comedy"  !

284
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:07,490
Middle-aged men sneezes on face: 10 hits~!!

285
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,360
Sneeze on his face for 10 consecutive times

286
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,810
This is...

287
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,770
I think this will make you earn several comedy medals

288
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,920
Isn't it good?       - I see

289
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,840
What do you think about it, Yama-chan?

290
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,970
I think that if I'm

291
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,970
Getting sneezed at---

292
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,890
His voice is actually messed up

293
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,890
That's true

294
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,500
That's from before

295
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,280
When will it come back?

296
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,530
I'm starting to worry

297
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,530
It won't

298
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:27,250
If they're gonna do it, they have to jump at me properly

299
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,650
Let's call our guests, please come in!

300
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,240
There's plenty of them

301
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,840
I see

302
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,880
Alright, Yamazaki-san

303
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,760
"Middle-aged men sneezes on face: 10 hits":

304
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,690
Start!!

305
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,560
At this point he's ready for everything

306
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,540
That's right

307
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,100
He just have to accept it

308
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,200
He can only take them

309
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,280
It's ten hits, you know

310
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,880
There are still 8 left

311
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,340
That was weak

312
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,280
They're different

313
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,400
Yeah, there's a lot

314
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,840
That too?

315
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,210
He drew back!

316
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,380
This dude...

317
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,970
I can feel malice in this guy

318
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,240
It's him again

319
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,770
This guy is evil!
- He's good

320
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,320
How about number 4?
- He went before

321
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,930
All this guy does is to draw back

322
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,050
Number 3 is hilarious

323
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,150
He's the main star

324
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,160
Here he comes

325
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,920
That was good, wasn't it?

326
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,320
Number 1 hasn't sneezed yet

327
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,320
They're having a blast

328
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Bring the camera

329
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,170
Bring it, yeah

330
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,440
Here he comes again!

331
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,450
How was it?

332
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,810
It stinks

333
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,890
Who cares about that!

334
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,370
We want your verdict

335
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,330
Is it comedy or not?

336
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,330
Tell us please

337
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,450
It stinks

338
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,490
It reeks

339
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,000
This is...

340
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,010
Ok but is it comedy or not?

341
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,490
IT WAS HUMILIATING !!

342
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,490
IT WAS HUMILIATING !!

343
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,490
In other words...?

344
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,370
THIS KIND OF SHIT IS NOT COMEDY !!

345
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,370
THIS KIND OF SHIT IS NOT COMEDY !!

346
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,280
You got through it though

347
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,010
My my my

348
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,370
It stinks...

349
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,560
That's cause Number 3 hit you lots of times

350
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,600
It reeks!
- He became a new character

351
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,970
We can't blame anyone for this
- Hey

352
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,490
Lend me something for wiping

353
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,120
I don't think there's anything like that
- Please

354
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,520
What the hell?

355
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,010
There's nothing
- So, it's not comedy?

356
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,720
Is it not?

357
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,330
We can't use it?

358
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,650
He said that for all of them

359
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,750
Yeah, and this one was fun

360
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,680
We could have used this gag!

361
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,850
Yes, it was hilarious

362
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,240
I can see that

363
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,530
It was fun, right?
- A lot

364
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,130
So fun
- Is it not good?

365
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,080
It's not good

366
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,090
No?
- No way

367
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,600
How does it feel like?

368
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,490
Uhm...
- I mean, getting sneezed at

369
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:16,890
Well,

370
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,410
It's humiliating

371
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,410
But we had them wait so much

372
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,210
Can't help it, I waited too, it's humiliating

373
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,960
Your voice is so raspy

374
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,370
I've never smelled something that bad

375
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,960
Woah, was it that bad?

376
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:38,570
IS NOT COMEDY !!

377
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:38,570
VERDICT: MIDDLE-AGED MEN SNEEZES ON FACE - 10 HITS

378
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:44,880
Down from the tower!

379
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,920
"Down from the tower! Small watermelon head-crack!"

380
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,880
Small watermelon head-crack~ !!

381
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,880
So, Matsumoto-san

382
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,610
What now?

383
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,490
We used small watermelons lots of times in Gaki

384
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,840
And I think we all agree it's funny to see
one of them smacked on someone's face

385
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,770
But what about having it fall on someone's head from 10 meters?

386
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:06,370
Break the small watermelon dropped from an height of 10 meters with your head

387
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:06,370
Let's see if it will be judged as "comedy" or "not comedy"  !

388
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:06,370
Small watermelon head-crack!!

389
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,340
I think we have to set some guidelines for it

390
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,370
This is pretty solid

391
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,320
It will be aimed at you

392
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,560
This weight...

393
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,560
Got it?

394
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,720
This will fall from 10 meters, so it will be a lot more

395
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,010
Its weight, yeah

396
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,490
I already think

397
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,850
This is not comedy

398
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,490
You can't say it yet
- Wait

399
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,690
Something you judge as "comedy" has yet to appear, geez

400
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,690
He's right, you said no to everything

401
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,610
Yeah but I mean, this is really...

402
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,090
It's gonna roll all the way and fall on your head

403
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,290
For this one

404
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,890
We'll have Tanaka-kun go up and do it

405
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,090
I think Hamada-san is better suited for this

406
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,570
It's not like it has anything to do with Hamada

407
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,770
And he's also not good with heights

408
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,770
That's true

409
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,170
I think it's about time we get a "it's comedy" from you

410
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,690
I agree, I really want this to work out

411
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,690
I want it too, really

412
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,690
Also, how many will hit you out of the total of 36?

413
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,530
You gotta be kidding me!

414
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,530
We don't know

415
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,770
We didn't ask how many there will be

416
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,810
You already broke my throat!

417
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,810
Well, at least

418
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,520
Let's see how the first one goes

419
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,880
And so,

420
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,800
Will "Small watermelon head-crack" be

421
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,090
Small Watermelon Head Crack:

422
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,090
Will it be comedy !?  Or not comedy !?

423
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,760
Labeled as comedy or not?

424
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,130
I've seen this on TV before
- Are you for real?!

425
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,370
This is...
- I'm here

426
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,200
Alright, everything's set

427
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,160
This is incredible

428
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,690
Wait a sec
- Ok

429
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,250
He'll just place the watermelon there
and it will roll down automatically

430
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:35,650
Is comedy supposed to be something this scary?

431
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,650
Well, it's all about

432
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:40,690
Having this tension turn into something to laugh about

433
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,690
This will be better than the previous ones

434
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,450
Comedy medals will pour down on you like hail

435
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,650
Are you ready!?

436
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,250
Are you for real?

437
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,610
Wait, for real?

438
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,160
That's all he's been sayin'

439
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,330
Can I toss it!?

440
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,290
Alright!

441
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,930
Come on, Tanaka is getting pissed

442
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,240
Ok, shall we begin?

443
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,340
W-wait

444
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,960
"Small watermelon...

445
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:02,960
Wait--

446
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,090
...head crack":

447
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,320
Start!!

448
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,320
Wait, wait!!

449
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,530
Here comes

450
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,090
Scary!
- Here it comes

451
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,480
That's so scary!

452
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,920
Wasn't that good?

453
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,120
How will he judge this?

454
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,720
Which is it?

455
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,320
Is it comedy or not?

456
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,890
It broke so good

457
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,850
This isn't comedy

458
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,550
But that is comedy

459
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,320
How can it not be?
- You sure?

460
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,480
It was so good
- It broke so nicely

461
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,530
He got sniped

462
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,880
We did it good

463
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,090
Right, Yama-chan?

464
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,440
It was good, right?

465
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:53,370
please do not attempt to imitate him

466
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:53,370
this is a performance Yamazaki is doing as a professional comedian

467
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,720
It didn't hurt, didn't it?

468
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,090
That was such a clean shot
- I know, right?

469
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,610
What's wrong?

470
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,730
You're not bleeding

471
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,440
It's not

472
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,290
Your acting really sucks

473
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,290
You're not bleeding

474
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,920
We all

475
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,880
Worked hard for this one, right?
- We did

476
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,330
But really...

477
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,730
I can assure no one was laughing that much

478
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,360
No way, no way, you're wrong

479
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,800
We all shouted "woah"!

480
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,240
We were surprised

481
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,090
In a way, on that moment we weren't laughing

482
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,810
And that's why it's not comedy

483
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,560
So what should we do? We don't really know either

484
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,050
I can see you're determined

485
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:31,450
But "effort" and "comedy" aren't the same thing

486
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,450
Ok, but...

487
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,410
When you think about it, it's funny
- Yes, if you re-think it

488
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,840
No good?
- No good

489
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,250
Also

490
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,490
Did the watermelon get inside my eyes?

491
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,890
It did not

492
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,480
I can feel it inside em

493
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,570
Like

494
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,490
In your eyebags?

495
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,490
Exactly

496
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,920
Are they full of watermelon juice?
- Yes

497
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,730
I can feel them pressing

498
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,830
Well, I can't deny they seem swollen

499
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,530
Right?

500
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,320
You sort of became Marlon Brando

501
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:03,050
Marlon Brando

502
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,120
That's true

503
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,320
How come?

504
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,050
It's cause it got inside
- It did, yeah

505
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,400
So it's not comedy?
- Seems like it

506
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,410
Even though it was so good
- Yeah...

507
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,920
Sorry, Tanaka

508
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,640
Was it no good?

509
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,650
Yeah, no good

510
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,250
Are you done? I mean, I have tons of watermelons here

511
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,490
Are you idiot? We're done!

512
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,920
He said you're idiot, Tanaka

513
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,080
It's not comedy

514
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,000
Got it

515
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:26,170
IS NOT COMEDY !!

516
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:26,170
VERDICT: SMALL WATERMELON HEAD CRACK

517
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:26,930
Drink up!

518
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,800
"Drink up! Megaphone water truck gulpin' drinking!"

519
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:35,090
Drink up!

520
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,090
Megaphone water truck gulpin' drinking !

521
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,080
So, what's this about?

522
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,980
We have a water truck prepared for this one, today

523
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:44,530
Drink up the large amount of water fired by the water truck:

524
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:44,530
Gulp it all down by catching it with the megaphone!

525
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:44,530
Megaphone water truck gulpin' drinking

526
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,720
And we also have this plastic megaphone, a large one

527
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,440
We'll have him hold it like this

528
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,010
Basically

529
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,250
It's a all-you-can-drink

530
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,320
You have to catch the water fired from the truck

531
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,890
With this and drink it

532
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,770
A water all-you-can-drink

533
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,130
I mean, don't you like drinking water?

534
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,330
You drink a lot of it!

535
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,210
I saw you drinking it lots of times

536
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,210
That's where I got the hint for this

537
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,090
One time we had dinner and I saw him drinking water

538
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,490
And there I got the hint for this

539
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,130
Of course you'd drink it

540
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,330
Yep

541
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,330
"Yep" my ass

542
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,640
This time

543
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
Will this megaphone drinking challenge

544
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,850
Megaphone water truck drinking:

545
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,850
Will it be comedy !?  Or not comedy !?

546
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,200
Be judged as comedy or not?

547
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,280
"Megaphone water truck gulpin' drinking": start!

548
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,440
Here goes!

549
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,320
Cold!!

550
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,120
It got in, Matsumoto!

551
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,680
We should aim higher

552
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,680
Is it getting in?

553
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,810
Matsumoto-san, how is it?

554
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,810
He should lower the megaphone a bit

555
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,080
Yamazaki, lower the megaphone!

556
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,680
Alright

557
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,250
WHAT THE HE !!

558
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,250
WHAT THE HE !!

559
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,850
"What the he"...?

560
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,120
That's what he said

561
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,600
"What the he"?
- We don't get it

562
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,080
What happened?

563
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:40,730
WHAT THE HE, THE HE, THE HEEE !!

564
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:40,730
WHAT THE HE, THE HE, THE HEEE !!

565
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,250
That's a combo

566
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:38,800
What's wrong?

567
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,730
How should we judge this?

568
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,830
I mean, is it comedy?

569
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,000
Matsumoto, do you think water got inside the megaphone?

570
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,810
I mean, Yamazaki's technique...

571
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,240
I can't deny he had one, but

572
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,530
He had to improve his posture
- He should have raised it more

573
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,250
After all I don't think he didn't make it

574
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,800
He's rising up

575
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,610
This is like "Goodbye Yamazaki"

576
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,640
I've seen this before

577
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,610
Stop this!

578
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:12,800
What are you doing?
- Why did he attack him?

579
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,000
Back up, Tanaka

580
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,640
I have no idea what just... is this comedy or not?

581
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,200
Which is it?
- Let's make that clear

582
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,480
Which one?
- Is it comedy?

583
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,240
Please tell us

584
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,840
Tell us if its comedy or not

585
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,760
Tell us please

586
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,120
Just tell us this
- We have to know

587
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,820
I wonder why he attacked Matsumoto

588
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,330
Why isn't he talking?
- Is it comedy?

589
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,050
THAT CAN'T BE COMEDY !!

590
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,050
THAT CAN'T BE COMEDY !!

591
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,050
So it's not comedy after all...

592
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,970
But we really want to find comedy...

593
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,810
If someone turns the tv on now

594
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,810
I bet they'll think this is Piccadilly-san

595
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,930
Piccadilly Umeda

596
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,880
No one could tell, he shouted just like him

597
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,930
Alright then

598
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,480
Our last one is

599
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,480
"Burdock strike match!"

600
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:58,730
Burdock strike match!

601
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:58,730
Burdock strike match!

602
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,800
Let go!
- Don't run!

603
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,280
Stop, Yamazaki!

604
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:18,240
This part is repeating, so here's a fun fact: Burdocks are very healthy - they can help preventing high blood pressure and blood vessel hardening; they also prevent high cholesterol and constipation, and they're good for hair health.

605
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,960
Go get him!

606
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,320
He's running
- Where is he--

607
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
How is this?

608
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,360
Bring the camera over there

609
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,760
Get here

610
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,560
How is it?
- Come on

611
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,650
THAT'S JUST A TREE BRANCH !

612
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,650
THAT'S JUST A TREE BRANCH !

613
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,950
A tree branch!

614
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,330
Say something!!

615
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,570
JUST SAY SOMETHING !

616
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,570
JUST SAY SOMETHING !

617
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,170
SAY SOMETHING!!

618
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,810
You weakling

619
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,810
He really hated this

620
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,250
To think we had Moriman to come all the way here!

621
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,360
Yeah, from Hokkaido...

622
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:17,490
Holstein Morio

623
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:17,490
Moriman

624
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:17,490
Tanuuma Man

625
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:17,490
They came from Hokkaido just for this episode

626
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,050
That's right

627
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,050
It's been a while since they came here

628
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,730
He got away really quickly

629
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,090
He really was fast

630
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:23,690
Alright

631
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,010
Cocorico, maybe you can go and bring him back here?

632
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,010
- Should we go look for him?

633
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,010
We'll try to catch him
- Yes

634
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,520
I mean seriously, that guy

635
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,160
Didn't say anything

636
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,610
And they both came from Hokkaido
- Yeah...

637
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,080
He ran away like crazy though...

638
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,730
He was so fast

639
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,010
Is he under a car!?

640
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,090
Under a car--?

641
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:45,890
A car--?

642
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,650
Is he a stray cat?!

643
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,080
We can't go further

644
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,960
No problem

645
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,480
He's frightened
- We'll take the digital

646
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,320
Here

647
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,640
He won't get out

648
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,000
We should just go home by now

649
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,880
Come here, come here

650
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,600
Come here
- It's fine

651
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,080
Don't be afraid
- This is too funny

652
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,370
Here kitty kitty!

653
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,970
Get out, we have canned tuna!

654
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,970
It's your favorite!

655
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,240
This is hilarious

656
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,920
Come on, we have tuna

657
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,850
Yama-chan...
- It's good tuna!

658
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,050
Don't be afraid!
- We have tuna!

659
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,610
Don't worry, they got home with AIR-DO

660
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,610
note: Hokkaido-based airplane company

661
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,640
Really, we don't have much time

662
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,080
They really took an AIR-DO

663
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,130
Yama-chan!

664
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,600
Do something, Tanaka

665
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,240
Zaki-san
- We have canned goods

666
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,880
It's ok
- Don't worry

667
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,920
He bit him!

668
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,170
Come on

669
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,770
I think he became a misanthropist

670
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,770
I think so too

671
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,720
'Cause he got bullied
- He holds a grudge

672
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,010
Against us humans
- Yama-chan...

673
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,170
Yama-chan, we'll make that Hiace (car) go boom

674
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,400
We'll turn this on

675
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,280
This...
- We're moving it

676
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,080
Maybe we should move it, yeah

677
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,640
Could it be...

678
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,320
...That he's pregnant?

679
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,840
Eh? For real?

680
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,090
