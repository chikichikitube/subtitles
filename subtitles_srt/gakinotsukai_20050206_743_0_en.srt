1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Once again, the 5 Members were told to dress smart.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,660
Downtown

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,660
Hitoshi Matsumoto

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,660
Masatoshi Hamada

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It is really okay to start like this?

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I don't know.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I just think we should have started in a better location...

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Anyway, today we're going to...

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
do part 2 of our farting series

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Bloody hell, again?

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Glad to be here, Sensei

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Nice to work with you. Please surprise us again..

13
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,430
Cocorico

14
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,430
Endo Shozo

15
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,430
Hosei Yamasaki

16
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,430
Naoki Tanaka

17
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We are just some no gooders...

18
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
He is our 'Last Hempera' ('He' is fart in Japanese.)

19
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,300
Yup, he sure is.

20
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,000
Last time at 'Hemachido Paris' (Translation: Waiting for fart in Paris)

21
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We saw a beautiful miracle.

22
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hamada farted multiple times in quick succession

23
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Showing his superior skills to the others,

24
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And got to eat a delcious French cuisine.

25
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He claimed the name of 'King of farting'

26
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And this time as well, a letter from Suga-chan (Producer)

27
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So cold!

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Ma-chan, Hama-chan, Endo, Tanaka and others

29
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I am sorry I couldn't come to the recordings

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I know it's a pathetic excuse for not coming but,

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
For all you guys who tried to hard for the New Year special

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I thought I would let you all let a bit out of a gas out and

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I have reserved a seat for you in a prestigious sushi restaurant

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But you can only have sushi if you fart,

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I have reserved the table for 2 hours.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So, please enjoy today

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,340
and let as much gas out as you can.

38
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,860
without the Gasu-man.

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,000
From Suga Kenji

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well of course.

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes, you can't blame him for acting like that

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So, where is this Sushi restaurant?

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,400
Apparently over there.

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,000
I see.

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This area is really expensive too

46
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,000
Man, it's so cold!

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Shall we go then?!

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,850

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Oi, it's here.

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sushi 'He'- (Literal: Sushi farts)

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't remember there being such a restaurant here...

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Sounds tasty.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Sounds a bit fishy..

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No one would come to a restaurant with this kind of name

56
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Man, the writing is even so neat.

57
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The restaurant today is 'Sushi He-'

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
First, if you want to fart, you raise your hand up

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you successfully fart, you get to order one type of Sushi.

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They have 2 hours.

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So, what will happen.

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Wow...

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hello.

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Wow, this looks really good.

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Welcome.

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Look at the size of the fishes!

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Wow wow wow...

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It looks so good.

69
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So we're doing it here today huh

70
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,260
Looks so good!

71
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,500
Last time, we got a course, but

72
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
this time, the person who farted can

73
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,000
order directly to the chef

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,140
whatever they want

75
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,000
Anything we want?!

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yup! Anything!

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Wow wow wow..

78
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Sorry.. Do you have anything you strongly recommend?

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Today..

80
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The Tuna is really good.

81
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Tuna huh?!

82
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We're going to have to get stuck into the Tuna first huh?

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Tuna sounds good

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Look at the size of the prawns!

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Looks so nice

86
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,500
This is yellow tail right?

87
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Yes it is

88
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Looks great.

89
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
On top of that...

90
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
There are Nigiri's

91
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
But also Chawanmushi, Miso soup

92
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,500
And tasty side dishes too.

93
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
Man, I want to eat so bad.

94
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Me too.

95
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Yes, I want to eat too.

96
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Ok then, we will begin now.

97
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,500
SUSHI TIME START

98
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Ok, next 2 hours are big...

99
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
Come on!

100
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
I'm going to eat until I'm full

101
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Yes, let's eat until we're full huh?

102
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Hold on everyone.

103
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,500
There's a bit of strange movement over here.

104
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Sorry, hold on a second.

105
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Just as they start, Yamazaki has a fart coming.

106
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Will he be able to open up the farting?

107
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
FAIL

108
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Oi, you! You always do that!

109
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,500
No it's weird, it feels like it's just about to come out!

110
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Really?

111
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,720
A strong start. But the time has only just started.

112
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,720
I don't feel anything coming out

113
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
It hasn't even be 5 minutes!

114
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,500
COME ON!!!

115
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
He got the first fart!

116
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Thank you!

117
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Chu-toro (Mid Fatty Tuna) please

118
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
OH MAN!!! SO LUCKY!!!

119
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
SO LUCKY!!

120
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Are you serious?!

121
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Man that chu-toro looks good

122
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
I always go for Chu-toro first.

123
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,000
I could eat Chu-toro the whole time.

124
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Well of course.

125
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Ye you're right. Wow, it looks so good

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Matsumoto-san always gets off to...

127
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I know.

128
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He really starts it off

129
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No no no, me..

130
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is nothing...

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The Sabu chan of the farting world.

132
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm just a

133
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
piece of ****

134
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Here you go!

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,010
Come on!!

136
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,280
It looks so good!

137
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,280
It looks so nice!

138
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,000
The sushi that Matsumoto ordered is the...

139
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
A tuna type, Chu-toro

140
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,500
So soft and juicy

141
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
it will kick up an appetite

142
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,500
It's so good, I can't get enough of it!

143
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
It's good huh?

144
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
I bet it is

145
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,000
Of course it is.

146
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There's no way it's not going to be delicious.

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
IT'S SOO GOOD!!!

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You know, the first time

149
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The French Restaurant is amazing too

150
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But I prefer sushi...

151
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh of course!

152
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh definitely

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,500
It is right?

154
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
'He Machido Paris' was good too but

155
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
But I prefer 'Sushi He-'

156
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Yes, it's better for sure.

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
As the other members watch and fill up with jealousy

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Matsumoto's face is just pure delight

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,500
It looks so good!

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,500
The other 4 want to follow Matsumoto but

161
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,500
The road to farting is not that easy.

162
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,320
It's definitely there

163
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,850
It's right behind my tail bone

164
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,050
I have no idea what you mean

165
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,660
That was quick

166
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
You don't get it?

167
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Because I have never right behind my tail bone

168
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,600
So your farts are behind your tail bone right now?

169
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,000
Ye, it's all just trapped there.

170
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,000
Is he an idiot?

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Can that even happen?

172
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What the hell is 'behind the tail bone?'

173
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Why don't you try put some gas in then?

174
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Yep Yep Yep!

175
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
It came out

176
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
It came out just now right?

177
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Yamazaki gets his first fart out

178
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
I'm so sorry.

179
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Hold it in for a second!

180
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
You really couldn't wait huh?

181
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,800
Like 'Yep y.. *Buu*'

182
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,000
Well anyway it counted so...

183
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Jeez man!

184
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,000
It was just a little wait more.

185
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm so so sorry.

186
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He couldn't wait until the camera came over.

187
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Chu-toro please

188
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,000
Sounds good!

189
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
Ye, it's got to be chu-toro.

190
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yamazaki's first plate is the same as Matsumoto. Chuutoro.

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Is it good?

192
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's always going to be good.

193
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So good.

194
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Obviously.

195
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yamazaki, we got to try hard and get as much as we can now or

196
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
In about 20 or 30 minutes...

197
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
All these fishes will be gone.

198
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The poor fish right?

199
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There should be enough.

200
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
There's a chance that all the bones might be gone too...

201
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The one to fear is Hamada's ability.

202
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,500
Endo is desperate to fart.

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,500
God, so noisy...

204
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
You're so noisy too, what the hell are you doing? Where are you hitting!

205
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Where is he hitting?

206
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Now, Matsumoto starts to whip his arse into shape.

207
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
When suddenly...

208
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
you going for it?

209
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Oh no... Just for a second.

210
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,700
Ugh, it just went past me.

211
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,700
'Went past me?'

212
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Ye, he looked at me as he passed.

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Man, that's so annoying.

214
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is really similiar to bass fishing.

215
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No it's not.

216
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Killed that...

217
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
He wouldn't even think about it, would he?

218
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Seriously, it got away, right?

219
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,500
But seriously, just as I tried to grab it, it ran away.

220
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,200
Hang on, I got one I think.

221
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,600
WHAT?!

222
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,000
WHAT!?

223
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,300
Oh god, once it starts..

224
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,000
Please don't.

225
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Why not!?

226
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, just for a second now..

227
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Did he run away?

228
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Ye, he got away.

229
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,800
There's similarities to bass fishing though, right?

230
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
NO!

231
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
I don't think I said it like that!

232
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,500
Has it come?

233
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,000
King Hamada. Is this the first fart?

234
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sure I got this.

235
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,000
A beautiful fart from Hamada

236
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Thank you very much

237
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Amazing...

238
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He's here! He's here!

239
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200
Chef, what should I go for?

240
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Start with your favourite one.

241
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,700
But they both got Chutoro, so

242
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,200
O-toro

243
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Let's go for that one!

244
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Just Nigiri? Or grill it on one side?

245
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Oh, please grill it.

246
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,800
Oh that sounds so good!

247
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,200
Ye, then I'll have one too.

248
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Oi oi, why do you get one?

249
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Oh, I don't get one?

250
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
It's Oo-toro!

251
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Oo-toro, huh?

252
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
This kind of stuff...

253
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,200
When I was a kid, I definitely wouldn't be able to eat this.

254
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
He's going to gril it.

255
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
WOW WOW WOW.

256
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,200
I mean, come on. This is going to taste awesome.

257
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
You can just tell.

258
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Oh, this one already has soy sauce on it.

259
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Oh man...

260
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
I should have chosen that one!

261
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,000
There you go

262
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Wow, it's amazing.

263
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The best and tastiest part of a tuna fish.

264
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Delicious with ginger and soy sauce on top.

265
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Should have chosen that one.

266
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well... you should definitely try this!

267
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
it's SO good!

268
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Hamada, absolutely delighted

269
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Oh, I have on coming.

270
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's coming out for you huh?

271
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yep! Loads is coming out today.

272
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't know what to get after Chu-toro

273
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, but I really want to eat the one Hamada-san got.

274
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Oi! Stop copying everyone else's choices!

275
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,000
What's wrong with that? I love doing that.

276
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,500
Grilled Oo-toro please

277
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes I can understand you would want that one.

278
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Here, following Yamazaki, Matsumoto tries...

279
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's great for you!

280
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What should I get?..

281
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I want Uni... But ANAGO!

282
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Let's eat Anago

283
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Here you go.

284
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Oo-toro no Aburi.

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
When you see it, you'll probably want to eat it as well.

286
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's getting busy in here.

287
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I know right?

288
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Seriously, it's getting really busy in here.

289
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You got to keep going.

290
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You have to push yourself.

291
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Ittadakimasu

292
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Excuse me!

293
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,000
Endo has a fart coming here. Will he be able to?

294
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,000
Has it come out?

295
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No... not at all.

296
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,530
Something in my pants moved though, I swear...

297
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You don't usually ask people if a fart came out...

298
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yes I guess...

299
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Wow, wow wow. That looks so good

300
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,500
Matsumoto's 2nd plate is conger eel.

301
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,000
With lots of volume, you will love the softness in your mouth.

302
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Is that a sandwich or something!?

303
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What a weird way of eating it.

304
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's so good.

305
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It certainly has loads of volume.

306
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:17,000
Due to it being so good, Matsumoto finishes it instantly.

307
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,000
On the other hand, Tanaka, who shows no sign of farting

308
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Is starting to show signs he is under heavy pressure.

309
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Tanaka? Seriously?

310
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm begging you... come out...

311
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh my bum.... Yep!

312
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,500
Yet again, Yamazaki has a fart coming.

313
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Yamazaki's 3rd fart of the day.

314
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,500
You're doing really well huh?

315
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Come on!

316
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,010
What can I get you?

317
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,800
Yamachan's in 1st place.

318
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
UNI!

319
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,000
Yamazaki's 3rd plate of the day is Uni from Hokkaido.

320
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Gunkan has soy sauce on it.

321
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,500
The Nigiri has salt on it.

322
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh man! He's got 2 different types, 2 different flavours.

323
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
This is my first time to eat Uni with salt.

324
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Man, that must taste so good.

325
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
He's eating so much today.

326
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh? It's a match.

327
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It tastes too good that Yamazaki is speechless.

328
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He's not really pulling it off..

329
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,500
Say something.

330
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The Uni has made him speechless.

331
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We've come here, and the Last Hemperor is a bit...

332
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He's in trouble, no?

333
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But last time was the same though,

334
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Maybe The Last Hemperor's time is coming to an end?

335
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,000
Maybe Yama-chan will take the crown from me?

336
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Ye... Right, I'm going to try my best.

337
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Is Yamazaki actually going to be able to knock The Last Hemperor off his throne and become the king himself?

338
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
When, suddenly.

339
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh, I have one coming. Yup...

340
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Hamada, 2nd fart of the day.

341
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Will Matsumoto be able to perform a miracle and fart right after his partner?

342
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You got snot hanging out of your nose.

343
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I felt like I was going to die.

344
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I know right? You feel like you're going to die.

345
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Chef! Yellow tail!

346
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh man! So nice...

347
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Hamada's second plate is the 'in season' yellow tail.

348
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The flesh is tough but succulent and is from the Japanese sea.

349
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I see Hamada eat Yellow tail all the time...

350
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,800
You love the stuff, don't you?

351
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,300
This is really good chef. Really really good.

352
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,300
Oi guys hold on...

353
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
A murder case has occured.

354
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,300
Somebody call the police!

355
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,300
What kind of a way is THAT to die?!

356
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,300
Oi Endo!

357
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
I'm so sorry about this...

358
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,300
Ignoring Cocorico, that man once again....

359
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,300
I got one... I got one!

360
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,300
Even though the volume of the fart was small,

361
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,300
Yamazaki extends his lead and heads onto his 4th plate.

362
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,300
Amazing man.

363
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,300
Thank you

364
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,300
Amazing!!

365
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,300
The microphone got it, right?

366
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,600
Right, what can I get you?

367
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Oh man, I'm not sure...

368
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Perhaps the Prawns you mentioned at the beginning?

369
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Ok, the prawns..

370
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,000
What's gotten into you man?

371
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You're doing so well man!

372
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Thank you.

373
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
They're really really big.

374
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yamazaki's 4th item is Giant Sweet Prawns, with two ways of tasting.

375
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,500
Here you go.

376
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Thank you!

377
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,500
This has salt and sudachi and you can put soy sauce on the other one.

378
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
2 flavours again.

379
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,700
That's going to be good.

380
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,700
2 TIMES 2 TIMES!! THE TASTE (from an old commercial in Japan)

381
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
That's so old..

382
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,700
No one remembers that.

383
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,700
That's got to be good!

384
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,700
What is that..

385
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,700
This is the fried part of the head for you.

386
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,700
I get that too?!

387
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,700
Oh come on!!

388
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
Get in there!

389
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
No!

390
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,700
Leave us alone!

391
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,700
Wow, it smells so nice...

392
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Yamazaki has had 8 pieces of sushi so far and fried prawn heads and is now a happy bunny.

393
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,700
If it goes on like this, Yama-chan is going to be the champion.

394
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
The closing stages of the farting competition.

395
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,700
Will Farting King Hamada be able to make a come back?

396
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
There's still gas left in me.

397
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,700
Loads and loads.

398
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Yamazaki is cruising now, and it seems he can still keep farting.

399
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,700
Exucse me, there is another 30 minutes before we close.

400
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
For real?!

401
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
Oh shit!

402
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,000
Cocorico's still haven't even farted once. Surely it can't finish like this?

403
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
When we're done recording... It's all going to come out...

404
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,000
Yep!

405
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That was quick!

406
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That was so cool!

407
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yamazaki's 5th fart.

408
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Chawanmushi.

409
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
He's onto the last stages of his meal...

410
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
He looks so cool..

411
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You never know, he might eat the chawanmushi and then go back and eat more sushi...

412
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
He's 'HE-nry Ouji' (King Henry)

413
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
There it is. A new name.

414
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I really wanted a nickname like that...

415
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm KING HE-NRY!

416
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yamazaki goes into the last stages of his meal and chooses Chawanmushi..

417
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It has a nice and warm citron smell to it.

418
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Oh, it's good

419
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,700
Absolutely nothing.

420
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,700
I'm not even close!

421
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
Shall we just replace Cocorico?

422
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,990
I agree... This is just NOT ON!

423
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,000
Please wait a bit more...

424
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Just a bit more time...

425
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm sure there are many others who would jump at this opportunity

426
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh for sure... Loads and loads

427
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Loads.

428
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'll fart and show you.

429
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
For our spot on the program.

430
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The Cocorico's panic.

431
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But the God of Farts smiles at Matsumoto!

432
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Matsumoto's 3rd fart of the day!

433
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What can I get you?

434
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Prawn Salad Maki!

435
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
When you just talk normally, it comes, doesn't it?

436
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Ye, that's what I'm doing now.

437
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Not moving around and all that.

438
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
How about singing? Maybe that would work

439
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You can turn anything into a song, right?

440
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,690
Yep, absolutely anything.

441
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,690
That's amazing.

442
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Ok, try this 'If you want to fart, please raise your hand.'

443
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
When you're about...

444
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
To fart...

445
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,200
Put your hands in the air!!!!

446
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,210
So shit...

447
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Matsumoto's 3rd plate is Ebi Salad Maki

448
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,200
The harmony between the Mayonnaise and the Prawns is perfect.

449
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,200
A little bit of soy and...

450
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Oh man, I could eat these all day long.

451
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
That looks so good.

452
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
When you're about...

453
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,900
to fart..

454
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,500
No, like this..

455
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,910
When you're about....

456
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,200
to fart...

457
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
put your hands up in the air...

458
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,390
I can't remember that melody.

459
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,200
Man they look like they're having so much fun over there...

460
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Ye, we just look like we've come for a nice meal together.

461
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,700
Yup, yup yup!

462
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,700
You serious?

463
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,700
Yamasaki's 6th fart. King Henry, who just doesn't know when to stop, orders fruits.

464
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
It's literally dinner for him.

465
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,200
Yup... man that's good.

466
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,200
We just look like idiots waiting for Yama-chan to finish eating his dinner.

467
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
He's just relaxing...

468
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
He's aiming for another dish...

469
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:34,970
After this... Yamazaki continues his miracle!

470
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Make 'Care in Softness and Tenderness, Scottie' into a song

471
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,800
Care in Softness and Tenderness, Scottie, ye?

472
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,200
Care in Tendernessssssssssssssssss

473
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,800
Care in Softnessssssss

474
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
You're so annoying!

475
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Shut the hell up!

476
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,800
I wish I was like him... I really do.

477
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Right I've decided.. This will be Hamada-san's song.

478
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:08,470
Why the hell...

479
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,000
You had so much phlegm that I couldn't hear a thing you just said.

480
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Right this will &&*£@&@^$*@& @$*^$*&@

481
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:26,000
The last 5 minutes. Yamasaki concentrates on a strong finish.

482
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yamasaki's 7th fart.

483
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And his final dish will be...

484
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What you going to do?

485
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,800
Ice Cream.

486
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
One Ice Cream please!

487
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
That's amazing.

488
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I've been beaten.

489
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I've been beaten...

490
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yamasaki just owned today...

491
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I think lastly that we should finish the program with Yamasaki-san's song...

492
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Care in Tendernessssssssssssssss

493
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Care in Softnessssssssssssssss
