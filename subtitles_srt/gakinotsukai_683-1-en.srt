How far is omurice still omurice? Let's bet on its limits!

12
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,570
Here we are

13
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,370
We already did 6 rounds before

14
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,910
Yeah we did

15
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,630
Ice Coffee

Limits series

17
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,630
Round 1:

18
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,820
"Limits Series" explores how far you can change words when making an order

19
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,130
Hiyashi Chuuka

20
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,130
Round 2:

21
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,480
In the past, they tried it with "Ice Coffee", "Hiyashi-Chuuka"

22
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,670
Mild Seven

23
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,670

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,670

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,670

Napolitan

30
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,180
Round 6:

31
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,180
Last time, Matsumoto ordered a "Napolitan" by saying "Tamori-san"

32
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,450
Here's the result

33
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,710
An egg & veggies sandwich

34
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,710
is that what you ordered?

35
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,480
Excuse me, I'd like to order a...

36
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,850
Tamori-san

37
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,420
Ma'am

38
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,450
Is my Tamori-san on its way?

39
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,370
There's a Napolitan coming up...

40
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,760
Huh!?

41
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,250
We are making a Napolitan, you hear me?

42
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,420
You got that?

43
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,420
Yes

44
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,370
My spaghetti Tamori-san

45
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,200
What the hell?

46
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,000
Are you kidding me?

47
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,350
Do you like omurice?!

48
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,750
Do you like omurice?!

49
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,680
So noisy...

50
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,680
You startled me

51
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Do you like it?

52
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,930
Omurice

53
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,710
Yeah I guess so

54
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,970
Is that so? Today we're doing it

55
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,970
That's what we'll do

56
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,340
But I changed the rules a bit

57
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,340
Really?

58
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,370
We have some phrases in the box, you just take one

59
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:32,670
Order your omurice with the phrase you took

60
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:32,670
from inside the box: if you win, you'll get a prize

61
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:36,910
Rules

62
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:36,910
m 0 0 l 48 0 l 48 10 l 0 10

63
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,770
And we go with that, but the prize money...

64
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,910
Producer Suga sets the prize money for each phrase

65
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,710
It's up to Suga

66
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,910
Producer

67
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,910
Suga Kenji

68
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,000
I see, it depends on how hard it is

69
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,000
Exactly

70
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,080
If you think that you just

71
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,800
Can't do it with that price

72
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,480
Someone else can do it for you

73
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,480
Oh, I see

74
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,480
We can negotiate

75
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,480
That's right

76
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,680
Negotiations are ok

77
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,820
And now

78
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,820
Matsumoto will reveal this round's phrases

79
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,000
Here's our first one

80
00:01:51,760 --> 00:02:10,710
(Large rice serving)

81
00:01:51,760 --> 00:02:10,710

83
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,850
Oomori raisu

84
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,420
"Oomori raisu"

85
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,170
This one is going to work

86
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,170
You think so?

87
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,170
No doubts about it

88
00:01:59,170 --> 00:01:59,970
I think so too

89
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,600
It clearly says "rice" too

90
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,600
Right

91
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,050
But how much is this worth, Suga-san?

92
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:04,940
I think 3000 yen at best

93
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,610
I think 3000 yen at best

94
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,940
3000 yen?!

95
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,940
Yeah but isn't it good

96
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,940
To get 3000 yen out of this?

97
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,940
Next one

98
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,940
"Omoronai ssu"

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:41,770

Say it, dude

103
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,480
This one, you see...

104
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,050
"Omoronaissu", mhh

105
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,800
It depends on how you say it

106
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,480
"Omoronaissu"

107
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,910
"Omoronaissu"... yeah

108
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,460
I think this one is around 4000 yen

109
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,130
I think this one is around 4000 yen

110
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,420
4000 yen, I see

111
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,420
Seems fair

112
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,000
Stingy prices, huh?

113
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,000
Stingy indeed

114
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,270
So it's real, the bubble did burst

115
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,670
So it's real, the bubble did burst

116
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,510
So it's real, the bubble did burst

117
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,970
It surely feels that way

118
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,710
Next one

119
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,110

This is the "food vs food" one

123
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,450
The one when they say "alright, got it"

124
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,820
But you don't know which one they'll bring

125
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:52,820
Yeah, those

126
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,020
This happened before

127
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,370

"Homeless"

133
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,310
This one's harsh

134
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,310
Is this harsh?

135
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,080

From this point

140
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,620
It gets really difficult

141
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,000
It is hard, we can see that

142
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,540
Next

143
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:30,060

147
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,910
Not eating?

148
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,310
This is dangerous

149
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,400
It's risky

150
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,510
You'd get skipped

151
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,050
They could say "ok, ok"

152
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,050
Yeah, they'll skip your order

153
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,200
But it depends

154
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Alright, next one

155
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:55,480
Can you please make me
a modified chicken rice?

156

159
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,220
I think this is going to work

160
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,510
This one's good

161
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,480
You think so?

162
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,940
I think they'll get it to you

163
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,970
Yeah but how are they "modifying" it?

164
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:43,970
That's the issue

165
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,140
There's only one way

166
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,940
Don't you think it's gonna be it?

167
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,620
But they could just add ketchup

168
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,650
Oh, that too...

169
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,650
Or make it larger

170
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,220
This could go well or not, it's a gamble

171
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,340

What?

176
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,000
This is a bet too

177
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,740
It's an ad-lib for the waiter

178
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,110
You just say it and see if an omuraisu will come

179
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,110
Ah, I see

180
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,050
It's like a quiz, I see

181
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,650
Yeah, a kind of quiz

182
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,910
A playful one

183
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,070
This is not good at all...

184
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,680

188
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,740
I think it's better than this one

189
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,740
It's doable

190
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,170
I think it'll come

191
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,170
I can see that

192
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,020
Here's our last one

193
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,910
This one is amazing

194
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:52,370

197
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,420
Samurai...?

198
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,740
Is it really Samurai?

199
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,110
I mean, for omuraisu?

200
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,710
Yes, Samurai, just one kanji

201
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,260
I mean, if it was "SamuraiSU" I could see that...

202
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,760
I mean, if it was "SamuraiSU" I could see that...

203
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,110
Right?

204
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,560
That's unacceptable

205
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,340
We're going with just one kanji

206
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,340
This is more suitable

207
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,510
We're sticking to this

208
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,170
Suitable? It's just "samurai"

209
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,710
What is he talking about

210
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,450
And you're not one to talk, you said "Ouyang Ice Coffee" to order an ice coffee before

211
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,450
That one was horrible

212
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,450
It was

213
00:04:59,380 --> 00:04:59,580
Challenging the limits of "ice coffee"

214
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,810
Challenging the limits of "ice coffee"

215
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,020
Oh,

216
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,020
I'll take one Ouyang Fifi

217
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,280
Ouyang Ice Coffee

218
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,280
Ice--

219
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,600
Ice coffee, right?

220
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,600
You clearly said it

221
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,740
I think in some cafès they now have Ouyang Ice Coffee on their menu

222
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,740
As if they do!

223
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,170
Such an orthodox boke-tsukkomi exchange

224
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,500
Such an orthodox boke-tsukkomi exchange

225
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,670
They'll now decide the first

226
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,670
phrase for the challenge

227
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,480
They're going to take

228
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,600
The first phrase from the box

229
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,650
Which one will it be?

230
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,110
Which is it?

231
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,110
Woah, I got a big one

232
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,450
Which is it?

233
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,450
Let me reveal it

234
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,450
"Homo Sapiens"

235
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:40,690
First phrase: "Homo Sapiens"

236
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,140
This is a tough one

237
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,770
How about this one, Suga?

238
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,880
"Homo sapiens"? Well, we started from 3000 yen

239
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,600
Yes

240
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,770
I think it's worth 30.000 yen

241
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:52,830
"Homo sapiens": 30.000 yen

242
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,680
Nice, isn't it?

243
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,880
We'll start from 30'000, it surely fits it

244
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,370
This word does

245
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,370
I agree

246
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,940
I mean, look at how many extra letters we got...

247
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,940
It's pretty bad

248
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,170
You're right

249
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,740
I don't have much confidence with this...

250
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,400
You think?

251
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,420
Yeah, I don't really want to do it either

252
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,200
Me too

253
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,250
That's a bad one

254
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:01,570
Then we're counting on you, Hamada

255
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,080
Then we're counting on you, Hamada

256
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,080
Me?!

257
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,580
Should I do it?

258
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,940
Are you going to?

259
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,110
Yeah, why not?

260
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,510
Well, everyone else is sayin' "I can't, I can't"

261
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,910
That's right

262
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,910
So I feel like I have to

263
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,910
That's so manly of you

264
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,740
Yeah, right?

265
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,420
Sometimes he's assaulted by **** old ladies

266
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,250
I swear, it's true

267
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,880
He's a rice bowl topped with unknown objects

286
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,680
You're the first one

287
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,110
So you have to get it right

288

289
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,710
You think you could do it?

290
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,340
What?

291
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,340
Getting this right

292
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,340
I think I can, if it's me, I did that

293
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,620
What?

294
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,110
Why the past tense?

295
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,170
Will they be able to get omuraisu

296
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,170
by saying "homo sapiens" instead!?

297
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,250
Will they get their omuraisu by saying Homo Sapiens?

298

Excuse me

300
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,250
Can we order?

301
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,250
Sure

302
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,510
I think omuraisu is not what I'm getting

303
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,780
I think omuraisu is not what I'm getting

304
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,120
I think omuraisu is not what I'm getting

305
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,490

There is

309
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,130
Then I'll take it

310
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,800
Do you serve drinks as well?

311
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,800
We do

312
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,530
Then I'll have an ice tea

313
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,740
I'll have an ice coffee

314
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,610
I'll get that too

315
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,910
You're not gonna eat?

316
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:43,940
We're good

317
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,280
You're good with only drinks?

318
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,110
Alright, I'll have...

319
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,710
This is something

320
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,020

325
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,180
Excuse me, can you please cancel my ice

326
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,180
coffee and make it an ice au lait?

327
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,780
Alright, I'll have Homo Sapiens

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,620
Alright, I'll have Homo Sapiens

329
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,050
You're not drinking anything?

330
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,950
An ice au lait and...

331
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,220
An ice au lait and...

332
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,830
Homo Sapiens

333
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,700
Omuraisu

334
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,340
Sorry

335
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,810
Impossible

336
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:50,980
Well, this was a complete failure

337
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,240
Well, this was a complete failure

338
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,280
Well, this was a complete failure

339
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,010
It was impossible

340
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,620
Can't be helped

341
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,150
He also said "omuraisu" before, this idiot

342
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,080
He also said "omuraisu" before, this idiot

343
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,620
What was that about?

344
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,950
I just couldn't help it

345
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,120
By the time I saw it on the menu

346
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,250
I thought "oh, they do have it" and I just said it

347
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,760
I thought "oh, they do have it" and I just said it

348
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,760
Should have stayed quiet

349
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,930
That surprised me

350
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,460
Really, I was surprised too

351
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,460
I thought "what is he sayin'?"

352
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,540
No way that could have worked

353
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,670
How can "homo sapiens" do it, huh?

354
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,800
I still think I could have pull it out

355
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,810
Then please

356
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,480
Can we please watch again

357
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,120
Matsumoto's failure before my order?

358
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,720
Matsumoto's failure before my order?

359
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,890
I think...

360
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,760
OMURAISU

361
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,080
is not what I'm getting

362
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,880
That was really bad

363
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,430
Unforgivable

364
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,430
Really really bad

365
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,450
Unbelievable

366
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,400
I couldn't believe it

367
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,600
I'm gonna do it

368
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,620
Round number two

369
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,620
Don't forget about paying Suga back

370
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,000
What the hell?

371
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll be waiting for thy sum

372
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,200
"For thy sum"

373
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,540
Ok, next one

374
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,340
Ann Lewis

375
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:17,730
Next phrase: Ann Lewis

376
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,280
Here it is

377
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,740
What should we do?

378
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,740
This one...

379
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,850
This one is really...

380
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,140
I think we can do it

381
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,570
First, let's ask Suga its value

382
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,280
60.000 yen

383
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:25,070
Ann Lewis: 60.000 yen

384
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,710
For real?

385
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,710
Really?!

386
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,740
Of course

387
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,710
It's level 9 after all

388
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,710
It's normal

389
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,710
Homo Sapiens was way harder than this

390
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,710
No way, man

391
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,880
Are you kidding me?

392
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,000
It's 'cause you're stupid

393
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,350
Who wants to try it? I guess everyone, right?

394
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,370
I want to

395
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,200
I want to try that

396
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,920
You 3, play rock-paper-scissor to decide who's going

397
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,520
Uh? "You 3"?

398
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,940
Yeah

399
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,570
It's fine like this

400
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,200
After that huge failure you just did

401
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,530
After that huge failure you just did

402
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
I didn't fail at all

403
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,880
I didn't do anything like that

404
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:57,740
Alright, let's see that again

405
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,840
Alright, let's see that again

406
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,170
How many times?

407
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,940
I think...

408
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,810
OMURAISU

409
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,450
Is not what I'm getting

410
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,110
That was absurd

411
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,820
You three, go for it

412
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,170
Ready and, rock-paper-scissors

413
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,170
I did it!

414
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,080
He got Ann Lewis...

415
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:26,860
By saying Ann Lewis instead?!

416
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:26,860
Will Yamazaki get an omuraisu

417
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,310
Next challenger is Yamazaki

418
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,110
Will he get an omuraisu by saying Ann Lewis?

419
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,770
Can we...?

420
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,770
Sure, I'm coming

421
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,050
Whenever you want

422
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,070
I'll have an ice coffee

423
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,070
Sure

424
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,140
I'll have udon, please

425
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,740
I'll have udon, please

426
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,240
I'll have udon, please

427
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,240
Udon, got it

428
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,650
I'll have a cola

429
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,110
Cola, sure

430
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,650
Cola, sure

431
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,850
Cream anmitsu

432
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,850
Yes

433
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,150
I'll have Ann Lewis

434
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,790
I'll have Ann Lewis

435
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,050
Man I'm thirsty

436
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,050
Me too

437
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,970
Tell me when you decided it

438
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,170
Oh, I have

439
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,340
Ann Lewis

440
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,170
Here goes

441
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,470
An ice coffee...?

442
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:09,910
Can I have a cheesecake too?

443
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,380
Can I have a cheesecake too?

444
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,150
Ann Lewis

445
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,890
I think I'll have Ann Lewis

446
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,220
I think I'll have Ann Lewis

447
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,820
Orange juice, ok

448
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,630
This is the worst

449
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,630
It sucks

450
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,900
But we discovered something

451
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,270
But we discovered something

452
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,470
But we discovered something

453
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,910
If you say "Ann Lewis", you'll get orange juice

454
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,410
If you say "Ann Lewis", you'll get orange juice

455
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,410
We now know that

456
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,220
This is...

457
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,440
That's way harder, man...

458
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,510
Shocking

459
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,510
Can't help it

460
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,310
Alright, your turn to draw, Yamazaki

461
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,770
Please give it all you got, you three

462
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,770
We will

463
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,110
Yeah, I mean

464
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,540
Of course we will

465
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,540
Suga-san is supporting us so much

466
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,110
Is that a big one?

467
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,910
Here it is

468
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,200
I see

469
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:25,080
Third phrase: homeless

470
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,220
"Homeless"

471
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,600
Perfect timing for this

472
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,370
You're right

473
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,370
Perfectly timed

474
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,710
I just thought about this, but...

475
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:15,010
I think the "MU" in omuraisu is the most important bit

476
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,010
I see

477
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,000
I see, huh

478
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,770
Ok, who's going for it?

479
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,440
I'm going

480
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,610
Really?

481
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
You haven't asked its price yet

482
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,600
You haven't yet

483
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,110
It's 200 yen

484
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,110
What!!

485
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,400
So loud

486
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Let's make this 20.000 yen

487
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,350
Homeless: 20.000 yen

488
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,200
Not bad at all, you can do it

489
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:36,360
Will they be able to order omuraisu

490
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:36,360
by saying "homeless" instead?!

491
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,110
Can they order "omuraisu" by saying "homeless"?

492
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,110
Here's Tanaka's challenge!

493
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,460
Let's see...

494
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,770
I'll have ochazuke and nori

495
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,970
I'll have ochazuke and nori

496
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,230
Ochazuke, alright

497
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,970
Ochazuke, alright

498
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,840
I'll take an ice coffee

499
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,240
Let's see... homeless

500
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,140
Let's see... homeless

501
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,480
Sorry, what was that again?

502
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,840
Sorry but I heard "homeless"

503
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,750
Sorry but I heard "homeless"

504
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,750
Omuraisu

505
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,310
Omuraisu? Ok

506
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,510
He gave up

507
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,290
You just said it, dude

508
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,140
Yeah, so clearly

509
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,590
He said "omuraisu"

510
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,260
Dude, you just said "omuraisu"

511
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,960
Dude, you just said "omuraisu"

512
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
He said it, yeah

513
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,200
It was only your second attempt

514
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,570
Right, too quick

515
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,340
But I---

516
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:15,970
When she got closer to you...

517
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:16,300
When she got closer to you...

518
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,370
When she got closer to you...

519
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,300
You panicked, right?

520
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,170
Right when she got closer

521
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,710
Right when she got closer

522
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,510
I couldn't do it

523
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,450
That was so bad

524
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,050
The hell is going on, today?

525
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,050
We're screwed

526
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,820
Did I really say "omuraisu"?

527
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,490
The first time you clearly

528
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,290
The first time you clearly

529
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,290
said "homeless"

530
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,090
And the second time you clearly

531
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,390
And the second time you clearly

532
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,390
said "omuraisu"

533
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,890
That's exactly how it went, no more

534
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,100
That's exactly how it went, no more

535
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,100
and no less than that

536
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,710
I'll be counting on you

537
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,710
Listen

538
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,540
We changed our plan

539
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,800
By now there's no point

540
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,310
In doing the first ones

541
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,450
We have to think about

542
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,050
What our audience wants to see

543
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,940
So I thought about what we should do

544
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,450
And I think #7 and #10 are good

545
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,800
"Can you please make me a modified chicken rice?"

546
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,110
And "Samurai", me and Endo

547
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,480
Are gonna do them

548
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,050
Don't you think it's good?

549
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,620
I think it's good

550
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,700
How much was it? 3 million?

551
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,430
Say that to him, Endo

552
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,450
What the hell?

553
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,200
You said that, right?

554
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,280
You said that before, dude

555
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,970
What are you talking about?

556
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,000
We'll do it for 3 million

557
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:32,140
By the way, Suga-chan, how much is the chicken rice thing?

558
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,140
This one?

559
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,600
It never appeared before

560
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,880
So I'm gonna say...

561
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,370
They're 70.000 yen and 1 million

562
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,890
"Can you please make me a modified chicken rice?"

563
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,890
100.000 Yen

564
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,890
70.000 Yen

565
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,890
Samurai

566
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,200
This is huge

567
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,910
Here it comes!

568
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,820
Here it is!

569
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,000
But it depends on the shop we're going to

570
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,970
Yeah, right

571
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,050
You don't know if it works, it depends

572
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,200
Let me say it again

573
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,510
If you say "can you modify it?"

574
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,680
And they're like "how about omuraisu?"

575
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,600
That's no good

576
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,100
If you say "yes", it doesn't count

577
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,600
I see, I can't say "yes"

578
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,770
So I just have to act as if I'm thinking about it, right?

579
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,540
No

580
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,940
If you say anything implying "yes", it doesn't count

581
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,450
If you say anything implying "yes", it doesn't count

582
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,420
So I just have to keep quiet

583
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:16,450
"Can you please make me a modified chicken rice?"

584
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:16,450
Will it work for an omuraisu?

585
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,650
Endo is going to say "Can you please make me a modified chicken rice?"

586
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,450
Will it work for a omuraisu order?

587
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,540
Sorry to keep you waiting

588
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,490
I'll have a cake

589
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,730
I'll have a cake

590
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,260
I'm sorry, we don't have them today

591
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,130
I'm sorry, we don't have them today

592
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,130
Oh, you don't

593
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,860
Then I'll have an ice tea

594
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,960
Then I'll have an ice tea

595
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,630
Ice tea, ok

596
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,500
I'll have the same

597
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,370
I'll have the same

598
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:32,900
Can I have a cola, please?

599
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,010
Can I have a cola, please?

600
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,080
I'll take an ice coffee

601
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,950
Sorry, listen... can you please

602
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,280
Sorry, listen... can you please

603
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,180
make me a modified chicken rice?

604
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,280
make me a modified chicken rice?

605
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,520
To chicken rice?

606
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,520
Yeah, I'd like to have it kinda modified, you know

607
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,030
You want me to add something to it?

608
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,530
You want me to add something to it?

609
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:08,740
You just have to

610
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,270
modify a bit a chicken rice

611
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,740
modify a bit a chicken rice

612
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,740
Got it

613
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,310
Wanna order anything else?

614
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:19,950
Wanna order anything else?

615
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,510
Oh, we're good

616
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,950
Ok, got it, I'll be back soon

617
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,950
Ok, got it, I'll be back soon

618
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,220
He said it according to rules

619
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,720
He said it according to rules

620
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,720
Really?

621
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,420
That waitress took that nicely

622
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:25,960
That waitress took that nicely

623
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,860
That waitress took that nicely

624
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,630
But we don't know what's gonna come

625
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,890
Excuse me...

626
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,500
I'm sorry to disturb you

627
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,500
But we don't have chicken rice

628
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,770
We can make you a Mexican pilaf or a sansai pilaf...

629
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,270
We can make you a Mexican pilaf or a sansai pilaf...

630
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,310
Chicken rice...

631
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,310
No Mexican pilaf, then?

632
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,340
I had chicken rice

633
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:48,200
I had chicken rice

634
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,340
yesterday, so... is there anything like it?

635
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,180
yesterday, so... is there anything like it?

636
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,010
Mexican pilaf is similar to it

637
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,310
Mexican pilaf is similar to it

638
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,190
How about you just modify a Mexican pilaf?

639
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:56,490
Mexican pilaf is similar to it

640
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,490
How about you just modify a Mexican pilaf?

641
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,890
Is there anything you want me to add to it?

642
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,960
Is there anything you want me to add to it?

643
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,960
Just modify it a bit, that's it

644
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,730
2 minutes later

645
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,930
How about a Mexican pilaf and fried chicken

646
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,100
How about a Mexican pilaf and fried chicken

647
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,100
set? Is that good?

648
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,600
I'm sorry, sir

649
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,000
Let's see...

650
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,510
We can make it a single serving

651
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,680
No

652
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
That's not really it...

653
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,510
What are you saying?

654
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,510
You're just babbling about...

655
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,450
You know, I want it to look like this

656
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,020
You know, I want it to look like this

657
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,950
Come again?

658
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,320
Yeah, look like what?

659
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,220
Dude, she's busy you know

660
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,620
Dude, she's busy you know

661
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,960
Dude, she's busy you know

662
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,110
Excuse me

663
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,110
It's fine

664
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:33,820
Can you like, wrap it up or stuff?

665
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,790
Can you like, wrap it up or stuff?

666
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,700
You mean omuraisu?

667
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,700
I really don't know much about that...

668
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:42,900
Man, he's so sly

669
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,240
Man, he's so sly

670
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,040
I'll leave it up to you

671
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,040
Is it really ok?

672
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,610
You're practically already out, dude

673
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,610
You're so out

674
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,650
"Wrap it up" was not good

675
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:56,880
But I didn't say "egg" or anything

676
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,550
But I didn't say "egg" or anything

677
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,550
That doesn't mean anything

678
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,350
You really tried, I recognize that

679
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,890
Or better, that waitress really tried

680
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:07,260
Or better, that waitress really tried

681
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,250
Yeah, she sure did

682
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:07,560
Let's give her 70.000 yen

683
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,990
Let's give her 70.000 yen

684
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,900
What dish is she going to bring them!?

685
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,170
Sorry to have kept you waiting

686
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,670
Here, I asked the chef

687
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:21,210
Here, I asked the chef

688
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,540
To do a chicken rice and make an omuraisu out of it

689
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,210
To do a chicken rice and make an omuraisu out of it

690
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,340
Surprisingly, the omuraisu appears

691
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,080
Oh, thank you

692
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,620
That's what I wanted to eat

693
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,620
Excuse me

694
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,080
This means nothing

695
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,920
They don't have it in the menu

696
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,050
But it doesn't mean anything

697
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,790
How should we judge this one?

698
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,060
How should we judge this one?

699
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,790
This is outside the menu

700
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,460
I think that hint you gave doesn't help you

701
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,390
I think that hint you gave doesn't help you

702
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,900
I think that hint you gave doesn't help you

703
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,970
You mean "wrap it up"?

704
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,230
What should we do?

705
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,600
If only you didn't say that phrase,

706
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,340
If only you didn't say that phrase,

707
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,340
"wrap it up"...

708
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,740
That sentence is against the rule

709
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,740
It got you your omuraisu

710
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,410
Try eat that, try

711
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,280
Try eat that, try

712
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,950
What do you think about it?

713
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,800
Here I go

714
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,450
It tastes like modified chicken rice

715
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:07,590
It tastes like modified chicken rice

716
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,590
It tastes like modified chicken rice

717
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,170
Suga-san, here's what happened

718
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,880
First off,

719
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,570
This restaurant had no chicken rice on the menu

720
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,570
I see

721
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:24,080
I told them if they could modify a chicken rice

722
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,220
And at first we got stuck on that

723
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,570
Then I told them to "wrap it up", I used those words

724
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,880
This is no good

725
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,880
I know

726
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,080
Me too I thought I've lost, then it appeared

727
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,940
And they brought me this

728
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,680
Out-of-menu chicken rice

729
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,310
With an omuraisu thing on top of it

730
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,080
What do you think?

731
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,030
You failed

732
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,110
And we're done

733
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,540
Four consecutive outs...

734
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,480
All four of us, yeah

735
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,480
This is impressive

736
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,110
And that means we reached our finale

737
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,770
Samurai

738
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,770
It's time for Samurai

739
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,640
I'm gonna do it truthfully

740
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,440
Really, I swear

741
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,140
I won't do anything shady, I'm gonna make

742
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,810
I won't do anything shady, I'm gonna make

743
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,580
I won't do anything shady, I'm gonna make

744
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,580
that omuraisu appear by saying that

745
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,580
that omuraisu appear by saying that

746
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,110
It's "samurai", you know

747
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,110
I'll say just that

748
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,800
If it doesn't come, this ep would suck

749
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,190
You gotta do it for Gaki

750
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,890
You have to say "samurai" and nothing else

751
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,560
You have to say "samurai" and nothing else

752
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,880
What do you mean?

753
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
What do you mean what?!

754
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,540
That's how the game works

755
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,540
Right

756
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,760
You can't say "samuraisu" or such

757
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,830
You can't say "samuraisu" or such

758
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,420
If you add a "su", you're out

759
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,670
If you add a "su", you're out

760
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,680
Yeah I mean

761
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,040
That's a huge rule violation

762
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,410
It's worth a fine

763
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,610
I could get fired for that and I wouldn't complain

764
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:48,090
Is it possible?

765
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:48,090
Ordering "omuraisu" by saying "samurai":

766
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,340
No one succeeded yet in this Limits series episode

767
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,540
Can you order an omuraisu by saying samurai?

768
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,540
Matsumoto is going to try

769
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,080
I'm going to the toilet

770
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:58,100
Matsumoto plans on ordering it

771
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:58,100
as he's coming back from the toilet

772
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,570
I'm ready to take orders

773
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,100
I'm taking a soda, ma'am

774
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,340
I'm taking a soda, ma'am

775
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,140
Alright, what else?

776
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,540
Two sodas

777
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,810
I'm taking a coffee

778
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,810
Hot coffee is ok?

779
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,310
Cola

780
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,180
There's another one at the toilet

781
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,850
There's another one at the toilet

782
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:23,890
Oh, excuse me

783
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,090
Oh, excuse me

784
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:26,790
I'll have a samurai

785
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,760
I'll have a samurai

786
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,460
What was that?

787
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:33,460
Samuraisu

788
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,460
Omuraisu? You're ok with that?

789
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,570
Yep

790
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,470
Is it really ok?

791
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,470
Yeah

792
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,170
No man, you didn't say that

793
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:37,530
No man, you didn't say that

794
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,600
No man, you didn't say that

795
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,740
You said "samuraisu"

796
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,340
You said it

797
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,340
You said it with such resolution

798
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,110
You're playing dirty

799
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,120
I just got that right, didn't I?

800
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,580
I just got that right, didn't I?

801
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,090
I just got that right, didn't I?

802
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,080
You didn't

803
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:55,520
Everyone had a face like "what?"

804
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,860
Everyone had a face like "what?"

805
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
I was like "huh?"

806
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,530
Samuraisu

807
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,530
You said "rice" so clearly

808
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,000
I bet he didn't want to say that

809
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:51,910
This video was brought to you by Tofu Panda Fansubs

810
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,200
But he clearly said it, that's what happened

811
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,840
Samuraisu?

812
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,850
He said samuraisu

813
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:17,970
We told you couldn't add "su", didn't we?

814
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,970
Yeah, no "su" allowed, right

815
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,680
And why did you say it?

816
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,710
Of course you end up sayin' it

817
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,340
Did I say that?

818
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,620
Stop denying it

819
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:38,080
We released a book to celebrate of TV show Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende's fifteenth year, which talks about its story.

820
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,680
Its title is "kiseki". It also features a special interview with Hitoshi Matsumoto and Masatoshi Hamada.

821
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,860
