1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,720
Wait, Yuta. Tuck in your shirt.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,010
I'm off. I'll be home
today around 7:00.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,820
Okay, have a nice day!

4
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,730
Thanks for waiting.

5
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,670
Were you here long?

6
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,100
Not long.

7
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,090
Shall we go?

8
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,000
Kodera

9
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,190
I'm home.

10
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,450
Oh, welcome home.

11
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,650
Is the bath heated?

12
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,540
Yeah.

13
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,090
You got home from work early.

14
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,470
Yeah, and your job must've run late.

15
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,530
It's the end of the month.

16
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,330
I've been running around
to meet my quota.

17
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,760
My hips can't take it.

18
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,670
Mix it thoroughly and then
spread it on the surface.

19
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,510
Sensei, I didn't come to work
here to do stuff like this.

20
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,440
After that, put this on top.

21
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,100
Are you listening to me?

22
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,130
What is that?

23
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,040
Seaweed boiled in soy sauce.

24
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,810
Seaweed boiled in soy sauce...

25
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,660
Yes.

26
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,830
It's just a theory of mine,

27
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,780
but side dishes that go well with rice
usually go well with bread, too.

28
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,680
This should only be eaten with rice.

29
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,920
This bread is topped with pickled
daikon radish slices.

30
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,770
That should be eaten with rice, as well.

31
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,660
Office Landlord:
Toyama Yoshie

32
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,660
You've got a lot free time, as usual.

33
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,250
Oh, Yoshie-san.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,450
Please try my pickled bread.

35
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,370
No thanks.

36
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,670
I'm hungry, but not that hungry.

37
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,530
It's unexpectedly good, you know.

38
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,690
The word "unexpectedly"
does not inspire confidence.

39
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,720
How are you going to make
the monthly rent like this?

40
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,370
I'll have last month's for you soon.

41
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,290
By the way, it's actually
the month before last's.

42
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,300
What made you think you
didn't owe that one?

43
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,450
Is there work coming to this office?

44
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,020
Attorney:
Hakamada Yukio

45
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,800
Please don't worry.

46
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,790
We have a number of ongoing clients.

47
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,790
Right, Shinozuka-san?

48
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,500
Yes. One client.

49
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,500
Temp:
Shinozuka Rina

50
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,610
You've only got one,
so don't exaggerate.

51
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,200
Hey, Kanae-chan.

52
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,770
Hakamada's Assistant:
Nonomura Kanae

53
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,660
Yes?

54
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,770
You're gathering material for your

55
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,440
lawyer manga while you
work at this office, right?

56
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,710
Yes.

57
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,630
Can't you use the manga
to advertise the firm?

58
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,510
I don't have that kind
of authorization yet.

59
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,020
I have syndication, but I'm
still treated like a newbie.

60
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,850
How useless.

61
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,760
Seriously useless.

62
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,130
Um...

63
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,140
Hello.

64
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,960
Oh. Kodera-san.

65
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,730
I was waiting for you.

66
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,180
Please.

67
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,410
That's the ongoing client
he mentioned.

68
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,890
Her husband's cheating on her,
and she's considering compensation.

69
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,830
I see. She's pretty, isn't she?

70
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,140
I captured my husband
having an affair.

71
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,880
Client of this episode:
Kodera Kiyomi

72
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,190
Whoa...

73
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,920
Good job.

74
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,520
And thank you for this.

75
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,190
Iron Spy Woman
Marilyn

76
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,190
It had useful information, didn't it?

77
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,160
Private Investigator:
Umemoto Kurumi

78
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,860
If you need to know the rest of the
story, I'll let you borrow more.

79
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,960
I have all 108 episodes,
up to season 10.

80
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,210
No, thank you.

81
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,230
This should be ample evidence.

82
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,930
In all honesty, it's
incomprehensible to me.

83
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,050
Why would my husband be
attracted to a woman like that?

84
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,090
Excuse me a second.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,540
You're right. She's plain.

86
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,650
You're way prettier.

87
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,220
How typical.

88
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,430
The partner in infidelity is usually
less attractive than the wife.

89
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,740
Men have low standards.

90
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,130
Especially men like this.

91
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,440
I also have this.

92
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,440
I took this in front of
that woman's home.

93
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,800
This is...

94
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,440
Double adultery!

95
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,520
She's married, and she has a child.

96
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,620
They look like a happy family
from the outside.

97
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,840
She should be happy enough.

98
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,860
Why would she cheat?

99
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,170
Speaking as a woman,
I can't understand it.

100
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,000
I cannot forgive this woman.

101
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,710
I understand...

102
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,690
Kiyomi-san, you know...

103
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,910
Compensation can be collected
from the mistress, too.

104
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,090
What?

105
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:21,770

Double Adultery! A Grueling Court Battle!!

107
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,500
Sorry. Were you here long?

108
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Not at all.

109
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,400
You can be late tonight, right?

110
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,510
Yeah. I told him there's a mother's
meeting at the elementary school.

111
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,250
My wife said she'd be late, too.
We can take our time today.

112
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,870
I represent Kodera Kiyomi-san.

113
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,210
My name is Hakamada.

114
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,460
I'm his assistant, Nonomura Kanae.

115
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,160
Fumiya's lover
Togawa Yuko

116
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,160
Kiyomi's husband
Kodera Fumiya

117
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,160
Kiyomi's representative?

118
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,730
I'd like the two of
you to see something.

119
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,690
What is this?

120
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,290
They were taken last Friday.

121
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,750
Both of you have spouses, and yet...

122
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,720
you seem to be intimate
with one another.

123
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,060
As a representative,
let me ask you directly...

124
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,260
Were the two of you having
an illicit affair?

125
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,530
You're at a loss for words.

126
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,730
I'll ask you again.

127
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,550
The two of you...

128
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,160
Were you doing it?

129
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,580
Well...

130
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,940
We have a lot evidence.

131
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,620
I think you might as well own up to it.

132
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,170
We did it.

133
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,820
That's judicious of you.

134
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,660
No, we didn't.

135
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,630
What?

136
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,700
We're not having an illicit affair.

137
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,770
No, no, no matter how you look
at it, you went to a hotel...

138
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,300
I never went in any hotel.

139
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,510
We just had lunch at a place
in front of this hotel.

140
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,470
This is a hotel district.
Why would you have lunch—

141
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,720
He and I have been friends
since high school.

142
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,520
We discussed our family life. That's all.

143
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,020
If you don't admit it,
this will go to court.

144
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,620
We don't want to go to court.

145
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,960
I don't care.

146
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,140
What?

147
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,950
It will take time.

148
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,730
And attorney fees will
be nothing to sneeze at.

149
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,540
I don't need an attorney.

150
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,320
Hakamada Law Office

151
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,320
A trial?

152
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,150
Yes.

153
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,240
She won't admit to it.

154
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,260
There's no other choice.

155
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,800
Actually, I've been
struggling with something...

156
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,170
I don't know if it's right for me to be
compensated by the mistress.

157
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,680
I think it would hurt her
innocent child and husband.

158
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,150
But...

159
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,140
I will go along with it.

160
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,690
What?

161
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,650
Based on what you've told me,
I've made up my mind.

162
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,920
I'll fight it out in court.

163
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,420
But, if it goes to court,

164
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,700
won't that lessen the compensation?

165
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,300
Well... in most cases.

166
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,320
Then, we should bill the husband for
compensation. He confessed.

167
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,050
But she's the kind of woman
who lies and says she isn't cheating.

168
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,070
I won't be satisfied
until I crush her.

169
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,980
Let's calm down first.

170
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,300
Sensei, say something.

171
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,720
Understood.

172
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,740
I'll make preparations for the trial.

173
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,180
Sensei!

174
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,520
Please do.

175
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:14,530
Going forward, there's someone
you must have on your side.

176
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,100
Kiyomi. I am sorry.

177
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,680
You admit you cheated, then?

178
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,580
Yeah. I do.

179
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,440
I'm truly sorry.

180
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,850
How long has it been going on?

181
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,360
Since the class reunion last year.

182
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,170
Oh...

183
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,170
We were both in drama club.

184
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,100
We were just club mates at the time...

185
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,850
But, at the reunion, she said
she liked me and stuff...

186
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,870
I got carried away.

187
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,480
I'm really stupid.

188
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,960
Stupid! I'm stupid!

189
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,160
Don't torture yourself.

190
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,350
I understand your feelings.

191
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,150
Huh?

192
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,940
You always hear about affairs
that start at class reunions.

193
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,240
Don't worry.

194
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,710
I'm on your side.

195
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,840
No matter what.

196
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,570
Kiyomi.

197
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,610
Why must the husband be on her side?

198
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,850
He's a major culprit, a cheater!

199
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,320
Our opponent this time
is quite a conundrum.

200
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,930
In order for the court to accept
the fact of the adultery,

201
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,480
we need sound evidence.

202
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,260
Thus, it would be faster to question
the culprit of the illicit affair.

203
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,470
It would be more
convincing and real.

204
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,380
She's a housewife, so usually
we'd meet at noon on a workday.

205
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,970
It was convenient because I have to
make my rounds out of the office.

206
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:06,930
I see.

207
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,660
Most of the time, we went
to love hotels in Shibuya.

208
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,880
They have places that give
discounts during workdays.

209
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,280
What days are those, specifically?

210
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,260
Let's see...

211
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,140
Just a second.

212
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,260
I have a points card.

213
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,960
Hotel
Charlotte

214
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,890
So many...

215
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,890
Yeah. I have another one.

216
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,940
Sorry. That was insensitive of me.

217
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,010
No, you're helping me a lot.

218
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:46,680
Anything else?

219
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,260
Well...

220
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,410
There was a time their rooms were full.

221
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,690
It was only once, though!

222
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,020
In that room.

223
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,170
What?

224
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,840
But it was only once.

225
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,530
Oh.

226
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,870
Anger Anger Anger

227
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:08,730
Anger Anger Anger

228
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,000
Anger Anger Anger

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,170
Statement

230
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,210
They even did it in your home...

231
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,910
Hearing it made me nauseous.

232
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,180
I had no idea he was
that insensitive.

233
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,700
He's desperate to get
himself out of trouble.

234
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,420
Well, that's to our advantage.

235
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,190
Think of it this way:

236
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,460
Every word he speaks will turn into money.

237
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,040
I understand.

238
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,050
I will make preparations for the
hearing based on this statement.

239
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,010
My husband says he'll go to court, too.

240
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,510
He said he'll bear witness,
and do anything I ask.

241
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,140
Tell him you don't want him to.

242
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,160
Huh?

243
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,300
It happens often. The party in
question takes the stand,

244
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,010
has an emotional outburst,
and hurts the case.

245
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,620
I'm worried that's what
your husband might do.

246
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,150
That's true.

247
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,200
Aside from that, to have the
upper hand in the hearing,

248
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,900
there are two things I need
you to drag out of him.

249
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,060
What are they?

250
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,830
First, you have to make
him say, "I did wrong."

251
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,500
That will make it clear that Fumiya-san
and Yuko-san had an illicit affair.

252
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,410
How is that?

253
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,360
Sexless or infertile marriages

254
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,800
can be seen as an existing break
between husband and wife

255
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,040
and make it more difficult
to receive compensation.

256
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,610
We have to eliminate
all those arguments.

257
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,620
I see.

258
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,840
And the other thing which you have
to drag out of your husband...

259
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,930
He has to say, "My partner
was the instigator."

260
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,370
I'm sorry. I truly did wrong.

261
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,500
So you feel you've done wrong.

262
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,300
Yeah. I absolutely did wrong.

263
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,370
I absolutely did wrong.

264
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,520
You've always been supportive of me.

265
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,970
When things weren't
going well at my work,

266
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,420
you worked at home and
helped our finances.

267
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,000
When I got in the scooter accident,

268
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,760
you nursed me and never left my side.

269
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,240
I am truly grateful.

270
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,460
I'm your wife, it's only normal.

271
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,520
Kiyomi.

272
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,240
You and I haven't talked
like this in so long.

273
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,230
I feel like we're newlyweds again.

274
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,620
I know.

275
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,610
One final thing I'd like to know...

276
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,280
Did you instigate the affair?

277
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,310
What?

278
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,750
Well, that...

279
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,050
Did you?

280
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,220
No, she did.

281
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,400
Yuko's the one who suggested we
go to a hotel after the reunion.

282
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,930
I think she said, "let's get
together" more times than I did.

283
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,360
I see.

284
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,830
So, she instigated the affair.

285
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,770
That's right. She was the instigator.

286
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,360
She was the instigator.

287
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,030
I understand.

288
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,760
I think I've told you everything.

289
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,610
I'm glad you recollected everything.

290
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,380
Thanks.

291
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,640
I did it for you. Of course I would.

292
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,920
Something went wrong with me.

293
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,980
Sorry, okay?

294
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,090
Kiyomi.

295
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:23,380
Anyway, please sign here.

296
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,680
Oh, yes.

297
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,850
Isn't the husband saying, "she was
the instigator" his subjective opinion?

298
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,050
Yes.

299
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,220
It doesn't carry as much
weight as evidence.

300
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,340
What's the point, then?

301
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,080
Well...

302
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,500
Look forward to the hearing.

303
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,590
Court of Law

304
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,360
The first oral proceedings

305
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,590
I didn't think a case like this
would be held at district court.

306
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,560
Where did you think it would be held?

307
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,790
Since it's a domestic case, I thought it
would be at the domestic relations court.

308
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,960
A compensatory action between a married
couple can be held at domestic relations court,

309
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:13,210
Compensatory Lawsuit

310
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:13,210
Compensatory lawsuit against guilty party in illicit affair → District Court

311
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:13,210
Divorce suit between married couples → Domestic Relations Court

312
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,850
but when the guilty party is on
trial, it's held at district court.

313
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,450
I see.

314
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,320
Subsequently, on January 9th,
the two had a tryst

315
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,250
in room 502 of the Hotel Charlotte,

316
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,330
at which time they had their
second sexual encounter.

317
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,550
Lastly, to repeat,

318
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:40,370
every rendezvous they had was
instigated by the defendant,

319
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,410
as Fumiya-san has stated.

320
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,480
That is all.

321
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,290
She's quite worked up.

322
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,270
Wow, you're good.

323
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,180
That is...

324
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,870
not true.

325
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,300
I never seduced him, not once!

326
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:19,350
Fumiya-san seduced me every time.

327
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,110
Huh?

328
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,880
That's right.

329
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,780
I was forced to see him.

330
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,990
And he raped me!

331
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,910
Ra...

332
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,690
...pe?

333
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,160
Now, hold on a second...

334
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,130
Please stay calm, Kiyomi-san.

335
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,630
So, you were raped, and the
relationship was one-sided.

336
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,580
Yes.

337
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,670
Exactly.

338
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,180
Hakamada-sensei.

339
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,060
Why didn't you make a counterargument?

340
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,690
Actually, it was lucky
Yuko-san made that remark.

341
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,590
What?

342
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,430
It's not Yuko-san who we're
fighting. It's the judge.

343
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,890
What?

344
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,000
Who is lying?

345
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,010
Who's statement should be believed?

346
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,780
It's her word against ours.

347
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,070
Statements made in angry outbursts

348
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,940
make the judge suspicious.

349
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,130
So, in order to drag that out of her,

350
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,280
you purposefully made her mad by

351
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,780
revealing Fumiya-san's statement
about her being the aggressor?

352
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,500
This is getting interesting.

353
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,530
Please inform Fumiya-san
about what happened.

354
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,200
I raped her?

355
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,570
That's ridiculous!

356
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,640
Ah, wait a second.

357
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,570
Does this look like she's being forced?

358
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,190
Whoa...

359
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,570
So, Yuko-san is lying, correct?

360
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,480
Of course it's a lie.

361
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,230
Yuko was the lead in this play.

362
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,230
This cosplay was Yuko's idea, too.

363
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,990
Memories of our drama club
days came back to us...

364
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,400
and we got crazy hot with
each other that day.

365
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,500
Man, I'm mad.

366
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,930
I'm fighting back with all I've got.

367
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,180
I'll give you whatever evidence you need.

368
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,000
She has to pay for her offense,
through and through.

369
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,370
You're right.

370
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,560
Love hotel photos

371
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:47,890
These photos were taken on
June 8th at the Hotel Charlotte.

372
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,820
It is clear that they
went to the hotel,

373
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,900
The third oral proceedings

374
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,610
and then she dressed up in
a high school uniform,

375
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,730
and thereby engaged in illicit actions

376
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,390
by her own volition.

377
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,240
That is all.

378
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,120
I was being threatened.

379
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,190
Please elaborate.

380
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:25,490
After he raped me, he took
those pictures of me.

381
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,320
He said if I refused to see him again,

382
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,710
he would show the photos to my husband.

383
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:38,000
That is why I met with
Fumiya-san repeatedly.

384
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,120
That school uniform was also his idea.

385
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,240
Don't worry.

386
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,110
The more stories she tells,
the greater our advantage.

387
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,760
After all, she has no proof.

388
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,390
I have proof.

389
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,000
Huh?

390
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,330
Proof?

391
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,330
She does?

392
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:07,460
The audio recording I have here
is proof that he threatened me.

393
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,320
Come on, let's get started.

394
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,220
I don't want to. This is wrong.

395
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,600
Refuse all you want.

396
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,510
But what would your husband
say if he saw these pictures?

397
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,490
Please...

398
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,460
I can hand the photos out
to your neighbors, too.

399
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,630
Please, don't!

400
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,700
Then get on your knees like always.

401
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,980
Come on. Se—

402
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,840
That's right.

403
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:51,090
Indeed, I realize there was an
illicit action, the one time.

404
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,500
It was because I was taken by force.

405
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:02,130
He began making threats like this,

406
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,340
and he made me
meet him many times.

407
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,820
But, I never did it with
Fumiya-san willingly!

408
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:21,580
I was desperate to protect my family.

409
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,450
Does the plaintiff have a rebuttal?

410
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,880
Sensei.

411
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,440
May I have a copy of the audio recording?

412
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,190
Then get on your knees like always.

413
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,530
Come on. Se—

414
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,570
It gets cut off at the end.

415
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,760
I hear "se."

416
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,100
What word starts with "se"?

417
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,620
Maybe "sex"?

418
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,690
Are you sure that voice
is your husband's?

419
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,330
Yes. I'm sure.

420
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,800
Or maybe "kiss" (seppun).

421
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,690
If Fumiya-san did make
threats, what will happen?

422
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,940
Then it would be difficult to
get compensation from Yuko-san.

423
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,610
Only if it's true, that is.

424
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,970
I need for you to ascertain,

425
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,580
if in fact your husband
made the threats.

426
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,100
I will.

427
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,060
I know. It's "missionary position" (seijoi)!

428
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,320
Come on. Let's get started.

429
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,340
I don't want to. This is wrong.

430
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,530
Refuse all you want.

431
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,090
Hakamada-sensei.

432
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:48,360
But what would your husband say—

433
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,640
Did you go about this the right way?

434
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,940
Meaning?

435
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,990
You could've gotten a
much higher compensation

436
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:02,950
if you had charged the
husband from the outset.

437
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,400
And it wouldn't have gone to court.

438
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,290
Do you have a way to save Kiyomi-san?

439
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,500
I don't know.

440
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,810
What?

441
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:30,540
Every client has their own unique pain.

442
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,420
I won't need you any more today.

443
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,050
Good work.

444
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,990
Oh, Kanae-san.

445
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,090
Could it have been "missionary position"
(seijoi) after all?

446
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,280
Who knows?

447
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,820
What?

448
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,600
Of course I didn't threaten her.

449
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,400
I've already told you.

450
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,280
She was the instigator.

451
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,110
Are you into S&M?

452
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,400
You know me.

453
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,750
I prefer just the "M" part.

454
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,530
How interesting! Double adultery...

455
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:27,780
I love the grueling battle
between the two women.

456
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,900
This episode is based on the
current case at the law office.

457
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,300
In next week's episode,

458
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,440
Editor at Tokiwa Publishing:
Tabata Misato

459
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,050
the mistress is going
to get crushed, right?

460
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,560
Yes, that is what will happen.

461
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,910
Cafe waitress:
Mizutani Sara

462
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,660
I feel it.

463
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,290
That mistress will assuredly
receive divine punishment.

464
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,820
There is no mistake.

465
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,710
Well...

466
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,480
Huh? Is she wrong?

467
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,730
Am I wrong?

468
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,110
In the actual hearing,
there are some ambiguities.

469
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,410
I see...

470
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,210
And, yes. The protagonist lawyer.

471
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,650
Does he only take on divorce cases?

472
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,080
Yes, that's the premise.

473
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,230
According to this,

474
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,650
divorce lawyers don't get
paid much for all their work.

475
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,530
Why would he specialize
in this field?

476
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:33,380
Now that you mention it,
that's a good question...

477
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,530
That is a good question.

478
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,470
That's a good question.

479
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,740
Hakamada Law Office

480
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,740
I don't want to. This is wrong.

481
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,180
Refuse all you want.

482
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,250
But what would your husband
say if he saw these pictures?

483
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,020
Please...

484
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,120
I can hand the photos out
to your neighbors, too.

485
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,940
Please, don't!

486
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,620
All right, then get on
your knees like always.

487
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,020
Come on. Se—

488
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,040
"Se"...

489
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,000
You're so loud!

490
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,600
What time do you think it is?

491
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,220
Umemoto-san.

492
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,820
What are you doing here at this hour?

493
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,420
I got so bored,

494
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,450
I started watching the forbidden fifth season.

495
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,240
Of what?

496
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:22,180
"Iron Spy Woman Marilyn,"
the greatest series in history.

497
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,650
Watch one episode and
you're hooked to the end.

498
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,570
It's the forbidden fruit.

499
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,710
This is bad.

500
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,650
We're in a crisis here.

501
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,530
I'll take a rain check
on that cherry pie.

502
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,400
Oh. Can you make us some coffee?

503
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,320
Sure.

504
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,500
But same to you, Sensei.
Why are you here so late?

505
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,940
I was examining the audio recording evidence.

506
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,780
Oh yeah. That's the creepy
one I've been hearing.

507
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,570
In this drama-freak's opinion,

508
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,320
it's a bad script.

509
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,590
It's not scripted.

510
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,760
The situation was real.

511
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,180
Not a chance.

512
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,190
It's obvious they're reading lines.

513
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,960
The guy actor especially.

514
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,700
Does it sound that way to you?

515
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:17,710
A high school drama club
could do it better.

516
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,500
Drama club...

517
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,040
Excuse me.

518
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,480
Oh, Kiyomi-san.

519
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,560
Good morning.

520
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,790
Is Hakamada-sensei here?

521
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,080
He's not here yet.

522
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,680
I'll call him.

523
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,970
Hello, Sensei?

524
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,500
Where are you?

525
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,420
I'm doing a little research.

526
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,150
Kodera Kiyomi-san is at the office.

527
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,220
Hakamada-sensei.

528
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,710
I asked my husband about the threats.

529
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,010
How did it go?

530
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,990
He said he never made them.

531
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:06,130
May I have a copy of
the audio recording, too?

532
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,030
I'm going to let my husband hear it.

533
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,860
That won't be necessary.

534
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,610
What?

535
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:15,370
There are some things I need to
ascertain before the next hearing.

536
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,870
Court of Law

537
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,230
The fourth oral proceedings

538
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,700
This is the threatening
email Fumiya-san sent.

539
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:30,420
In 3,000 words he states
that he'll destroy my family

540
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,750
if I don't continue seeing him.

541
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,270
Your Honor.

542
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,110
Proceed.

543
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:46,990
Are you sure this email
was sent by Fumiya-san?

544
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,700
The sender's email is Fumiya-san's.

545
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,760
Understood.

546
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,830
Thank you very much.

547
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,670
Is that all?

548
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,170
Yes. It's more than enough.

549
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,940
Your Honor, if I may?

550
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,480
Proceed.

551
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:27,310
Can we replay the audio recording which
has been presented to the court?

552
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,230
Come on. Let's get started.

553
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,040
I don't want to. This is wrong.

554
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,520
Refuse all you want.

555
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,460
But what would your husband
say if he saw these pictures?

556
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,290
Please...

557
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:47,350
I can hand the photos out
to your neighbors, too.

558
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,050
Please, don't!

559
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,180
Then get on your knees like always.

560
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,630
Come on. Se—

561
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,240
Upon examination of the audio recording,

562
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:06,510
there was no sign of
fabrication or editing.

563
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:12,230
Clearly, the voices are those
of Fumiya-san and Yuko-san.

564
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:16,100
However, there is
something dubious about it.

565
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,880
Therefore, to clear my doubts,

566
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,980
I ask for the defendant's cooperation.

567
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,350
What?

568
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,390
Please read from this script.

569
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,230
Here.

570
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,970
Here goes.

571
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Come on. Let's get started.

572
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,380
I don't want to. This is wrong.

573
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,810
Could you read it with more emotion?

574
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:58,620
You were active in high school
drama club, after all.

575
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,730
Come on.

576
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,580
Think of this place as the stage.

577
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,390
Let's go.

578
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,740
Come on, let's get started.

579
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,140
I don't want to. This is wrong.

580
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,270
Refuse all you want.

581
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,340
But what would your husband
say if he saw these photos?

582
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,430
Please...

583
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:27,200
I can hand the photos out
to your neighbors, too.

584
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,390
Please, don't.

585
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,350
All right, then get on
your knees like always.

586
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,260
Come on. Se—

587
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,850
All right, then get on
your knees like always.

588
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,760
Come on. Se—

589
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,430
...n-s-e-i.

590
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,530
Next.

591
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,570
"Sensei"?

592
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,970
Oh, happy day,

593
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:57,650
for the pompous sensei
to show his true colors.

594
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,220
My apologies.

595
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,370
I got carried away with the play.

596
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:12,090
This in fact is a script from
a high school drama club

597
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:15,160
After School Humiliation

598
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:15,160
Fumiya-san and Yuko-san were in.

599
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,730
I borrowed it from
Yuko-san's alma mater.

600
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,560
It's an erotic comedy tour de force,

601
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,710
in which high school students take
revenge on a spartan female teacher.

602
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:32,100
Quite a provocative scenario
for a high school drama club.

603
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,450
The dubious aspect is this.

604
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,890
Kazuya: "Come on, let's get started"
Yukie: "I don't want to, this is wrong."

605
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:40,890
The audio recording presented as
evidence and the script...

606
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,060
are absolutely identical.

607
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:48,800
Yuko-san and Fumiya-san were
high school classmates.

608
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,810
They were also in the drama club together.

609
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,210
According to Fumiya-san's statement,

610
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:00,870
conjuring their past
would make them hot.

611
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:03,620
Memories of our drama class
days came back to us...

612
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,180
and we got crazy hot with
each other that day.

613
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,610
The two of you had the script on hand...

614
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,190
and while recalling fond memories...

615
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,860
the two of you reenacted
the play, thus the audio.

616
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,500
That's not—

617
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,860
Listen, Yuko-san.

618
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,620
The audio recording and the
threatening email

619
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,320
can easily be proven false.

620
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:40,260
By the way, you will
be penalized for fraud,

621
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:45,880
for having fabricated evidence
to avoid a monetary lawsuit.

622
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,020
You'd be digging your own grave

623
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,860
if you were to persist any further.

624
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,290
We rest our case.

625
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,490
Court of Law

626
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:23,860
Judgment day

627
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,330
All rise!

628
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,880
Bow.

629
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,730
Be seated.

630
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,060
I will now render my verdict.

631
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:46,010
The court has decided that there
was indeed an illicit affair

632
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:57,490
between defendant, Togawa Yuko, and
plaintiff's husband, Kodeara Fumiya.

633
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:11,700
Hence, the defendant is ordered to
pay two million yen to the plaintiff.

634
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,110
All right!

635
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,340
You won, Kiyomi!

636
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,580
Hakamada-sensei.

637
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,910
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

638
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,100
No.

639
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,630
You're the one had had to endure it.

640
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:39,630
For now, I'm relieved about
the judge's decision.

641
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,460
I didn't know what was going to happen

642
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,500
when she brought up the threats.

643
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,470
I wasn't worried at all.

644
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:54,320
It's more difficult to prove that
an adulterous affair did not happen.

645
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,120
The compensation fee
might have been less,

646
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,660
had she confessed to it from the outset.

647
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,390
Is that right?

648
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,640
If there was even a little confession,

649
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,150
the court might show mercy
and decrease the amount.

650
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,540
But Yuko-san destroyed
that chance, all by herself.

651
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,670
Good job, Kiyomi.

652
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,850
Darling.

653
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,410
Congratulations.

654
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,660
Did you see the look on Yuko's face?

655
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,480
It made me feel good.

656
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,020
But you only get two million
for all that work, huh?

657
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,980
You deserve more, don't you?

658
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,110
Please don't worry.

659
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:43,050
Kiyomi-san is due for more compensation.

660
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,560
Seriously?

661
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,400
How does that work?

662
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:49,420
I'm glad I cooperated.

663
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,940
I'm glad you had such a
fine attorney on your side.

664
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,450
Darling.

665
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,810
This is for you.

666
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,890
What's that?

667
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,370
Divorce agreement?

668
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,050
Divorce Agreement

669
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,780
I am divorcing you.

670
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,180
What?

671
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,850
Didn't I tell you?

672
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,740
I was going to divorce
you from the start.

673
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,030
So, darling.

674
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:19,000
Will you compensate me?

675
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,270
Compensate you?

676
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,660
Wait a second!

677
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,370
I cooperated with you.

678
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,240
Were you tricking me?

679
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,210
The nerve.

680
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,310
After all your cheating,

681
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:33,480
after all blaming
it all on the mistress,

682
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,920
after all the boasting you did
about the steamy details...

683
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,420
Did you think we could go
back to the way we were?

684
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:52,030
Here's the statement proving all
of your adulterous activities.

685
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,170
Statement

686
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,670
When the affair started.

687
00:39:54,670 --> 00:40:00,640
The number of times of
physical relations.

688
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:06,080
You even stamped and signed it.

689
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:13,500
Not even a fine attorney of my
caliber could counter this.

690
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:23,550
Computing the compensation fee,
it comes out to three million.

691
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,930
That's about the size of it.

692
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,950
Three million?

693
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,540
This is a joke, right, Kiyomi?

694
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,970
Have mercy.

695
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,450
Wasn't it you who said that an offender

696
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:42,650
should pay for it,
through and through?

697
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,160
By the way, you can
pay it in installments.

698
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,760
Sensei, you were always going to make
the husband pay, too, weren't you?

699
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,510
It's the law, that if the
entire sum of the compensation

700
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:15,120
were taken from the
spouse's illicit partner,

701
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,040
we cannot sue the other party.

702
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,360
Then how were you able
to sue Fumiya-san?

703
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,720
If there is a divorce, then
compensation is higher.

704
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:31,330
Compensation for illicit affairs

705
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:31,330
Compensation is higher when there is a divorce.

706
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,090
I presented the case to
the court on the premise

707
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:38,000
that the couple are
not getting a divorce.

708
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,600
So I was able to sue Fumiya-san
for the difference.

709
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:47,110
3 million yen (compensation fee) - 2 million yen (Yuko's suit) = 1 million yen

710
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:47,110
Lawsuit to husband Fumiya

711
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,610
I hope Kiyomi-san was satisfied.

712
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:52,450
She got compensation from her
obnoxious husband and partner both.

713
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,290
I wonder about that.

714
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,630
What?

715
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:06,110
At least we got what we could.

716
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,530
Um, Sensei?

717
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,040
Yes?

718
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:17,840
Why are you a divorce lawyer?

719
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,280
Oh, the bread's ready.

720
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,480
It's pickles bread.

721
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,290
