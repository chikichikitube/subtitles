1
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,980
I didn't think there'd be a second episode of this

2
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,160
11 months ago, I gave those bastards a heavenly punishment

3
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,520
I thought that would be enough to set them straight,
But those bastards haven't learned their lesson

4
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,640
Do you know who I mean by "bastards"?

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,640
The same 4 idiots from Gaki no Tsukai

6
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,000
Those bastards...

7
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,240
ARE WORTH LESS THAN TRASH

8
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,220
Today... I shall bring the wrath of the heavens upon them again

9
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,760
Timed & Typeset by Kedomas
Translation by senor_wristband

10
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,230
Starting with this moron, the idiot Hamada

11
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:34,720
11 months ago I gave him a good lesson...He didn't learn a thing!

12
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,900
The theme is, an impression in the style of Furutachi Ichiro

13
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,520
Oh no!

14
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:51,080
So this is Jiji-nuki, it's a game like Baba-nuki where you pair up cards,
And near the end,

15
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,800
You were looking at my cards the whole time right?

16
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Stop doing that Tanaka!

17
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,640
When I said "This one" you were just straight up looking at them like this

18
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,600
Did you see that?

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,640
The Idiot Hamada says "You were peeking right" straight away

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,240
Stop peeking!!

21
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,560
He kept repeating it! See he said it again

22
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,770
You were peeking so hard

23
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,280
Stop glancing at them

24
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,240
There again!

25
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,880
So while I was playing Jiji-nuki that bastard beside me kept repeating that

26
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,360
He's like a small dog that loves to bark

27
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,960
He's a Chihuahua! A Yorkshire Terrier! A Pomeranian!

28
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,640
THIS IS WHAT HE REALLY LOOKS LIKE THOUGH!

29
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,360
So starting from Hosei-san, pick a card

30
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,520
From Matsumoto-san right? Ok

31
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
Hmm? Oh right

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,120
Oh I got one! Right away

33
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,400
BB Queen - Dancing Ponpokurin

34
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,460
BB Queen right?

35
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,160
Matsumoto-san just needs to get this one right?

36
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,160
Yes, exactly, yes...

37
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,520
That's the order...

38
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,670
That's not right...

39
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,670
Eh?

40
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,240
Hosei-san just took one now right?

41
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Endo will take from Hosei-san now

42
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Oh right, I got the order wrong is all

43
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,180
It's Tanaka's fault right?!

44
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,450
Furthermore, during a different theme...

45
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,320
Tanaka you better get this one

46
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,440
No no , that's too difficult

47
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,020
Yes, I had this card

48
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,790
That's wrong! You messed up!

49
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,790
EH?!

50
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,360
Give that back to Yama-chan, and then Tanaka take it from Hamada-san

51
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,130
Who the hell is this guy?

52
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,360
This was Tanaka's fault

53
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,500
*clicks tongue*

54
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,160
He said it very clearly. He said it clearly just now

55
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,200
What the hell man

56
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,000
The game itself is complicated to keep up with

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,920
So hearing them
Nag & Nag & Nag & Nag & Nag & Nag

58
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,340
It just confuses me! Who the fuck was that guy from the staff? Holding things up

59
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,720
The staff are scared of Hamada, they just go along with him

60
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,000
They're corrupted by Hamada

61
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,800
Today, I shall make a clear declaration,

62
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,530
I SHALL NEVER PLAY JIJI NUKI AGAIN

63
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:32,360
This is "Easy to Win Beach Volleyball",
The aim is to win by 100 points

64
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,400
Alright!

65
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,840
What's with that sloppy attitude?! YOU'RE SLOPPY!

66
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,120
Are you gonna play or not? Which is it? ARE YOU GONNA PLAY?!

67
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,920
I'll play!

68
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,280
I'll play, I-i'll...

69
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,600
The guy on the other team's bench is angry... Is everything alright?

70
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,720
They could just all get along...This is like power hasrassment

71
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,640
OI!!

72
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,510
Fifi was worried for me right? She said it was "like power harassment"

73
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,040
When his switch flips,

74
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,720
He just becomes un-understandable, he just won't stop

75
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,280
You know what?

76
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,240
Like...Um...Get Yoshimoto to fire him

77
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,720
DISMISS DISMISS DISMISS

78
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,360
DISMISS HIM

79
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,360
He's too backwards for In age where TV has to adhere to compliance

80
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
He can't understand this era

81
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,940
I heard...that guy came out with a song?

82
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,760
WOW WAR TONIGHT ~ Sometimes we create a Movement

83
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,840
"Sometimes like this" - Shut the fuck up!

84
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,440
"Just a little bit-" Shut the fuck up!

85
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,560
Impossible Impossible Impossible Impossible!

86
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,780
How are you gonna create a movement?!
You're corrupted by movement

87
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,200
And his partner is a piece of work too...

88
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,600
The next battle - Wake up! World Record! Slimy Climbing!

89
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,960
This was an episode where everything was slimy, well just watch,

90
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,920
And the point was to get over that height

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Poof

92
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,920
He just farted

93
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,440
(Everyone) That's so embarassing!

94
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,680
OI! You just farted now right?!

95
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,840
(Background) No farting!

96
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,410
That guy loves farts

97
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,560
He loves farts, asses, and shit!

98
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,200
So he will always notice right away

99
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,490
He'll immediately turn to face the fart

100
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,320
Even though he's almost 60!

101
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,440
He loves farts!

102
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,800
(Narrator) Which Gaki member does Toru Muranishi think is the filthiest?

103
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,360
So this was the 100 Quiz for Toru Muranishi

104
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,400
Tanaka-kun seems like he has a lot of stuff to clean off his di

105
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,160
Ahh, he has a dirty dick?

106
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,600
He did

107
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,560
So he's talking about dick cheese?

108
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,400
Ahh I see. That's a proper insult.

109
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,360
Yeah for real!

110
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,760
Which Gaki member does Toru want to swap places with?

111
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,520
This question, he answers who

112
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,760
Tanaka-san

113
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,360
He said me

114
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,640
He has a normal personality, he's a normal person

115
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,660
A normal guy with too much dick cheese?

116
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,920
No need to bring it up again

117
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,500
A guy with a normal personality

118
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,760
And because of that you don't clean your smegma

119
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,580
That guys loves dick cheese too

120
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,320
Farts, asses, shit, dick cheese

121
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,840
That guy loooves dirty jokes

122
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,960
Even though he knows they have to bleep it out, he kept saying it!

123
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,400
He might have big muscles,

124
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,320
But his brain is all shrivled up

125
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,760
Which Gaki member does Toru think is filthiest?

126
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,520
This question comes up everytime, and I'm not satisified with this happening everytime

127
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,280
Endo and I didn't back down

128
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,280
Yes, I just has to be Tanaka I think

129
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,000
This bastard...Whenever this question comes up he always writes my name

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,920
He never once thought about something different
He alwaaaays writes the same thing

131
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,560
That's why all he can ever do is Ho-Ho-Hoi

132
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,990
What the hell is Ho-Ho-Hoi

133
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,920
It's not funny at all...

134
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:52,640
There was one other guy,
I forgot about that useless guy

135
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,520
That Rakugka from Naniwa

136
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,760
That guy, for the "I think you like this item" series,
For an accessory for Shiraku-shisho,

137
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,460
This is what he chose

138
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,920
Yup it's funny that's it get rid of it
get rid of it

139
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:21,140
The Fuji Soba incident...

140
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,280
Is that a Fuji Soba? The place near Bancho

141
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,320
On NTV Road

142
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,520
Yeah NTV road

143
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,600
This is NTV road right?

144
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,520
That right?

145
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,320
Yes, either down the hill or on the way down I think, right around there,

146
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,040
Almost there

147
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,200
Here?

148
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,680
Here! That one!

149
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,600
It's a Yudetaro...

150
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,330
I've messed up...

151
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,480
Tanaka where are you?

152
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,920
I thought of everyone so I went to the one near the studio in Kojimachi,

153
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,900
Kojimachi?

154
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,040
Yes

155
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,840
But I ended up at a Yudetaro...

156
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,220
I see we should have changed the card and gone to Yudetaro

157
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,360
Just as Matsumoto said.
Just come to Yudetaro

158
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Those guys never shut up about this either
"You went to Yudetaro!" ... "You went to Yudetaro that time!"

159
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,840
So many so many so often so often they never shut up about it

160
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,560
It's a Soba store, it's a standing soba store

161
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,500
Just think of it as the same!

162
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,210
Come ... to Yudetaro

163
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,480
This time too,

164
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,180
Time time too ... Those 4 idiots ... I want to give them a heavenly punishment!

165
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,680
First Ever on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arrahende Chiki Chiki

166
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,560
Bet your life on this one sip, KIKI Canned Coffee!!

167
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,960
Alright!

168
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,040
This is the 44th one

169
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,000
Fourty four this time

170
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,280
You don't drink this stuff?

171
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,760
I don't really drink it that often, it's too sweet

172
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,560
You don't like sweet drinks? Tanaka you don't drink it?

173
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Yeah I wonder

174
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,120
I've never really seen him drinking it

175
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,220
But I think he might drink it the most out of all of us

176
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,440
Canned coffee?

177
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,860
I think now I shall bring down heavenly punishment on these 4 idiots

178
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,360
Who's going first? Shozo will you go?

179
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,560
Can I? Alright

180
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,320
Go to the front

181
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,540
It's canned coffee...

182
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Oh no

183
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,640
This seems like a tricky one

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,080
The one chosen for Endo is a smooth tasting canned coffee

185
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,790
Alright then

186
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,430
I've drunk this one before

187
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,360
Really?

188
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,000
Eh?

189
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,200
Are you done now?

190
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,560
Yes, I should be good

191
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,800
Alright then

192
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,800
Damn, I think i've drunk this one before

193
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,820
Alright excuse me, I'll get started with this then

194
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,920
"Beat Black"?

195
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,800
I feel like it's not the one

196
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,160
It's not?

197
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,000
Well the smell is just as important as the taste

198
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,840
Yeah

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,400
I can tell

200
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,400
For real?

201
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,040
It's different?

202
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,200
It's totally different!

203
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,300
Totally different?

204
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,480
Really?

205
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,240
The one I drank was not Beat Black

206
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,240
Wow!

207
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,000
I think we can tell - Well it's only been 1

208
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,920
Well well well yes

209
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,000
Ehh? Hold on what should I do

210
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,320
You start to lose your sense of taste

211
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,160
If I touch it I have to drink it right?

212
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,800
Yes if you touch it

213
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,280
Yeah if you touch it

214
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,920
It's canned coffee, so the smell might be hard to discern

215
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,160
Alright here I go

216
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,240
Matsumoto-san, I can tell.
Hosei-san, I can tell

217
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,600
Oh really?

218
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,960
It's wrong! This is totally different!

219
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:39,400
The one I drank...

220
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,400
This one, was not Beat

221
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,600
Alright alright alright

222
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,400
You can really tell?

223
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,640
If I get this I win 100,000 yen...

224
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,560
Actually they're all Beat aren't they? Beat Black...

225
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah they chose a lot of Beat ones

226
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,120
This is a Beat special

227
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,480
Here I go

228
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,880
Are you starting to lose confidence?

229
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,440
You're starting to lose confidence right?

230
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,920
Yeah he might be

231
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,120
Ah but this one is dangerous!

232
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,200
This is where you gotta decide!

233
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,760
Indeed!

234
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,680
Hold on! Is this it?

235
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,760
It's not it right?...

236
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,360
Can you really do this?

237
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,840
What do you wanna do?

238
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,280
Do your best!

239
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,160
What should I do

240
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,880
You can do it!

241
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,600
This is so hard!

242
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,840
No way, this is only the 3rd one

243
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,440
Yeah, you don't want to take too much time

244
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,480
Alright, excuse me

245
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,080
The one I drank, was not Beat special

246
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,360
You're doing pretty well

247
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,440
Yes, I am

248
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,200
4, 6, I've cleared 7

249
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,520
Alright

250
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,360
Anytime now I should get

251
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,160
Damn really?

252
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,680
Now that you've come that far you gotta win

253
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,280
Yeah

254
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,800
Yes

255
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,200
C'mon clear them Endo

256
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,800
Do your best

257
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,760
Yes indeed

258
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,680
The one I drank was not Black Morning

259
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,920
Wow!

260
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,920
Alrighty

261
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,000
That was close!

262
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,000
Too close!

263
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,720
Hot!

264
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,360
C'mon hurry up Endo

265
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,480
OK

266
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,440
Endo!

267
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,320
Don't waste time like that, you have that habit

268
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,040
I've never drank these ones before

269
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,800
Go ahead

270
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,080
Do your best

271
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,680
Thank you

272
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,840
Here I go

273
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,920
Alright go!

274
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,880
Ahhhh...
The one I drank was,

275
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,680
Do it!

276
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,280
Endo!

277
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,760
"Time Premium"

278
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,720
Endo!

279
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,480
Endo! Hurry!

280
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,280
Hurry!

281
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,760
Was not it!

282
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,080
ENDO!!!

283
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,240
ALRIGHT!

284
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,560
ENDO

285
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,200
ENDOOOOO

286
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Alright! Thank you!

287
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,560
OK!

288
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,960
Thank you!

289
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,800
Alright, I'm kinda happy about this

290
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:56,280
The one I drank was not Cafe Choice Coffee...

291
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,840
Seriously?

292
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,680
It was that one?

293
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,240
Damn, what the hell is this?

294
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,720
Hold on hold on

295
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,720
This is scary...

296
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,040
Don't just do Ho-Ho-Hoi!

297
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,600
What is this?! I'm scared!

298
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,280
That hurt!

299
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,520
The next one... Can you go please?

300
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,240
Yeah, c'mon clear this one

301
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,520
Oh yeah

302
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,480
This feels kinda wet...well whatever

303
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,120
We've decided

304
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,520
Hamada-san here you go

305
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,160
The smell first

306
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,120
The smell comes first

307
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,120
First remember the smell...

308
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,960
The smell is pretty important

309
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,920
Hamada...

310
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,640
Oh? Is it that bad?

311
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,360
The smell is important

312
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,280
What's this fancy one?

313
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,160
Sorry?

314
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,120
What's this fancy one?

315
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,840
It's probably one of the expensive ones

316
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,160
Yeah the most expensive one

317
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,680
How is it?

318
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,720
How is it?

319
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,880
Hamada?

320
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,200
Hamada-san cut it out

321
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,240
Keep going Hamada

322
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,560
I-

323
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,040
I-

324
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,520
I-

325
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,080
I-

326
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,360
this-

327
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,920
What'd you say?

328
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,000
I-

329
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,800
You know this whole time,

330
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,040
I've had like, a head, a head-

331
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,400
This is way closer than the last one

332
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,700
Damn this is a tough one!

333
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,680
dAmN tHiS iS a toUgh OnE!

334
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,240
Is it this one?

335
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,120
iS iT thIs ONe

336
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,200
"is it this one"

337
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,760
Should I bet on this?

338
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,440
Oh will you?

339
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,040
I think even If I think about it...

340
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,680
Do your best. Alright!

341
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,920
The one I drank was this canned coffee!

342
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,590
That sucks...

343
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,040
I got it wrong huh...

344
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,120
You'll never get another advertisement for canned coffee!

345
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,560
Ow!

346
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,280
Alright

347
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,240
This one is too hard

348
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,240
Now they should behave

349
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,850
Alright let's go

350
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,800
That's a wrap!

351
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,120
I'm very sorry!

352
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,340
The Bazooka was terrifying

353
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,560
I was saying "Ow"

354
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,920
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You told me that last time too.

355
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,680
You said that last time too

356
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,920
I had no idea what to do

357
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,400
Yeah, I'm sorry about that

358
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,120
How was it Tanaka-san?

359
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,080
Just...So unfortunate

360
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,480
This is so unfortunate

361
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,120
You slipped on the stand

362
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,400
I slipped

363
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,760
That was dangerous

364
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:43,040
Matsumoto-san was there, so I grabbed his shoulders

365
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,920
He was soooo stable. Like a rock.

366
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,600
I thought "What a reliable guy"

367
