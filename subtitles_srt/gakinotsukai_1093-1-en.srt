00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,470
Freeze King Grand Prix!

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:15,050
It's a competition to see how well you can freeze without blinking and without being noticed by your target while eating.

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,620
Three teams entered this last week.

4
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,870
Matsumoto will judge them on each of the five sections to see how well they did.

5
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,870
This Double Freeze is a Extremely Freeze, so to speak.

6
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:47,910
Tonight, the remaining three teams will take on the challenge, and the Freeze King will finally be decided.

7
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,680
The next challenger, come on!

8
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,000
Why did you take this job?

9
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,510
Didn't your manager freeze?

10
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,480
I love pranks, and I said so many times that I wanted to be in this.

11
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,710
I think you are insane to think this is a prank.

00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:35,460
[Subbed by RAIDEN1017]

13
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,630
The Freeze Girl who defies conventions.
Rola.
Here we go!

14
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,540
Hi!
Good evening, I'm Rola!
What's up?  I'm doing well!

15
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,910
Who are you talking to?

16
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,450
Everyone, watch me! I'm definitely going to win

17
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,050
I think this is the piece of cake!
Okay, bye-bye!

18
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,750
- She's always on the move, isn't she?
- Yeah!

19
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,560
Her targets are her good friends, Yoshiizaki-san, a hair stylist, and Imamura-san, a fashion stylist.

20
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,530
She was waiting for her target at a restaurant.

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,240
Hey, why are they using this footage?

22
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:23,280
She is so excitable even when she is alone.
How will this affect her freeze?

23
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,380
Hair stylist Yoshizaki-san arrived.

24
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,490
Next, Imamura-san, the fashion stylist, arrived.

25
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,190
Rola's plan is to set up immediately after the toast.

26
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,930
Cheers!

27
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,070
- What's her private life like?
- I've never seen it before.

28
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,200
Tasty!

29
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,110
- Are you sure you don't have a boyfriend, Imamura-chan?
- It's not that I don't, it's just that I can't.

30
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,410
How about *****-san?

31
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,310
He's gay.

32
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,280
I just found out recently that *****-san is not gay.

33
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,880
- He is gay.
- He's bisexual, isn't he?

34
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,190
- What's that?
- He can go for both.

35
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,560
Is that so? That's creepy.

36
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,860
You're just talking aimlessly.

37
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,700
Fifteen minutes passed without her freezing up.

38
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,430
More girl talk ensued.

39
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,400
This is delish!

40
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,000
I should have brought my dog today.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,310
- I should have done the same. You can bring your dog here.
- Is that right?

42
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,410
Maybe.

43
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,110
She's always on the move.

44
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,120
She's so into girl talk that she never freezes up.

45
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,560
So the staff sent her a text to warn her.

46
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,030
Are you serious?

47
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,060
Then Rola finally started moving.

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,470
What would you like to order?

49
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,970
Takoyaki!

50
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,010
That's the first one.

51
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,380
You're not drinking any plum wine.

52
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,110
Don't do that. Have some plum wine.

53
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,850
You're frozen.

54
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,220
She didn't get caught?

55
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,890
Rola's nostrils are open.

56
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,590
Don't be ridiculous!

57
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,530
She should go on the offensive from here in one go.
But...

58
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,740
- I wonder who would be a good match for you.
- I don't know anyone among the people I know.

59
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,740
- How about *****-san?
- He has a girlfriend.

60
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,410
Is it going to end after just one time?

61
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,550
- Surely that's not the case.
-  I'm certain she will do many more from now on.

62
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,350
- He might have a lot of flaws.
- Yeah, he might be very careless.

63
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,860
When I met him the other day, there was a hole in his sock.

64
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,160
I don't care about the content of your chatter!

65
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,230
Rola is completely absorbed in her chatter

66
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,200
Hi.

67
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,100
Since she shows no signs of freezing, the staff hastily calls her on the phone.

68
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,040
She is just eating her dinner for free.

69
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,610
He politely explained the purpose to her again.

70
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,950
How will reflective Rola freeze?

71
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,450
Have you reflected on it?

72
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,620
- Then I'll introduce you to a good man.
- Really?

73
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,030
How about Gushiken-san?

74
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,430
I prefer someone a bit younger.

75
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,300
It finally started.

76
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,970
Why did you freeze at that moment?

77
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,010
You're completely caught!

78
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,210
"Why did you freeze at that moment?"

79
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,050
You're completely caught!

80
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,250
She froze as if to say, 'Please look at me.’

81
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,620
Is she still doing it?

82
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,790
She's already been ignored.

83
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,620
They think she is an idiot.

84
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:09,300
She tried her best in her own way, but she was already drunk and showed no signs of freezing.

85
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,540
Are you serious?

86
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,940
The staff called her, but she was completely oblivious to the phone, so they were at a loss.

87
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,120
Now's your chance!

88
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,750
She blinked.

89
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,690
That’s terrible!

90
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,360
Rola, you're terrible at this!

91
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,430
Was this song played on the second day of the event?

92
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,130
No.

93
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,700
You are being ignored by them.

94
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,970
And 'BEAST', which wasn't on the first day either.

95
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,440
Oh, really? I wanted to see it!

96
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,010
That's a lie.

97
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,610
Don't say weird things.

98
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,080
If you say that, I'll eat takoyaki.

99
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,980
You're bad at this!

100
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,750
It was Rola!!

101
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,590
Bye-bye!

102
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,530
Bye-bye.

103
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,330
It was difficult.

104
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,530
Rola, they called you and explained everything, didn't they?

105
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,540
But I forgot.

106
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,340
So I'll do better next time.

107
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,670
“Next time”!?

108
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,710
This doesn't happen frequently.

109
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,010
There won't be a next time.

110
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,710
Matsumoto-san, please evaluate her.

111
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,450
This is terrible.

112
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,980
That was terrible.

113
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,390
This is still on the better side.

114
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,520
The category in which I want to give you the highest score is 'Discomfort.'

115
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,590
However, there is no such evaluation category.

116
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,530
It was funny that you introduced Gushiken-san to her.

117
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,670
That has nothing to do with the freeze.

118
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,140
The next challenger, come on!

119
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,320
Why are you next, Diamond Yukai?

120
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,360
I know the audience didn't see it, but you tripped on the stairs, didn't you?

121
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,560
Yukai-san, what did you think of the VCR so far?

122
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,430
A rock 'n' roller like me is a terrible liar.

123
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,870
If possible, could you speak a little more up front?

124
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,540
You're always so close.

125
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,180
Freeze Fighter with Ultra Hardness.
Here we go!

126
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:43,220
His targets are Mori-san, the stage manager for his gigs, and Yamamoto-san, the new manager who has recently been put in charge of Yukai.

127
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,360
Yukai's plan is to set him up when he breaks the disposable chopsticks.

128
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,940
- Mori-san, please take a seat in the back of the room.
- It's been a while.
- Hi, I'm already drinking.

129
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:07,950
This time, Yukai invited the two targets, with the cooperation of manager Ogura, for a dinner meeting that doubled as a planning session for his 50 yeas old  anniversary live concert.

130
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,590
When he breaks the disposable chopsticks...

131
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,720
Huh? It's already started?

132
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,960
You look very tired. Are you all right?

133
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,560
I'm fine.

134
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,300
Before freezing, Yukai made sure to express to them that he was tired.

135
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,000
I see.

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,070
Giracci!!
(*This is a call invented by Yukai.)

137
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,640
"Giracci"?

138
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,280
[Yukai is drinking non-alcoholic beer to drive back to Sano, Tochigi Prefecture, where his home is located.]

139
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,510
I finally had a drink with you.

140
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,450
Once he breaks the chopsticks, his freeze begins.

141
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,060
Oh, is he going to freeze already?

142
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,690
He started right away.

143
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,530
He's a rock 'n' roller.

144
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,570
Yeah, that's good.

145
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,540
A good start.

146
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,280
This is unexpected.

147
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,020
He's hungry, but he did it at this point.

148
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,090
- Surprisingly long.
- Yeah, it's a good.

149
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,130
Are you tired? Are you okay?

150
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,700
- I haven't slept much lately.
- You should eat a lot of food.

151
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,900
The target interpreted the freeze as fatigue, because he was appealing that he was tired.

152
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,240
From this point on, Yucai began to freeze boldly.

153
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,280
My kids are cute.

154
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,780
Look.

155
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,020
Oh, twins.

156
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,080
- They are resemble to Yukai-san.｡
- Yeah.

157
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,460
No one is laughing.

158
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,330
They think you're a sketchy person.

159
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,600
You haven't been sleeping, poor thing.

160
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,070
It's important for the office to create artists who are too busy to sleep, right?

161
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,910
“You haven't been sleeping, poor thing.”

162
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,120
It's hard for me too because he's the father of twins.

163
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,590
I'll talk to my colleague about it.

164
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,360
I'll talk to him about your debilitating condition.

165
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,360
Mori-san was worried about Yukai's health and contacted an acquaintance.

166
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,600
But...

167
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,840
[Order button]

168
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,570
He sees Yukai-san's “symptoms”.

169
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,410
He has the look of someone who's into drugs.

170
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,780
What the hell are you saying to our talent?

171
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,550
- So he has managed to deceive them completely.
- That’s right.

172
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,990
You're not doing drugs, right?

173
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,730
That's not true! Come on!

174
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,400
In other words, his acting is convincing.

175
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,530
Yukai was under suspicion.

176
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,930
You've been told a terrible thing.

177
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:19,170
An hour had passed since the start. He went to the restroom.

178
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,810
He'll be worried if he leaves now.

179
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,010
You're really pushing yourself!

180
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,850
Hey, that's not good!

181
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,550
He'll die if he drives home.

182
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,760
He looks dead!

183
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,130
He looks dead!

184
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,030
And It’s a long time!

185
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,810
Allow me to say, that phenomenon of his is very dangerous.

186
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,310
- As his friend, I have to say that his condition looks dangerous.

187
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,340
He is serious about it.

188
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,510
The suspicion towards him continues to grow.

189
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,620
The mood is not good.

190
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,120
But Yukai didn't care about their worries.

191
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,100
Are you all right?

192
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,840
He is very worried!

193
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,140
He is very worried!

194
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,110
But it's funny.

195
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,990
Mori-kun, you wanna see my guitar?

196
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,660
(*His guitar is a Martin D-45.)

197
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,560
This guitar sounds great.

198
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,260
I'm going to pee.

199
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,530
Why did he go peeing at this point?

200
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,480
He's a rookie.

201
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,480
He's a newcomer, so he probably doesn't know what he should do.

202
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,360
“Why do I have to manage this guy?”

203
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,090
How on earth is he going to manage this man?

204
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:27,170
You should stay in Tokyo instead of going back to Sano.

205
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,570
I'll be fine.

206
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,700
It's dangerous.

207
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,880
You really shouldn't go back to Sano today.

208
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,180
That's funny.

209
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,950
He should not be allowed to leave.

210
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,190
Let's take a picture.

211
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,960
You don't get many chances to take pictures, do you?
I'll pass.

212
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,930
Why don't you take the picture without me?

213
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,130
Say cheese.

214
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,470
It's too long!

215
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,910
They're waiting for you!

216
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,580
They're waiting for you!!

217
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,510
It's so long!

218
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,720
Hey, are you okay?

219
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,990
We're going to have a meeting about Yutaka Tadokoro (Yuka's real name).

220
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,930
I'm telling you this as your friend, you didn't really do anything wrong, did you?

221
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,100
It was Diamond Yukai!

222
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,430
It's over.

223
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,540
It was pretty good.

224
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,870
It had a lot of power.

225
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,780
That was funny, Yukai-san.

226
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,150
But I was treated like a junkie.

227
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,950
You were very worried about them.

228
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,250
You almost got a perfect score.

229
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:02,730
The soulless feeling you had when you left the room was amazing.

230
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,900
I didn't expect the word "drugs" to be used so much on TV.

231
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,440
Now for the last challenger.

232
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
Yama-chan.

233
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,620
The flow is really good now.

234
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,660
I can show you the Extremely Freeze that Matsumoto-san mentioned earlier.

235
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,140
They are freezing!!

236
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,840
It's a double freeze!

237
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,980
Don't laugh!

238
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,550
You guys freeze too much.

239
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,390
Housei Yamasaki, the man who freezes laughter.
Here we go!

240
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:07,960
His targets are two guys whose careers are less than his, but who are his seniors in rakugo.

241
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,100
He is practicing.

242
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,670
He is well prepared.
He just waits for his targets to arrive.

243
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,450
Hi!

244
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,990
He has invited them for a dinner meeting to discuss the rakugo show.

245
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,650
Cheers!

246
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,460
Yamazaki's plan is to grab some hot sake and then start the freeze.

247
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,460
Don't you just want a drink?

248
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,200
This year marks the 100th anniversary of Yoshimoto.

249
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,470
The Great Yoshimoto Rakugo Festival?

250
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:58,740
So I want to do something with rakugo storytellers in Tokyo.

251
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,480
Hot sake was served to their table.

252
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,990
Finally, Yamazaki makes his move.

253
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,290
Let's be careful while drinking sake.
Cheers.

254
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,410
This is quite long

255
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,710
Suddenly, this is long.

256
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,150
The first freeze is long.

257
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,850
We don't do that in rakugo.

258
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,360
It's a joke to stop your body like that, isn't it?

259
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:54,500
He made the next freeze difficult because they saw the first freeze as a joke.

260
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,870
How many stories can you tell?

261
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:03,680
Almost 130.

262
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,380
I don't have as many as he does.

263
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,180
But you are already in the media.

264
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:17,690
I used to criticize the media.
To be honest, I used to criticize Hosei-san, too.

265
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,200
I didn't know anything about the TV industry at that time.

266
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,100
- Now?
- This is terrible.

267
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,570
This is the worst thing to do.

268
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,680
He must be testing the rakugo storyteller's reaction.

269
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,690
He couldn't freeze well.

270
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,000
As the drinks went down, the target started doing it too.

271
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:03,670
If I was going to FREEZE, I would do this.

272
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,970
You made him say the word “freeze.”

273
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,110
At this point, you've already failed.

274
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,680
Did he freeze you back in return?

275
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,420
- What is happening?
- They're just playing .

276
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,590
He's imitating Yamazaki.

277
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:36,840
The target, Kakitsu, also started to freeze.
The banquet turned into a messy game.

278
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,740
And...

279
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,680
How much hot sake did you drink?

280
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,780
About six bottles.

281
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,520
- This is terrible.
- This is a messy game.

282
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,330
This is a messy game.

283
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:10,000
- Is that okay?
- I guess you just have to make them laugh.

284
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,210
It was Hosei Yamasaki.

285
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,350
Yama-chan!

286
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,520
You were worse than Rola in some ways.

287
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,180
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha.

288
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,760
Please evaluate him.

289
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,820
I cannot evaluate him at all.

290
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,460
That was just a shit.

291
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,360
Did I poop?

292
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,030
This can't be on the air.

293
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,870
Gaki News!

294
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,010
The Downtown figure is very popular and is now available for pre-order!

295
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:56,110
This is your last chance.
The deadline for ordering Hamada figures is approaching!
See the official web site for more details!

296
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,590
Now, Matsumoto-san, please announce the winner!

297
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,520
Yes!

298
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,060
The winner is ...

299
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,390
- Come on!
- Come on!

300
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,440
I wondered what would happen if I did it now.

301
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,380
We are waiting for you.

302
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,110
You don't have to stand with the comedians, Yukai-san.

303
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,980
The winner is ...

304
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,780
Come on!

305
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,990
Diamond Yukai!!

306
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,430
You will receive the Freeze Trophy!

307
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,130
Congratulations!

308
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,610
You don't have to freeze anymore!

309
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,610
[Thank you to those who were inconvenienced]

310
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,180
Hi.

311
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,820
This is the Freeze King Grand Prix.
I have to freeze.

312
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,660
I don't get it at all.
What the hell is that show?

313
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,030
- This is Gaki no tsukai.
- Is it serious?

314
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,100
I had a feeling that something was off.

315
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,410
This is the Freeze King Grand Prix.

316
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,850
Was that an act?

317
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,880
Of course!

318
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,920
I was seriously worried about you!

319
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:52,960
- What is this?
- This is Gaki no tsukai.

320
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,900
This is a segment that just freezes.

321
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,910
Do you think what I did is funny?

322
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,610
I don't think so at all.

323
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,410
I don't know what it means.

324
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,780
