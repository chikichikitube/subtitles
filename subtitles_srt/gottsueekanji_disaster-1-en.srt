00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,730
Yoko-chan! Yoko-chan!!

4
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,830
What's wrong, Yoko-chan?

5
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:04,670
You can't sleep

6
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:05,470
You'll die

7
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,270
Yoko-chan!

8
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,370
Yoko-chan!!

9
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,370
If you sleep, you die! Yoko-chan!!

10
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,170
Yoko-chan!

11
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,210
Yoko-chan!!

12
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,240
Don't sleep!!

13
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,380
But...

14
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,380
It's been three days since we're lost...

15
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,980
It'll be ok, Yoko-chan

16
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,550
Someone will come and rescue us

17
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,320
So don't sleep!

18
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,590
Sleep equals death!

19
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,620
Yoko-chan!!

20
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,620
Wake up!

21
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,100
Something's coming

22
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,190
An helicopter

23
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,850
The sound of an helicopter!

24
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,220
Hey!!

25
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,220
We're here!

26
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,460
Rescue us!

27
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,460
I'm here to rescue you, get in!

28
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,760
Wha-?

29
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,550
Just get inside

30
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:56,780
Alright

31
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,780
Yoko-chan! Yoko-chan!!

32
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,890
You alright?

33
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,390
Yoko-chan!! Yok---

34
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,490
Man that's small

35
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,590
Quick, get inside!

36
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,400
A-alright

37
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,700
This is...

38
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,500
The clothes are in the way

39
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,200
Yoko-chan!

40
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,680
Just get inside!
- Yes!

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,610
There's no time to waste
- Y-yes

42
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,420
Alright, let's go!

43
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,620
You're not inside, get inside

44
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,920
I'm sorry

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,560
This... wait, how...?

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
How should I...?

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,900
How am I supposed to...?

48
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,380
Ok, you can go

49
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,310
You're not inside yet

50
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,010
What should I do?!

51
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,010
Let's take this
