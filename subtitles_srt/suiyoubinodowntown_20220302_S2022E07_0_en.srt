00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,450
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,180
Let's get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,340
First?

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,390
Who is it?

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,490
It's Kendo Kobayashi!  -Hello everyone

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:24,400
This time, I bring you the second instance of a project that was very popular

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,840
Really?
-Yes, it is this:

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,610
The 2nd survey on the best comments made by comedians to date

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,410
So its that
-This is it

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,550
This is highly anticipated exciting
-Do you remember it?

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,010
We've got some great participants this time
-Really?

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,590
They took part in a survey, so please take a look at the VTR
-Okay

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:50,160
So, a survey on what comedians think are the best comments made by other comedians, and,

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,440
No matter how much you don't like a certain food, as long as it is the best version of it, you'll acknowledge it's deliciousness

15
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,960
The 2nd survey on the best comments made by comedians to date

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,690
The first is Yamauchi

17
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,460
What is this photo!?

18
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,930
When I used to be on "Ametalk"

19
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:37,840
There was a section about artists who came to Tokyo but felt that they couldn't fit in

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,350
We were participating as a party that had integrated into Tokyo

21
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,920
I think I remember

22
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,220
The ones that couldn't fit in were Seshita and Plus Minus

23
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,020
The program made things difficult for those involved

24
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,090
Like suddenly asking them to eat very spicy dishes

25
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:01,030
To exceed the supposed limit of spice they could handle

26
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:08,810
Plus Minus's Iwahashi made an extremely accurate analogy about Seshita

27
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,880
So precise even that I would say it should be passed down by future generations

28
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,410
In my heart, it is the absolute first

29
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,640
Is that so?
-Told by future generations

30
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,420
Iwahashi's extremely accurate analogy is as follows

31
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,260
I saw this one

32
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,390
Go for it!
-Chance!!!

33
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,190
Chance!

34
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,420
Seshita's experiencing a crisis

35
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,030
What a weird face

36
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,500
He's become Sakurai!

37
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,170
This
-No, no, no, no.

38
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,310
Certainly accurate

39
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,950
It really was so precise

40
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,690
Indeed, it's exactly the same

41
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,650
When he made that face

42
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,760
Everyone laughed because the expression itself was funny

43
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,230
But when everyone was laughing, only Iwahashi-san

44
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,980
It adds another layer of meaning

45
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,960
Spoke up and said "He's become Sakurai"

46
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,980
Is it that accurate?

47
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,140
And indeed, he had become the same as Sakurai

48
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,250
He did become the same

49
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,070
In that moment when everyone was laughing

50
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,330
Someone piped up and said "He's become like Sakurai"

51
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,540
Everyone thought "That's true," and it made the atmosphere even more lively

52
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,150
In all honesty, because everyone was laughing so hard

53
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:29,650
Hamaya (his partner) thought he had said it

54
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,580
What happened?

55
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,090
He thought "Seeing the Sakurai-looking face caused the analogy to just come to me"

56
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,190
He thought he'd done a really good job

57
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,680
I'm scared, what is this?
-Scary, scary

58
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,570
I don't really know why, but when I heard him say that,

59
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,830
Why?

60
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,300
I thought "No, no, no, wasn't it me that said it?"

61
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,530
That's what everyone was thinking

62
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,440
After hearing the line "He's become like Sakurai"

63
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,870
I was also thinking "He's become like Sakurai"

64
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,140
An amazing phenomenon

65
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,940
Because it fit so well

66
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,580
So I thought I had said it too

67
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,950
Scary!

68
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,550
What an amazing phenomenon

69
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,420
But after watching the broadcast, I told Hamaya:

70
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,060
"Oh... Iwahashi said it..."

71
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,830
"Oh yeah... it was Iwahashi"

72
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,560
I see, I guess it's possible

73
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,000
I said "I'm really suprised it was Iwahashi..."

74
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,410
Can such a thing happen?
-Impressive

75
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,550
Next is the comment that Morita was most impressed by

76
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,970
About a year ago, on Wednesday Downtown

77
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:29,150
There was a theory called "The first B in BKB is 80% Super"

78
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,320
It involved me going out on location

79
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,920
In the studio part of the theory, Matsumoto said something

80
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,330
It made me think "Ah! As expected of Matsumoto Hitoshi!"

81
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,660
I don't remember at all

82
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,330
Morita was impressed by the following quote from Matsumoto

83
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,550
I remember
-Really?

84
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,440
The theory is...

85
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,090
BKB- Ah, sorry
-No problem, please

86
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,510
Hamada-san, is it okay?
-Of course, it's yours, after all

87
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,540
Is that so? I'm sorry

88
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,480
The last dumpling?

89
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,720
Can I eat this?

90
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,180
That's the one

91
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,010
This was really awesome

92
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,720
That's it!

93
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,440
I can understand this one

94
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,360
First of all, the speed at which he says "the last dumpling?"

95
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,110
The tone is very good

96
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,000
Such a quick retort

97
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,040
It's too fast

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,190
There's also the conciseness of the phrase that makes it so much more effective

99
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,770
This is essentially, to put it mildly

100
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,270
A bundle of politeness (over-politeness)

101
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,660
But if you just said "a bundle of politeness" straight

102
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,100
It could be a little confusing

103
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,880
Instead, he just said "the last dumpling?"

104
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,690
In such a concise sentence, a perfect interpretation is offered

105
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,160
And included "dumplings", as everyone knows the phrase "dumplings are always in abundance"

106
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:52,660
With this compact turn of phrase, there's a sense of speed and quality

107
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,610
This guy is so talkative!

108
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,670
Indeed, I think it's perfect

109
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,160
This is so embarrassing

110
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,840
It's a shame that its embarrassing

111
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,740
If you think about it, Matsumoto does this type of thing as much as possible

112
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,680
He provides these sort of statements in all sorts of settings

113
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,980
Not just on Wednesday Downtown but also Downtown DX

114
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,850
Even if the room has a weird atmosphere

115
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,320
All of a sudden he's able to cut in with a comment and lift everything

116
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,420
He's very strong in general fields

117
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,510
Strong in general fields

118
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,090
It may be rude to say, but regardless, it's the way I feel

119
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,560
What are you talking about?

120
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:32,050
Also, some of the guests in the same theory also left other strong comments

121
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,240
Say three words along the lines of the three initials: BKB

122
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,080
Junior, please let us hear your BKB

123
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,650
Eh?
-Say something that BKB stands for

124
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,670
In the face of Jinnai's sudden prompt, Junior's instant reaction is as follows

125
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,490
Junior, please let us hear your BKB

126
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,780
Eh?
-Say something that BKB stands for

127
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,330
Starting with BKB
-What the hell do you think?

128
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,630
At the wedding (bridal), I sang "Bitter Coke" and made people laugh
-Isn't that me?

129
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,820
How dare you do such a thing!
-That's awesome!

130
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,580
That's beautiful
-Amazing

131
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,950
Hey-ya!

-You can't end on "Hey-ya!"

132
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,770
Isn't that what happened? Isn't that when you say "Hey-ya"?

133
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,980
Junior's reply is also a real powerful

134
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,010
His reply was also very fast

135
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,350
I'm impressed he came up with the word "bridal"

136
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,620
I doubt BKB himself would think of the word "bridal"

137
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,810
Even the creator couldn't think of it

138
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,830
Next is the comment that Hamaya was most impressed by

139
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,330
I saw it on TV about a year or two ago

140
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,800
On "God Tongue"

141
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Daian appeared in a segment on the show

142
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,470
About after coming to Tokyo things were supposed to get better

143
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,270
Why is it always like this? That sort of segment

144
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,210
While everyone was giving their own opinions

145
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,410
Gekidan Hitori made a comment

146
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,680
It really made me laugh

147
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,550
It was so funny that I went back and watched it several times

148
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,250
Its the sort of thing that only Hitori could say

149
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,460
A very, very enjoyable comment

150
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,460
The comment by Gekidan Hitori that made Hamaya go back and watch it several times is as follows

151
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:09,470
Tsuda didn't think of using Nishizawa, did he?

152
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,220
You only care about yourself

153
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,240
I don't only care about myself
-You only think about yourself

154
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,300
No consideration at all for Nishizawa

155
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,210
That's true
-It's sad

156
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,250
What's "too sad"

157
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,680
You really have this all for me look on your face

158
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,800
That's not it!
-There's the long-awaited look

159
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,090
You've never felt he cared for, have you?
-Never

160
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,020
It feels like your struggling alone, right?
-It really does

161
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,820
Sometimes it really feels like I'm struggling alone

162
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,390
It's hard, isn't it?
-It's hard

163
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,090
Forget it, let's just kill Tsuda

164
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,700
Why!?

165
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,600
Why do I have to be killed on this show!?

166
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,170
This was really funny!

167
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,780
The phrase "let's kill him" really shows a complete lack of consideration for Tsuda

168
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,080
"Forget it, that's it, let's just kill him while we have the chance"

169
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,780
This sort of vibe is just too interesting

170
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,080
Its really frivolous, right?

171
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,640
As a proposed suggestion its just too frivolous, right?

172
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,020
"Why don't you sit down first?" It's this level of frivolity

173
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,290
"Why are we all standing? Let's sit down first" It's this level of emotion

174
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,910
It is indeed frivolous

175
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,100
This feeling really makes me laugh

176
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,800
Forget it, let's just kill Tsuda

177
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,400
Why!?

178
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,510
Why do I have to be killed on this show!?

179
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:26,710
Next is the comment that Hollywood Zakoshi was most impressed by

180
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,280
About 20 years ago

181
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,320
TBS had a show called "Gachikno!", right?

182
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:37,660
※A documentary variety show broadcast by TBS from April 1999 to July 2003

183
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,660
One of the projects was called "The Way of Sincere Manzai Talents"

184
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:44,000
All Kyojin appeared as a lecturer at one point

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,830
His comments were really unforgettable!

186
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,300
You're choosing such a well-known thing?

187
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,570
Eh, is it?

188
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,900
We all remember this

189
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,800
I don't remember

190
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,640
Really? It's that famous?

191
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,040
It was really like a bolt of lightning

192
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,580
It really was like rolling thunder

193
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,580
The comment, which struck like lightning, was as follows

194
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,860
It was indeed a shock

195
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,850
Take it from me

196
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,190
Unscrupulous people

197
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,380
I don't want them to become famous

198
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,830
I don't want people with bad attitudes to become famous

199
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,460
I just want some good people to get ahead

200
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,530
To remain

201
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,580
If you keep going this way, even if you stay until the end, nothing'll happen

202
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,070
You'll lose face

203
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,690
I guess you don't really know me

204
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,480
If you were my student

205
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,840
I'd PAN PAN ya!

206
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,420
※All Kyojin wrote in his book: I actually didn't mean to say that, I said "PAN PAN" because I meant "I want to beat you up" "if you don't do a good job I'll do it" and so on, it was probably a result of my own anger and excitement

207
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,420
This sentence is really too famous

208
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,690
So this is the source of the parody
-Yes

209
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,230
This, this is really great

210
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,030
I can basically understand the meaning of the words

211
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,400
"If you were my student, I'd PAN PAN ya!"

212
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,680
But the "PAN PAN" thing is...

213
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,000
The actual meaning is a total mystery

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,740
It can be considered to be incredibly imaginative

215
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,700
Indeed

216
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,980
I do think All Kyojin said it in this way deliberately

217
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,790
What the heck is PAN PAN

218
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,450
"Please use your own imagination to understand it as you see fit"

219
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,280
This sentence has infinite imagination, does not it?

220
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,190
If he had just said "If you were my student, I would have beaten you up"

221
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,820
It would contain this one connotation and that would be the end of it

222
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,090
"If you were my student, I'd PAN PAN ya!"

223
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,800
What he intends to do, until now, is still unclear

224
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,230
I really don't get it

225
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,670
What're you gonna do? Beat the face until it's round like a pan?

226
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,270
Or do you mean PAN PAN, like beat it?

227
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,270
He didn't say, and he didn't do it, right?

228
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,240
Subject to interpretation

229
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,310
To what extent and how much he wants to PAN PAN is also unclear

230
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,810
PAN PAN, indeed...

231
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,280
What constitutes a PAN PAN is also unclear

232
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,980
There's a saying "If you were my student...i'd forgive you"

233
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,910
Which is the way it is because, after all, you're my student

234
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:49,720
Instead, I think it should be "If you want to be my student, I'd PAN PAN ya!"

235
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,260
So that's how it is

236
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,330
We also asked Zakoshi if he had his own version of this comment

237
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,630
Is there an exaggerated parody about this
-Yes there is

238
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,400
It's a good thing you asked me, there is

239
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,570
Really?
-Can I perform it?

240
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,000
So, here is Hollywood Zakoshi's "If you were my student, I'd PAN PAN ya!"

241
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,540
If you were my student, I'd PAN PAN ya!

242
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,470
That's the normal one

243
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,510
The exaggerated "If you were my student, I'd PAN PAN" is:

244
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,900
If you were my student,

245
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,690
I'd po-PAN po-PAN-ya

246
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,020
It's like that

247
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,270
It should be po-PAN po-PAN

248
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,390
What is he doing?

249
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:33,550
So, Hollywood Zakoshi's favourite comment from All Kyoin is...

250
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,640
If you were my student, I'd PAN PAN ya!

251
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:46,100
He's been storing this up for a while
-This is too cheap

252
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,210
Right?

253
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,810
Bang bang be be is just PAN PAN!

254
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,220
There's also a Ba

255
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,520
And stored up for quite a while

256
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,620
It's really a golden line

257
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,790
Matsumoto was also mentioned

258
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,100
I also think the phrase "the last dumpling" is very strong

259
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,500
Still though, its embarrassing to being commented on so much

260
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,240
If it continues...

261
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,470
I'll PAN PAN ya!

262
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,110
No, no, no don't use it here

263
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,940
I have a feeling you're gonna keep using it

264
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,870
Is it for here?

265
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,040
Does anyone else have any favorite comments?

266
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,960
I think Iwahashi's line "He's become Sakurai"

267
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,390
The fact that it made people think they said it was really an interesting phenomenon - A phenomenon indeed

268
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,560
It is
-It's incredible, isn't it?

269
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,730
It also really shows how accurate the statement was

270
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,680
The most interesting thing is that, after the "He's become Sakurai" line

271
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,500
Seshita became more interesting
-True

272
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,210
Okay, we also have more comedians that have been asked
-Oh really?

273
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,440
Please see the next VTR
-OK

274
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:56,610
Next is the comment that Chocolate Planet's Osada was most impressed by

275
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,790
What left a deep impact on me was...

276
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,760
On the 2020 edition of Dream East-West Neta Battle

277
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:11,630
Hamada's comments have stayed with me ever since

278
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,320
The most recent?

279
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,870
This program was for the New Year period

280
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,870
So it made wonder why he said what he said

281
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,610
It was really shocking

282
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,940
I really think that only Hamada would say such a thing

283
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,050
It was a pure reflection of Hamada's singular style

284
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:34,050
The words of Hamada, which do not fit the New Year setting, are as follows

285
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,970
Weekly Ferrari

286
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,060
There is such a thing

287
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,290
How's the assembly going?
-I'm just starting to work on it

288
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,690
There's just one more step left until I complete the Ferrari of my dreams
-I'm looking forward to it!

289
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,630
For this week's issue #4

290
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,210
Please allow us to take a week off from publication without notice

291
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,610
Don't just decide that yourself!

292
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,410
Is there a hiatus for this kind of stuff?

293
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,070
For Jinnai's performance based about Deagositini

294
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,410
Which was the grand finale of the western army

295
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,910
Hamada was constantly muttering during the performance

296
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,380
What were you saying, Hamada?

297
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:11,360
Isn't this unfunny?

298
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,260
Scary

299
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,280
This is where it starts

300
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,890
Hamada, you shouldn't say such things, right?

301
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,700
No, the audience was more or less laughing
-Yes

302
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,600
But this group here, completely still and silent

303
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,440
What a way to start the New Year!

304
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,600
This is the hardest part

305
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,680
Up until this point there has been some unfunny guys, right?

306
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,140
No
-No no no

307
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,710
But not to this extent

308
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,320
Isn't what this guy said even harsher?

309
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,750
Indeed

310
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,690
Seriously, unfortunately its not the same as Deagostini, the laughter will only come later

311
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,800
Matsumoto's comment is also very strong

312
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,500
Indeed

313
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,670
The audience was indeed laughing

314
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,710
Very impressive indeed

315
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,940
But the performer side was certainly a bit...

316
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,690
This guy is too much

317
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,870
Not so much laughter

318
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,370
From that point on, their team lost a bit of energy

319
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,470
Even if this is the case, it does not matter

320
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,450
But regardless, I think it's very impressive to be able to say it so bluntly

321
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,080
Everyone can have this kind of confused feeling at times

322
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,400
Correct

323
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,650
But in this type of big new year show, most people wouldn't say this sort of thing

324
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:19,090
However, in my opinion

325
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,930
Being teased can also be considered a chance for redemption

326
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:27,370
Its possible to be able to tell that the comedians on set aren't really laughing

327
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,400
After all, you can directly see their reaction

328
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,150
You weren't laughing?

329
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,240
The feeling of "Wow, the comedians aren't smiling much"

330
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,540
It can indeed be felt

331
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:39,240
But in this case, instead of ending on a whimper

332
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,980
The situation can be improved with a bit of teasing like this

333
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,950
I think, in a sense, this helps save the misfire

334
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,650
I see

335
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:54,350
Next is the comment that Yoshimura was most impressed by

336
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,280
Yoshimura

337
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,600
It was about 8 years ago on Shikujiri Sensei's program

338
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,360
We shot a different kind of project than usual

339
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,170
Which was about common people

340
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:12,560
Focusing on a reclusive self-sufficient artist living in the mountain

341
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,650
Sawabe went to interview him

342
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,150
How do you live?

343
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,290
What do you do? How do you stay up to date?

344
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,290
Due to the lack of money, he was interested in what the person ate

345
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:30,490
And the analogy used for a certain food was really awesome

346
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,700
It's a perfect statement

347
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,670
I watched the VTR in the studio with a few other guests

348
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,700
And until now those words have stayed with me

349
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,710
Sawabe's metaphor that Yoshimura will never forget is as follows

350
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:49,270
It occurs when the program crew are shown the food which the individual has stored for long term preservation

351
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,280
Is it stored here?

352
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,920
Regarding hand-salted mushrooms...

353
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,560
Is this a chunk of The Predator?

354
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,730
Its like you're collecting and storing pieces of The Predator

355
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,770
Wonderful

356
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,870
If it were me, I'd say "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait"

357
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,710
"Wow, it's scary, it's disgusting," and so on

358
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,540
And I would definitely add a phrase like "it stinks" to fill the blank time

359
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,880
It's more likely someone would say "this is so and so and so"

360
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,280
Or say something beforehand

361
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,380
Like "this can't be shown" or something like that

362
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,690
It'd stop at the level of "something is wrong with this person"

363
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,890
But without any assistance, he just shot off a line instantly

364
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,490
"Is this a piece of The Predator?"

365
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,560
You can only do something like this with strong comedic sense

366
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,600
If it was me, I would have dealt with it normally

367
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,770
"That's disgusting," "Wow..." and so on

368
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,370
Which would most likely hurt the other person's feelings

369
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,300
And that old guy almost certainly doesn't know what The Predator is

370
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,770
"You seem to be saying something but I don't understand what you're saying"

371
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,940
But when we look at it, we think, "Wow, it's a piece of The Predator"

372
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,380
Look at the way the hand reaches in and takes it out, the way the thing shines

373
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,120
Isn't it just a piece of The Predator?

374
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,620
The more you look at it, the more it looks like it

375
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,210
It's subtly brilliant

376
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,720
If there is prior rehearsal or pre-rehearsal

377
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,320
I don't think it'd be possible to come up with it

378
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,160
Only without these it is possible to make such an off-the-cuff comment

379
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,500
This is really a person who can react quickly!

380
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,570
Really strong explosive power

381
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:21,270
Yoshimura not only admires Sawabe's talent but also...

382
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,870
There's really a lot...

383
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,340
For example, something that Ariyoshi said

384
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,810
This was also a TBS program

385
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:33,920
A variety show that aired on TBS from October 2008 to February 2009. The main theme of the show was to help a celebrity get his or her wish, but if the wish was not granted, the celebrity had to pay all the expenses and other responsibilities

386
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,680
How many years ago was it? Hm, it was a long time ago

387
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,920
It was called "Pact with the Devil", right?

388
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,720
Oh, I really miss it

389
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,320
Although I don't remember it completely precisely

390
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,810
According to Yoshimura, the comments in question were extremely subtle

391
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,110
13 years ago

392
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:51,830
An exterior scene between Ariyoshi and a political mobster

393
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,040
Scenes like this just don't exist anymore

394
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,410
Its incredible to think Ariyoshi once did a scene like this

395
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,950
Once again, I think he's great and I'm sure I couldn't do it

396
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,650
Its a scene in which he's going around collecting questionnaires

397
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,820
It's really awesome

398
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,470
The moment that Yoshimura was moved by Ariyoshi's youthful and heroic act is as follows:

399
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,210
Excuse me, Hama-ko

400
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,220
It's already a strange start

401
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,340
Can I talk to you for a second?
-What do you mean?

402
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,260
We are the "Pact with the Devil" program

403
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,110
What are you doing, bringing a camera with you

404
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,110
Wait a minute
-What are you doing?

405
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:46,560
Ouch, we just want to know about a questionnaire we asked you to do for this program

406
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,310
You did not fill it out, right?

407
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,650
I don't even know about any shit like that

408
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,870
You don't know what?

409
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,500
Aren't you being a little too rude right now?

410
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,840
You're the one who's being rude, you bastard!

411
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,550
So impressive!

412
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,170
I was paid... eh, that's not true, dumbass.

413
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,510
That being said
-I don't have the ti-ti-time to deal with your questionnaires one by one, you idiot!

414
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,010
You're the one who's the idiot!

415
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,710
So harsh

416
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,890
This is the questionnaire
-Shut up you're so annoying!

417
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,090
What's the problem you old fart?

418
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,080
Hamada, wait, ow ow ow!

419
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,610
So messed up

420
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,120
I'm talking about a questionnaire, a questionnaire

421
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,870
This is my car!

422
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,210
So where's my car?

423
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,240
Why is the car I was in not here?

424
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,810
You're getting too excited!

425
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,880
Do you have dementia?

426
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,420
Hamada, can we talk a little more?

427
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,820
I've had enough. Don't open it

428
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,190
So awesome

429
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,560
Just a bit longer
-You're so annoying!

430
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,770
Ariyoshi is too awesome

431
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,890
Driver, please wait a little longer

432
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,330
Old fart!

433
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,260
After that, Ariyoshi also visits his office for the purpose of the questionnaire

434
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,770
You are still young, don't be so reckless

435
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,280
I understand what you're saying, Hamada

436
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,450
Calling me an stinky old fart is too much

437
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,110
Indeed, because you aren't a stinky old man

438
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,010
Just an old fart  -Not an old fart either...

439
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,250
And

440
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,420
Mother died, want to go to see mother in heaven to rub her shoulders and back

441
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,160
There's no way you're going to heaven!

442
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,760
Hamada can't go to heaven, right?
-But I'll probably to go to hell when I die

443
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,400
Absolutely
-Right?

444
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:40,600
Next is the comment that Razor Ramon RG was most impressed by

445
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,770
So awesome!

446
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:46,240
It was the 2013 edition of King of Conto (Sketch)

447
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,780
Kawahara's comments after a certain performance

448
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:58,420
In the history of this competition, i'm not sure any other comments really surpass this one

449
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:06,560
After the score comes out, Downtown speaks before the break

450
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,570
I thought "Is this really the time to play dumb?"

451
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,570
The quote from Kawahara that RG admires is as follows

452
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,100
Okay, let's take a look

453
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,920
The score for the second round of contestants...

454
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,310
Is 946

455
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,460
So the ranking after adding up the scores of the two rounds is

456
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,710
Awesome!

457
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:46,040
With 1825 points they are now ranked temporarily first!

458
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,820
That's pretty good

459
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,020
So, Panther!

460
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,940
No, no, no, sorry, sorry, sorry, this is what Hamada is supposed to say

461
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,380
I'm sorry, please don't beat me up, I'm sorry

462
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,410
Why did Seshita get beaten up?

463
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,360
Calm down, please

464
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,820
Watch it again

465
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,420
To begin with, the set was quiet for a moment

466
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,380
Yeah, there was indeed a moment

467
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,030
For a second, everyone was wondering "what's going on"

468
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,160
Yeah, indeed, it took some time to understand

469
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:15,170
After this, Downtown both start to react

470
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,630
This should be considered the highest honor

471
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,300
In this kind of competition

472
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,830
It's tough to make this kind of thing happen, right?
-Indeed

473
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,810
There are indeed a few famous instances of this in the past

474
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,780
For example, Laughing Rice's "It didn't turn out how I thought it would!"

475
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,780
※In the first round of M1 2008, Audrey, who came in ninth place, won the highest score of 649 points and eliminated Laughing Rice, who was in third place, from the top three. When Imaeda asked Laughing Rice about his feelings on the provisional table Nishida replied with this now classic quote.

476
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,820
But in Kawahara's case, it wasn't like that, usually you're asked "How do you feel?" after you take your seat

477
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:44,060
But instead, he came to the front of the stage after the performance, and before Hamada asked

478
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,980
"So, Panther..."

479
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,970
Kawahara has always been, so to speak,

480
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,540
A man who only responds by playing dumb

481
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,010
So all of this culminates in his "So, Panther!"

482
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:01,110
And the choice of Panther is great

483
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,510
To say "So, Jarujaru!" wouldn't be right

484
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,820
It has to be "So, Panther!"

485
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:13,710
So, this is RG's favorite comment of Kawahara

486
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,660
So, Panther!

487
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,680
No, no, no, sorry, sorry, sorry, this is what Hamada is supposed to say

488
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:21,280
Not a single opportunity missed

489
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,820
I'm sorry, please don't beat me up, I'm sorry

490
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,030
Don't even know why you're angry

491
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,470
Okay, that's all the quotes for today
-There it is

492
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,310
What do you think?

493
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:35,760
Although each of them is very good, the last "So, Panther"
-"So Panther"?

494
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,920
Kawahara-san didn't say "So, Panther" straight away

495
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,820
First he read the autocue

496
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,400
Because Hamada also reads it before saying his lines

497
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,990
Kawahara joined in on this action completely

498
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,160
Yeah
-Very detailed

499
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,000
So it appears even more like Hamada
-So it is

500
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,430
Mine was just speaking for everyone

501
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,160
It's not much
-"Isn't this unfunny?"

502
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,070
Yes, yes, yes, after all, that's what everyone thought
-Matsumoto what do you think

503
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:05,030
Well, Jinnai is not usually known for such making unfunny jokes

504
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,580
But as we said, because of the teasing Jinnai was saved somewhat

505
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,450
But he's been experiencing hell ever since

506
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,620
Since then, every performance is unfunny

507
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,630
I feel that in the two years since that day, he's been a little uninspired

508
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,960
Indeed, he hasn't redeemed himself

509
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,700
Let's welcome the next presenter

510
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,470
It's Chocolate Planet
-Thanks for having us

511
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,420
It's choco's

512
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,820
Chocolate's is okay
-Why do you have to make it plural every time?

513
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,540
Do you really like the sound "'s"?

514
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,520
You two come often!
-Thank you

515
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,870
So, what is the theory this time?

516
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,050
This is a theory about "NOM NOM NOM"

517
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,820
You really dare make a joke at this time?

518
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,710
Please acknowledge his courage

519
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,250
I was surprised myself

520
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,890
Although a bit sudden

521
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,080
About 5 years ago,

522
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,130
There was a "Even if the food is disgusting, after 3 days of fasting..."

523
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,630
"You will eat it" theory

524
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,500
Do you remember this hypothesis?
-I vaguely remember such a thing

525
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,640
Concerning the final verification results:

526
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,950
The food that Ungirls' Tanaka hates is cilantro (coriander)

527
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,140
In the end, he still couldn't eat it
-Couldn't eat it

528
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,210
The food Sugi hates is sea squirts

529
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,310
After fasting it proved to be very delicious

530
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,060
Viking's Nishimura hates figs

531
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,390
And although he ate it

532
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,760
This thing doesn't have any flavor at all!

533
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,390
No flavor!

534
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:31,960
What's with this stuff?

535
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,600
Nishimura ended up losing his sense of taste

536
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,610
What the hell!?

537
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,940
So the results were ultimately confusing

538
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,270
Three people with three different results
-What the hell happened?

539
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,780
That's just how it turned out

540
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,810
So we also don't understand what happened

541
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,540
Isn't it true that the taste sensitivity of the tongue becomes higher after fasting?

542
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,040
In the end, it turned out to be a mysterious verification result
-Nishimura is really an odd guy!

543
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,820
So this time, we bring a new theory about disliked food

544
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,020
This is it:

545
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:02,060
No matter how much you dislike a type of food, if you eat it at its peak quality, you will think it's delicious

546
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:09,200
Yes, I'm sure all of you here have tasted the best food

547
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,070
Just saying meat alone

548
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:14,080
If you compare cheap meat with the highest grade of meat

549
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,640
You'll surely think it's not the same thing.
-True

550
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,410
Incidentally, what food do you hate, Matsumoto?

551
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,680
Sushi with the silvery white type of fish, that type I can't stand
-Oh

552
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,580
Like those square sushi

553
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,580
※A square of sushi with mackerel slices on it, made in a mold in Kansai

554
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,950
It is similar to mackerel sushi, right?

555
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:33,760
That thing is no different from a Zippo
-Zippo?

556
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,790
That stuff is not for human consumption at all

557
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,490
A gasoline zippo lighter?

558
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,990
This guy judges whether food is good or not from its appearance

559
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,960
No, no, no, no...

560
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,460
Is it the appearance that's not good? Or is it the taste?

561
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,500
It can reflect your own face

562
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,540
So it's not so much the taste as it is a point of dislike?

563
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,100
Because its as smooth as the surface of a mirror

564
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,560
Is it that smooth?

565
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,070
Has there ever been a situation where you can see your own face?

566
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,980
You can't see the face so clearly, surely

567
00:28:51,980 --> 00:29:01,590
No matter how much you dislike a type of food, if you eat it at its peak quality, you will think it's delicious

568
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,840
That's it

569
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,030
This time, the target was a trio of people who each had a type of food they would absolutely not eat

570
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,240
First is...

571
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,550
Hello
-Hello

572
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,750
Jungle Pocket's Ota

573
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,730
He has been called out on the pretext of working for a fake food show

574
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,810
Do you have any favorite food?

575
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,840
Eel or something

576
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,910
Also meat

577
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,740
Following along with this topic

578
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,590
Conversely, do you have anything you absolutely hate to eat?

579
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,760
Well...yeah I do
-What is it?

580
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,190
Cucumber
Oh, cucumber?

581
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,690
I am completely unable to eat cucumber

582
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,430
I haven't eaten a piece of cucumber in almost 30 years

583
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,900
Even if there's some in a salad, you can't eat it?

584
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,200
Even if there's small pieces in potato salad, I will avoid all of them

585
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:55,250
So, Ota's absolute NG food is cucumber

586
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,000
How did you come to hate eating cucumbers?

587
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,310
There was a teacher in elementary school

588
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,780
The kind of teacher who didn't allow us to leave anything uneaten

589
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,580
At that time there were cucumber slices in the lunch

590
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,650
I tried to prevent the teacher from finding out i'd left some

591
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,760
By hiding it in the desk drawer as if it had all been eaten

592
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,020
But in the end, it was discovered

593
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,130
The teacher said, "If you don't finish these, you can't go home"

594
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,630
So although I tried really hard

595
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,330
I just couldn't eat it

596
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,730
And a large pile of it on the table looked absolutely disgusting

597
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,070
So I threw up

598
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,410
So,

599
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,380
After this we're going to record a promo for the show
-Okay

600
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,250
So please come with me

601
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,720
Under false pretenses

602
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:43,190
He is lead to another room in which the best cucumber can be found

603
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,260
This is probably going to be bad

604
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,900
Ah this is a shock...

605
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,690
What's this all about?

606
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,410
What kind of project is this?

607
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,380
It's really scary

608
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,580
No matter how much you hate a certain type of food

609
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:14,080
You'll think its delicious once you eat the best version of it

610
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,520
Oh...so that's it

611
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,930
This time, the best version of cucumber tasted by Ota was...

612
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,760
Compared to the average cucumber, it is about twice the price

613
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,960
So straight!

614
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,470
This is specially selected Chichibu cucumber

615
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,940
Sweet, umami and crisp

616
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,840
It must be delicious

617
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,450
I am really not sure

618
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,680
Whether my body can accept it or not

619
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,520
After all, I have childhood trauma connected to it, and I really hate it

620
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,650
Its not the level of "oh I can't stand the smell of it"

621
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,990
Is it possible for you to eat the best cucumber?

622
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,490
No, I don't think I can eat it

623
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:03,240
Since this instance is not on the level of "just muddle through and eat it"

624
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,220
It can't be eaten in its natural state

625
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:12,310
So, we instead make a dish to change its state

626
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:19,550
If this is acceptable, then we will use a two-stage system to verify

627
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,710
The first thing Ota was told to eat was

628
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,160
Korean Style Salad

629
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,160
Ah I see...

630
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:34,130
It's not as refined a cuisine as I expected...

631
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:37,030
Putting a raw cucumber in front of me to eat...

632
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,840
My heart is really beating fast right now

633
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,900
What will be the result?

634
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,180
It seems he really can't eat it

635
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,330
Can't eat it, right?

636
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,580
What a nuisance!

637
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,110
Seriously a nuisance

638
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:58,750
Is he eating it?

639
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,450
Ate quite a lot

640
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,880
He's chewing

641
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,330
Eaten with lettuce

642
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,590
Yes

643
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,700
There is also seaweed in it

644
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,900
Yes, so the taste is still there

645
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:14,740
I can eat it

646
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,640
This is no problem

647
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,510
At its highest quality, do you acknowledge its deliciousness?

648
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:26,550
I'm sorry, I really can't say it's delicious

649
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:30,490
Its just the taste of Korean salad

650
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,290
I can't say i'm feeling that the cucumber is delicious

651
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,230
It just tastes like a Korean salad, so it's good enough to eat

652
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,860
But still, you chewed and swallowed it
-Yes

653
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,000
If this is the case, it can be eaten

654
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,410
The taste is still acceptable

655
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,990
After that, it was time to challenge the raw cucumber

656
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:54,430
After 30 years, can he overcome the inability to eat cucumber if its peak quality?

657
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,340
Not eaten it in 30 years, impressive

658
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,150
It should be okay to dip it in some salt, right?
-It's OK

659
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,820
Waaaaaa...

660
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:01,000
This is now pure cucumber flavor

661
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,620
I genuinely haven't eaten it like this

662
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,420
I'm going to do it

663
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,030
Too fast!

664
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,210
Don't you think it's too fast?

665
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,390
This is true resistance

666
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,240
Please wait a minute, I'm really...

667
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,770
Eh, wait?

668
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,780
What's going on?
-I don't know

669
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,980
The moment I put it in my mouth, I started to vomit

670
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,480
Definitely psychological trauma

671
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,350
You can also take a little break

672
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,510
I'll try again

673
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,320
First drink some water to rest a little

674
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,320
It's okay, it's okay, I'm scared that if I wait too long i'll be more afraid

675
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,220
What do you mean by "afraid"

676
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,220
It means his hate has already reached the level of fear

677
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,030
I'm going for it

678
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,130
Don't dip it in the salt!

679
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,420
Ah, he's chewing

680
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,300
Eh?

681
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,380
I said don't dip it in the salt!

682
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,130
Hasn't he finished?

683
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,050
It's not that good to eat

684
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,420
However...

685
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,230
It's not impossible to eat

686
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,830
Success!

687
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:22,630
It's not as bad as my recollection of it

688
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,970
I still don't understand my body's reaction to it

689
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,140
But the feeling of "It's not what I thought it would be" prevailed

690
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,940
And I was able to swallow it by accident

691
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,910
So, from now on, Ota

692
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:36,810
What will you think of cucumbers?

693
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:39,150
I have the type of "I can actually eat it" confidence now

694
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,320
Despite still not feeling that it is "delicious"

695
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,070
By experiencing it at its best, he was able to eat cucumbers after 30 years

696
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,800
Next is...

697
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,500
Gushiken Yoko

698
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:02,770
What can't I eat? The things I can't eat are few

699
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:08,310
When I was young, I used to catch sea urchins to eat

700
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:12,480
But after eating so much of it, I began to feel a little strange about it

701
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,650
In the past, you thought it was delicious?

702
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,370
Ate too much and became disgusted by it

703
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,190
It was delicious because, how can I say... because I was hungry

704
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,260
What aspect is it that you hate?

705
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,360
Its slippery so its unpleasant

706
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,400
Do you mean the texture of the food?  -Yes, and

707
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:31,070
It also smells a bit unpleasant

708
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:36,310
And the color of it also looks like poo, which is a bit off-putting

709
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,370
So i'm afraid i'm not really willing to eat it

710
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,210
He's really cute

711
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,080
He's still a kid

712
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,880
What is this man saying?

713
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,320
When was the last time you ate sea urchin?

714
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,420
When I was in high school

715
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,310
Gushiken's absolute NG food is "sea urchin" which he has not eaten for over 50 years

716
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,170
So

717
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,270
Ah, there are a lot of people here... hello

718
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,900
No matter how much you hate a certain type of food

719
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,840
You'll think its delicious once you eat the best version of it

720
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,950
Ah, I can already tell its not possible even before i've seen it

721
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,510
Sea urchin, I really can't

722
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:21,400
The peak quality sea urchin prepared for Gushiken is...

723
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,110
About seven times the price of average sea urchin

724
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,670
One box costs about 25,000

725
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:31,230
Sea urchin of Ezo horse manure from Nemuro, Hokkaido (gold quality)

726
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,830
Gold quality

727
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,550
It is characterized by a strong sweetness and aromatic richness

728
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,630
Can't even look at it

729
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,810
Evil ... it really fills the nostrils

730
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,510
The smell is really strong

731
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,980
This is way stronger that what i've experienced in the past

732
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,700
Is it the fragrance?

733
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,590
It is the smell of sea urchin

734
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:04,000
This time, the first challenge is sea urchin steamed rice

735
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,500
So, please enjoy

736
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,830
The food I can't eat is raw oysters

737
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,080
I can't stand the taste

738
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,440
I can't stand the soft feeling when I bite down

739
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,940
So it's probably been about 10 years since I've eaten it

740
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,050
So, please enjoy

741
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,650
Trying to pick a bite with no sea urchin

742
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,590
So... sorry

743
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:40,060
That...

744
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,970
Every grain of rice is covered with it...

745
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,900
That's for sure!

746
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,670
Wait a minute...

747
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,300
If he doesn't want to eat it then nothing can be done

748
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,760
So, after this

749
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,460
It took this long?

750
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,810
It's still quite difficult

751
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,100
So tough

752
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,600
This is really tough

753
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Is it ok to just not eat it?

754
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:08,760
The struggle and refusal to eat the sea urchin lasted 20 minutes

755
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,090
But at this point, finally,

756
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,100
Uwa, this is really too much

757
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,810
Placed deep in the throat

758
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,540
To avoid the taste

759
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,910
Avoid the tastebuds

760
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,340
Deep in the throat

761
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,820
Wasn't chewed at all!

762
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,450
It's impossible

763
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,550
Ah... i'm sorry

764
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,890
Can't even chew a mouthful

765
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:39,490
Can't eat it

766
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:45,310
Although it was of the highest quality, he could not eat the sea urchin

767
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:50,030
Ah ... sea urchin is still sea urchin after all

768
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,270
Saying this type of flavor is delicious, I just can't

769
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,130
The final challenger is JOY

770
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,080
Foods you dislike are...?

771
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:12,590
Mentaiko, tomato, eggplant, red bean filling

772
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,970
For JOY, who is a very picky eater

773
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:20,030
Which is the worst out of all of these?

774
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,700
Probably tomato, I threw it up in the past

775
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,230
It's tomato

776
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,670
How long has it been since you've had one?
-A tomato?

777
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,440
Tomato...

778
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,880
I haven't had one since the early years of elementary school, I think

779
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,810
Even a single bite is just impossible...

780
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,480
Taking a bite of it will probably kill me

781
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:44,430
And so, JOY is lead to his final resting place

782
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,660
Hello

783
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,490
Thanks for having me

784
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,900
Ah!?

785
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:56,430
Eh!?

786
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,140
No matter how much you hate a certain type of food

787
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,810
You'll think its delicious once you eat the best version of it

788
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,270
Can't do it, can't do it, can't do it

789
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,910
I don't think I can do it, so let's just not

790
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,610
This is not just a simple dislike of mine

791
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,880
Please sit down first

792
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:14,550
Hey... the GoPro has been shooting for 11 minutes already

793
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:18,320
So you were already preparing this when we were talking back there!

794
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,270
For JOY, who hates tomatoes so much

795
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,050
The price of this variety is 5 times higher than the normal variety

796
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:28,440
This box of small tomatoes costs about 5,400

797
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,160
And its sugar content is twice as high as the average variety

798
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,570
With an elegant sweetness

799
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,980
Certainly not the same as a standard tomato

800
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,160
The first item to be challenged is marinated tomatoes

801
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:42,680
Marinated Tomatoes

802
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,680
This is completely raw

803
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:48,350
So, please enjoy "the highest quality marinated tomatoes"

804
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,390
Please wait a moment...

805
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,860
Can you give me a countdown or something?

806
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,360
If it's not mandatory, I can't eat it

807
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,330
I don't think I can do it otherwise, its like a bungee jump
-Okay

808
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:58,760
Is it okay to count down from 10 seconds

809
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,360
Please start from 15

810
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,590
10 isn't enough?

811
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,370
Okay, so let's get started

812
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,440
15 14…

813
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,000
Just count down from 5

814
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,470
This is bad...

815
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,780
Does it make any difference?

816
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,940
Ah ah, i'll show you my power

817
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,910
Let's do it, eat it!

818
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,710
Awful!

819
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,420
Awful!

820
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,950
These are the highest quality tomatoes

821
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,290
Awful!

822
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:28,660
Super disgusting

823
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:33,480
JOY can't even eat it at its highest peak quality

824
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,280
It must be absolutely delicious

825
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,600
On the contrary, because the quality is high, the flavor is very strong, right?

826
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,800
The tomatoey taste is too prominent

827
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,140
It's probably more difficult for me to eat the highest quality one

828
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:48,910
For those who can't eat it, the best quality one is the worst

829
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:52,720
This should be the answer to this theory

830
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,090
This proved, once again, that I really can not eat tomatoes

831
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:00,760
Incidentally, what is your least favorite food, Saito?

832
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,160
Huh?
-What's the food you hate, most, Saito?

833
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,760
Whoa... eh?

834
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,130
Tomatoes...

835
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,810
This was known in advance and that's why they asked him, right?

836
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:17,740
We got this information
-Oh, this is bad...

837
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,440
How resistant are you?

838
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,010
Raw is definitely impossible

839
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:25,010
I probably haven't eaten it since elementary school

840
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,880
Same as JOY

841
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:27,650
Eh, wait a minute... Oh, so that's how it is...

842
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:28,750
This is how it is

843
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:35,300
Today happens to be the first time that Saito has hosted a variety show

844
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,210
His reaction will probably be really bad

845
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:40,870
The tomatoes that JOY challenged are now presented "raw"

846
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,870
Everyone takes a deep breath

847
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,640
After 14 years, he'll try a tomato

848
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,240
Eeeeee! This is bad!

849
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,590
This kid is really spoiled

850
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:02,540
It's a very high class tomato

851
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:03,690
I guess it'll turn out like this

852
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,620
Oh wow, it still stinks after throwing it up

853
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:10,090
The taste of the core is really awful

854
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:15,610
3 out of 4 people couldn't even swallow

855
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:20,310
Only Ota ate it

856
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:23,240
After one week

857
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,710
Eh? A follow-up?

858
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,310
Hello
-Hello

859
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:30,650
What's the show?
-Wednesday Downtown

860
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:34,780
Before this you ate the highest quality cucumber
-Yes

861
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,820
How did it go after that?

862
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,720
I bought cucumbers at supermarket and took them home

863
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,320
To challenge myself

864
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,230
Unfortunately it's still not working

865
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:48,900
After all, I ate the highest quality cucumber, right?

866
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:54,770
In summary,
overcoming food you hate is extremely difficult

867
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,340
I see

868
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,940
The result is that it is very difficult to overcome

869
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,320
What do you think?

870
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:09,590
If it is the highest peak quality of something, the smell is probably quite unpleasant for those who hate it

871
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:12,840
The speed that everyone spat it out is abnormally fast

872
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,120
Its true, they threw it up instantly
-Indeed

873
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,590
So they really do find it extremely unpleasant
-Indeed

874
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:20,730
It's usually rare to see so many people continuously vomiting

875
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:25,700
I hoped Gushiken would try harder
-Yes

876
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,940
It might be better to start the challenge with poop

877
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,840
Have you ever seen anyone picking up poo with chopsticks?

878
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:36,750
And don't put a trash can next to them, so they can't use it to escape the challenge

879
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,280
I see
-It's making it too easy

880
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,240
Or stuff poop in Gushiken's mouth while he's asleep
-It's not about poop

881
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,190
Sea urchin is enough

882
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:46,660
How has the food that Gushiken dislikes become poop?

883
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,890
It's sea urchin!

884
00:45:48,220 --> 00:46:14,820
