00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:10,990
Good morning.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,270
Good morning Hamada-san.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,270
It shouldn't be so hard to tell.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,750
It's me.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,470
You don't usually wear such an outfit, do you?

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,070
Because you're a performer.

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,560
That's very clever, Yama chan.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,030
Thank you.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,860
"Because you're a performer."

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,070
It doesn't matter at all.

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,620
I have a favour to ask...

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,800
What is it?

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,640
Matsumoto has something he really wants to do.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,030
Again?

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,630
He told me that the other day.

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,230
Yes.

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,950
What does he want to do?

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,710
What is it?

20
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,820
He wants to set a world record in the high jump.

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,470
Huh?

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,750
Why?

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,360
I don't know, since he was crying...

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,310
Was he crying?

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,320
The current world record is 2m 45cm

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,780
2m 45cm? That's high.

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,110
It means he wants to set 2m 50cm, right?

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,870
But there's nothing we can do about it.

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,230
Wrong. That is why I'm dressed like this. Come on!

30
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,470
Don't make me explain everything. What does this outfit make me?

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,430
Kuroko (Stage assistant dressing in black).

32
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,430
He really wants to high-jump. What can we do?

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,110
Assistance, right?

34
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,710
Assistance?

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,590
Let's help him to high-jump, shall we?

36
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,510
Will he be satisfied?

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,270
Will he be satisfied, high-jumping with our assistance?

38
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,540
He will. He really wants to high jump.

39
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,870
Are you sure?

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,230
Will you help?

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,550
Yes. Yes, we will.

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:00,480
Will he be able to exceed the world record of 2m 45cm set by Sotomayor from Cuba In 1993?

43
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,870
Wow, this is high.

44
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,390
Here he comes.

45
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,390
Good morning.

46
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,630
He's ready.

47
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,990
You may be thinking that

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,510
Matsumoto is being selfish again.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,990
When you have been

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,350
in this field for a long time,

51
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,670
a time like this

52
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,190
does come.

53
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,670
Yeah, a time you feel like high jumping.

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,910
But my base strength is not enough and I have not been training for it.

55
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,750
So it seems to be impossible

56
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,350
Yes.

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,870
So I hate to say this but

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,670
just a little is OK so

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,150
I need your power

60
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,990
All right. Let's do it.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,950
Shall we?

62
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,710
So high huh?

63
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,230
Yes it is.

64
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,630
Is it that high?

65
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,230
I count on you guys.

66
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,950
Yes, we understand.

67
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,150
Let's just make it happen in one time

68
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,790
Yes

69
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,270
Hey wait...how...

70
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,870
How...

71
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,310
Leg...leg...

72
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,510
OK.

73
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,310
OK..OK.

74
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,950
Ready?

75
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,390
Yes

76
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,430
Hey hey hey. wait.

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,860
Timing was bad.

78
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,520
Timing was bad.

79
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,230
Not good at all.

80
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,230
Sorry.

81
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,910
You go there.

82
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,270
Yes, only timing.

83
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,550
Now, timing..

84
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,470
So it's just about timing then.

85
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,230
It's the timing, yes

86
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,510
Let's get off to the excellent start.

87
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:02,990
Ready?

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,670
Yes!

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,150
Three!

90
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,270
Matsumoto san!

91
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,270
Our fault?

92
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,990
Well, we tried our best!

93
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,910
What should we do?

94
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,230
We should go.

95
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,670
What should we say though?

96
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,400
We should apologize anyway, in this situation.

97
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,320
We should lift him up higher. Huh?

98
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
But he's heavier than I thought.

99
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,800
Yes.

100
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,110
Right?

101
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,270
Matsumoto is doing his knitting

102
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,720
Matsumoto

103
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,320
I think the angle was wrong.

104
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,480
I don't care that I couldn't.

105
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,230
The important thing is, everyone is going in the same direction. Right?

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,070
I'm not mad because I can't high jump.

107
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,900
If you're not going to try hard, just quit it!!

108
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,040
No, it's not that.

109
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,270
No, stop it.

110
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,990
Don't waste it.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,510
You did a good job. Nice color.

112
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,950
Leave it to us.

113
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,230
It's angle.

114
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,350
Please come, we will be perfectly ready.

115
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,510
We'll be waiting.

116
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,350
Changing the mood, here's the 2nd challenge!

117
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,190
We should do a talk too.

118
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,150
Well

119
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,110
just let's do it, OK?

120
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,510
Let's hurry

121
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,590
Ready?

122
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,590
Yes.

123
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,980
Put it on there.

124
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,710
No no no..

125
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,630
What?

126
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,630
Sorry.

127
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,630
I thought it was angle.

128
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,470
Wasn't it strange?

129
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,270
No.

130
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,870
Let's try again. It's gonna be OK.

131
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,820
Sorry, but next time will be OK.

132
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,710
Sorry

133
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,070
Sorry

134
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,510
It'll be no problem at all.

135
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,550
Let him lay down.

136
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,150
It's OK.

137
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,230
So heavy!

138
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,110
Ouch!

139
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,550
Use your hands.

140
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,030
Take it off it hurts!

141
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,790
Lift him up!

142
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,790
Lift.

143
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,150
Matsumoto san!

144
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,150
Our image was once we lift him up, he will...

145
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,990
He would be pulled up high.

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,990
Then we could've thrown him over.

147
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,230
Go to Matsumoto's dressing room again to apologize

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,590
Matsumoto is playing imaginary drums

149
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,110
I want to high jump!

150
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,310
Don't make me wear strange accessories.

151
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,180
Too long.

152
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,850
I waited for way too long.

153
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,430
We are trying hard though.

154
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,910
Matsumoto tries the 3rd challenge!

155
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,270
It's so high.

156
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,310
It is so high.

157
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,150
Let us begin!

158
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,830
We need one more. This side and that side.

159
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,070
Is it OK like this? This side is sticking out.

160
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,910
This is going to be good.

161
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,910
Right?

162
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,790
It was long.

163
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,470
He was watching us while laying down.

164
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,670
Go to Matsumoto's dressing room again to apologize

165
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,260
You shouldn't laugh when he's mad

166
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,260
We're sorry, we'll try not to

167
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,750
Since you guys laugh; it makes him more mad.

168
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,030
Yes.

169
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,710
Matsumoto is filling out an embarkation card

170
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,360
I am NOT an old man,

171
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,790
who needs to stay for such a looong time

172
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,350
in bed.

173
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,000
What the hell. What do you think?

174
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,230
When people watch it in the studio,

175
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,110
I want them to think I could do it!

176
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,790
There are people who actually high jump close to that height.

177
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,870
As for me,

178
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,680
It's not that I can't. But looking at the bar....

179
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,340
REALLY MAKES ME WANT TO HIGH JUMP!! 💢

180
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,230
We're sorry.

181
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,230
We're sorry.

182
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,270
That's true.

183
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,670
Still a long way to the bar.

184
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,230
We should seriously think about how to lift him up higher.

185
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,910
We understood, Matsumoto san.

186
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,910
We'll do it next time.

187
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,510
We should go up.

188
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,630
Yes, we think so too.

189
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,630
Let's use ladders

190
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,110
Yes.

191
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,470
We can go really close to the bar.

192
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,510
Yes.

193
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,310
Hoping this will be the last, the 4th challenge!

194
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,870
It'll be OK.

195
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,230
Let's do it.

196
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,030
Come here! Come here!

197
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,550
Sit there.

198
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,190
Parallel to the bar.

199
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,710
Ouch.

200
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,550
Ouch!

201
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,790
Ouch! Ouch!

202
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,790
Ouch!

203
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,550
Heave ho!

204
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,760
Matsumoto Hitoshi 2m 50cm
The World Record has been broken!?

205
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,590
You did it!

206
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,950
You did it!!

207
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,030
He did it.

208
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,110
Yeah.

209
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,830
What's the matter?

210
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,550
Go to Matsumoto's dressing room to check him out

211
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,030
Matsumoto is trying to remove chewing gum off his shoe

212
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,510
Was it good?

213
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,420
Do you really think viewers would go like "Wow, Matsumoto did a great job!"

214
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,030
Do you?

215
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,160
Nope

216
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,510
You don't!?

217
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,550
No way.

218
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,110
Well, rather than "Macchan is great..."

219
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,590
I'm not satisfied with the staff's applause

220
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:17,420
We'll do it again after next month.
