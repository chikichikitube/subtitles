If I Were An F1 Racer...

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,690
F1... F1... what the hell is up with that?

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,570
What's so cool about F1?

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,450
This is all they do...

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,040
Seriously

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,500
I believe they're a bit more focused than that

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,500
I'm totally faster than them

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,880
Can you drive like this though?!

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,720
At speeds of like 300 km/h?

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,560
Huh?

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,560
I'm pretty sure I can handle that

13
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,190
300 km/h??

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,060
And their heads get banged around like this

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,320
But everyone's driving about 300 km/h right?

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,030
It's not just one guy, right?

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,440
I wouldn't want to waste energy going that fast by myself

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,780
You're missing the point!

19
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,220
I don't think you can handle that speed

20
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,160
But it's the car doing all the work

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,290
No, it's the driver's technique moron!

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,920
Listen, when I was in driving school...

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,380
Don't compare your stupid driving school

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,010
to racing a car!

25
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,880
Did they teach you to ride like this at driving school?!!!

26
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,180
Were you changing gears like this?!

27
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,140
But it's much easier to drive that way

28
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,350
Get the hell outta here!

29
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,270
You fool, you don't know what I'm capable of

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,480
My instructor even said,

31
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,730
"You drive too fast"

32
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,940
But that's...

33
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,230
You're an idiot

34
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,400
Those are two completely different situations

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,490
You're talking about driving a school vehicle

36
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,240
But I was told "You're driving too fast!"

37
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,120
But this is from your driving instructor

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,080
You were doing 40 km/h tops!!

39
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,290
Well, the instructor was stunned at my speed for sure

40
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,710
But you're not to exceed 40 km/h during your class

41
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,580
I mean, I failed once because of that

42
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,460
I only went up to 42 or 43 km/h

43
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,710
But you went over

44
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,920
Yeah, I did

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,970
Then you might have the right skills, too...

46
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,260
Get outta here!!

47
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,100
We're talking about a mere 40 km/h!!

48
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,430
We are far from being skilled!!

49
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,890
What do you mean?

50
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,680
This one time,

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,310
I was too poor to put any gas in my tank

52
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,020
And I had maybe this much gas left

53
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,770
But I managed to get home safely that night

54
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,000
How the hell does that relate to anything we're talking about ?!

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Those racers don't think about the gas in their tanks

56
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,480
They do, too

57
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,820
They need to make a pit stop to refuel and stuff

58
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,580
But are they paying??

59
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,340
Why do they have to ?!!

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,540
That's their freakin' job!!

61
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,410
You expect them to pay out of pocket?!!

62
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,980
â™ª And that'd make a whole lot of differeeeence â™ª

63
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,410
You're not making any sense!
