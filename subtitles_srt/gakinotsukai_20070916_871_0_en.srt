00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!]

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,720
A usual day in the meeting room before the recording of "Gaki No Tsukai".

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,520
They are all looking and getting excited over the girls in the magazine.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,950
But that 'man' is nowhere to be seen.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,330
She's cute.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,660
I mean, I get it...

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,540
You're returning it, right?

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,190
Excuse me.

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:21,720
Sorry...

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,520
Sorry for interrupting...

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,060
May I have some of your time?

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,880
I have another letter from our guy, Matsumoto.

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,670
-Our guy?
-Everyone knows Matsumoto!

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,290
I have come to deliver it.

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,110
I bet he drew a tiny map again.

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,370
In the letter...

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,360
I got this from 'our guy' Matsumoto.

18
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,260
Again...

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,050
Again with this...

20
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,470
-It's the usual pattern.
-Right, right.

21
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,030
"You lot are a bunch of begging lowly celebs who are no better than chickens."

22
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:57,080
"It is so painful to see how the lot of you fly around the big sky of showbiz like a bunch of sexual vultures."

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,550
Here he goes...

24
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,490
He wrote the same thing before.

25
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,850
"So let us see who is the real technician, the sexual dynamite, the human crimson viper."

26
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,560
"That is the purpose of this letter."

27
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,900
"Hitoshi Matsumoto".

28
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,740
He drew a map again.

29
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,910
He included "Safari Park".

30
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,460
There's the "Fuji Safari Park" and then "Here".

31
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,290
This is too broad.

32
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,240
He also included a pet shop at the side.

33
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,590
This is pretty bad.

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,800
He included the zoo as well.

35
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:33,070
-But you know he always does this even though he never gets first place.
-You're right.

36
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,880
That's just how it goes.

37
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,580
He was so desperate last time.

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,340
Did you see?
He went like this with the mannequin.

39
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,990
And his reaction after barely winning over me.

40
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:45,930
Wasn't that so lame?

41
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,580
Yeah, isn't it so lame whenever he's happy?

42
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,420
Anyways, 'our guy' Matsumoto is waiting so please go ahead.

43
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,990
Are you guys coming too?

44
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,630
Yes, of course.

45
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,730
We also wanna see what it's like.

46
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,770
Yes.

47
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,840
You'll be shocked.

48
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,980
The guys have put their prides on the line to see who's the sexiest.

49
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,760
Matsumoto came out victorious the first time around.
But it has been a close race.

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,470
Alright!!

51
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,380
With two losses for Tanaka and one loss for Endo, everything is on the line.

52
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,320
What kind of contest will they face?
And what punishment will the loser endure?

53
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,180
We're closeby every time.

54
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,970
-We don't need that map.
-Right, right.

55
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,830
-That map is so useless..
-Yeah.

56
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,610
We're at the "Safari Park".

57
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,780
He's always sitting like that.

58
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,430
-Good morning
-Morning!

59
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,960
Good morning!

60
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,550
You always have this nice setup going on.

61
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,790
You sure took your sweet time getting here, you $@#% celebs!

62
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,580
$@#% celebs?!

63
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,230
$@#%?!

64
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,970
Right, I don't think any of us are $@#%...

65
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,470
Today is all about kissing.
Kissing!

66
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,730
-Yes.
-Right.
-Kissing?

67
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,810
Lift your hand up if you've kissed before!

68
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,990
Of course we have...

69
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,540
Then let me hear your first kiss stories!!

70
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,350
How about it?

71
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,230
-I think it must have been in my 2nd or 3rd year of middle school.
-Oh, that's pretty fast.

72
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,210
-Quite fast.
-That was back then.

73
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,780
Tell us her full name.

74
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:23,810
Huh?!

75
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,060
Tell us her full name.

76
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,230
The other person's name?
-Yes.

77
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,880
-What?!
-Say it, quickly.

78
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,160
Who did I kiss back then...?

79
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,210
What do you mean?!
We're talking about your first kiss!!

80
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,990
Say it, come on.

81
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,360
You guys, are you serious?!

82
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,390
How shameless can you be?

83
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,850
It's your first kiss!
You don't remember her name?!

84
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,530
-Do you remember yours?
-Of course.

85
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,700
Who is it?

86
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,710
It was Mieko Ishida.

87
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,160
Mieko Ishida?

88
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,320
Why am I the only one spilling the beans?!

89
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,340
We don't really remember...

90
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,710
It must have been pretty humiliating for you guys then...

91
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,480
Right?
Saying the full name is embarrassing...

92
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,430
It's all about kissing today!
Kissing!!

93
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,200
Kissing, right...

94
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,770
We're seeing who's better at kissing!!

95
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,780
Oh right...

96
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,050
We have the stage all ready to go!

97
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:14,920
-Yeah.
-Sure.

98
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,990
It's over there!!

99
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,030
Let's get over there.

100
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,110
You're just embarrassed.

101
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,190
Let's go.

102
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,920
Open it.

103
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,230
Oh, this way.

104
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,000
Alright.

105
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,500
What's this?

106
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,910
-What is this?
-I see...

107
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,020
What is it?

108
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,950
Alright, it's the Kiss Machine!!

109
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,830
We have more people this time around.

110
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,520
So deciding who goes first will be hard.

111
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,450
Listen up guys!!
Today we'll be seeing who is the fastest kisser!!

112
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,240
The rules are simple.

113
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,770
Players will ride a moving platform.

114
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,920
And they will try to kiss as many lips as possible from the 80 slots.

115
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,860
This time around, 6 people will be taking up the challenge excluding Matsumoto.

116
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,300
Of course, the worst one will have to take a punishment!!

117
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,600
-I see...
-Right...

118
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,740
Understood?

119
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,180
Are you confident?

120
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,540
Are you confident in your kisses?

121
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,580
This is not about confidence, I would bite off every single one of those lips apart.

122
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,770
That's not good.
You can't be biting them off.

123
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,680
I guess I'm just "wild".

124
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,290
It's my "wildness".

125
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,210
My "wildness"!!

126
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,950
That's how they say it in Okinawa.

127
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,410
Hurry up and decide who's first!!

128
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,040
Here he goes.

129
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,530
-The order...
-Should I go?

130
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,370
Shall I go?

131
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,330
- Vacuum are you going?
-Vacuum are you going first?

132
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,290
I mean you normally don't want to go first.

133
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,720
Sure, you can wait and see what the deal is.

134
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,790
Alright then, let's have Vacuum go first.

135
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,090
-Alright.
-You going?

136
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,900
Are you guys just gonna call me Vacuum from now on?

137
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,810
Are you?

138
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,010
Aren't you Vacuum for License?

139
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,420
I'm totally okay with it.

140
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:04,780
Alright.

141
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,700
Our first batter is Vacuum Fujiwara.

142
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,820
How good a kisser is he?

143
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,330
Let's start.
Here comes Vacuum!

144
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,880
Go ahead!

145
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,300
Ready...

146
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,620
Set!

147
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,560
That's so creepy.

148
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,950
So creepy.

149
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,640
Amazing! Amazing!

150
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,430
Alright!

151
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,530
He's missing quite a few.

152
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,560
-Right, on the right side.
-He missed one.

153
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,680
-The platform's speed is fixed.
-I see.

154
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,370
So it's all skill.

155
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,080
But look at these ones, they are moving.

156
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,680
Oh, right.

157
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,970
It's getting harder.

158
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,970
By the way, it takes about 50 seconds to get to the finish line.

159
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,950
50 seconds?

160
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,900
He's missing a lot of them.

161
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,820
You're right.

162
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,230
You know...

163
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,870
I would also like it if you could keep in mind your expressions.

164
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,220
-They're running away from him.
-They move a lot.
-You can do it!

165
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,140
And you might even bite them while they run away.

166
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,400
They are running away.

167
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,390
-They really get away.
-This is hard.

168
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,340
It looks so hard.

169
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,890
Alright, that's it!

170
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,330
-I see...
-I don't get it.

171
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,260
Vacuum, how was it?

172
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,730
I felt it in my legs.

173
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,780
-What? For real?
-Really?

174
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,880
That's crazy.

175
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,650
Even a 29 year old guy like me ended up like this.

176
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,670
No way!

177
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,250
-You even seem like you work out.
-That's true!

178
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:30,870
For real?

179
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,320
It hurts a lot over here.

180
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,520
I see.

181
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,450
Let's look at Fujiwara's score!

182
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,100
Go ahead!

183
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,350
54!

184
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,750
-Is that good?
-How is that?

185
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,760
But out of how many is this?

186
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,390
So it takes around 54 seconds to get to the finish line.

187
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,620
-Right.
-Right.
-It's around 50 seconds.

188
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,380
So he got 1 for every second.

189
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,100
It might be good.

190
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,780
Yeah, it might be.

191
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,990
Let's see who's our next challenger!!

192
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,380
This persona comes and goes.

193
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,060
So annoying.

194
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,660
Maybe I should go next.

195
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,380
For real?

196
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,750
-I should...
-Hold on, did you say you were 29?
-I'm 29.

197
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,880
I'm 39.

198
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,500
So we're gonna see who's better?

199
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,470
You'll feel it right in your thighs.

200
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:15,650
But you know, he has had surprisingly good results on this series.
You'll feel it right in your thighs.

201
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,520
But you know, he has had surprisingly good results on this series.

202
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,030
You're trying hard, right?

203
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:22,720
-I'm quite confident.
-Right.

204
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,360
He's pretty confident.

205
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,690
Alright then, you should go.

206
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,500
Okay then, here I go.

207
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,390
-Alright.
-Go on.

208
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:27,770
Yes.

209
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,690
Ready...

210
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,890
Set!

211
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,300
Whoa, that's scary.

212
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,410
How will he fare?

213
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,290
He already missed one.

214
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,380
That was pretty fast.

215
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,460
This is pretty bad, no?

216
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,870
By the way, kissing the same one twice doesn't count.

217
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,270
Yes.

218
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,080
-You have no choice but to ignore the ones that pop up in your peripheral vision.
-You're right.

219
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,020
He did that for nothing.

220
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,410
Alright!

221
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,690
He's not hitting them.

222
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,880
However...

223
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,500
-He's not doing too bad...
-He's going.

224
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,880
-I feel like he's doing better than Vacuum.
-No way, no way.

225
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,860
He's not?

226
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,600
I don't think so, he's missed a lot.

227
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,580
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

228
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,850
Isn't he backing up a bit too much?

229
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,030
He's bumping against all those obstacles after all.

230
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,960
And it is quite fast.

231
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,470
-What do you think?
-He looks flabbergasted.

232
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,500
He looks exhausted.

233
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,470
Was it hard?

234
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,400
This hurts.

235
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,020
Huh?

236
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,000
My jaw is all stiff now.

237
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,480
Because of all the kissing...

238
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,760
Because of all the kisses?

239
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,870
Alright let's look at Yamazaki's score!

240
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,030
Whoa, amazing!

241
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,750
Awesome!

242
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,290
This is amazing.

243
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,080
-Awesome!
-Amazing!

244
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,630
This is amazing!

245
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,640
I didn't think the gap would be this big while I was watching you.

246
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:02,190
-I think where I differed from Vacuum, was that he went for the ones at the bottom.
-Right.

247
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,730
-Oh, you're right.
-That's so true.

248
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,440
-He got all the bottom ones.
-Yes.

249
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,380
He went down...

250
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,400
-But you can't do that unless you're a big masochist.
-Right, you have to go down...

251
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,800
You have to dive down.

252
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,460
Right, dive down.

253
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,440
So in that sense, masochists have an advantage in this challenge.

254
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,840
Then Hamada is at a real disadvantage.

255
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,610
Let's go to the next contestant!!

256
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,110
Honestly, I wanna see how this turns out.

257
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,190
We had a guy in his 20s and a guy in his 30s.

258
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,500
Now we have to do a guy in his 40s.

259
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,390
-How is the 40 year old guy gonna do?
-That's right.

260
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,150
-Alright then, I don't mind.
-I really wanna see how it turns out.

261
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,210
Hamada, the representative of the 40s.

262
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,050
How many kisses will he steal with his octopus lips?

263
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,220
Alright, let's go!

264
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,130
Please start!

265
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:47,930
How will he do?

266
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,300
Ready...

267
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,900
Set...

268
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,160
-Scary!
-That's scary.

269
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,640
He looks pretty good.

270
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,790
He's very good.

271
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,600
You're right.

272
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,210
-He got them all so far.
-He did.

273
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,470
-He's really getting them all.

274
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,270
Oh, he just missed one.

275
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,920
He missed one.

276
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,080
You should always ignore them if you mess up the timing.

277
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,760
Oh no, oh no, oh no!!

278
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,790
-This is bad!
-That's bad!

279
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,300
He missed a ton of them!

280
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,610
This is terrible!

281
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,160
He looked a bit dizzy there!

282
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,300
He's struggling!

283
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,540
Oh! He went for the bottom!

284
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,240
He's gonna fall!

285
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,480
-Look he's gonna fall.
-He missed about half of those.

286
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,590
Look at that face!
That expression!

287
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,290
-That was bad!
-The end!

288
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,580
That was so bad.

289
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,820
I'm very interested in these results.

290
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,020
-This is bad.
-It's terrible.

291
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,050
I can really feel it in my back.

292
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,550
It was really bad.

293
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,410
In the middle there you looked like Akira Shimizu.

294
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,330
This could be the lowest score yet!

295
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,720
What is Hamada's score?!

296
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,460
-Alright!!
-Yes!

297
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,040
Hamada, this is bad.

298
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,850
-I figured as much.
-Me too.

299
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,950
-I never thought there would be such a big gap between scores.
-For real...

300
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,070
Can I go next?

301
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,570
Endo?
Okay then.

302
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,510
You're going?

303
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,450
I'm going.

304
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,600
-Endo won't do good, I'm sure of it.
-Right...

305
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,670
-He's the kind of guy that just pokes the $@#% around.
-Right.

306
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,940
-He doesn't know what to do.
-That's so true.

307
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,250
That's why he was startled when he called us $@#% celebs.

308
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,420
He's the only one that reacted.

309
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,580
He looked at everyone with that "who?" face.

310
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,470
He straightened up right away.

311
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,460
And we didn't say anything.

312
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,020
Endo, the butt of the joke.

313
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,690
How will he do at the kissing machine?

314
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,040
Alright, let's go.

315
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,200
Please start!

316
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,200
Ready...

317
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,540
he must be excited.

318
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,420
Set...

319
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,910
This thing is so exhausting.

320
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,520
This one is actually harder than the ones we did before.

321
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,790
In terms of stamina as well.

322
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,720
-He's missing a few.
-He is, he is.

323
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,750
That must hurt!

324
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,260
He must be...

325
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,400
Look, he's not getting any!

326
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,490
-This is bad.
-This is really bad.

327
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,730
-It's bad!
-What's he doing?

328
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,220
You are done for if you fail there.

329
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,730
But he's coming back.

330
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,530
He's run out of steam.

331
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,650
But he didn't get that many, did he?

332
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,580
It's over!

333
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,860
I also got sprayed with that stuff, rigth?

334
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,950
-Yes, you did.
-Yeah.

335
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,950
I was like, "What the hell is that?".

336
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,480
Shozo! Shozo, did that break your heart?

337
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,780
-Honestly... Remember how we were getting hyped up back there?
-Yes.

338
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,840
I knew I was done for at that moment.

339
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,680
-Let's look at Endo's score!
-52... 52...

340
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,550
Show us!

341
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,320
52! 52!

342
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,190
I knew it!
It's because he fell.

343
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,550
You shouldn't fall.

344
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,280
Of course I was better!!

345
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,760
40...?

346
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,530
That's right.

347
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,210
Falling off the platform was really bad.

348
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,060
These guys have no clue.

349
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,140
Yeah, they are clueless.

350
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,510
It's pretty hard.

351
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,890
Right?

352
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,510
I have zero confidence now.

353
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,050
I shall go!

354
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,200
But I'm not confident at all.

355
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,490
Inomoto is feeling the pressure after seeing Endo's blunder up close.

356
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,770
How will he do at the kissing machine?

357
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,750
Alright, please start!

358
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,550
Ready...

359
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,860
Set...

360
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,260
The first part is the easiest.

361
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,730
This part...

362
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,060
Oh, he's missing a few.

363
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,320
Everyone does fine at this stage.

364
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,880
-This guy is ignoring a lot of them.
-He is, he is.

365
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,360
He might be ignoring them on purpose.

366
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,730
Maybe...

367
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,420
But he's doing much better than Endo.

368
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,700
He's pretty good.

369
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,960
-Endo was crumbling at this stage.
-You're right.

370
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,980
He was all wobbly around here.

371
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,700
-He came close to falling off.
-He's fine, he's fine.

372
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,080
Endo is in trouble.

373
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,500
Oh this is...

374
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,050
I don't know...

375
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,650
This part is so annoying.
You can't get anything.

376
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,610
Doesn't he look tired already?

377
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,460
-But he's definitely done more than Endo.
-You think so?

378
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,540
-This is good.
-The end!

379
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,620
-Endo really messed up by skipping the bottom ones.
-He really did.

380
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,110
I was panicking.

381
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,010
How do you think you did?

382
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,170
I was in full panic mode!

383
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,820
You look pretty exhausted.

384
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,900
I feel sick.
I might throw up.

385
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,870
Besides that...

386
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,050
Your movements were a bit...

387
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,410
You also briefly fell off the platform.

388
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,860
I was just rushing.
I just had to go faster.

389
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,110
I wonder how he did...

390
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,850
Alright, let's see his score!

391
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,870
-Alright!!
-Whoa, 49.

392
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,470
-He even beat me.
-True!

393
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,190
He beat Hamada...

394
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,570
Yeah.

395
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,380
Honestly, I don't think I'll lose to Tanaka.

396
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:32,970
Right.

397
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,550
At the very least I have to beat Endo's score of 40.

398
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,440
That's right.

399
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,020
Rather, why is it always a battle between these two?

400
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,270
Alright!!

401
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,630
-Hurry up and go.
You're so loud.
-Alright! Here I go!

402
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,980
Tanaka has already lost twice in this series.

403
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,970
Will he clear his name this time around?

404
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,190
-Tanaka.
-Yes?
-Are you ready?

405
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm ready!

406
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,690
Please start!

407
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,540
-I don't think he'll get to 40.
-Ready...

408
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,210
Set...

409
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,260
I don't think he's gonna do it.

410
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,060
From these three, Tanaka...

411
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,570
He's no good!

412
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,890
Good! Good! Good!

413
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,590
That's great!

414
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,870
He fell off!

415
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,010
He fell off again!

416
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,290
Why is he falling?

417
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,440
He's missing everything!

418
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,970
Whoa, he's getting left behind!

419
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,010
It left him behind!

420
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,010
Tanaka, you can do it!

421
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,930
That's super bad!

422
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,490
This is such a failure.

423
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,850
-He's picking back up.
-No, he's no good.

424
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,180
But you know he's not scoring any points.

425
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,130
He's going like this.

426
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,020
How many times are you falling off?!

427
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,770
Oh, this!

428
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,720
It's over!!

429
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,810
How'd he do?

430
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,180
-How'd he do?
-This is bad.

431
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,030
-How many times did he fall?
-Tanaka...

432
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,550
-Tanaka.
-Tanaka.

433
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,970
He's the most exhausted.

434
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,380
-I must thank you.
His face is pale white.

435
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,980
-Your face is pale white.
-You're right.

436
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,010
That was something...

437
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,570
What happened to you?

438
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,900
What went wrong?

439
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,030
He looks like one of the people in "The 8-Tomb Village".
(Japanese mystery movie)

440
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,070
I hate this contest the most.

441
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,980
He's afraid of the running away faces.

442
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,210
He's afraid his bride will run away from him.

443
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,320
Alright, Tanaka!

444
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,380
-Shall we see?
-Yes.

445
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,050
What is the score?!

446
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,520
Come one!

447
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,930
Alright!!

448
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,440
I knew it!!

449
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,720
Is this for real?

450
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,840
33?!

451
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,480
-It's almost half of Hosei!
-Half!

452
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,350
What the heck...

453
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,630
33 is so bad.

454
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,110
Are you serious?

455
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,580
With that being said...
Tanaka is the loser!!

456
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,360
Tanaka's punishment is: "Poster Kissing Pervert at the Shopping District".

457
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,870
You'll know what it is once you get there.

458
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,750
-Have a nice trip!
-Good luck!

459
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,130
Seriously?!

460
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,810
This project should just end already!

461
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,050
This series too!

462
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,460
I really hate this.

463
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,290
I can't win...

464
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,710
I really can't win...

465
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,780
This is a punishment and I won't quit until I get it done...

466
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,360
So let's get going.

467
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,520
I will kiss every single poster hanging in this shopping district.

468
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,670
I will try my best.

469
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,620
Here we go!

470
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,920
Damn it.

471
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,020
I'm really getting that Asakusa vibe.

472
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,210
Alright.

473
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,180
Where are they?

474
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,100
Over here?

475
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,110
Alright.

476
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,560
Looking for them is such a pain in the ass...

477
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,950
This is a poster, right?

478
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,260
This one...

479
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,820
Alright.

480
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,400
Let's go.

481
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:29,990
Let's go.

482
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,540
What am I doing...?

483
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,030
Okay.

484
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,720
Alright, okay.

485
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,650
Isn't this Eiko Segawa?

486
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,290
Alright, let's go.

487
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,780
Shall we do it?

488
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,820
Ehm... Mr. Tanaka?

489
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,260
Yes?

490
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,200
Is that you?

491
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,540
Yes... Yes...

492
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,460
Are you filming?

493
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,010
Yes...

494
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,050
Right!

495
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,830
This is Asakusa!!

496
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,750
I kinda hate this.

497
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,240
Excuse me.

498
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,750
Alright, let's keep going.

499
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,800
The king...

500
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,670
Impulse...

501
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,560
True...

502
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,250
There's a ton of these.

503
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,980
Let's go.

504
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,430
Whoa, I can't reach this one.

505
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:25,280
I see... "Nude T heather Rockza".

506
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,370
Whoa, Asakusa 21st Century...

507
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,350
There's another one.

508
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,290
Another Asakusa 21st Century...

509
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,340
I've never seen this Monchhichi.
(Stuffed monkey toys similar to beanie babies)

510
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,290
There's a ton of them here...

511
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,600
Let's get it done...

512
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,450
I have to do it.

513
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,010
Alright!

514
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,100
Alright!

515
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,210
Oh, Eiko Segawa!

516
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,890
We meet again!

517
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,230
Let's do it.

518
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,740
Is this a poster?

519
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,060
I don't know...
