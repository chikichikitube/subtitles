1
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,840
Well, yes, I did simulations

2
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,780
In conclusion, I want to win in quantity, it may be boring and lame, but I want to win in terms of quantity

3
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,420
I'm Marin with the best pussy in Kitakyushu

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,250
The atmosphere there is really unique

5
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,320
You have no idea what's interesting anymore

6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,990
Or what's not interesting as well

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,430
It's gonna come out as a bird

8
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,730
You're saying the wrong joke all the time

9
00:00:53,170 --> 00:01:01,170
In regard to setting the mood, I bet Matsumoto-san is thinking "Fujimon, this dude is doing a fantastic job!"

10
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,780
He didn't say that to me though

11
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,450
He didn't, but I bet so, I bet he's thinking about it

12
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,050
Ahh, it's soda water?

13
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,980
Oh, so it's soda water

14
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,870
Yellow card, Jimmy   -Yes

15
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,410
"Sometimes it's sunny, Takajin"

16
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,680
"Be a little rough, Blue jeans"

17
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,510
Why are you looking this way, dude

18
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,950
Orange card!   -Eh?!

19
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,690
Eh? Orange all of sudden?   -Yes, orange

20
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,160
It hurts! My nose hurts!

21
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,520
You bastard...Fujimori...

22
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,630
I shouldn't have listened to you

23
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,330
You're out!   -Number one

24
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,740
The number one...

25
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,050
I really wanted to watch soda water (in his nose)

26
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,850
You want to watch it too, right?

27
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,980
(Yeah, really wanted to watch soda water)

28
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,320
(But that wasn't possible, due to the timing)

29
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,490
Let's start

30
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,630
Does anybody need a towel?

31
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,430
A towel?

32
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,430
I don't need a towel

33
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,200
Is there anything for me to wipe then?

34
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,310
Something to wipe?...

35
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,640
Eh?

36
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,140
Just wipe the oven then

37
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,080
The oven

38
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,440
The oven?   -Yes

39
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,680
Wipe the oven? Got it

40
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,720
Like this?

41
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,390
That's the stove

42
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,850
It started already?   -Yes

43
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,920
Which one is the oven?

44
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,690
The oven?

45
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,990
Which one is the oven?

46
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,960
The oven? Is there an oven in here?

47
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,560
What happened to you?

48
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,530
(The way she's talking...)

49
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,430
People are going to see your nipples

50
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,470
You're looking at my nipples, right?

51
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,270
No, I'm not though...

52
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,510
He definitely looked at my nipples, right?

53
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,210
He said "people are going to see your nipples"...

54
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,210
There's a tape sticking to your barefoot too

55
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:34,890
(Tomochika and Yuriyan started an improvised performance as a Geisha, which involves traditional Japanese dance and uses gesture to tell a story)

56
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,710
(This is amazing)

57
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,250
"The phone rings"

58
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,160
"I'm not going to say 'Hello' though"

59
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,630
"Clean up the room, clean up the room"

60
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,970
"I have to clean up the room"

61
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,570
"My job is to clean up the room"

62
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,240
We can clearly see it

63
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,980
"People can clearly see it"

64
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,740
It's completely exposed

65
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,880
"Please hide it for me, please"

66
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,250
Jinnai, please hide it for her

67
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,020
Please hide it for her, Jinnai   -Please face the reality

68
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,190
Please hide it for her, she's a girl too, so please

69
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,490
He's at a loss

70
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,930
We can see it, clearly

71
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,630
Jinnai, fix it for her   -It looks like a mic

72
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,530
Jinnai, please fix it for her   -Your nipple is synchronized with the mic

73
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,440
But it's gonna be a problem if I touch it

74
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,810
Please use this to show her that it's exposed

75
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,810
The whole tip is exposed

76
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,120
Well done for holding on

77
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,160
(Incredible)

78
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,440
(That's tough)

79
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,210
(It's interesting, it's really interesting)

80
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,980
(What's going on?)

81
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,060
(Fujimon is very close, very very close)

82
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,830
"Should I go this way?"

83
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,370
"Nope, I'll go this way and turn around"

84
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,840
That was so close

85
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,750
Come on, stop it! I hate this!

86
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,280
That was so close

87
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,380
I don't want this anymore! Please!

88
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,620
Come on, no more, please!

89
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,920
That was so interesting, what was that?

90
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,960
That's really interesting

91
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,100
That was so interesting

92
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,330
That was interesting

93
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,100
That's tough

94
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,200
We watched it in the studio, and still, it was so interesting

95
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,270
Her role as the master is really pissing me off

96
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,610
It seems like it's going to end for once, but then...

97
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,510
They were targeting Jinnai

98
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,650
It's dirty to target one person

99
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,220
Let's take a look

100
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,490
Actually, Fujimon is already...

101
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,960
He's already laughing   -Yeah, he's kind of laughing

102
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,560
That shouldn't be allowed, but...

103
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,960
"Should I go this way?"

104
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,530
"Nope, I'll go this way and turn around"

105
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,970
Come on, I saw a huge, huge butt coming to me

106
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,410
I see

107
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,380
Her collaboration with the master is really pissing me off

108
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,010
Jinnai already got a yellow card

109
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,720
I actually can't decide this

110
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,520
No, no please, brother, it's orange

111
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,420
Umm...   -Please, give me one more chance

112
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,520
Well, it wasn't took clearly...

113
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,620
Please, please...   -Umm...

114
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,360
Okay, orange then...   -Thank god

115
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,360
And Fujimon, seriously...

116
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,730
That crying face is unforgivable too   -Not even a crying face?

117
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,730
No, not that face

118
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,570
That's already like 80 or 90 percent laughing

119
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,570
So that's not acceptable

120
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,370
Okay, so crying faces are not allowed too

121
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,810
Yes, please keep that in mind

122
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,440
I don't want that anymore

123
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,550
So both of them scored points for that

124
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,850
Hooray!

125
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,280
Go get changed, dude!

126
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,290
Go get changed, and don't look this way!

127
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,620
Stop it, honestly, please stop it

128
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,160
That was so close

129
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,930
If Jinnai didn't laugh for another 10 seconds, I bet I'll be the one laughing

130
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,930
That's enough, honestly, that's enough

131
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,740
Let's start

132
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,740
Damn it

133
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,270
I'll take Fujimon for the next one

134
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,440
I told you to go get changed

135
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,710
Why are they coming in turns?

136
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,850
Excuse me, I heard that we can try dance lessons here?

137
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,880
It's not here

138
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,350
(She's being really aggressive here)
It's over there

139
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,830
(She's being really aggressive)

140
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,260
I heard that we can try dance lessons here?

141
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,860
It's probably next door

142
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,130
I think you got it wrong

143
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,730
Kamei Shizuka-san? (former Japanese politician)

144
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,130
*Haruna is always being teased about looking like male celebrities, and it has become a routine gag for her to reply with "No, I'm freaking not!"

145
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,130
No, I'm Iwaki Nobuko (another Japanese politician)

146
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,170
I think I heard some noise like "Ching Tong Chang" just now

147
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,980
It's next door

148
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,780
I'm passionate and energetic, I'm Iwaki Nobuko (the title of Iwaki's book)

149
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,580
You're not wearing pink today, huh?

150
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,320
*Iwaki Nobuko is known for her pink suits

151
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,320
Yes, I changed it, because I lost the election

152
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,960
And you changed it to green?   -Yes

153
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,290
I heard "Ching Tong Chang" just now...

154
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,360
It's from the room next door

155
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,360
Not from here

156
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,250
(Very interesting)

157
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,920
"I have no idea why am I here"

158
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,490
"But I want to say thanks to my parents"

159
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,270
"I'm glad that I was born in this world"

160
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,870
"Say this to your parents"

161
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:09,780
"Say thank you to your parents"

162
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,480
"The girls army is coming to you!"

163
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,060
"You know what I'm talking about, right? Hey, Jinnai?"

164
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,090
(What's going on?)

165
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,190
(This is hilarious)

166
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,160
(Huh?)

167
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,000
(Should this be counted?)

168
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,040
(Fujimon...)

169
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,210
"Where are you going?"

170
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:45,980
"I will not give up on you"

171
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,530
I hate this! Come on!

172
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,200
Come on!!!

173
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,900
I feel pity for Jinnai

174
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,470
That's dirty!

175
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,510
Why did that dude come out again along with "Papa-ra-pa"?

176
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,910
This is cruel   -Very cruel

177
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,150
They're completely targeting you

178
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,080
This is too dirty

179
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:25,160
Well, maybe that's their strategy to take you guys down one by one

180
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,360
Let's take a look

181
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:37,300
"I will not give up on you"

182
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,070
(The tune changed here)

183
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,510
Come on, that dude is just...they even changed the tune

184
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,580
Yeah, they changed the tune

185
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,450
No one expected that

186
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,290
Oh, come on...

187
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,160
Are you out?

188
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,360
Yes, I am...

189
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,960
Jinnai, you're out!

190
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,160
Ahh, really?

191
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,710
What was that "Papa-ra-pa"? Come on...

192
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,610
Ahh, really?

193
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,140
Let's go

194
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,410
The girls are strong

195
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,480
The girls are really strong   -Yes, they are

196
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,590
I'm so frustrated

197
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,120
You didn't make it this time, again

198
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,390
Yeah, I didn't make it

199
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,590
Well, I think I've entered the "zone"

200
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,500
I laughed at Yuriyan's dance for once

201
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,700
And while I'm still thinking "I mustn't laugh at that this time", here comes another dancer Haruna

202
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:49,170
"I have no idea why am I here"

203
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,440
"But I want to say thanks to my parents"

204
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,850
I just have to say, I've entered the "zone"

205
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,750
With Tomochika changing the tune and Yuriyan appearing just in time

206
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:06,090
I feel like it's a perfect stage prepared for me

207
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,390
And I just laughed naturally

208
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,830
Come on, please go get changed...

209
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,270
(So Tomochika is scoring a lot of points for this)

210
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,440
(Tomochika is really strong, right?)

211
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,540
It's almost like we've prepared it beforehand   -Exactly

212
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,850
Okay, let's start

213
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,790
I would have laughed if Jinnai wasn't here

214
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,450
Please go get changed, come on...

215
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,260
He's right

216
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,460
Please...

217
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,960
Shoji-san is making something

218
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,460
What are you making?

219
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,300
Well, I'm not actually making it

220
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,370
(Here it comes)

221
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,170
(Shoji-san's favorite gag)

222
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
(Shoji-san really likes this)

223
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,140
It's impossible to be a Talento forever, right?

224
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,640
So that's how you make it

225
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,180
What are you making?

226
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,050
Eh?

227
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,210
What are you making?

228
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,720
The head of a frog

229
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,090
So it's not a food?

230
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,520
It's not a food?

231
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,090
Yes, it is a food

232
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,360
What do you mean by the head of a frog then?

233
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,030
That's a joke

234
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,630
That's just a joke

235
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,930
Yes, that's just a joke

236
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,000
It's impossible to stay in the Owarai world forever, right?

237
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,110
Seriously, what are you making?

238
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,370
It's an experiment!

239
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,510
In case I lost my job and become unemployed

240
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,850
Never think that you can be a Talento forever, that's gonna hit you hard

241
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,250
How many times are you saying that?

242
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,250
Never think that you can always...

243
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,250
Let me say it 4 more times!...

244
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,590
Never think that they'll always be here, your parents and money

245
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:49,890
Well, of course

246
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,900
Anyway...

247
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,800
Can you go get changed?

248
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,100
Go get changed

249
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,900
But that's her style

250
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,610
I have pride in this

251
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,440
She has pride in that...

252
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,180
What are you going to do with this?

253
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,650
Where are you going?   -Please wait a second

254
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,460
It's really cool to do that, like she's putting on some hair gel

255
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,760
Like Aladdin

256
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Amazing, that's a beautiful Fuji forehead (widow’s peak)

257
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,430
Yeah, it is

258
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,500
Fuji forehead A, Fuji forehead B, Fuji forehead C, Fuji forehead D

259
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,670
Yeah, exactly

260
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,910
Fuji forehead A

261
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,910
Umm...may I...umm...

262
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,680
Yes?

263
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,180
Umm...I stink, so...

264
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,790
I smell like sesame oil

265
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,260
How come?

266
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,030
Well, I smell like sesame oil

267
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,390
Did you use sesame oil?

268
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,460
Yeah, sesame oil

269
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,100
Of course you'll smell like sesame oil, if you're bringing sesame oil with you

270
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,340
Yeah, you're right

271
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,070
I like the smell of sesame oil

272
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,870
Oh, you like it?   -Yes

273
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,540
That's it?

274
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,610
That's it

275
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,250
With just that?

276
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,580
With just that

277
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,520
Yes

278
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,520
Is he the villain?

279
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,090
He's the villain

280
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:29,930
If you have the power, please stand up and save Japan

281
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,800
Please!

282
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,470
Here I go!

283
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,630
Checkmate!

284
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,540
Why don't you fight back?

285
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,450
Brigham Young once said...

286
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,090
"I have to save Japan"

287
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:42,230
"Although this has never been proven in history"

288
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,110
"However, well-known people usually think like this"

289
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,380
"Never walk backwards"

290
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,510
"Live with no regrets"

291
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:02,790
"And the most important thing that I always keep in my mind is..."

292
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,160
"To have a dream"

293
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,860
"You have a chance too"

294
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:17,970
"If the children are going to save the world in the future"

295
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,440
"Then you shall save the world now"

296
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,880
"You are trying to escape"

297
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,880
"You are trying to escape"

298
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,250
"You are just trying to escape from here"

299
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,680
"You are trying to escape from the family"

300
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:41,730
How could this be allowed? This is too dirty!

301
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,330
Are you okay?

302
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,070
That's ridiculous

303
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,830
They came to take me down together

304
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,340
But Jimmy-san, that's not acceptable

305
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,870
Don't try to hide your face

306
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,740
I really didn't want to laugh, they're pissing me off

307
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,650
It's unacceptable to hide your face in the refrigerator anyway

308
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,080
You're just hiding your face

309
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,250
These gals are really pissing me off

310
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,550
Yeah, Tomochika is so mean

311
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,320
She's so mean   -Very mean

312
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,690
She's scoring so many points

313
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,090
She's so mean, seriously

314
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,930
Without getting her hands dirty

315
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,230
Pulling strings behind the scene, what a terrifying women!

316
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,000
"You are trying to escape"

317
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,410
"You are trying to escape"

318
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,780
(Actually, Jimmy is already laughing here)

319
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,880
(This is not acceptable)

320
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,220
"You are trying to escape"

321
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,520
"You are just trying to escape from here"

322
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,490
"You are trying to escape from the family"

323
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,600
You collapsed on the floor!

324
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,800
I tried so hard to hold back this time and I came this far

325
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,100
Why me? Why are they targeting me?

326
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,340
Well, you only got a yellow card and you tried to hold back, so I'll give you an orange card

327
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,510
Orange   -Orange

328
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,980
That was awful

329
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,880
I don't want these girls to be here

330
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,380
They're working together as a team

331
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,450
Please stop collaborating, come on

332
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,450
Not sure if that should be prohibited though

333
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,720
Well then, Fujimon, you can collaborate with Jimmy too

334
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,130
Even if we two collaborate, probably nothing good will come out of it

335
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,460
Well, that's hard to tell

336
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,220
What happened?

337
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,230
Please hide it

338
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,440
It's gonna pinch your breasts

339
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,240
Yeah, my breasts...

340
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,040
Do you play guitar?

341
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,840
Yes

342
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,420
You laughed just now, right?

343
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,130
Nope...

344
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,460
I didn't laugh...

345
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,430
Oh, is it?

346
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,700
Oh, is it

347
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,170
Nope, I didn't laugh

348
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,050
(They're nasty!)

349
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,100
(Fujimon have no choice but to join them)

350
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,880
Perfect timing

351
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,740
Hey! Come on!

352
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,020
No...no...

353
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,460
I'm just knocking it like this...that's it...

354
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:08,760
Excuse me

355
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,340
Who are you?

356
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,210
You mean me?

357
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,410
Infinite testicles syndrome

358
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,960
He bursted into laughter?

359
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,760
"Ta-hahaha"?

360
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,400
I didn't expect that!

361
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,470
What happened?   -No idea at all

362
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,870
His testicles got me

363
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,600
You weren't even looking at him

364
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,840
You only heard it

365
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,340
"Ta-ha-ha"

366
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,880
He was laughing so loud that I didn't understand what's going on at first

367
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,080
He was laughing so loud that I thought he's not laughing

368
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,710
"Ta-ha-ha"

369
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,450
It's almost like he's actually not laughing

370
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,450
As if that's actually legit

371
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,490
Who are you?

372
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,550
You mean me?

373
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,690
(He tried to escape and went that way, because he knows he's going to laugh)

374
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,990
Infinite testicles syndrome

375
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,070
He bursted into laughter

376
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,830
So, Jimmy

377
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,100
You're out

378
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,250
That's the loudest laugh in Documental history

379
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,080
"Ta-hahaha"

380
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,150
Infinite testicles syndrome

381
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,020
Infinite testicles syndrome got me

382
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,990
That's a syndrome though   -Yeah, a syndrome...

383
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:55,130
I didn't expect Tomochika and the girls army to work so well together

384
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,900
The arrogant and outrageous Kasae at the roadside

385
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,540
That's so long

386
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,310
I'm Marin with the best pussy in Kitakyushu

387
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,280
And I'm actually really weak at dirty jokes

388
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,220
I won't laugh at testicles, but that infinite syndrome was just...

389
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,650
Infinite testicles syndrome

390
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,890
How much did you pay so far?

391
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,730
4 million now, and seriously...

392
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:31,000
Please forgive me if I'm on the news tomorrow

393
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,840
Let's start

394
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,080
You're so beautiful

395
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,290
No, please don't say that

396
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,120
That's not good

397
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,390
You're beautiful

398
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,590
Please don't seduce me

399
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:56,730
I do not belong to anyone

400
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,330
How many days a week do you work here?

401
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,230
About 5 days a week

402
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,800
You're beautiful

403
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,900
Please leave me alone

404
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,540
My husband will be jealous

405
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,940
How long have you two been married?

406
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,340
It's a second marriage for both of us, so...

407
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,010
Well, 4 years now

408
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,080
It's embarrassing to talk about my age, but...

409
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,620
My kids can take care of themselves now

410
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,950
And they said to me "Mom, feel free to start a second life"

411
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,120
And that's when I met him

412
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,020
Meisa?

413
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,230
He's your son?

414
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,830
Yes, he's my son

415
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,800
Your mom is really beautiful

416
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,770
Very beautiful, very sexy

417
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,490
Is it here?

418
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,060
What do you mean?

419
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,860
Bee complaints

420
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,060
Bee?

421
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,730
Bee complaints

422
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:09,230
Oh, so you're a bee exterminator?

423
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,500
Yes, because someone contacted me

424
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:17,140
But although your face is being protected...

425
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,310
-Your arms are completely exposed
-That's too dangerous, what if it stings you?

426
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,910
I'm always being stung

427
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,580
Is it fine?

428
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,490
It's dangerous if you got stung two times in a row, right?

429
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:35,130
But I have im...imm...immunity to it

430
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,260
Mei-eki?   -Immunity (men-eki)

431
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,660
*Immunity (men-eki) and Nagoya station (mei-eki) sounds similar

432
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,360
You mean the Nagoya station?

433
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,660
That's Mei-eki

434
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,610
He was like "ha-hum"

435
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,850
Very naturally

436
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,820
No, no, no

437
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,150
You said "ha-hum"

438
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,050
Did I?

439
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,050
Of course you did

440
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,320
That's just the sound of my breath

441
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,390
But you never breathed like that before

442
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:10,390
Yes, exactly, that's it

443
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,330
So you did laugh, right?

444
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,730
I heard him saying "Hum-hum-hum"

445
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,700
Yes, he did   -He was like "Hum-hum-hum"

446
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,170
No, that's really just the sound of my breath

447
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,840
No, no, no   -Let's take a look

448
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:28,750
But I have im...imm...immunity to it

449
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,850
Mei-eki?   -Immunity (men-eki)

450
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,080
*Immunity (men-eki) and Nagoya station (mei-eki) sounds similar

451
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,750
You mean the Nagoya station?

452
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,080
That's Mei-eki

453
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,920
Huh?   -What was that?

454
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,090
What was that?

455
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,460
This is so difficult to judge

456
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,030
What was that?   -Yeah, what was that sound?

457
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,100
To be honest, I was just thinking "Um-hum, that was quite interesting"

458
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,470
So you're laughing?

459
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,510
No, I'm not laughing

460
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,810
I'll be a bit harsh for this one

461
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:00,210
Yeah, he did actually laugh

462
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,110
Yellow

463
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,110
My first card

464
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,150
It's difficult to judge Tomochika too

465
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,920
She laughed during her performance as another character

466
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,250
How should that be judged?

467
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,060
Haruna, you laughed as well, right?

468
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,390
Even when you're performing, if you go too far, I'll count it as laughing too

469
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,730
In regard to this, I actually laughed during my performance too

470
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,300
So honest   -Very honest

471
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,500
You're so honest

472
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,920
I ordered food delivery just now

473
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,690
So tiny

474
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,990
That's too tiny

475
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,300
This should be enough for 3 people

476
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,760
No way, that's not for 3 people

477
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,930
Octopus, shrimp, sea urchin

478
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,370
Octopus, shrimp, sea urchin

479
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,600
Oh, no it's not

480
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,540
Octopus, shrimp...

481
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,640
*The shape of the Octopus sushi looks similar to the Shikoku island

482
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,640
Nope, it's shrimp, sea urchin, Shikoku*

483
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,680
The island of Shikoku, the island of liveliness

484
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,410
Ise-shi has a lot of visitors because of the seaport in Tsu-shi. Tsu-shi is prosperous because of the Grand Shrine in Ise-shi.

485
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,110
*This is a folk song popular during the Edo period, which praises the Nagoya Castle

486
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,110
And we Owari Nagoya has the Nagoya Castle

487
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,250
*The original phrase is to hold back and "Eat nothing and drink nothing before you arrive Numazu"

488
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,250
Eat nothing and drink nothing when you arrive Numazu*

489
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,260
Tsume has no Tsume, yet Uri has Tsume

490
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:21,160
*This is a phrase used to memorize the difference between two similar Kanji, Tsume (爪) and Uri (瓜)

491
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,160
That's how you write it in Kanji

492
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,760
When the mountain smiles, the rivers will disappear

493
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,170
Is it true or is it just superstition?

494
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:34,770
Is it superstition? (Mei Shin ka)

495
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,710
Shin Ka Mei

496
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:39,840
The Meishin Expressway is now congested with traffic for 50km

497
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,080
Ahh...so slow...

498
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,390
Who are you?

499
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
Excuse me

500
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,400
Will I see you again?

501
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,430
Who knows?

502
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,100
When will you come next time?

503
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,870
I'll come whenever I want to come

504
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,840
That is my choice

505
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,310
Why are you always so capricious?

506
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,840
I'm capricious?

507
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,580
Well, that's because...

508
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,280
A capricious journey

509
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,520
That start of a love story

510
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:26,520
And when I open my eyes

511
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,790
It's you!

512
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,100
When will you be here next time?

513
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,270
Please don't escape from love

514
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:42,910
(Uh-oh?)

515
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,310
You won't be able to escape!

516
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,640
(He got caught)

517
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,780
Jenny, who gets lonely easily
(He got caught)

518
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,650
Come on! Come on!

519
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,490
Jenny got it! Jenny got it!

520
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:01,630
*This is a phrase used to describe that it is considered to be good luck to dream of Mount Fuji, a hawk, and an eggplant in the first dream one has in the new year

521
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:01,630
First Fuji, second hawk, third eggplant

522
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,690
Inside that helmet...

523
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,860
There's a quail egg in it

524
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,630
Really?

525
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,340
Oh no!

526
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,600
(Someone laughed?)

527
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,470
(Who laughed?)

528
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,470
Oh my god!
(Tomochika laughed)

529
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,540
She saved me!

530
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,380
That was like hell

531
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,780
That's so rare

532
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,210
Self-destruction?

533
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,620
That's not like you

534
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,720
What was so funny?

535
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,820
Actually, whenever these two people sing and dance, I'm trying so hard to hold back my laughter

536
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,090
Really? You were holding back?   -Yes

537
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,890
I paid full attention to Fujimon only

538
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:13,630
Yeah, you should, that was like hell   -Yes, it was hell

539
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,070
What the hell did you gals do to me?

540
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,130
And the other guys are not coming out at all

541
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:20,070
Yeah, those two guys   -They are so mean

542
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:23,310
It was like a cheap musical

543
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,340
Let's take a look, that really surprised me

544
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,120
(What is she even trying to do?)

545
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,060
(She completely laughed)

546
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,360
This might be a bit harsh to Tomochika, but...

547
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,860
I'll give her an orange card straight away

548
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,130
But Tomochika scored many points

549
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,200
I see

550
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,040
How many times did you gals perform those musicals? Come on!

551
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,340
Seriously, those musical theaters...

552
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,380
Because these two girls are always starting it

553
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,780
The guys are not coming out at all   -Yeah, they're not coming out!

554
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,420
That's no good, I'll give you a penalty if you stay inside for too long

555
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,420
Yes, please tell them about this

556
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,820
Why are you coming right to me?

557
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,460
What was that "dog-dog-dog"?

558
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,890
What's going on?

559
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,070
Let's start

560
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,780
Maeda really likes sunglasses, huh?

561
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,350
Hello everybody

562
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,390
Don't mind me

563
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,220
You catch my eye though

564
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,660
We're curious about you

565
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,400
No, please don't mind me

566
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,330
Well, of course we'll be curious

567
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,600
Please don't mind me

568
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,130
So curious...

569
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,500
No, excuse me

570
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,140
I'm just a single father passing by here

571
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,950
Are you milking?

572
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,550
Yes, I have to extract milk

573
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,850
It's not gonna come out, not for man   -It's coming out though

574
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,490
No way, it won't

575
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,320
Quite a lot came out though

576
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,460
Yeah, it's coming out

577
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,460
So it's father's milk, not mother's milk

578
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,200
Yes

579
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,500
Father's milk (Fu-nyuu)

580
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,330
Fu-nyuu   -Ha-nyuu?

581
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,170
Funyu Yuzuru   -Yes, Funyu Yuzuru

582
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,400
*Hanyu Yuzuru is a famous Japanese figure skater

583
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,400
No, it's Hanyu

584
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,110
(That's preposterous)

585
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,810
I'm back

586
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,280
I'm Funyu Yuzuru

587
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,280
It's Hanyu   -The ring is...

588
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,560
You saw it, right?

589
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,390
No, we didn't

590
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,790
It's exposed

591
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,630
What's exposed?

592
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,330
Your nipples are exposed

593
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:00,300
"Your nipples are exposed"

594
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:05,970
"My nipples are nearly exposed"

595
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:11,210
"My nipples are completely exposed"

596
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,110
"Boobs, boobs, boobs..."

597
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,780
"Boobs, boobs, boobs..."

598
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,450
"Here a boob, there a boob"

599
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,290
"When I'm sleeping, when I'm awake, it's all about boobs"

600
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,860
"So glad to be born as boobs"

601
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,060
You didn't get it right

602
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,920
(Fujimon?)

603
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,120
Dodosuko?*

604
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:32,360
*"Dodosuko-suko-suko...I love you" is a gag by Tanoshingo

605
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:31,220
Dodosuko-suko-suko, Dodosuko-suko-suko...

606
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,360
I love you

607
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,890
Dodosuko-suko-suko, Dodosuko-suko-suko...

608
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,160
I want to eat picked eggplant

609
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,400
Dodosuko-suko-suko, Dodosuko-suko-suko...

610
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,770
My molars are gone and disappeared

611
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:55,110
And then I found it on the floor

612
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,180
Aren't you laughing?

613
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,180
You're laughing, right?

614
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,390
Eww, his nose hairs are sticking out

615
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,160
You're not Dave!

616
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,400
Who are you?

617
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,780
This uncle is so strange!

618
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,360
What are you doing here?

619
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,790
Don't talk to me like that

620
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,360
Don't talk to me like that

621
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,130
Yes, you're right

622
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,160
*"Henna Ojisan", which literally means strange uncle, is a famous character created by Shimura Ken

623
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,160
I'm Henna Ojisan*

624
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,370
I'm Henna Ojisan, so I'm Henna Ojisan

625
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:53,040
I'm Henna Ojisan, so I'm Henna Ojisan

626
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,640
I'm Henna Ojisan, so I'm Henna Ojisan

627
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,510
He's Henna Ojisan, so he's Henna Ojisan

628
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,750
He's Henna Ojisan, so he's Henna Ojisan

629
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,510
She's Henna Obasan, so she's Henna Obasan (strange auntie)

630
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,180
She's Henna Obasan, so she's Henna Obasan

631
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,190
She's Henna Obasan, so she's Henna Obasan

632
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:13,160
She's Henna Obasan, so she's Henna Obasan

633
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,590
Can clearly see her nipples

634
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:28,610
This guy touched the side of my breasts

635
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,840
This uncle is so strange!

636
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,480
Get out of here!

637
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,210
Yes, you're right

638
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,550
I'm Henna Ojisan

639
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,790
I'm Henna Ojisan, so I'm Henna Ojisan

640
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,650
I'm Henna Ojisan, so I'm Henna Ojisan

641
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,090
(That's barren)

642
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,790
(It's interesting though)

643
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,070
Where are you going?

644
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:13,880
She's double eyelid now

645
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,860
She's single eyelid before

646
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,890
So cute   -She's looking sharp

647
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,460
Thank you

648
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,830
Oh, Shoji-san too

649
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,660
Shoji-san too

650
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,000
She's imitating someone...

651
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:34,640
Mori Shinichi-san? (Enka singer and composer)

652
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,040
*The original phrase is "My Dear Mother" (Ohukuro-san), a famous song by Mori Shinichi, which sounds similar to paper bag (Kami-hukuro)

653
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,040
My Dear Paper Bag (Kami-hukuro)

654
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,780
It should be My Dear Mother (Ohukuro-san)

655
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,780
My Dear Twisted Bag (Neji-hukuro)

656
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,320
Twisted bag?   -It's My Dear Mother (Ohukuro-san)

657
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,420
My Dear Little Pouch (Ko-hukuro)

658
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,290
It should be My Dear Mother (Ohukuro-san)

659
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,720
My Dear Paper Bag (Kami-hukuro)

660
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,390
Someone said that already

661
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,290
Someone said that?

662
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,660
I didn't hear that

663
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,530
She clearly said it though

664
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:05,500
Okay, so are the zombies ready?

665
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,540
What should we do?

666
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,570
Ahh, I'm not really confident about it

667
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,340
Well, I did prepare a gag though

668
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,940
Let's go for the zombies?

669
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,980
Okay, let's go

670
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,150
Zombie time

671
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,150
Hello everybody   -Hello

672
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,720
Hello, he's Mr Jimmy   -I'm Jimmy

673
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,520
Mr Jimmy?   -Yes

674
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,230
You are Mr Jimmy right?   -Yes

If someone saw you?

679
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:50,750
I feel like I can get a girl today

680
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,350
Make her pregnant

681
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,820
Say "I bet there will be"

682

684
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,020
Not here, dude!

685
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,320
You have to say "I bet there will be"

I bet there will...

Not here, dude!

688

Excuse me, please listen to Mr Jimmy's erotic Shigin

690

To the love hotel   -To the love hotel?

692
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:20,080
I bet there will be condoms

693
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,080
Of course there will, dude!

694
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,850
Of course the hotel will have condoms, Jimmy!

695
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:26,680

00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,570
Don't raise the red one, then raise the red one

707
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,470
Raise the red one

708
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,080

Lower the red...   -It's all about the red one, dude!

711
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,310
So hot

712
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:58,180
No it's not hot

713
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,880
It's all about the red one, dude!

714
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,720
Here comes the "Guess what is Jimmy saying?" corner

715
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,790
So many varieties

716
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:09,390
So please guess what's Jimmy saying

717
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,530
Okay, I see, so what is he saying?

718

Pee-po, Pee-po, Pee

719
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,800
That's just the sound

720
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,040
Why? Why?

721
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,780
Exactly, exactly

722
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,440
So Jimmy, what's the correct answer?

723
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,510
Jingisukan

724
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,550
Completely different, dude!

725
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:31,250
So hot

726
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,320
No it's not hot

727
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:37,220
Why are you feeling hot? And the pronunciation of Jingisukan is completely different from Pee-po, Pee-po!

728
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:40,020
Here comes the "Guess what is Jimmy singing?" corner

729
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,120
Please do it, Jimmy-chan

730
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,700
Okay, so what is Jimmy singing?

731
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,700
Fight, fight

732
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,300
Fight, fight

733
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,970
Hachiro, Hachiro

734
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:54,940
Hachiro, Hachiro

735
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,810
I am Hachiro

736
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:57,810
It should be a song though

737
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,710
That was interesting, huh? Jimmy-chan?

738
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,880
That was so funny

739
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,050
Yeah, that was funny

740
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,590
So Jimmy-chan, what's the correct answer?

741
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:12,690
Belly button, belly button, belly button

742
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:14,160
What the heck was that!

743
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,890
So hot   -No it's not hot

744
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,590
Why the heck are you feeling hot for this?

745
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,430
There's no such song as "Belly button, belly button", right?

746
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:21,730
So lastly, let's end with Jimmy's erotic Shigin   -Yes

747
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:23,630
So please do it, Jimmy-chan

748
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:31,940
Tomorrow, I will order a delivery health (call girl)

749
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:37,780
And I bet I will be paying 23,000 yen

750
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,680
So you're really going to call a girl, huh?!

751
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:40,780
So hot

752
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,480
No it's not hot

753
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,320
He said it for me

754
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,060
You really got him with that

755
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,630
Let's go?   -Let's go

756
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,100
Let's go   -Yes

757
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,760
Let's go   -Let's go

758
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,040
This is getting serious

759
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:06,240
46 more minutes
