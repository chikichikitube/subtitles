1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,430
Where is Downtown?

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,530
- They have not come yet.
- They are both not here yet.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,230
But I don't think they will miss work.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,840
- Are they camping today?
- I have heard that from them.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,440
Maybe they really won't come.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,970
I think they're already close.

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,540
- Hi.
- Hello!

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,380
Sorry for the wait.

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,580
Hamada hasn't come yet.

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:29,090
Hamada hasn't come yet.
But I have something to tell you first.

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,460
What's going on?

12
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,030
Yoshimoto Kogyo is hectic right now.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,800
To put it simply, Hamada's sex drive has not subsided.

14
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,140
Does he still have that kind of it?

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,170
I put him on the scale,
minus Hamada's sex drive,
and he weighed only 24lb (11kg).

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,680
His sex drive is so heavy...

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,950
And now he is being taken repeatedly by gossip magazine photographers.

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,420
Yoshimoto is desperately trying to hold him back.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,920
Apparently he is being taken from a position around here these days.

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,290
Doesn't he notice the camera?

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,260
He is being taken between the FLASH and FRIDAY photographers.

22
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,830
The FLASH photographer has been caught in the FRIDAY photo.

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,600
Yoshimoto has managed to hold him in check now, but he is in danger if he continues like this.

24
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,140
So he needs to let off some steam.

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,410
Letting off steam of his desire?

26
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,110
I had a long talk with Hamada.
We talked for about two and a half days.

27
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,780
- That's a long time.
- Did you guys stay over and talk?

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,420
He wants to let off steam of it in the show.

29
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,620
I see. He wants to release it well.

30
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,790
He has a desire to lift up that now.

31
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,930
“Lift up that”?

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,700
He often says, "I haven't lifted up that recently.”

33
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,870
About what?

34
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,870
You know what I'm talking about.
He wants to lift up the man's desire.

35
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,040
But that cannot be done in these times.

36
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,350
But he was taken doing it by a photographer, and Yoshimoto  is hectic right now.

37
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,820
Has he done that already?

38
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,120
That is not good.

39
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,790
So, would you guys change into this?

40
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,160
I see.

41
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,770
It's okay. This will put Hamada in a better mood.
And everyone will be happy.

42
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,410
- I don't want it to be a big deal.
- Of course.

43
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,710
Then get changed in these.

44
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,940
- Okay.
- Shall we change over there?

45
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,010
- I'll hold this.
- Thanks.

[Subbed by RAIDEN1017]

47
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,090
Oh, that's nice.

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,960
That's nice.

49
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,060
- Your personalities are showing through these.
- Really?

50
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,260
Yours is long.

51
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,700
Some are long, some are a little short.
I think that's good.

52
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,010
He would be rather embarrassed if all of you had short skirts.

53
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,740
Is that because it's deliberate?

54
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,980
I think it's very good.

55
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,510
You guys don't wear pantyhose?

56
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,520
Well, he doesn't like that.

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,050
He likes bare legs best.

58
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,720
- Okay, let’s make yakisoba.
- Yeah.

59
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,330
Let's do something camp-like.

60
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,600
- Hey.
- Hello.

61
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,230
Sorry to bother you.

62
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,130
We're camping today, what are you guys doing?

63
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,300
- We were thinking of making yakisoba.
- Okay!

64
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,670
Let's make it!

65
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,810
Okay, let's make yakisoba.

66
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,020
I don't know, I haven't done much camping.
Tanaka, do you know this?

67
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,450
I have some experience.

68
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,790
Let's put oil in first.

69
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,000
Can you put the bean sprouts in first?

70
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,740
Wouldn't it be better to put the meat first?

71
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,410
- Have you put the oil in already?
- Yeah.

72
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,640
It would be better to put the meat in too.

73
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,610
Thank you.

74
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,150
Hey, come here for a minute.

75
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,090
I place the water here.

76
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,060
What are they doing?

77
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,820
Not a chance!

78
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,930
I wasn't watching them enough.

79
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,700
I'll tell them that.

80
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,700
- They don't get it.
- I know.

81
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,080
Maybe you could put the meat in first.

82
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,840
Hey, wait a minute.

83
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,750
What are you guys doing?

84
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,920
What are you guys doing?

85
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,390
About what?

86
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,460
Underware.

87
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm wearing those.

88
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,430
He's not aroused by your underware at all.

89
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,470
He wants you guys to wear underware that are more arousing.

90
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,930
More arousing underants?

91
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,300
- Are you wearing your own underware?
- Yes.

92
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,500
That's no good.

93
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,310
He didn't have an erection at all!

94
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,540
I was thinking, "Hey, he doesn't have an erection at all.”

95
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,380
That's no good.
It’s not a release of it for him.

96
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,450
Yes...

97
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,480
I have prepared these.

98
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,690
- Wow, are you serious?!
- Put these on.

99
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,520
Are you serious?!

100
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,830
We should stop lifting that thing like this in these times.

101
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,060
So we alone have to fulfill his desires.

102
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,060
He was furious!!

103
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,030
His gums were bleeding.

104
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,800
He's incredibly angry.

105
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,300
Was he clenching?

106
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,740
He was bleeding from here.

107
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,280
- Scary!
- He is quite angry.

108
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,050
Just put them on.

109
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,410
Put them on right away.

110
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,380
Let's do it right away.

111
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,850
I thought you guys knew I didn't need to say this.

112

[3 minutes later]

113
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,160
We changed.

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,760
You okay?

115
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,930
- Did you put them on?
- Yes.

116
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,560
You don't have to do anything extra.

117
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,030
You don't have to remove the underarm hair.

118
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,670
That's realistic and good.

119
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,170
He said he likes hair.

120
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:21,840
Really?

121
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,140
Really?

122
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,480
- He said, "I like it better with it than without it.”
- He said that?

123
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,150
- Why did he talk you that?
- Then I guess it's good.

124
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,880
Then let's make yakisoba.

125
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,820
Let's do it.

126
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,420

00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,300
It's a beautiful day.

129
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,440
Should I get a plate for you, too?

130
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,640
I see. That's good.

131
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,110
I'll put this on a plate.

132
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,420
Thanks.
I'm sure you're all getting hungry.

133
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,880
I'll take the noodles out of the bag, too.

134
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,120
- What are you doing, Yamachan?
- Everyone find something to do.

135
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,470
Please tell me when to put the noodles in.
Can I put them all in?

136
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,670
Oh, it's all in.

137
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,610
You don't need to put water in it?

138
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,080
Thank you.

139
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,680
- Do you have any water?
- This sauce is powder.

140
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,120
Then put that in last.

141
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,420
What are these guys doing?

142
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,630
I think so too.

143
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,560
What are these guys doing?

144
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,030
Sorry.

145
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,560
When they do that to me...

146
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,030
Come on, man.

147
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,400
i'm counting on you.

148
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,370
- It looks good.
- Can you put the sauce in now?

149
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,140
Should I put that in already?

150
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,010
Hey, hey, hey.
Wait a minute.

151
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,550
What are you guys doing?

152
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,950
He was so furious!

153
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,820
You guys didn't react at all!

154
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,760
No comedian would be okay with being seen in his underwear.

155
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,330
You guys are wearing women's panties.

156
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,530
And you guys have been seen by him.

157
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,400
If you didn't react when he saw them, he wouldn't be aroused at all.

158
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,770
Do you want him to see your underwear?

159
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,670
No!

160
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:36,010
You don't want him to see that, do you?
Your feelings of not wanting him to see it are the very reason he wants to see it!

161
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,080
All of those things combined make him more and more erect!

162
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,450
Do you understand that?

163
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,720
He was looking at it through the mirror trying to do something about it!
He was trying to get himself up!

164
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,590
But he couldn't do it, he said.
You guys were like wooden puppets.

165
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,430
That's not good.
That's like a brothel.

166
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,800
He wanted reality.
I didn't think it was a good idea.

167
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,070
Sorry.

168
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,970
You have to understand that.

169
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,700
Yes.

170
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,970
- I thought you guys wanted to be seen with it.
- It's not.

171
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,710
- It's not?  Then give him a reaction.
- Yes.

172
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,440
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

173
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,850
COME OOOOON!!

174
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,760
CAAAAAMP   YEAAAAAAAHHH!!
COME OOOOOON!!

175
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,790
So what are you guys making right now!?

176
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,460
We're making yakisoba.

00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,170
- Hamada, you like yakisoba, right?
- Yeah!

178
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,900
Okaaaay!

179
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,040
The dish will be ready soon.

180
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,740
Now please put in the source.

181
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,340
Excuse me..., please don't do that.

182
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,850
Please wait just a little longer.

183
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,750
Oh, hey!

184
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,390
Hey, please really don't do that!

185
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,240
Please don't do that!

186
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,610
Okay, let's put the sauce in.

187
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,120
Please don't...

188
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,360
I think it's fried enough.

189
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,800
The sauce isn't mixed enough.

190
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,140
Matsumoto-san, let's play a game while they make this.

191
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,050
That's good.
We have Twister.

192
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:55,980
That’s nice.

193
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,320
Tanaka and Yama-chan, go over here and play Twister.

194
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,550
You guys go make it.

195
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,460
I spin the roulette.
First is Tanaka.

196
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,120
Stop.

197
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,030
Red.

198
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,400
Put your left foot on red.

199
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,530
Put your left foot on red.

200
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,210
Put your left hand on green.

201
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,170
Good.

202
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,550
Tanaka, put your right foot on red, too.

203
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,880
Tanaka, put your right foot on green.

204
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,220
Your right foot...yes.

205
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,460
Tanaka, react.

206
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,240
Please stop!

207
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,540
- Yamazaki, put your left foot on yellow.
- Yellow?

208
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,810
This posture is hard.

209
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,250
Tanaka, put your right hand on green.

210
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,860
Please stop! I'm embarrassing!
Please stop!

211
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,470
Please don't do that!

212
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,870
Please stop already!

213
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,410
Tanaka, are you okay?

214
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,210
Please stop!

215
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,480
He's a really troubled senior.

216
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,150
This is different.

217
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,290
It tastes better if it's slightly charred.

218
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,220
Yeah, I think so.

219
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,260
Hamada!

220
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,430
Hamada, hey!

221
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,500
I'll talk to them.

222
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,540
I'll talk to them very firmly.

223
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,840
Did we do something wrong?

224
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,850
Your reactions are still weak.

225
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,320
Please be more embarrassed

226
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,290
- More!?
- I was embarrassed enough.

227
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,790
But he did have one compliment.

228
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,930
Fujiwara's wedding ring got him aroused.

229
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,070
"Oh, are you married?”

230
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,730
Does he see these details?

231
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,170
He said it constantly.

232
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,870
He said Tanaka has a lot of problems.

233
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,740
I think I did the best I could.

234
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,780
Never show your bare butt.

235
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,910
That's extra!

236
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,750
“Extra”?

237
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,680
He wanted to see your butt!
But he doesn't really want to see it!

238
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,060
In fact, he does want to see it!
But he is trying to see it in hopes that you will not show it to him!

239
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,660
Can you understand his feelings!?

240
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,730
You have to understand those feelings of his!!

241
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,360
How many years have you guys been with him!!?

242
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,100
Don't make me say this to you any more!!

243
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,470
So sorry.

244
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,040
Matsumoto!

245
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,570
Yes, sir!

246
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,040
He said “yes sir.”

247
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,610
What's their hierarchy?

248
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,150
They don't need panties.

249
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,050
- Really?
- They don't need panties.

250
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,020
Otherwise they would not be embarrassed.

251
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,520
If they don't want me to see them, they should immediately cover them up with skirts.

252
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,190
It's your fault.

253
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,300
Is it our fault?

254
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,700
Hamada didn't want to do this.

255
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,100
What?

256
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,840
He said, "You guys don't need panties.”

257
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,380
Matsumoto-san, let's not do that!

258
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,050
I'm sorry, I refuse to do that.

259
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,510
He's serious.

260
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,820
- I'm really sorry about that.
- Let's apologize to him for once.

261
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,450
I can't say anything to him.

262
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,790
We'll talk to him directly.

263
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,960
We'll talk to him directly.

264
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,100
I don't understand at all how we don't need pants.

265
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,800
I can't say anything to him.
So go directly to him.

266
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,200
Let's go, guys!

267
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,880
What?

268
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,510
So sorry.

269
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:28,390
We are going to react well and arouse Hamada-san.

270
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,490
So we want to put our panties on.

271
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,990
Wouldn't you guys be more embarrassed and work harder if you aren't wearing a skirt?

272
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,430
We are still trying hard enough.

273
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,800
No!! You guys didn't do it earlier!!

274
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,970
Next time we will do it well.

275
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,370
Shouldn't you guys be out there taking your panties off right now?

276
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,810
Please let us wear panties.

277
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,710
Why do you guys want to wear panties so badly?

278
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,780
That's because I'm embarrassed.

279
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,910
If I see it, what's the problem!?

280
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,780
Even so, I'm embarrassing not to wear panties.

281
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,450
I'm embarrassed even now.

282
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,220
- Then you have to react well.
- Yes!

283
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,790
- Can you guys do that?
- We can!

284
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,690
- You guys can do it, right?
- Yes!

285
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,200
Give us another chance.

286
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,900
You guys go back.
Hey, Matsumoto.

287
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,570
If they don't make it next time, I won't care about it anymore.

288
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,710
Tell them that again.

289
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:36,350
He said, I'll try one more time, but if you guys can't do it again, I'll have you do something new.

290
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,190
He said you guys could do without the skirts.

291
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:44,090
Then he can't lift up that.

292
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,760
I don't understand the purpose.

293
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,070
Doesn't he want to lift up the skirt?

294
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,770
I don't know the details either.

295
00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:00,540
These things happen, don't they?
You know how sometimes you start out with a 60-minute course, but halfway through you want to make it a 90-minute course?

296
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,480
- So does he enjoy it?
- I don't know. That's half my guess.

297
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,020
He wants you guys to scream more.

298
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,350
He wants you to moan, doesn't he?

299
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,990
“Moan”?

300
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:17,190
Maybe he wants you to get high.

301
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,830
Anyway, let's do it.

302
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,060
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

303
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,170
Okay, let's get started!

304
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,410
We've cooked the yakisoba, we've done the twister, what's next?

305
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:40,250
How about a competition to see who can take the best selfie?

306
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,090
Let's do it!

307
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,920
Let's upload it to SNS.

308
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,660
Compete to see who can get the most likes?

309
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,290
I guess there is a trick to taking good pictures of this too.

310
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,260
Yes, you have to take into account the background and so on.

311
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,200
Come on!!

312
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,470
Come oooon!!
Don’t do that!!

313
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,110
The light is also...

314
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:18,960
They have no feelings of not wanting to be seen in their panties.
They think all they need is a loud voice.

315
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,320
It can't be helped.

316
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,760
You guys, gather around a minute.

317
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,570
After all, it can't be helped.

318
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,070
You guys didn't even moan.

319
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,510
I'm not sure what you mean by "moan.”

320
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,140
What does that mean?

321
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:44,050
- You wouldn't even know if you were asked to moan, because you can't do it.
- Sorry.

322
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,450
Take off your skirts.

323
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,390
Are you serious?

324
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,590
We're taking off our skirts?
Doesn't he want to lift up our skirts?

325
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,460
He seems to have gone to the NEXT STAGE.

326
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,360
Does he want to see our panties all the time?

327
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,500
What are we going to do?

328
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,070
We have no choice but to take off our skirts.

329
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,240
That's what he says.
And this year is Downtown's 40th anniversary.

330
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,710
You don't have any more demands from him, do you?

331
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,750
Of course.
There will be no more.

332
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,880
I'll think about how the staff might edit it, so take your skirt off for once.

333
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,490
This happens all the time, doesn't it?
You know, there are things that you take off on the site, but you don't know what will happen when it comes to the magazine

334
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,690
What are you talking about?

335
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,330
- What did you just talk about?
- What's he talking about?

336
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,600
Anyway, now you can gladly take off your skirt.

337
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,270
Do I take it off here?

338
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,440
- Can I take my skirt off here?
- Maybe it's okay.

339
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,370
I'm embarrassed.

340
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,040
I'm already embarrassed.

341
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,880
Would you like it like this?

342
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,680
Does he get aroused by this kind of thing?

343
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,320
That might be good.

344
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,260
- I think a little glimpse is good.
- I think he likes this kind of thing.

345
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,830
I hope this arouses him.

346
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,230
Then let's resume the selfie.

347
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,600
I bend down a little to take the shot.

348
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,970
Oh, that’s nice!

349
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,970
Nice!

350
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,640
Straighten up!

351
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,280
Don't bend over, assholes!

352
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,650
No!! Hamada-san!! I'm so embarrassed!!

353
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,350
I'm so embarrassed!!

354
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,620
Good!!
Yama-chan, good!!

355
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,760
You scored high.

356
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,670
Nice!!

357
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,870
Is this guy stupid?

358
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,580
- Oh, nice!!
- Endo, concentrate!

359
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,810
You're good too.

360
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,550
Concentrate!

361
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,850
Please don’t!

362
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,160
- Hang on, Fujiwara!
- No!!

363
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,360
Get him arouse!

364
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,590
Please don’t!!

365
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,360
Good!!

366
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,800
- Was that good?
- Good!!

367
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,130
- That was good.
- Today was very good.

368
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,500
It's been a long time since I've done something like this.

369
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,170
He's happy!

370
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,840
- There was no problem.  And they're happy too.
- Really?

371
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,580
They didn't mind doing it?

372
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:30,150
They're just pretending they don't want to do it.
They know what they're doing.

373
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,880
Okay, I'll give them a commendation.

374
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,380
- Commendation?
- It’s no wonder.

375
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,890
Stand up straight and show me your panties.

376
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,560
Stand up straight and show me your panties!!

377
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,060
Show me more, Yama-chan.

378
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,530
Right!

379
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,360
Certificate of Recognition,

380
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,170
Best Lifted Up Person Award.

381
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,770
Mr. Naoki Tanaka!!

382
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,010
You have done a very good job of being just the right amount of sexy without being overdone, while still maintaining a bit of tomboyishness.

383
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:09,150
In honor of your hard work, I present you with the award as the "Best Lifted Up Person."

384
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,860
From Downtown’s Masatoshi Hamada,
Yoshimoto Kogyo Corp. on November 13, 2022.

385
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:23,230
When I looked right down your skirt, your's was sticking out through the gap in your pants, and it was a hell of a thing!

386
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,570
I was so horny!!

387
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,740
Thank you!!

388
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,240
- Congratulations!!

389
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,340
- Thank you!
- Congratulations!

390
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,150
Cherish it!

391
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,280
Matsumoto-san, please do it again next time.

392
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,450
Sure, I'll make sure to do so.

393
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,050
Do we have to do this again?

394
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:44,850
Of course.

395
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,820
They kind of look like they don't want to do it.

396
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,590
You want to do it, don't you?

397
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,190
Of course.

398
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,030
You can take Tanaka home with you.

399
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,900
That's not what you meant, is it?

400
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,330
What does that mean?

401
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,800
It's not?

402
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,810
- Okay, Tanaka, congratulations!
- Thank you!

403
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,370
Congratulations!

404
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,110
You might just win back-to-back championships in the next one!

405
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,240
Yes!

406
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,210
You guys have to BEAT Tanaka.

407
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,180
No, not in that way!

408
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,620
Yes!

409
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,950
Thank you!!

410
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,450
Thank you so much for today!

411
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,390
See you!

412
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,660
Thank you so much!

413
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,390
See you!

414
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,890
Thank you!

415
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,370
Do you guys need a lawyer?

416
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,840
- I would love to.
- Please.

417
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,940
We will file a class action lawsuit against him.

418
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,950
Even a new lawyer would be able to win against him.

419
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,350
We can definitely win.

420
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:49,720
