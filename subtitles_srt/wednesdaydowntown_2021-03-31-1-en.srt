1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay everyone, let's begin!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Tonight, as our presenters, we'll be having these gentlemen.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Welcome!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Woah, so many!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's Tamura Kenji, Chocolate Planet, and Kasuga!

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,500
TOOS!

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Hey that was funny, do it again!

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,900
TOOOS!

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,900
That's pretty good!

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,500
Yeah, that's really funny.

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,500
Really funny.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Okay but did anybody even notice Kenji go cha~?

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,900
Wait, you didn't hear me?

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,900
It was right in the center! A center-cha.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,000
Wow, you really cha-ed, huh.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay, let's get on with it.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, that's right.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay everybody, it's what you've been waiting for...

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's an "everybody's theory" special.

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,900
Okay, who are we starting with?

21
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,900
I'll go first.

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,000
A real star duo.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thank you.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay, so the theory we've chosen this time is this.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,000
Even if you're at home alone, if somebody knocks on the door while you're on the toilet, you'll end up saying "I'm in here!"

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,500
No way, right? If you were alone?

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,500
Wouldn't you be too terrified?

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,000
You would, right?

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,200
Yeah, but before the fear sets in...

30
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,200
You'd reply by reflex.

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,500
Yeah, exactly.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,500
I see. So it's fear versus reflex.

33
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,500
What do you think?

34
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,800
Well if it were a person's voice, I'd be scared, but I wonder if you could reply to a knock with a knock.

35
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,900
You might just reply with a knock.

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,500
It would only be really scary knowing for sure there's a person there.

37
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:27,500
A theory that says: even if you're at home alone, if somebody knocks on the door while you're on the toilet, you'll say "I'm in here!"

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Kawai from Einstein.

39
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,500
A hidden camera has been placed in his home while he's living alone.

40
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,500
30 minutes pass until the time comes.

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,500
While Kawai enters the bathroom...

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,500
A staff member hiding on his balcony comes in.

43
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
Woah, that startled me!

44
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Huh?

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
He locked it!

46
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
He didn't say "I'm here."

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,200
Since he didn't seem to be coming out, let's try it once more.

48
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Woah!

49
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
What's going on?

50
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,900
It's Wednesday Downtown.

51
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,900
You can't do shit like this...

52
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,900
Die. Die, die, die, for real.

53
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,900
I really can't do this.

54
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,900
Do you know the line between right and wrong?

55
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,900
In conclusion, they didn't know.

56
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,300
In the end, he didn't say it.

57
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,200
Fear won.

58
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,000
Of course it would!

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,300
He locked the door so fast.

60
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,200
That would be so scary.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,200
Okay, moving on.

62
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,200
Here's the next theory we've chosen for today.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No matter how unpalatable the food, if you were on a streak catching marshmallows in your mouth, you'd eat it

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The targets this time were called in under the pretenses of a challenge.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,400
Nadaru, from Colocolo Chittychitty Peppers.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
How are you feeling?

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well, we've done it live once before.

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,800
He doesn't remember at all.

69
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,800
Quit similing at me.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The unpalatable thing Nishino will be throwing is...

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hornet larvae

72
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,000
Wow, he's good.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,500
I didn't think he'd be this good at it.

74
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,600
Nadaru smoothly catches a number of marshmallows.

75
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
He keeps sticking his hand out.

76
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,900
He looks like Itsugi Hiroshi.

77
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Did he notice it?

78
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,200
He ate it.

79
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,800
Larva

80
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,300
Marshmallow

81
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,300
Larva

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yuck.

83
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,000
He feels something is off, but he continues...

84
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,800
In total, three larvae entered his mouth

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And now, to reveal the prank...

86
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,500
You put some wet thing in there.

87
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,000
Thanks for your work today.

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,500
I think I saw something funny.

89
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,300
What's all this?

90
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,500
What did you do?

91
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,000
Did you notice anything unusual?

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,400
Yeah, there was some kind of wet marshmallow

93
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,900
Yeah, the wet marshmallow!

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,900
What the hell did you do here?

95
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,400
Some wet marshmallow...

96
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,300
What's the prank?

97
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,300
What did you do with it?

98
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Did you eat it?

99
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Hold on, what?

100
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,200
The theory is that if you're catching marshmallows, you'd eat whatever nasty stuff that gets thrown in.

101
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,500
Here's what it was.

102
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
It was larvae??

103
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Stag beetle larvae.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
No, not stag beetle. Hornet larvae.

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,100
Oh, it was only hornet larvae.

106
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,100
Huh?

107
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,500
Wait, that's your reaction?

108
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,000
You're relieved?

109
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,000
As a kid I used to be fed hornet larvae.

110
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
By who?

111
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
My dad.

112
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,400
I always said that I didn't want to eat it

113
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,100
But at least it's not from a stag beetle

114
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,400
Chocolate Planet's selection from everybody's theories.

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Moving on, we have...

116
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,000
Among the names of elementary schools and middle schools, the word "east" is particularly common

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We'll take a look at the kanto region, and count up schools with "north," "south," "east," and "west" in their name.

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Starting at the fourth most frequent, we have...

119
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,400
North, at 163 schools.

120
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
In third place...

121
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,400
West, at 213 schools.

122
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
In second place...

123
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,400
South, at 247 schools.

124
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,400
In the end, "east" was indeed the most frequent.

125
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,100
Now, according to our researchers, the reasoning for this was...

126
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,400
a mystery.

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,400
What are they on about?

128
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
East was most common.

129
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,400
If you're sitting in a sauna, you should be able to eat scalding foods with no problem.

130
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,100
Cause you'd already feel hot all over.

131
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,800
For our challengers this time, we have this pair, regulars of the show by now.

132
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,400
They're both mostly able to handle the temperature of the food under normal conditions.

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The person who enters the sauna is decided by rock-paper-scissors.

134
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,000
Abarareru-kun's sauna is set to 99ºC.

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Ikezaki's room, right outside, is 25ºC.

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,300
Two pieces left!

137
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,000
I think I can do it

138
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,500
However, Ikezaki's already down to his last egg.

139
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,800
Okay, I'm done! I'm done!

140
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
That's hot!

141
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
The air in here is unreal!

142
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Being inside the sauna...

143
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,300
was the food any less hot?

144
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,800
No, of course it was hot!

145
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,800
The next theory from Chocolate Planet is...

146
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,800
If you put your pants on while the hem is sewn shut, you'll fall down

147
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Yeah, of course you would.

148
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,400
Just outside our last location, we find Ikezaki again...

149
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,800
Right, that's what would happen.

150
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,800
The last theory chosen by Chocolate Planet today is...

151
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:51,200
Kids who complete a bike tour across Japan during their summer vacation would grow up to be splendid adults

152
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,900
This time our subjects are brothers who completed a bike tour of Japan in the summer of 1997.

153
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,000
The brothers started in Ashiya, Hyogo prefecture.

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,900
In 44 days, they completed a tour of Japan.

155
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,900
In total, they biked approximately 3,300 kilometers.

156
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,900
Furthermore...

157
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,900
They raised money for the Great Hanshin earthquake.

158
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,200
Participating in activities across the country, they helped with recovery from the earthquake...

159
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:31,500
In total, they raised nearly three million yen in contributions from Hyogo prefecture.

160
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Surely, they would go on to be splendid people.

161
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
The phrasing here is scary...

162
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
It really is.

163
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Are they gonna turn out OK?

164
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,500
Pleased to meet you.

165
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,500
Here's the older brother, Masamichi, who's now 34 years old.

166
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,100
At present, what is it that you do?

167
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Currently, I do work related to the Guinness World Records.

168
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:10,000
He works for the Guinness World Records in Japan, spending his days alongside people who challenge the human limits.

169
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,100
So what about the younger brother, then?

170
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
He must be the bad one.

171
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,100
What I'd really like to do is support the people who endeavor.

172
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,800
I think it's a job that I can do to give back.

173
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
I'd say it's my calling.

174
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And what is it that your brother is doing now?

175
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,500
Currently my brother's living in America...

176
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,300
and he's working for Apple.

177
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,300
In conclusion: they really became splendid adults.

178
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,800
So, Fujimon, what did you think?

179
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,000
How about that theory about schools with "east" in their name?

180
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
What was that?

181
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
Yeah, tell us what you thought about that one.

182
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,950
Well, uh...

183
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,300
Who cares?

184
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,300
No, wasn't it amazing?

185
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,500
There were twice as many with "east" than "north."

186
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
No, but...

187
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,800
You're messing with me.

188
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,700
You seemed to be most interested in that theory.

189
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,700
No, but I wasn't.

190
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,700
Was "east" in the name of the school you attended?

191
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,700
Well in high school it was, yeah, but...

192
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Why would I have any reason to care about that?

193
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,700
Yeah, but in the end, "east" was the most popular.

194
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,700
What do you make of that?

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,700
It was clearly the most popular. By far.

196
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
Right, going off of that.

197
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,900
You're killing me.

198
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,900
I can't stand this.

199
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,900
Up next, everybody's theories, as chosen by Kasuga.

200
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,900
Okay, here are the theories we're doing today.

201
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,900
A theory that states the oldest property available for rent must be from the Edo period.

202
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,300
Really?

203
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,500
Well there's a lot of old buildings, you know.

204
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,400
I happen to have lived in one for twenty years myself, "Mutsumi-sou."

205
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:22,400
The building was made in 1966. A 55-year old building from the Showa era.

206
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,400
So if we hit the maximum age, it could be from the Edo period, right?

207
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,900
But you don't mean a sort of cultural building...

208
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,900
No, I mean a place you can actually live.

209
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:55,500
A theory that states the oldest property available for rent must be from the Edo period.

210
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,500
First, we'll look at the oldest property available for rent in Tokyo.

211
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,900
A run-down part of the Bunkyo ward.

212
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,500
This property here was built...103 years ago.

213
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
1919 (Taisho year 8).

214
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:23,500
A building that survived the Great Kanto earthquake and Tokyo firebombing.

215
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,500
It remains a property for people to rent.

216
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,500
For the curious, we'll take a look inside.

217
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
It's pretty nice.

218
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,900
The inside's nice, yeah.

219
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:44,500
Although it's been renovated several times, the space remains intact.

220
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:52,540
Currently, the rent for the property is 120,000 yen.
(approx. $1080 USD)

221
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:03,540
If you had been paying that for 103 years, the total would be 143,820,000 yen.
(Approx. $1.3M USD)

222
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,540
We talked to the current renters about their experience.

223
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,540
It gets super cold.

224
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,540
The temperatures...

225
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,540
Numbingly cold in the winter, and really hot in the summer.

226
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,540
The walls are super thin so we really hear the neighbors.

227
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,440
That's not so great.

228
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,460
Next, we'll expand our search to include the whole country.

229
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:37,460
In Fukuchiyama, Kyoto, we came across an even older building.

230
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,460
A detached house, currently seeking renters.

231
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,260
127 sq. meters, 6 rooms excluding dining and kitchen.

232
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,260
It may need some remodeling, but the rent is 50,000 yen.
(Approx. $450 US)

233
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,260
What's with those four adjacent "Japanese-style rooms"?

234
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,260
It was built 127 years ago.

235
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,260
Meiji 27. (1894)

236
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:18,260
Moving on, we have a detatched house in Yamazoe village, Yamabe, Nara prefecture.

237
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:24,260
204 sq. m, with 6 rooms excluding dining and kitchen.

238
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,260
The rent here is also 50,000 yen.

239
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,260
The kitchen reflects the time in which it was built, with a kamado wood-burning stove.

240
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,860
In the bathroom, there's a goemon-style bath, still functional.

241
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,860
Now, to reveal the age...

242
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,460
I'm afraid we only have one method to prove it, but...

243
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,060
It goes back 153 years ago.

244
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,360
The first year of the Meiji era [1872].

245
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:07,360
With a house available dating back to Meiji year 1, finding a house from the edo period was all but confirmed...

246
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,960
In what year do you the building was actually erected?

247
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,560
I think it would've been the end of the Edo period.

248
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,260
I can't be totally sure of it though...

249
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,260
With this, the theory is nearly proved.

250
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,660
But if we continue our investigation...

251
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:32,660
In Kamigyo ward of Kyoto, we found an unusually old building.

252
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:40,660
The property has a narrow frontage, and a long entryway.

253
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,460
In the past, taxes were applied to the frontage, so...

254
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,060
it was built to be narrow.

255
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,060
In the Edo period, there was a "frontage tax."

256
00:18:54,060 --> 00:19:01,060
It seems that this sort of long, narrow property was typical of the era.

257
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,760
As for the building's age...

258
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,760
I've been told it was built 350 years ago.

259
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,760
Although there aren't documents confirming it, stories dating the building have been passed along.

260
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,760
Stories of a building from 1670...

261
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,660
We're renting and currently seeking tenants.

262
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,660
What's the rent?

263
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,660
80,000 yen.

264
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,660
The bathrooms have been recently renovated...

265
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,660
But you can really feel the age of the place through its still-functional well.

266
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,260
In conclusion: those interested should inquire.

267
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,360
Fujimon, your thoughts?

268
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,360
Well, I mean...

269
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:02,360
For the bathroom there, I think I would have preferred it in its original state, you know...

270
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,360
You'd take as it was, huh.

271
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:12,360
Are all the comments you make going to be that gloomy?

272
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,460
So strict!

273
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,860
Soooo strict.

274
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,860
Everyone's theories, as selected by Kasuga. Next up, we have...

275
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:34,860
If elementary schools kids asked Jimmy Onishi, "Jimmy, are you getting any?" he'd be so surprised that he couldn't reply.

276
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,860
Note: I'm not familiar with this gag— I'm pretty sure it's a dirty joke though...

277
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,860
Hello! This is Jimmy Onishi.

278
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,860
Today I'm here at the Edo Tokyo Museum.

279
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,860
We brought out Jimmy to a fake TV shoot.

280
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,560
Ok, all set.

281
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,440
We're gonna make arrangements to go in now, so please wait here for a bit.

282
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,440
Once he thinks the camera's stopped rolling...

283
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,640
Jimmy, are you getting any?

284
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
Sure ain't!

285
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,640
Damn, he's good.

286
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,640
Everyone's theories, as selected by Kasuga. Up next...

287
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:29,640
Somewhere, there must be a pair of sisters like Maya and Meena, where the elder dances and the younger tells fortunes.

288
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:38,640
In the RPG Dragon Quest IV, you encounter the Mahabala sisters, Maya and Meena.

289
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,440
Could there really be a pair of sisters living the same way?

290
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:51,740
For efficiency's sake, we'll start by approaching a fortune-teller.

291
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:58,440
I can't think of anybody here matching that description at present.

292
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,040
I'm afraid nobody comes to mind.

293
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,040
There was something like that in Dragon Quest, wasn't there?

294
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,040
I'm acquainted with a number of fortune tellers, but...

295
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,040
I can't think of anybody that fits the bill.

296
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,040
But among those we asked...

297
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,040
I myself am a fortune teller, and my younger sister is a dancer...

298
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,040
but I guess that's the opposite?

299
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:30,040
We found the inverse of the Mahabala sisters, with a fortune-telling elder sister and a dancing younger sister.

300
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,340
She's been in America, belly dancing in New York...

301
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,840
They were spot-on with the dancing and fortune-telling, but unfortunately in the wrong order...

302
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,840
Who cares if it's the wrong order?

303
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,840
But when we continued on with our search...

304
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,840
We came across a promising lead in Yokohama's Chinatown.

305
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,040
Welcome. A pleasure to meet you.

306
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,640
This is Ms. Hoshi, a fortune teller at the Four Pillars of Destiny.

307
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,840
We've heard that your sister is a dancer. Is that right?

308
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,840
My sister's practiced traditional Japanese dance since she was a girl.

309
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,840
The older sister is a practitioner of Japanese dance— that is to say, she's a dancer.

310
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:31,840
With this, we've found the real-world incarnation of Maya and Meena.

311
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,840
Have you been told before that you're just like Maya and Meena?

312
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,840
And who would they be?

313
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,840
Is it some kind of legendary tale?

314
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,240
Yeah, something like that.

315
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,240
Everybody's theories, as chosen by Kasuga. Up next...

316
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,240
When talking about Yasu from Zun, for some reason you always have to include the "from"

317
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,440
Can you do one more?

318
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,740
Hell yeah I can!

319
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,740
They really got some use out of this spot, huh.

320
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,240
We're gonna show you some pictures of comedians, so...

321
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,740
Tell us the name of their duo and then their own name.

322
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,840
Okay, got it.

323
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,940
Downtown, Hamada Masatoshi.

324
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,940
Audrey, Kasuga.

325
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,640
Panther, Ogata.

326
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,640
Viking, Kotoge.

327
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,640
Saraba Seishun no Hikari, Morita.

328
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,940
Zun's...Yasu-san.

329
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:36,940
Everybody's theories, as chosen by Kasuga. Up next...

330
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:42,940
It can't be possible to lap up water faster than a dog

331
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,940
What, you mean like licking it?

332
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,940
I'm pretty good at licking though.

333
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,940
Here we have Kuro-chan, a man confident in his tongue capabilities...

334
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,440
By the way, if you lose, you'll get a few electric shocks

335
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,440
Wait, what?

336
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,440
Looks like the dog's thirsty too

337
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,440
Quit moaning.

338
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,440
He got it all.

339
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,440
No way!

340
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,140
He's going "woof."

341
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Wait, hold on!

342
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,140
Oh, he's woofing.

343
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,540
It's really not working.

344
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,540
Everybody's theories, as selected by Kasuga. Lastly, we have...

345
00:25:51,540 --> 00:26:00,540
Safety shoes really are safe.

346
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,540
So, to test the theory out...

347
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,840
Ow, ouch!

348
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,840
After his competition, we brought him out again as a subject.

349
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,840
The theory you'll be testing this time is "safety shoes really are safe."

350
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,840
Safety shoes are safe?

351
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:25,840
We'll be using steel-toe boots, standard-issue safety shoes.

352
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,840
For some reason I've always thought safety shoes were cool, so I've worn them before, but...

353
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,940
You mean you wore them in private?

354
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,340
Yeah.

355
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,040
Look at those nips.

356
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,040
They're pretty hard, huh

357
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:45,040
The experienced Kuro-chan prepares for action...

358
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,040
First...

359
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,040
Hey wait, this is pretty heavy...

360
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,040
LEVEL ONE: BOWLING BALL

361
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,740
You're gonna take that and drop it on your boots.

362
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,040
By myself?

363
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,240
Yeah.

364
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,040
Is it really gonna be OK?

365
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,840
Look, this is only level one, so try to hurry up.

366
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,040
Wait, how many times am I doing this?

367
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,040
It's an everybody's theories special, so it keeps a quick pace.

368
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,440
Oh, so it's a quickie.

369
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,840
Doesn't hurt at all.

370
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,940
Then why'd he cry out?

371
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,940
LEVEL TWO: HAMMER

372
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,040
Could you put your foot on that?

373
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,340
I actually felt that one, though.

374
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,040
More than that bowling ball earlier.

375
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,340
Did it hurt?

376
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,440
No, it didn't.

377
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Oh, that's good.

378
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,040
Let's do the next one, then.

379
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Wait, what?

380
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Hold up, hold up!

381
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,040
LEVEL THREE: CAR

382
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,040
I thought I was gonna be run over.

383
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Yeah. So next...

384
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
Don't "yeah" me.

385
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
The car's gonna run over you.

386
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,040
You're gonna run over them?!

387
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Yeah

388
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,040
Am I gonna be OK?

389
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Is he OK?

390
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
Is he or isn't he?

391
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,740
Are you OK?

392
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,440
It ran over you?

393
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,040
It ran over me...

394
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
I'm fine!

395
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,040
Ooh, I tricked you!

396
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,240
Trickuro-chan!

397
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,240
Trickuro-chan.

398
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
He really said Trickuro-chan.

399
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,440
Moving on...

400
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,440
LEVEL FOUR: TRUCK

401
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,940
This is level four.

402
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,040
Come on, no way.

403
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
There's no way you can do that!

404
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
No, really, come on!

405
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
There's just no way.

406
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,040
We've already reached the max for what I can do.

407
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Do you really mean you can't?

408
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,040
Like, for TV reasons? Or you really just can't?

409
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,540
There's no way I can!

410
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,840
No, but like, Kuro-chan, you really really can't?

411
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,940
No, I can't!

412
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,440
We'll end the human experimentation here for now.

413
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,440
We'll continue with a raw egg.

414
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,440
I guess they'll put it inside the boot.

415
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
Oh, they put it inside?

416
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,440
Hey...

417
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,440
You shoulda brought this out sooner.

418
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,040
That was scary.

419
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,040
If you had this before you should've brought it out.

420
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
This might be even scarier than last time

421
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,040
The result?

422
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,040
Here I go.

423
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,140
Oh shit!

424
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,440
It's super broken!

425
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,440
That's scary!

426
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,940
The whole theory's scary!

427
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,040
In conclusion: there are limits to the safety of safety shoes.

428
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,340
So that's it.

429
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,340
You know, we almost ended off on the wrong foot there.

430
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,840
I mean he was only considering it, but...

431
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,340
If he actually went for it, we'd be finished.

432
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
Scary.

433
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,540
Maybe it was his animal instincts.

434
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,540
Up next: everybody's theories, selected by Tamuken.

435
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,940
Okay everyone, I'll be the last to present today.

436
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,940
To start off, please take a look here.

437
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,940
So I'm hearing some surprise, but you know who this is, right?

438
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,940
It's Bit, right?

439
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,940
The impersonator?

440
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,940
Yes, exactly.

441
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,940
Today, we've brought you a theory regarding this Bit Takeshi.

442
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,940
Here it is.

443
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:25,240
If shown a caricature of Bit Takeshi and asked who it is, not a single person would reply "Bit Takeshi"

444
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,240
Huh, I guess not.

445
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,240
Nobody would know who Bit Takeshi is.

446
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,040
Even among comedians, that would be tough...

447
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:51,040
If shown a caricature of Bit Takeshi and asked who it is, not a single person would reply "Bit Takeshi"

448
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,440
The entertainment industry's hit rock bottom.

449
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,440
Booby-traps battle royale!

450
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,440
Bit Takeshi's been playing Beat Takeshi alone for 42 years.

451
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,340
I guess there is a resemblance, huh.

452
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,440
He looks more like the old Beat Takeshi.

453
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:10,440
And now, we present what must be the world's first caricature of Bit Takeshi.

454
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,440
But if we take a look at it compared to a caricature of Beat Takeshi...

455
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,540
Indeed, if you look closely, you can see the difference.

456
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,940
Will anybody be able to correctly name the caricature?

457
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,940
We're going to show you some caricatures, so please identify them for us.

458
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,440
Sanma-san.

459
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,440
Tamori-san.

460
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,440
Beat Takeshi.

461
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
Why would Bit belong in the same group?

462
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,840
With those three back to back, of course they'd say that...

463
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,340
They may have been suggesting "Beat" a little too much, but...

464
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,340
They were.

465
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,340
Indeed, nobody said that it was Bit Takeshi.

466
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,340
And after that...

467
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,340
Beat Takeshi.

468
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,440
Beat Takeshi.

469
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,440
Beat Takeshi.

470
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,040
As expected, it's nothing but "Beat Takeshi."

471
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,240
However...

472
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,040
I think it can be done correctly, but...

473
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,240
When you've got the big three all lined up and expect us to guess that it's "Bit Takeshi"...

474
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,040
That's playing dirty.

475
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,640
He makes a good point...

476
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,340
We'll try testing if people can guess it based on Bit's picture alone.

477
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,740
Beat Takeshi.

478
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,040
Takeshi Kitano.

479
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,440
Beat Takeshi.

480
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,840
Beat Takeshi.        Beat-san.

481
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,440
Beat-san?

482
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:48,440
In the end, out of a hundred people, zero answered "Bit Takeshi."

483
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,440
However, it's possible that for lay people, Bit is simply not familiar enough.

484
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,840
So we conducted an additional investigation among comedians familiar with Bit.

485
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,040
First, we have...

486
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:06,540
Somebody who's worked closely with Bit over the years, Haraguchi Akimasa.

487
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,540
We called him in to a fake business meeting.

488
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,540
Would you mind if we asked a few questions for a survey on caricatures?

489
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,540
The result...

490
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,840
Sanma-san.

491
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,540
Tamori-san.

492
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,540
Takeshi-san.

493
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,940
Takeshi who?

494
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,740
Beat Takeshi.

495
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,040
Wrong.

496
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,340
Huh?

497
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,840
The correct answer was Bit Takeshi.

498
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,640
In the end, he didn't answer "Bit" either.

499
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,940
Incidentially, here's one of Beat Takeshi.

500
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,940
Ohhh, I see.

501
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,940
Actually, yeah...that was pretty rude of me.

502
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,940
They're totally different.

503
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,980
I feel kinda embarassed.

504
00:34:53,580 --> 00:35:01,980
* Sokkuri Kan-kisara is an event held at a pub full of lookalike entertainers. Vermont Hideki was originally imitating Hideki Saijo (see his Vermont Curry commerical)

505
00:34:53,580 --> 00:35:01,980
Up next is a longtime friend of Bit and a regular of the Kisara*, Vermont Hideki.

506
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,980
Hideki's really not looking the part.

507
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,980
Let's begin.

508
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,980
Could you bring it closer? My eyesight's really bad.

509
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,980
Ah, Sanma-san.

510
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,980
Tamori, isn't it.

511
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,980
Ah, it's Takeshi.

512
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,580
Takeshi who?

513
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,780
Beat Takeshi-san.

514
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,680
Next is a friend of both Bit and Beat, Matsumura Fumihiro.

515
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,380
Akashiya Sanma-san.

516
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,180
Tamori-san.

517
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,380
Kitano Takeshi-san.

518
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,380
Incorrect.

519
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,080
Huh?

520
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,080
Then who?

521
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,080
Ah, Bit Takeshi.

522
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:49,080
In the end, he too was unable to reach the answer straightaway.

523
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,680
I mean...there's something about him that looks...

524
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,880
too poor to be Takeshi-san.

525
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:59,990
Up next, a junior to Bit before making it big...

526
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,880
Audrey's Kasuga.

527
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,990
Oh really!

528
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,880
Sanma-san.

529
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
Tamori-san.

530
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,980
He'll know.

531
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,580
Takeshi-san.

532
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,280
Takeshi who?

533
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,680
Hm? Beat Takeshi-san.

534
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,580
Your final answer, once more, please.

535
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,080
Beat Takeshi-san.

536
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,780
Incorrect.

537
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,480
Huh?

538
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,180
Ah, Kitano Takeshi-san.

539
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,280
Incorrect.

540
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,680
Huh? But that's Takeshi-san, isn't it?

541
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,980
The correct answer was Bit Takeshi.

542
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,980
Oh, come on.

543
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,680
That can't be Bit.

544
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,980
Takeshi Kitano...

545
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,980
Is this one here.

546
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,980
Actually, yeah. When you line them up like that...

547
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,980
I feel bad about it.

548
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,580
You say "actually" like it was obvious.

549
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,980
Among comedians who know Bit well, zero were able to identify him straightaway.

550
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,980
For our final subject, we'll test Bit himself.

551
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,980
If he can't get it right either, our theory is as good as proven.

552
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,380
That's, y'know...

553
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,980
Sanma-chan.

554
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,680
Makin' it easy, huh.

555
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,680
Tamori.

556
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,080
Huh?

557
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,480
That's...me?

558
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,580
Or who I'm impersonating, I guess?

559
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,980
I guess it's who I'm impersonating, so...

560
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,280
Beat Takeshi-san.

561
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,880
Your final answer once again, please.

562
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,880
Beat Takeshi-san.

563
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,880
Incorrect.

564
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
It's...

565
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,880
me?

566
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,080
In conclusion: Bit Takeshi is the first to achieve total victory in a "zero people" theory.

567
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,080
We did it!

568
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,080
Finally!

569
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,380
Even though we've been doing these "zero people" theories all along...

570
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,480
This is a first?

571
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,680
It is, thanks to Bit.

572
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,680
But it wasn't a very close match.

573
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,680
We kinda knew what would happen.

574
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,680
And the way it was done wasn't that fair.

575
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,680
In that order, right?

576
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,680
The big three.

577
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,980
Right, so that's Bit's fault, isn't it.

578
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,180
No, no, no.

579
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,080
You're really not that funny today, huh.

580
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,380
Everybody's theories, as selected by Tamuken. Up next, we have...

581
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:30,380
If you've been locked in a room, after checking the lock once, you wouldn't notice if it were unlocked afterwords

582
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,380
The set up is as follows...

583
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,380
A victim has been locked in the room...

584
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,380
Please remove your eye mask.

585
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,380
Mantenro's Ootoni.

586
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,380
He kinda got big, huh.

587
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
Huh?

588
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,080
What's up with the coat?

589
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,080
What's going on?

590
00:38:54,580 --> 00:39:02,080
Not thinking he has to do anything in particular, ten minutes pass by.

591
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,480
And then...

592
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,080
He realizes that he's been locked in.

593
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,080
'scuse me!

594
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,080
'scuse me!

595
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,080
15 minutes after being in the room, the door is quietly unlocked.

596
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,080
'scuse me.

597
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
'scuse me.

598
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,980
That's interesting.

599
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,980
Is anybody there?

600
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,980
This is bad.

601
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,980
Indeed, he did not notice the door being suddenly unlocked.

602
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:02,980
And just like that, four hours pass by.

603
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,980
Huh?

604
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,080
I'm really not allowed to leave at all?

605
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,180
He really has no idea what this is all about.

606
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,280
What's the meaning of this?

607
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,280
Really, what is this...

608
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,280
He notices.

609
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,280
Is it okay if I leave?

610
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,280
What's this about?

611
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,280
I mean, what?

612
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,880
What is this?

613
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,280
I'm coming out.

614
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,280
Everybody's theories, selected by Tamuken.

615
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,280
Four hours, huh.

616
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,000
Up next is...

617
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,680
At the sushi restaurant in Japan furthest from the ocean, the freshness should be a concern.

618
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:13,080
First, let's locate the sushi restaurant furthest from the ocean.

619
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:21,080
According to geographical research, the furthest location is at this point in Saku, Nagano.

620
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:28,580
And in this part of Saku, there are approximately 20 sushi restaurants.

621
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:33,580
Among them, the closest restaurant we found was...

622
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:39,580
this 57-year old establishment, Miyako Sushi.

623
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,580
Ah, welcome.

624
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,380
It would seem that this is the furthest sushi restaurant in Japan from the ocean...

625
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,080
Yes, I'm aware.

626
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,380
Moving along, to get to the point...

627
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,980
Sorry to be rude, but is the freshness a concern?

628
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,380
- It's not a problem.

629
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,980
That is rude.

630
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,280
From both Toyosu and Niigata...

631
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,980
we get fish coming in every day.

632
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:14,280
Since we're right in the middle, we actually have supply from both directions.

633
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:20,280
In conclusion, the freshness wasn't a concern at all.

634
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,480
Everybody's theories, selected by Tamuken. Up next...

635
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:39,480
If a child wearing Hotei-print clothes were to get lost at a shopping mall, he could be found by intercom with the message "calling for the child wearing Hotei-print clothes..."

636
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:45,480
** The Hotei-print (hoteigara) is the signature design of rock musician Hotei Tomoyasu.

637
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,480
This time, our theory will be tested by a three-year old kitted out in Hotei-print.

638
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,480
We'll have him play a lost child in the shopping mall here.

639
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,380
Excuse me!

640
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,180
I have a lost child here...

641
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,880
What sort of announcement will be made?

642
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,280
Next, the supervisor is called in.

643
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,280
Let's see how the announcement is made by a staff member who isn't aware of our theory.

644
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,980
The result...

645
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,580
Calling all customers...

646
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:23,180
Just now, at our entrance, a lost child was reported.

647
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,580
The child is a boy about five years old...

648
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,180
wearing black and white leopard-print jersey.

649
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,180
Would the customer responsible for this child...

650
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:36,480
please make their way to the main entrance.

651
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,480
Everyone's theories, as selected by Tamuken. Lastly...

652
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:49,480
When talking about Yasu from Zun, for some reason you always have to include the "from"
~Part Two~

653
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,080
Downtown, Hamada.

654
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,880
Audrey...

655
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,880
Kasuga.

656
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,480
Cocorico...

657
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,280
Kondo.

658
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,280
Zenko-Ji...

659
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,480
Baldy.

660
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,480
Salaryman...

661
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,480
Yamada.

662
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,480
Shoten...

663
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,480
* Shoten - classic rakugo TV program

664
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,480
Katsura.

665
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,480
That's enough.

666
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,280
In conclusion, Jimmy hardly knows the names of any comedians at all.

667
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,080
Kinda pisses you off.

668
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,280
I think we need a new referee.

669
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,280
Fujimon, going back to that place far from the water...

670
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,980
What did you make of the freshness proposition?

671
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,980
Come on, I mean...

672
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,980
The whole country's pretty connected...

673
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,380
and it has been for a while, yeah?

674
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,780
Even if...

675
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,080
Even if it's being delivered, it's gonna come pretty quick.

676
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,080
Right, but y'know, actually, there was delivery from both parts of the country, right?

677
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,780
What do you make of that?

678
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,780
Oh yeah but actually it was delivery on—

679
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,780
both of the–

680
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,780
killl meeeeee.

681
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,580
Gimme a damn break.

682
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:29,080
But if they've been around for 57 years already, it must've been pretty tough in the old days...

683
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,580
Yeah, that's true. 57 years ago...

684
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,280
Well, it's...

685
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,980
news to me.

686
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,980
Come on, even Kanda-san noticed.

687
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,980
Get it together, man.
