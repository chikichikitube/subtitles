1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:07,800
Murakami Shoji's classroom series started without anyone wanting it

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,300
It started with a ninja class and then a green beret class

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,900
And then it continued with a pirate class

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,700
The pilot's class was held under the blazing sun in midsummer for the first time

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,200
What kind of the classroom will be held this time?

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,200
You think this is just a bicycle, don't you?

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,800
Follow the damn rules!

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,000
Did we already do it two or three times before?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It snowed for a bit before

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,000
It's so cold now

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,700
Seems like we're doing it again

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,700
Well he made us to

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,900
Is today a piano... pierro (clown) class?

14
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,200
We don't have a piano class now

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,200
Do you know, this classroom series has always had the lowest rating?

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,800
When it's out the ratings are already at the lowest

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,800
Let's tell that to Shoji san now

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,900
Like Shoji san, frankly speaking...

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,700
He probably knows that already

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,500
That's why there's no use

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,000
"Arrival on site"

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's so damn cold

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,300
The hell's that?

24
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,300
Today's temperature is 2Â°c

25
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,000
Their training begins in the cold

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,600
Even a real clown would take today off

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
It's so far away

28
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
It really takes so much time to get there

29
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,600
So damn cold

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,000
We should just move to keep ourselves warm

31
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,700
It's so dabbled here

32
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,300
Where do they take us at such time?

33
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,700
We're here, Clown's class

34
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,900
In that tent

35
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,600
I already wanna have a break

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,700
"Gather here for the Clown class"

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Get out of the tent already

38
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,800
Wait a second

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,300
Yamasaki san

40
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes?

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,300
Should I enter it?

42
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,900
Come out already!

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,700
Good morning!

44
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,100
Good morning

45
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,100
Did you wake up?

46
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,500
The person that appeared on stage with his dog was Murakami Shoji

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,900
What did you guys say to me?

48
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,900
Today...?

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,900
We want to quit it, because the weather is so bad

50
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,200
That's already enough for us, big brother

51
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,100
Hamada, whom are you calling a brother?

52
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,600
I'm sorry

53
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
Maybe that was someone that drove you here?

54
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,900
Am I wrong?

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,200
I'm chief

56
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,200
Got it?

57
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes

58
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,900
Chief, isn't it cold(lame)?

59
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,500
That's my style of performing

60
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,300
What's the matter?

61
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,400
You got it wrong, we mean is it cold?

62
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,500
What's cold?

63
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Listen all of you

64
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,600
You always say it's hot when it's hot and it's cold when it's cold

65
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,300
How come that you're so affected by the weather?

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,300
I'm so stuffed with your whining

67
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,600
He always hates you

68
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,100
Isn't is sad being a man?

69
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,100
We're clowns today

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,500
Endo

71
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,900
I'll say something

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,500
Chief

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,900
Can I ask you one question?

74
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,500
Fine

75
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Chief, this series'

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,500
ratings are always in single digits

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,600
That's right, it's the lowest in Gaki

78
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,500
Can't we do anything about it?

79
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,700
What?

80
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,700
Single digits?

81
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,200
Up until now we've done 4 already and it's always...

82
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,700
Well it has nothing to do with it

83
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,900
Are you afraid to get involved with me?

84
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,800
That's not what we mean

85
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,400
Let's start with greetings

86
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,000
Greetings

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Can you do it?

88
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Please show it to me

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,500
Lets work hard together

90
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,200
Don't talk!

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,600
Clowns don't talk

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,400
All of you should show it with your body

93
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,000
You shouldn't speak

94
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm going to be very strict today

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Finally, the practice training to become a clown begins

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,100
Starting with a pantomime

97
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Clowns must know pantomime

98
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,300
Let's see how you can do it on your own, Hamada

99
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,800
Do the one with a wall

100
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,200
Why don't you try it?

101
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,300
That's quite difficult

102
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,700
Well that's not so bad for the first time, Hamada san

103
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,100
Try that a bit wider

104
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,500
You do it too tiny

105
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,300
I see

106
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,300
So you should do it wider

107
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,800
Tanaka

108
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,500
Do the one with a rope

109
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,200
Try it, pulling a rope

110
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,100
We're watching closely

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,800
What's that? You like you've caught a giant eel

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,500
Are you an idiot? You should do it like that

113
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,200
Hamada

114
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm sorry

115
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,700
Are you a laughing idiot?

116
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,200
I'm sorry

117
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,300
I'm really sorry

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,500
Don't say that it's cold (lame)

119
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,600
You think you're cold (lame), that's why you're cold (lame)

120
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,100
If you swap the meaning of words, it will be a completely different sentence

121
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,000
Get rid of all that "cold (lame)" stuff

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,300
Think it's stiff

123
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Stiff?

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,600
Stiff

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,300
To put simply... you know...

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,100
Well, anyway

127
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,900
I'm really sorry, I didn't manage to finish it

128
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,600
Well, that doesn't matter

129
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,700
Come here

130
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:31,100
Do you listen? A clown should not speak at all

131
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,700
We see

132
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,700
You know, sadness, and other different emotions you shall portrait through your body

133
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,700
You should make it seem like a play

134
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,000
And without a single word

135
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,600
Alright?

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,300
Hamada, get inside there

137
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,800
Inside?

138
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,800
"Hamada's challenge"

139
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,600
That's so cramped

140
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,300
That's how it is?

141
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,300
Sit down there inside

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,700
First of all

143
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,300
Hamada kun is ordering ramen

144
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,900
And it's Hamada's favorite

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,100
Enough of that

146
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,100
Ouch!

147
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,200
I'm sorry!

148
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
You shouldn't speak

149
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,700
When there was no half-boiled egg, you decided to bust the shop owner

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,500
Why don't you try it?

151
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,400
Ready?

152
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Go for it!

153
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,900
That's no good. Can't you do it?

154
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,900
Can't you do it properly?

155
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,800
You shouldn't show words, and also

156
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,500
Do you get it?

157
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,000
That was the correct way

158
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
What was that?

159
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,100
You can't show like that?

160
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,700
Yes

161
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,700
I'm sorry, didn't know that

162
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,200
Can you freeze for a moment?

163
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,400
Yes, just like that

164
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,600
Look at that face

165
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,600
OK

166
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,000
Thank you very much

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,700
Good job

168
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,200
Thank you

169
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
So far so good

170
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,500
Let's go

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,500
Who's next?

172
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,000
You're next

173
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,000
"Yamasaki's challenge"

174
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Please, do you best

175
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
We're counting on you

176
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,300
Yamasaki

177
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:36,900
Yes?

178
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,000
The truth is

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,700
there was diesel fuel in here

180
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,060
Before you've entered

181
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,600
Let's go

182
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,500
All of you, let's go

183
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,700
Excuse me, chief?

184
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,700
Balance is vital for clowns

185
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,100
Next up - tightrope walking

186
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Take one each

187
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,500
Yes

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,100
Don't do anything stupid with them

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,100
That's quite a bad idea

190
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Don't say such things

191
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,600
You should do it with a good mood

192
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry

193
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
That is Macchan's

194
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,400
Thank you

195
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
I'm not really into it

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,500
You take that

197
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,000
Take it!

198
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,200
No way that's mine

199
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
It is yours

200
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,400
Do what your teacher tells you

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,100
Take it!

202
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,900
Please take it

203
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,000
It's heavy

204
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,600
What are you doing?

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,600
Do you want to quit?

206
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,300
I will do it!

207
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,200
For how long will you be acting like that?

208
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,580
Listen, this is 50 meters high

209
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,300
50 meters? So tall!

210
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,600
And you shall hold to it

211
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,700
You should walk like this

212
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
This way

213
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,900
And you definitely should not fall down from here

214
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Why don't you try?

215
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,100
"Everyone's challenge"

216
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,300
You definitely shouldn't come off

217
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Let's try now

219
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Be careful!

220
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,300
Most certainly

221
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,300
Not bad!

222
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,400
Just like that! Grab it!

223
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,400
Keeping a balance?

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,800
Just go like that

225
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,800
Stop for a moment all of you

226
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,800
You fell down

227
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,400
You already fell down

228
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,800
Teacher, that's impossible for me

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,200
There you go again

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,800
That's what the youth says these days

231
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,300
Can't you do it at least for 10 or 20 seconds?

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,500
Are you happy that you fell down while walking?

233
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,100
You come in here with an unknown potential!

234
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:33,700
However, I really can't do it with such a big log

235
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,100
Look at everyone, am I wrong?

236
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,300
You know, you shouldn't think that that's impossible

237
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,500
Why's that?

238
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,900
You know, your father

239
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,900
Was a great man

240
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,900
I'm talking about Serube Yamasaki

241
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,400
Back in the day he could walk that easily

242
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,500
On the rope to the Robiaru building

243
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,000
Your legendary father didn't know such words like "I can't do it"

244
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,300
Should we finish already?

245
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,700
The bell's already ringing

246
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,300
That was not as usual

247
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,200
It already tells us that we should go home

248
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,300
Why does that always happens with me?

249
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,000
Do it

250
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
"Yamasaki's challenge again"

251
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,500
Do your best

252
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:44,600
Look, like that keep yourself balanced

253
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
Pay attention to your body

254
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,200
Grab it properly

255
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,200
Do your best!

256
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,200
Why not just carry it?

257
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,700
"Why not carry it?"

258
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,700
I'm telling you to grab it

259
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,000
Why can't you just garb it? Just like that

260
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,700
That's how an expert does it

261
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,700
Why is difficult just to do it like this?

262
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,400
Just roll it a bit in your hands, you idiot

263
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,600
Just do it properly

264
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,300
Like an annoying child

265
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,500
Hold it, and now walk

266
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,500
Don't look down

267
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,000
You should look ahead for 10 meters

268
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,000
That's your first time saying it

269
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,300
'Zaki san, do your best!

270
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,400
Just like that

271
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Good

272
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,200
Very good, don't forget 'bout the balance

273
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,300
And then do it like that

274
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,000
Yama chan is absolutely fearless

275
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,300
Fine, enough of that

276
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,100
Let's move

277
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,100
You're absolutely worthless in this one

278
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,600
Let's have a brake

279
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,500
"Break time"

280
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,700
Shouldn't we start from my Senpai

281
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,700
Take it

282
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,200
2 or 3 cups, take as much as you want

283
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,900
So cool. Really?

284
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,900
Than I shall take it, thank you

285
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,700
You're next

286
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,700
May I?

287
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,700
Thank you

288
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,700
Thank you

289
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,700
Thank you

290
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,700
Thank you

291
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,700
No way

292
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,700
What a splendid tea, it's so good

293
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,300
Excuse me

294
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,500
Mine's empty

295
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,700
May I pour some?

296
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,100
He's pouring it by himself

297
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,100
Thank you for the tea

298
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,900
Do you have a right to drink?

299
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,200
I'm able to drink

300
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,700
Don't say that as if you'll be able to drink

301
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,600
Don't you think that's strange?

302
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,600
But, I tried hard

303
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,300
Although Russians and Chinese don't quarrel

304
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,100
It sounds just like telling them in Japanese to stop it

305
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,100
Completely meaningless

306
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,100
The other party also

307
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm completely cold (lame) today

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,200
Sorry, completely terrible

309
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,900
Cold? Maybe you meant stiff?

310
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,900
Yes, stiff

311
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,200
I'm completely misled

312
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,500
At this point

313
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,200
Next up, the clowns should know one of the most exciting part of their show

314
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,800
This what audience is the most excited about

315
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,600
Look, you hold the fork

316
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,100
They throw you that

317
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,600
It falls on you

318
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,900
And then you strike a pose

319
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,400
And then the audience claps

320
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,200
This is what clowns never stopped doing

321
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,100
Fine, why don't you try?

322
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,500
Me? I think I'll be able to do it

323
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,500
"Matsumoto challenge"

324
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Are you ready?

325
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Do your best!

326
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,200
Let's do it

327
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,500
Great! So cool!

328
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,800
The hell did you do now?

329
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,300
What was that, Matsumoto kun?

330
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,300
But I caught it

331
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,700
Does that mean anything to you?

332
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,900
It was supposed to be like that?

333
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,900
I'm sorry

334
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,800
I just thought that I should have tried harder

335
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,800
You shouldn't try so hard!

336
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,100
You're trying hard in wrong direction

337
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,800
And now you did your "best"

338
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,900
I'm sorry

339
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,900
I'm so pissed off now

340
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,900
Hey, you, try it

341
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
I'm sure I'll be able to do it
"Yamasaki's challenge"

342
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,000
Do your best!
"Yamasaki's challenge"

343
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,900
Alright, did you get that?
"Yamasaki's challenge"

344
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,200
Alright, did you get that?

345
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,200
It's quite rainy

346
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,300
Do it like a pro

347
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,100
What's with him?

348
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,300
Go, get it!

349
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,600
Chief, could you please throw it more careful?

350
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,600
Let's do it with an apple

351
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
With apple, right?

352
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Can't he stop that?

353
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,100
Please throw it

354
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,900
Because, chief, I will definitely be able to do it

355
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,300
I am confident

356
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,700
I'll do it properly, so please throw it

357
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,900
Where's that confidence?

358
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,700
Chief

359
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,600
Let's stop that already

360
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,200
Please, give me a chance like you did to others

361
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,300
It just hit his shoulder

362
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,600
That just hit your shoulder

363
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,500
You just have no motivation

364
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,300
I'm motivated!

365
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,200
Motivation Energy Iwaki (Japanese politician)

366
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,600
You don't have any of that

367
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,140
You absolutely have nothing of that

368
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,740
Motivation Energy Yamasaki

369
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,740
You're hopeless

370
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,600
I'll do it

371
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Come here

372
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,100
Take it

373
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,100
Hamada, try throwing a fork

374
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,400
Please stop that, chief. This is definitely dangerous

375
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,100
The last one is the toughest obstacle for the clowns

376
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,600
Not to speak at any time

377
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,400
Shall we train not to speak?

378
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,700
Yamasaki

379
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,600
I told you to be quiet!

380
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,500
Yamasaki, didn't you do the training to be silent

381
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,600
Anyway

382
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
That's the last training to be silent

383
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,600
Yes!

384
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,100
Bring it here

385
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,700
What? Wait a minute!

386
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:40,900
Now, you'll be chased by this Shepard dog

387
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,900
That is our final training

388
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,400
This is the next step for a person in not letting any voice out

389
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,400
In that case...

390
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,100
Matsumoto?

391
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,300
Why don't you try?

392
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,700
Wouldn't it be better to see a demonstration?

393
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,700
What?

394
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,100
By chief

395
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
That's just a suggestion

396
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,300
Can't we have a look at our chief's demonstration? Please!

397
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,700
Alright

398
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,700
I'll do it

399
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Please be careful

400
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Please, chief

401
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,200
"Chief's demonstration"

402
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,200
So he should be chased by it? That's scary

403
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,200
Look carefully

404
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,900
Yes!

405
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,400
It's coming!

406
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,900
That's no good

407
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,900
So scary!

408
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,000
Ouch!

409
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,200
Chief that's too scary, no way we're doing it

410
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,800
Chief, that too bad, we're not doing that. See you next time, chief

411
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,500
Miss owner, stop it!

412
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,300
"After recording"

413
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,800
That was too scary!

414
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,700
You're all snotty

415
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,400
Blood come out, wait that's paint

416
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,900
I got so scared from that!

417
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,000
I forgot that I was a clown
