1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,700
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,030
Toro Salmon's Kubota Shichi-Henge!

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,840
- It's been quite a while since we did this, hasn't it?
- He is the 58th challenger.
-58th!

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,910
This time the challenger  came directly to me .

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,850
- Did he ask you to let him do it?
- "Really let me do it."
- Really?

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,850
He has enough momentum to "21 henge".

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,850
No way.

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,060
- Feel his enthusiasm firsthand.
- Okay.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,530
Now, come the star of today's show, Toro Salmon!

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,130
Hello!

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,400
- Your enthusiasm is great.
- I am going to do 26 henge instead of 21 henge.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,270
What are you saying?

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,240
- It was the first time I had ever been asked directly for h.
- I see.

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:52,910
I don't know if it was because of Shichi-henge, but he didn't say a word during the recording of yesterday's bicycle race show.

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,150
That's bad!
That's a bad influence!

16
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,850
- You are too nervous!
- Then don't do it!

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,490
This is the ranking list.
What rank are you aiming for?

18
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,330
Of course, I want to surpass Koumoto-san, who came in first.

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,430
- Koumoto has been sitting in first place for a long time.
- I would like to be in the top 5 or 6.

20
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,670
It was difficult to make jokes because compliance was very strict.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,600
You're already making excuses?

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,170
No, it’s not!

23
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,780
Don't say that before you do it.

24
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,680
I can no longer do dick jokes that make people around the world laugh.

25
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,520
That's not just a compliance issue.

26
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,960
- Please do your best to do as much as you can to broadcast.
- You are aiming for the top 5, so good luck to you!

27
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,870
This is nice.
“Can Matsumoto and Kinni-kun talk to each other using only their muscles?”

28
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,910
- You got up fast!
- I can.

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,940
No, you can’t!

30
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,610
You got up fast!

31
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,350
I don't know, I'm a “Shichi-henge Virgin”.

32
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,080
We are all like that at first.

33
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,490
I can have a conversation with just my muscles if I want to.

34
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,360
But that conversation isn't funny.

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,960
- That's not good!
-  Even if we could have a conversation, it would have to be funny.

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,930
How about having Shoji join it?

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,440
Shoji still can't speak with his muscles.

38
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,310
He is not a good talker.
Not a good “muscle talker”.

39
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,750
Thank you for visiting us today.

40
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:45,330
Touch as many girls as you like that you normally would not touch.

41
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,560
Now the girls will enter, and please go and sit with the man of your choice.

42
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,300
Melon-chan, Strawberry-chan, Marron-chan, come on, go to them.

43
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,010
Now, when she comes next to you, hustle time begins.
Don't just cause trouble.
Have fun today.

44
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,880
Now the "flirting time" starts.

45
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,890
Now, everyone, please touch them as much as you like.
Don't overdo it.

46
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,390
It is a one-shot deal that you can only touch.

47
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,890
Staff, turn on the lights.

48
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,030
Girls please go back.

49
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,430
I don’t know.

50
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,900
I didn't do anything.

51
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,370
Sir, what did you do?

52
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,710
I didn't do anything.

53
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,180
There is a karen in seat 6.
Check.

54
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,650
A short man with a shaggy head.

55
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,550
What did you do to her?

56
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,780
I did not do anything to her.

57
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,050
Our girl is crying!

58
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,420
Please follow the rules!

59
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,560
Get all the customers out.
And park the car out front.

60
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:58,700
We are in business to entertain you!

61
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,800
Are you okay?

62
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,870
It is nothing....

63
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,440
She is crying.

64
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,040
Look up.
Let's go to the private room.

65
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,680
What are you doing?

66
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,910
What did you do to her?

67
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,350
What happened?
Did he say anything to you?

68
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,950
He said, "I have to do this or I won't get excited."

69
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,020
No way.

70
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,590
I didn't mention this to upper management, but this is the fifth time you've done this, right?

71
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,060
This is the fifth time.
But I didn't tell them about it.

72
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,230
You go back.

73
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,500
Huh?
I know this guy.

74
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,440
Chairman, please come here.

75
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,980
Hey, wait there, short man.

76
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,680
Chairman.

77
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,450
Is it still going on?

78
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,420
This is a long piece.

79
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,490
It's a long piece from the first shot.

80
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,730
There are a lot of customers today.

81
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,130
Is that you?

82
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:00,730
Hey.

83
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:01,660
No.

84
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,170
- You messed with our woman?
- No, I didn't do anything.

85
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,300
Who is he?

86
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,930
He is Hamada.

87
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,870
Ah, I know this guy.

88
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,310
I like comedy.

89
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,840
I forgive you.
You have a life ahead of you, right?

90
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,910
Hey, do the "announcement of the results".

91
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,280
- I like that one.
I listen to it on Youtube a lot, right?
- Yes.

92
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,320
Say "announcement of the results".

93
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,750
Say "announcement of the results"!!

94
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,930
- Announcement of the results....
- What's that little voice!?

95
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,560
Is my youtube volume too high?

96
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,070
Is my youtube volume too high?

97
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,370
Say "announcement of the results"!!

98
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,570
Are you kidding me?

99
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,570
- Would you like me to call the police?
- Yeah.

100
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,440
What the hell.

101
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,610
It was long.

102
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,810
Was the last one necessary?

103
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,580
It was long.

104
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,590
I don't think he needed the second half.

105
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,590
The girl touched you a lot, didn't she?

106
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,620
She kept saying, "Let's play, Hosei-san."

107
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,430
The girls really said that.

108
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,860
That's the kind of thing that bothers me.

109
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,170
It was pretty real.

110
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,050
I enjoyed the movie.

111
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,350
Yeah, I never thought I'd be able to watch a movie with you at my age.

112
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,290
Ah, the traffic light turned red.

113
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:38,260
This is no time for older man and older woman to be talking about love here.

114
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,770
No matter how much I jump rope, I can't lose any weight.

115
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,810
I want to lose 8 kg.

116
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,910
Ow...!
My stomach hurts!

117
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,810
why does this have to happen right now?

118
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,520
It can't be helped.

119
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,050
Sorry.

120
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,790
He's pooping.

121
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,890
Ah, that's refreshing.

122
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,900
Sorry. There was no bathroom.

123
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,030
Oh, I have to do this while I'm waiting.

124
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,070
- What the hell are you doing!?
- What?

125
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,110
I have to jump rope while I'm waiting.

126
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,550
This light is taking forever.

127
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,250
What the hell are you talking about!?

128
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,650
Stop it!
Sorry, sir!

129
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,460
You're overdoing it!

130
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,100
- "The light has turned green."
- Sorry!

131
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,830
Get the hell out of here!
You stupid son of a bitch!

132
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,700
So sorry!
I was about to shit myself!

133
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,700
I'll leave.
Sorry.

134
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,780
Go away!

135
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,490
Woah, you don’t see this everyday!

136
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,090
There's a flower blooming in the asphalt!

137
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,670
I don't understand the view of the world.

138
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,470
That was a good story?

139
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,540
I thought the acrylic panels were there to protect us from the coronavirus.

140
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,010
But it was to protect us from shit.

141
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,550
That was absolutely necessary.

142
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,750
He's an idiot.

143
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,740
Hi.
Please listen to one ridiculous story.

144
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,500
No, please listen to two, three, or four.

145
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,670
Let me begin immediately.

146
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:11,380
I work in a small buckwheat noodle restaurant.

147
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:17,120
No, it is not small, but rather large.
Well, please imagine the size of the restaurant by yourself.

148
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,690
When I enter the restaurant, I see my wife, Omame.

149
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,390
I have been running this restaurant with her for over 50 years.

150
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:32,670
And there comes a man with a swagger that is well-known in town.

151
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,300
"Shokichi is here!!"

152
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,080
Shokichi was famous for doing bad things.

153
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,480
Shokichi entered the private room and closed the door.

154
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:51,220
Then Shokichi said,
"Hey, bring me a large bowl of buckwheat noodle!"

155
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:57,790
Sorry, it's not a large bowl, it's a medium bowl.
No, not a medium bowl, but a small bowl.

156
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,660
Then I said to Omame,
"Omame, give him a small bowl.

157
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,360
"Yes, honey."

158
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,500
Omame went into the room and closed the door.

159
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,940
But Omame did not come out of the room.

160
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,040
I heard a sound from the room.

161
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,380
"Hey, Omame, what are you doing?"

162
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,050
Omame said nothing.

163
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,750
"Hey, Omameh, answer me!"

164
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,590
"@#$#%^&&#$$&"

165
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,490
Did a customer come in?

166
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,390
"Hey, Omame, are you listening?"

167
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,600
I don't know what that noise is, but I can hear it.

168
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,000
I felt sick, so I went toward the eel restaurant

169
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,270
There was a man I recognized at the end of a narrow alley.

170
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,880
"Hey, Shokichi is here"

171
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,480
Huh? What is he doing here?

172
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,150
"Shokichi, What are you doing?"

173
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,520
"I'm having "my rolling pin" held by Omame."

174
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,860
And Shokichi said, "Hey! Why don't you join me?

175
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,860
"I can't do that!"
I found myself holding Shokichi's rolling pin, too.

176
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,300
I found that his rolling pin entered me repeatedly.

177
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:21,480
What a day, I thought, and went back to the restaurant.

178
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,140
Then I noticed that the manhole cover was open.

179
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,380
"Who was messing with this manhole?"

180
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,150
I opened the manhole and found someone in it.

181
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,350
"Hey, Shokichi is here!"
He came out of the manhole.

182
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,590
When I looked closer, I saw that Omame was touching his rolling pin.

183
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,920
Then Omame did this.

184
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:49,300
As she did so, a white liquid, like buckwheat sauce, sprayed around from the manhole.

185
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:59,110
I licked it off my mouth and it was salty.
It tasted like seawater on the beach.

186
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,120
What a wonderful day it is today.

187
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,320
I really hope this isn’t a dream.

188
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,000
He makes jokes like this all the time, doesn't he?

189
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,940
It was like Shibahama only at the end.

190
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,070
It was like a human-interest story?

191
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,570
He is disgusting.

192
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,020
Shangri-La, The utopia she chanted is dazzling

193
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,160
Shangri-La, She spoke quaint is good

194
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,960
Why this song?

195
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,100
Shangri-La, Whatever she does, it doesn't matter

196
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,940
Shangri-La, Ignore the memories lost in Shangri-La

197
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,010
KISS in a dream
KISS KISS KISS KISS KISS

198
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:09,850
The colorful world that seems to lead to anywhere and everywhere is a beautiful time

199
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,020
KISS in a dream
KISS KISS KISS KISS KISS

200
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:28,070
My heart was thrilled with sweet feelings that always and forever sparkle like those days

201
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,010
KISS in a dream
KISS KISS KISS KISS KISS

202
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:45,850
The days are peaceful in the rustling that seems to drift away forever and ever

203
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,860
KISS in a dream
KISS KISS KISS KISS KISS

204
00:13:51,460 --> 00:14:04,640
The rain that always and forever sparkles and falls down was moistening the spring like those days

205
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,880
I want to be a crocodile.
Yeah, I want to be a crocodile.

206
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,950
Is he crazy?

207
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,760
It was messy.

208
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,420
He is insane.

209
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,800
Here comes Kazu-kun, the gorilla genius!

210
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,410
Let's see what the gorilla genius Kazu-kun can do!

211
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,010
First of all, let's thank our visitors!

212
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:51,820
A...RI...GA...TO....U...
(THANK YOU)

213
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,090
You're so smart, you know how to read!
Ladies and gentlemen! Give him a round of applause!

214
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,670
Kazu-kun, don't touch your butt!

215
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:16,410
Kazu-kun, wake up!
Hey, visitor next to him! Rub Kazu-kun's back!

216
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:28,690
The visitor with a banana in front of you, peel the banana and feed it to Kazu-kun.

217
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,740
I've never seen Kazu-kun so happy.
Ladies and gentlemen! Give him a round of applause!

218
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,810
Because you smell it!

219
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,050
Why aren't you eating this?

220
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,520
Kazu-kun, why did you smell that again?

221
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,390
The visitor next to him! Rub Kazu-kun's back!

222
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,400
Kazu-kun has a fruit present for you all today.

223
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,470
Hey, Kazu-kun, give it to everyone.

224
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,050
He has a sense of camaraderie.

225
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,850
Kazu-kun is unusually excited!
But he is so happy!

226
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,090
Huh?
Kazu-kun wants to say something.

227
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,300
PA...PA...

228
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,440
Great! Kazu-kun could speak for the first time!
It's thanks to gorilla papa!

229
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,740
That's all, Kazu-kun, the genius gorilla.

230
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,350
Kazu-kun was talking.

231
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,950
He recovered in the second half, didn't he?

232
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,720
I don't know if that was really Kubota, though.

233
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,430
Please stop now.

234
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,200
Walk!

235
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,540
Hey, fuckin' pig.
How many days have you been coming to this shop?

236
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,710
20 days.

237
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,010
- You've been going here for 20 days straight?
- Yes, thank you.

238
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,450
You're disgusting!

239
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,550
Get down here on all fours.

240
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,590
Yes.
Please be gentle.

241
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,660
Like this? Like this?

242
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,130
Please don't do that!
Please!

243
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:56,240
I'm going to tease you a lot today with this thing you love so much.

244
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,140
Please don't do that.

245
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,470
You want me to stop?

246
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,510
No.

247
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,110
What do you want!?

248
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,010
I want you to do it!

249
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,610
- Say "I want you to do it, please."
- I want you to do it, please.

250
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,350
Here we go.

251
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,820
It sounds great.
It sounds wonderful.

252
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,060
- Get off.
- Yes.

253
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,060
This is what you really love.

254
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,030
You can smell it.

255
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,870
- How about it?
- I can't resist. I'm back.

256
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,070
- You wanna see what's inside this thing?
- Yes, will you show me?

257
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,440
Oh, I can't resist.
Can I put my finger in?

258
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,310
- Not yet!
- Sorry.

259
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,310
Let me touch it a little.

260
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,180
- I said not yet!
- So sorry.

261
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,450
Look, you can see inside.

262
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,790
I can't resist any longer!

263
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,160
- Don’t lick that!!
- Sorry.

264
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,260
I've rewarded you too much.
Wrap this around your waist.

265
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,070
- Is this the legendary one?
- Yes, it is.

266
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,740
Does this cost extra? Is that okay?

267
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,840
- Hurry.
- Yes.

268
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,010
- Blow on that!
- I can't!

269
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,510
- Hurry!
- Please forgive me!

270
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,520
No! it looks like its gonna pop!
It's overflowing!

271
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,450
I'm already overflowing!

272
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,520
- I can't do anything anymore!
- Come here!

273
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,860
Come here, I'll give you a reward.

274
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,060
I'll give you a reward.

275
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,400
If I do that, I won't be human!

276
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,270
Blow it!
Here we go!

277
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,700
Here we go!

278
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,640
Please extend the time!

279
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,870
Please extend it until I die!

280
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,610
Until I die!

281
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,550
Now I'm going to whip you.

282
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,980
You're going to do that now?

283
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,450
- That no longer works for my body.
- Come on!

284
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,650
- Please spit in my eyes.
- Come on!

285
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,190
Sorry.

286
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,860
I laughed.

287
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,800
- It's a terrible proclivity.
- You seem to like this kind of thing too.
- No.

288
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,070
This seems to make masochists laugh.

289
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,770
Yes, me and Matsumoto-san had laugh.

290
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,020
Who?

291
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,020
Hello?

292
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,020
I just got home.

293
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,530
What I do now is none of your business.

294
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,630
I'm alone now, so I have nothing to do.
I'm going to play alone now.

295
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,170
Leave me alone.

296
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,340
Formula 1 starts now.
I'm hanging up.
...Fuck you.

297
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,550
I'd like to play with this, imagining Formula 1 alone.

298
00:20:52,710 --> 00:21:00,190
The McLaren is in the starting position and the cars following behind.
I love it when these turn like this.

299
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:06,360
I love to catch up like this and do 400 to 500 km/h in the second half of the race.

300
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,330
I don't want anyone to see this.

301
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,670
I love this part.

302
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,000
At the starting line I turn this thing on.

303
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,750
Yes, from here it's a straight line to the finish line.

304
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,180
From here!

305
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:45,800
In a battle of 500 to 600 km/h, McLaren is going to get passed.
But McLaren will catch them from here!

306
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,500
From here!
From here!

307
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,810
From here!
That's enough!

308
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,140
"That's enough"?

309
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,450
That's enough!
That's enough!

310
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,580
Everything is already enough!

311
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:08,920
There's no stopping them! I can't finish!
My adrenaline is pumping!
I have work after this, but I don't care!

312
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:17,500
It's rare in this day and age, but I shave so much.
I have to do this.
And I'm going to end up crashing.

313
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,100
That's end up crashing.

314
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,800
And it starts here.

315
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,850
- What are you doing?
- What the hell.

316
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,590
That was awesome!

317
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,530
What the hell is this punchline?

318
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,700
You thought I was going to get a weird haircut, didn't you?

319
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,530
It's neat.

320
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,470
Surprisingly.

321
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,970
Surprisingly neat!

322
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,240
That's fun!

323
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,250
- He also recovered at the end.
- Yeah.

324
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,910
How much is it in the end?

325
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,920
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

326
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,820
- There were some worrisome parts along the way, but...
- You rank right up there with TKO's Kinoshita.

327
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,960
Bad luck!

328
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,890
It's bad luck!
Give me a break!

329
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:24,160
It's just a coincidence.
Don't say that.

330
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,530
Someone please add 1,000 yen! Please!

331
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,470
- I don't want to be like him!
- That is an injustice.

332
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,000
I don't want to be like him!

333
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,110
Sure, you used a plastic bottle.

334
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,440
You right.

335
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,680
But that's not the case.
I just made a sound with that thing.

336
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,150
That was great at the end.

337
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,820
I saw you as Jack Nicholson.

338
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,690
Nobody calls me Jack Nicholson.

339
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,360
It was good.
