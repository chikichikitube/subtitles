On today's Gaki No Tsukai

00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,500
We'll see the second half of the previous table games episode!

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,370
Just as last week

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,820
It's time to have a good time playing

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,820

12
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,360
This one

13
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,930
We'll have to play it in front of the table

14
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,660
Roger       - Ok

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,040
Use your turned-down card as a pillar to rise a building!!

16
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:36,040
Captain Rhino (huge version) - Germany

17
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,260
The game Tanaka chose

18
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,160
Is "Captain Rhino", from Germany!

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,470
You have to use face-down cards as pillar
to gradually build a tower, it's a balance game

20
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,280
Cards will start piling up

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,750
And the one who tears it down will lose, that's the game

22
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,130
I see

23
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:57,800
First you place your "wall-cards" in the position showed on the base-card

24
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:57,800
Germany -  Captain Rhino (huge version)

25
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:57,800
Then you place a "roof-card" from those you have in your hand

26
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:57,800
note: narrator voice = same as text

27
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:07,730
OVER THE DISPLAYED MARK

28
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:07,730
THE NEXT PLAYER WILL PLACE "CAPTAIN RHINO"

29
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:13,040
ADDS AN EXTRA ROOF CARD

30
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:13,040
CHANGE ORDER

31
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:13,040
PLACE AN EXTRA

32
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:13,040
ROOF CARD

33
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:13,040
SKIP ONE PLAYER

34
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:13,040
THE NEXT PLAYER

35
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,260
This 5 marks appears over the roof cards you can place

36
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,800
The players will stack em up while following their directions

37
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:13,040
OVER THE DISPLAYED MARK

38
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:13,040
THE NEXT PLAYER WILL PLACE "CAPTAIN RHINO"

39
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,100
This mark is the most important between them

40
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,210
One thing

41
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,010
If a player places a roof-card with the Rhino mark

42
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,550
The next person in order must

43
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,450
Place Rhino over it and keep on building

44
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:35,460
Rhino

45
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,320
So is it a special card ?

46
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,500
In a way this one has a special function

47
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,350
So it's special, right?

48
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,430
'Cause you can't just move it

49
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,340
Where do we have to place this monster, then?

50
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,340
monster

51
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,340
It's not a monster!

52
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,340
It's Rhino     - In the middle?

53
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,460
Rhino is supposed to be a loveable character!

54
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,130
Let's try a bit to... that's right, we have to try it

55
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,160
If I don't try it I won't get it

56
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,130
Maybe while you explain it...

57
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:40,870
Ok so...

58
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,510
Let's start from me

59
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,300
First of all place it

60
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,480
Following the directions

61
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,140
Which directions?

62
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,140
This is, uh... it's

63
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,650
The illustrations

64
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,650
down here

65
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,550
And now

66
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,710
I'm placing this

67
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,280
You place it-- oh, there's Rhino

68
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,010
Here's Rhino

69
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:58,910
Rhino already?!

70
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,700
So now Endo-san

71
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,220
Has to place Rhino before the cards

72
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,990
THE NEXT PERSON MUST PLACE RHINO ON TOP

73
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,990
Wait a moment, already?

74
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,290
So I guess it's here?      - Place Rhino there

75
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,790
Placed     - Now the walls

76
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,900
Two cards for this?

77
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,800
Yes

78
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,020
Is it always two cards?

79
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,000
Nope, could also be a single card

80
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,470
Who knocks it down

81
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,760
Yes?

82
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,470
loses

83
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,470
That's right     - Got it got it

84
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,570
Now Endo-san

85
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,080
Has to choose which of his card to use as his roof-card

86
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,980
Has to choose which of his card to use as his roof-card

87
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,980
Ok ok ok

88
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm going then

89
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,070
It's a Rhino card again

90
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,680
Ok, Hamada-san is next

91
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,120
You have to take that Rhino first

92
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,010
Make sure to take it first

93
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:32,550
Right

94
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,860
Rhino

95
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,860
So are we reusing

96
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,860
this thing?

97
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,700
Could you stop calling it "thing"?

98
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,650
Let's avoid this abusive language

99
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,380
It's Rhino-chan

100
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,340
I mean, I guess it's still bearable at this height      - Yes

101
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,100
Right, but things won't be that easy as it gets taller

102
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,640
After that, Hamada safely clears a round

103
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,640
Hamada then proceeds to safely place his wall-cards

104
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:54,270
Matsumoto too easily clears a round!

105
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,830
After him, Matsumoto too clears it easily

106
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,700
And next one is Housei

107
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,380
Housei is next

108
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,680
Place Rhino first

109
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,450
Oh, Rhino-chan first?

110
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,370
Yes, Rhino-chan first

111
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,200
Then I place this      - Place it, right

112
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,770
This is...

113
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,340
This is a bit...

114
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,480
Ok, done      - Alright

115
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:08,980
Woah!

116
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,120
This one kinda

117
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,990
Gives me a bad sense of stability

118
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,810
It's scary, yeah

119
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,890
This-- Oh, you used that?

120
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,150
This is a reverse card

121
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,270
CHANGE ORDER

122
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,190
Flips the order

123
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,270
And now it's Matsumoto's turn

124
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,270
Got it

125
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,540
Can you see

126
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,440
The way he's trying to create

127
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,440
this sort-of-fighting mood?

128
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,870
It's like those rival dojo in comedy manga, isn't it irritating?

129
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,940
It's like those rival dojo in comedy manga, isn't it irritating?

130
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:38,320
Suzuki Yoshiji

131
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,400
It's like those of Suzuki-sensei or...

132
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,320
Kaminaga Ichiro

133
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,570
Or Kaminaga-sensei

134
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,380
Yeah that's the setting he's aiming at

135
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,320
We're gonna need tons of lawyers for that

136
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,320
Yeah, right

137
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:40,710
Alright

138
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,120
What should I do?

139
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,300
Which is it?

140
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,630
CHANGE ORDER

141
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,080
That one...

142
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,630
It's reverse again

143
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,630
Back to Housei-san

144
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,670
Have I forgot to mention "rival-relationships are old fashioned"?

145
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,170
As long as it is

146
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,170
Funny, it doesn't matter that much

147
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,070
We're back to Yama-chan      - Your turn, Housei-san

148
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,100
This is pretty harsh

149
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,610
Now that we end up to this

150
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,230
Watch out

151
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:06,870
This is risky!

152
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,440
Seriously

153
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:07,900
Ok

154
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,870
This one was risky

155
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,570
Yeah

156
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,410
I've made it

157
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,040
It would suck to get Rhino by now

158
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,280
What if we pull out Rhino now?

159
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,130
CHANGE ORDER

160
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,700
You have to place it     - Matsumoto-san

161
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,130
You're next

162
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,590
(staff)

163
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,590
It's reverse again

164
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,570
It's not that hilarious, man !!

165
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,300
I guess two turns were enough!!

166
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,200
It got old already      - What, wait a moment

167
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,710
Matsumoto, Hamada and Endo too clear their rounds splendidly!

168
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,270
After that

169
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,870
Matsumoto, Hamada and Endo perfectly make it through

170
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,050
The building reaches the tenth floor!

171
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,040
And the building

172
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,570
Reaches its 10 floor!

173
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,460
Tanaka, this...

174
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,710
This is... we're pushing it to its limits

175
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,790
I really want to add a floor to this

176
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,280
Of course you want to

177
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,580
One, two, three, four, five...

178
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,080
This is the worst part

179
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,270
If the game would end here

180
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,270
it won't be funny at all

181
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,790
I guess you're right

182
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,230
Even if you say so...

183
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,670
If this ends here

184
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,670
Tanaka is the worst

185
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,130
Concentrate, concentrate

186
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,700
Concentrate, you're doing it

187
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,970
It's fine

188
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,510
This is nothing good

189
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,350
Which card is it next?

190
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,070
This

191
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,720
SKIP ONE PLAYER

192
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,640
Skip one player?

193
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,110
It's on Matsumoto-san then

194
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,610
Rules are rules

195
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,060
His choice is right

196
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,630
Dude that's so sly

197
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,230
He can but please

198
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,400
Please don't fail on this one !!

199
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,360
Come on Tanaka, you don't have to go that far to stop me

200
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,130
He made it

201
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,130
He did it

202
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,200
Ok

203
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,500
Yama-chan will be skipping this turn, so it's on Matsumoto-san

204
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,270
Yama-chan will be skipping this turn, so it's on Matsumoto-san

205
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,270
Ok, Matsumoto-san

206
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,540
Matsumoto-san...

207
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,380
If it falls right now

208
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,380
it's not going to be funny at all

209
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,580
It would be the worst

210
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,220
It's really the unfunniest distance

211
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,220
I mean height

212
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,750
I really have no idea how's up there, I can't see anything!

213
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,790
I really have no idea how's up there, I can't see anything!

214
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,500
Right

215
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,010
That's true

216
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,810
It's too high

217
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,780
I don't know its shape

218
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,680
Woah, here we are...

219
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,700
Which shape is it?

220
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,700
It's a single one

221
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,200
A single one?     - Just one?     - One...

222
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,630
A single "V" on its center

223
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,670
If you manage to get through this, the next player will be pressured

224
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,970
If you manage to get through this, the next player will be pressured

225
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,490
Yeah, right

226
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,090
Pretty high...

227
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,000
This is a bit too much...

228
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,840
You can do it, Matsumoto-san!

229
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,050
He actually made it

230
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,440
See?

231
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,550
Are you for real?

232
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,880
This is impossible by now

233
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,220
Speak louder!

234
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,490
I have a really bad feeling about this

235
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,820
This is a bit too much...

236
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,230
It's on, it's on, it's on!

237
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,260
Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok

238
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,010
That means

239
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,810
Hamada-san is next

240
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,180
This is impossible by now

241
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,240
I don't think I can see its top from this stepladder

242
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,780
I don't think I can see its top from this stepladder

243
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,520
Let's do it with a taller one then

244
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,640
I think you can do this

245
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,810
Yeah but it's shaking like crazy!

246
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,250
This should do it

247
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:15,930
Yeah but

248
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,800
Shouldn't we let Hamada place it?

249
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,350
Man, it can't be that near

250
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,460
This is scary

251
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,400
If you please

252
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,450
Scary !!

253
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,250
That's 'cause you placed this single card here

254
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,360
Why the other side?

255
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,320
Nnnope !!

256
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,650
The other side! The other!

257
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,620
It's not a matter of sides---

258
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,460
You suck

259
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,700
Moreover, it happened without him realizing it

260
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah it was like "I have no idea what's goin' on"

261
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,490
He really had no idea it was happening

262
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,400
He ignored it!

263
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,100
As soon as I placed it

264
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,530
I suddenly got it back cause it was shaky

265
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,780
Alright, you're no good!!

266
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,820
Matsumoto snaps playing a occupy-the-base game!?

267
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,540
Coming up

268
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,540
Matsumoto's outburst with a battle game!?

269
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,190
Blokus - France

270
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,190
Link together the pieces with your color and line them up!!

271
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,780
The next game Tanaka chose

272
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,280
Is "Blokus", from France!

273
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:32,070
France -  Blokus

274
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:32,070
It's a game about occupying the others' base, in which 4 players,

275
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:32,070
in order, has to connect the pieces with his own color

276
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,850
4 players, in turns,

277
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,850
While connecting their own pieces

278
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,490
Must place them on the gameboard

279
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,790
However

280
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,620
There's a single rule...

281
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,700
You have to line each of them up one after another

282
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,200
As a rule, at least one spot of each piece must adhere

283
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:43,380
As a rule, at least one spot of each piece must adhere

284
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,160
It must touch, right?

285
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:43,380
To that of another piece you've placed

286
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,330
Just one spot, right?

287
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,210
You have to make sure their edges touch

288
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,770
The edges?

289
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,170
But you can't make them touch like this

290
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,380
We can't?      - Is it not good?

291
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,250
Yeah this is no good

292
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,220
If the sides are touching, it isn't ok

293
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,850
Edges only?

294
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,490
Yes, it's only the edges

295
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,830
You do like this with just the edges...      - I see...

296
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,390
And gradually connect them

297
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,000
By doing that you widen your own field

298
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,030
You also have to think on how to block your opponents' invasion

299
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,030
That's hard!     - I see

300
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,670
You have to

301
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,170
Use your head

302
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,970
The player who thinks he can't go further than that, is out

303
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,560
I see, I see

304
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,710
Keep on playing until the end with those who still can

305
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,800
Woah you can't really...

306
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,870
Win this game if you don't corner the others

307
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,340
Pretty much

308
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,220
Starting from Endo

309
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,410
Lots of them have edges... Ok, I'm going

310
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,220
Ok

311
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,610
Nice choice

312
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,740
Next up is Hamada

313
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,950
Choose which one to use between these

314
00:09:28,620 --> 00:10:00,150
Endo → Hamada → Matsumoto → Housei

315
00:09:28,620 --> 00:10:00,150
upper right corner: in-game color of the players

316
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,680
Alright

317
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,110
Good

318
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,420
Like that

319
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,020
Alright

320
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,120
Back to Endo-san

321
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,330
Yes, yes, yes, just like that

322
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,070
Why pointing that out? I can see it

323
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,530
'Cause the rules are surprisingly hard

324
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,110
Let's see...

325
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,200
Alright, alright

326
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,200
Ok

327
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,670
Yes, that's fine

328
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,480
I have no idea what to do, though      - Yeah me too

329
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,120
You can't do that!!

330
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,160
'Cause the sides are touching right here

331
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,160
But it wasn't touching over there

332
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,630
Yeah but

333
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,130
Even if it touches just one side is still not ok

334
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,130
So like that?      - Yeah, that's fine

335
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,900
The four of them easily place their pieces

336
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,680
However, the space on the board

337
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,680
However, the space on the board is reaching its limits

338
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,480
8th round

339
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,430
Give me a second     - Ok

340
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,480
Should I do a countdown?    - Ok

341
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,350
You ignored it

342
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,240
You're all cornering me

343
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,240
Good, good

344
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Is that good?     - Yeah

345
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,660
Alright

346
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,680
Matsumoto-san, you're next

347
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,070
What?

348
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:03,510
It

349
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,450
It just took you a long time to realize that

350
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,850
It just took you a long time to realize that

351
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,310
Its' just that...

352
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,550
You were just going 3, 2, 1 to us

353
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,830
It's just that none of you

354
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,830
Reacted to my countdown at all, so I wonder why

355
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,120
It backfired just at me

356
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,120
Ok

357
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,120
Alright, good, good

358
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,260
Ok, ok, ok

359
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,440
It's about time for a drop-out

360
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,530
Yes, it will slowly get more severe

361
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,000
So someone will surely lose soon

362
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,160
I see...       - Yes

363
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,080
Ah!! A side is touching there

364
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,250
How many times are ya doin' this?

365
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,350
You're the only one who did this

366
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,350
countless times

367
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,220
Shut the hell up!!

368
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,910
What the hell, man

369
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,850
This piece is long

370
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,430
Tanaka, shouldn't we use a penalty system?

371
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,730
You've made the sides touch again !!

372
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,370
Can you do this more seriously?!

373
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,270
Alright, alright

374
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,270
Hurry the hell up!!

375
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,750
Say what you like but I'm always hurryin' up

376
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,750
I have this big one

377
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,090
You just wanted to say that, don't you?

378
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,160
I've found a pretty good spot

379
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,180
He's right, that's ok, alright

380
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,590
What are you doin'?

381
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,530
You said it's not ok to touch sides, so...

382
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,530
Don't check their length

383
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,790
The situation quickly worsened

384
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,870
Alright Endo-san, that was good

385
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,540
Can I snap one of them in half?

386
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,540
You can't

387
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,630
You can't

388
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,510
That's obvious

389
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,880
You just want to tear them all to pieces

390
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,940
Oh!     - Ok, ok

391
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,700
I see

392
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,150
Am I the one who's screwed after all?

393
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,780
Well...     - Seems so

394
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,650
YAMAZAKI!!

395
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,290
YAMAZAKI!!

396
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,430
YOU DID IT, YOU FUCKER!!

397
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,130
He's right

398
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,470
This is pretty bad for him

399
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,860
I think he's done for      - Yeah pretty much

400
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,060
Probably      - This is...

401
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,940
I wonder if I can overcome this

402
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,800
Right, right, right

403
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,600
After that, Housei

404
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,650
Endo

405
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,600
And Hamada place their pieces easily

406
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,040
And it's Matsumoto's turn again

407
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:28,940
Alright

408
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,350
Up to you, Matsumoto-san

409
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:30,990
Man

410
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,030
The situation got pretty harsh for me

411
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,950
Do I have fitting pieces for that?

412
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,570
Am I done for!?

413
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,160
I think it's impossible

414
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,180
Get the hell away from me!!

415
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,210
There must be a spot!

416
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah but... not much left

417
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,800
Oh! This one!

418
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:56,910
He found one!

419
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,800
Alright!

420
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,070
He did pretty good!

421
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,710
His range got really wide

422
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,720
He did a great move

423
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,950
He made his comeback

424
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,380
This felt so good

425
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,710
An unexpected turn

426
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,690
You can't place that over there

427
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,920
You really want to stand in my way, don't you?

428
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,690
Can he do that? I'm not sure

429
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,170
This is 100% illegal

430
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,240
And on top of that you are a friggin' unpleasant presence!!

431
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,070
They were completely attached        - What the hell was that?

432
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,080
Endo's situation is going to...

433
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,800
At this point

434
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Things don't look good for Endo

435
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,180
I think I've just run out of free space

436
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:30,970
Probably

437
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,950
Of course this was impossible for Endo

438
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,390
'Cause baseball

439
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,390
Is the only thing he ever did in his entire life

440
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,290
Looks like

441
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,830
Endo-san has

442
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,310
I'm done for, right?

443
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,830
no space left

444
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,680
I have no space left

445
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,700
Do you have a 1x1 square piece?

446
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,820
Have you used it already?       - Yeah I used it

447
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,200
If only baseball

448
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,200
Wasn't the only thing he ever did to this day

449
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,100
That's what made him waste his 1x1 square

450
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,170
This all happened 'cause I did nothing but baseball

451
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,900
Yup, I can't do anything      - You're out then

452
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,740
ENDO DROPS OUT

453
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,740
Leave your pieces here, we count them later

454
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,740
It's Da-Hama's turn

455
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,950
Now it's battle between 3 players

456
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,080
I think Da-Hama-san too ran out of space

457
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,580
I think Da-Hama-san too ran out of space

458
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,580
Yes, the situation got really strict by now

459
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,890
(staff)

460
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,890
If he hasn't any 1 or 2 square pieces left, he's...

461
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,690
Well, he doesn't have any of those, so...

462
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:17,030
Nothing left for me to do but snap them in half

463
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,550
Giving that you can't do that, it means you're out

464
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,500
HAMADA DROPS OUT

465
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,200
Alright

466
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,060
So now

467
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,200
Now it's a 1 vs 1

468
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,770
Matsumoto vs Housei: the unexpected conclusion!?

469
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,440
So, it's a 1 vs 1 now

470
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:30,970
Oh but

471
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,780
I still have the 1x1 square piece left

472
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,030
He's right      - Incredible!       - I see

473
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,370
It could come in handy

474
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,180
Yeah but he has to widen his range

475
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,020
I think this is the only place left...

476
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,780
There's nowhere but here, right?

477
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,110
Tanaka-san?

478
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,540
This...        - Matsumoto-san...

479
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:47,820
What the-

480
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,960
That isn't attached to anything

481
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,890
If that was ok, it would have changed the whole course

482
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,360
If that was ok, it would have changed the whole course

483
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,360
Anywhere would be ok

484
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,500
I see, there...

485
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,000
That is so satisfying to watch!

486
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,130
It felt so good

487
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,590
Yeah, it did

488
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:14,080
Matsumoto vs Housei - they both only have 5 pieces left...

489
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
After that

490
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,370
The battle between Matsumoto and Housei continues

491
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,170
And both their pieces are down to five

492
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,700
And now it's Matsumoto's turn!

493
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,940
This one? No, maybe it's wrong..?

494
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,320
I'm going home !!

495
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,060
See you, then

496
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,290
Why is that? Just play this

497
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,300
Come on!!

498
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,070
Why do you want to go home? Hurry up and finish this

499
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,640
Why do you want to go home? Hurry up and finish this

500
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,780
It stinks!!

501
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,310
Come on, he's just messing around

502
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,610
I bet you just felt the urge to say that giving the moment!

503
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,280
I bet you just felt the urge to say that giving the moment!

504
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,410
Come on, man

505
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,070
Found it

506
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,480
Woah, Matsumoto!

507
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,910
And now...

508
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,660
The situation has become sort of numb by now

509
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,530
It's the legendary duel

510
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,750
That's true

511
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,890
Alright, alright, alright

512
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,910
I should have make it reach that other side there...

513
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,950
I had no idea at first that it would turn out like this

514
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,680
Whatever I do isn't ok

515
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,910
This is not good

516
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,340
This too won't do

517
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,810
And even this move

518
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:32,660
Does it mean

519
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,990
Is this a stalemate!?

520
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,780
I think you just have to use the 1x1 square

521
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,480
Yeah I think you don't have anything left

522
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,430
I'll use it and hope for a chance of winning

523
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:38,820
Right

524
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,520
You just have that corner left

525
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,290
Where?

526
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,160
Like here, this part

527
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
You mean here?

528
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
I think that's the only thing to do

529
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,010
He did it!

530
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,450
Can you still go on?

531
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,850
I'm probably done for

532
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,620
You're probably done for

533
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,620
I think I am

534
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,210
You can't with those pieces

535
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,320
I think it's impossible for Housei-san too

536
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,790
We gotta measure them

537
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,790
Yes, we have to     - Wait a moment...

538
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,000
This two are the same

539
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,650
Same goes for these two

540
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,900
It's on these two

541
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,800
1, 2, 3, 4, 5... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

542
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,370
They scored the same

543
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,370
Same points...

544
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,870
You fought that much just for a draw

545
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,430
So, is it a draw in the end?

546
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,840
It's a draw in the end

547
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,340
No winner in the end?

548
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,000
Maaaan, just look how it turned out...

549
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:32,680
An hard fight playing a game from Korea!?

550
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,500
This game was really fun to play

551
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,640
Yes, it's a brainy one

552
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:39,720
Let's strike down the tree bark and make it fall!

553
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:39,720
Korea -  Click Clack Lumberjack

554
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,340
The next game Tanaka chose

555
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,010
Is "Click Clack Lumberjack", from Korea!

556
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:49,730
In order, each player hits the tree with the axe 2 times

557
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:49,730
Korea -  Click Clack Lumberjack

558
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:49,730
The player who collects more fallen bark, wins!

559
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,080
Rules are simple

560
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,480
In order, each player hits the tree 2 times with the axe

561
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,620
The player who makes more bark fall down, wins!

562
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,970
Let's start from Endo-san

563
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,410
From me?     - Yes

564
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,260
Ok, here I go

565
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,010
Nothing fell down from it

566
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,980
This is harder than you'd expect

567
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,550
So friggin' violent...

568
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,410
So crude...

569
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,550
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

570
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,880
Even if we're playing, it's not funny at all with this guy

571
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,050
Even if we're playing, it's not funny at all with this guy

572
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,050
I'm sorry, I'll fix this

573
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,890
At least scream an "AAAAAAAH!"

574
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,830
That was harsh      - I'm still learning this!

575
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,860
Such a rough character

576
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,060
That' not it, that's not it

577
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,760
It's just hard to set the power      - Right

578
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,270
Let's continue from me then, this guy is no good after all

579
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,270
Going back to square one, they'll start again from Matsumoto

580
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,660
Here I go

581
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,900
AAAAAAAH!

582
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,670
Come on, Downtown-san...

583
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,960
So strong!

584
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,280
Ok, real talk now

585
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,080
I had no idea how hard I should have hit it!

586
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,080
I know, right?

587
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,920
You don't know at first

588
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,020
I didn't know how it felt, I'm sorry!

589
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,240
You wouldn't think of it as being that light

590
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,620
Really?

591
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,790
This bitch is way more unreliable than I thought

592
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,990
This bitch is way more unreliable than I thought

593
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,990
It's weak

594
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,490
It's better to go soft on it

595
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,390
They'll start again from Housei

596
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,290
I'm going

597
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:52,820
Ok

598
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,450
Yeah, that's how you do it

599
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,260
That's 'cause we aimed to get a point at the very start

600
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,260
Yeah, that's right

601
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,560
Something like this

602
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,600
I guess that's it

603
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,210
It's pretty hard to get points in this

604
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,740
They're not fallin'

605
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,850
He's so gentle now

606
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,320
That was without a doubt way too weak for a hit!

607
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,820
Who are you, an old shoemaker?

608
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,110
Geez, this

609
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,650
This is pretty hard

610
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,780
Yeah it's hard

611
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:30,780
Oh, I see

612
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,640
Awww, but it's possible

613
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Yeah

614
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,940
I think it's here

615
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,560
What is there? You can do it?

616
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,030
See?

617
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,030
Alright, one point

618
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,540
I guess we'll make some points from now

619
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,400
I see, I see      - 'Cause it's crumbling

620
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,580
3rd round

621
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,590
Look at this one!

622
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,360
It came out with a click

623
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,360
(staff)

624
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,360
Doesn't count if it doesn't fall

625
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,430
This could be a chance

626
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,280
You're right, it's easy to take off this piece

627
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,000
Why is it a chance ?

628
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,000
'Cause this...

629
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,730
Maybe it's better not to say it

630
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,600
Right, don't say it

631
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,560
Are you kidding?

632
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,370
He chickened out

633
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,370
You can do that?

634
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:16,960
Look!

635
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,640
Does that one count?

636
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,900
(staff) Yes, it counts

637
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,900
You should have told me that

638
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,200
He took two

639
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,260
I see

640
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,250
Why are you telling me this only now?

641
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,840
I didn't know side hits were ok too

642
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,550
Yeah, right?

643
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,180
He's good!

644
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,420
Yamazaki is scoring a point after another

645
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,020
I bet you already have this game at home!

646
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,360
I bet you already have this game at home!

647
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,320
Yeah I mean, it's strange

648
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,230
You can't be this good at it!

649
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,960
That's the first time I saw it!

650
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,150
Are you sure?

651
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,370
I don't have one myself!

652
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,320
He's secretly trained

653
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:51,240
Tanaka & Endo too failed their round

654
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,750
Following Housei

655
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,370
Tanaka and Endo try to score points too

656
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,600
But they're not able to make any bark fall

657
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,270
So...

658
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,140
If I use my axe

659
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,140
and swipe

660
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,140
it this like this am breaking rules?

661
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,140
No, you can do it

662
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,000
I can?     - Yes

663
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,550
Only the bark

664
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,680
As long as you hit it

665
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,420
So good!

666
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,950
He's suddenly so good at it !!

667
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,590
I bet you have this game at home!!

668
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,160
But Hamada

669
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,130
Wouldn't it be better to end this round with one hit?

670
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,160
Nice idea       - You can if you want to

671
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,160
In the end the most unnecessary thing has been said by me

672
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,900
In the end the most unnecessary thing has been said by me

673
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,530
That was sweet of you

674
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,530
You can strike 1 or 2 times?

675
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,330
I'm gonna be screwed

676
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,330
On this next round

677
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,330
No doubts on that

678
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,860
This isn't easy

679
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,160
Why don't you try to place it back upright?

680
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,110
He's right

681
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,110
I have to study this

682
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,940
I can hit it as if I'm scraping it off, right?

683
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,530
Oh, you' wanna take that down?

684
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm sorry

685
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,640
Was that even something?

686
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,640
It's this way! I got this

687
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,790
It kinda went back

688
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,430
The top got risky

689
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,780
He's right, watch out Housei

690
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,020
Right, one strike

691
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,690
I think if it goes well now there's no way we can reach his points

692
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,690
Push it back

693
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,390
Right

694
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,120
That was risky!

695
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,980
He's a prodigy

696
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,950
There's no doubt he got this game at home !!

697
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,240
You have it, don't you?

698
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,630
That's so strange

699
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,740
That's amazing!

700
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,640
So strange

701
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,320
I'll try to place it back

702
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,490
Nice one

703
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,390
Maybe placing it back won't get you points

704
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,390
It makes you bring out your character

705
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,150
I see

706
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,520
It brings out your character

707
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,630
Man

708
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,030
Tanaka sure likes to return it to its uprightness

709
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,260
"Its uprightness"

710
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,270
I guess I like to do that

711
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,040
But I guess you managed to get 1 point after all

712
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,970
Endo isn't

713
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,970
thinking of anything anymore

714
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,980
'Cause he's really an

715
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,980
, that's why

716
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,980
idiot

717
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,100
See?

718
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,680
That was no good at all

719
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000

00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,800
Are we done?

721
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,200
Are we?

722
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,870
You cleared it by smashing it

www.shionnotsukai.wordpress.com

724
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,280
You're really the worst!

725
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,110
The worst!

726
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,650
The one on top is so light!

728
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,580
Of course it is!

729

It's like smacking down the Daruma first in Daruma-Otoshi

730
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,330
The game wouldn't be fun at all!

Of course it's light, it's on top of them!

733
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,220
But I wanted it to make this fall--

734
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,990
We all did our best not to do that!

735
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,460
I'm sorry... I'm sorry
