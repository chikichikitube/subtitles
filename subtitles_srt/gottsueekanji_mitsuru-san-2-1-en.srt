00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,020
We are...

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,590
basically...

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,790
ugly!

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,720
Why can't our arms follow the rhythm?

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,550
Maybe we should quit
-Stupid!

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,420
We're a dancing super idol group...

00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,720
Hamigakitai!

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,920
What should we do
-Yea

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,370
Tatsuya!

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,340
What are you doing, just drinking?

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,070
Come and dance with us!

14
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,000
No!

15
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,900
I didn't want to join you guys from the beginning!

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,120
What?
-I want to be solo!

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,150
If I practice with you guys...

18
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,090
I'll never be popular! What's with that "We're idols" talk!

19
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,850
What?  Don't make fun of us, idiols!

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,050
Girls dream about us!

21
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,050
What the hell are you saying?!

22
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,750
Stopt it!

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,150
You're no idol!

24
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,820
Stop it, you're killing him!

25
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,600
I told you I don't want join you!

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,800
Stop!

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,900
I told you to stop!

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,840
T..Tatsuya...

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,940
Are you ok?

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,770
Tatsuya! Tatsuya!

31
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,770
Are you ok?!

32
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,050
He's dead!

33
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,020
What shall we do?

34
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,020
It's true!
-What can we do?!

35
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,820
He's dead

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,240
Mitsuru-san!

37
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,900
What did you do?!

38
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,970
Actually...

39
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,600
I...

40
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,690
I hit Tatsuya on the head with this ashtray and killed him...

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,720
You shouldn't be doing these stupid things!

42
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,350
I'm sorry!

43
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,620
I'm sorry!

44
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,220
I'm sorry, but Tatsuya...

45
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,920
Go and close the window

46
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,740
Check and see if anyone is around

47
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,500
It's clear!

48
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,750
Tatsuya! He's dancing!

49
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:40,800
Idiot!
