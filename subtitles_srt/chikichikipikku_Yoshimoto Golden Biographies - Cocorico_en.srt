5
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,110
Okay, let`s begin with this episode of Golden Biographies.

6
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,210
Today we will take a look at a duo.

7
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:16,610
Today’s guests are a very popular comedy duo.

8
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,260
Hosei, you have known them for some time, right?

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,030
Know them? I would say I spend time with them at least once a week for the past twenty years.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,990
I probably won't learn anything new about them today.

11
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:34,670
Yes well, we have these two on standby, let's take a look.
This could be interesting.

12
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,470
It really smells like flowers. Right?

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,160
Right?

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,120
What?

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,230
It smells of flowers.

16
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,230
It smells of flowers?

17
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,380
It's really strong.

18
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,020
You see how they are talking now? That makes me really happy.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,970
They didn't talk like that before?

20
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,970
They didn't.

21
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:03,990
I don't really have the image of them being so popular but let’s go and take a look.

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Maybe my nose is stuffy?

23
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,410
It's so strong that even if you have a stuffy nose you should be able to smell this.

24
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,480
Then I have no idea.

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,830
Really? That’s strange.

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,590
Yeah, I really can’t smell the flowers.

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,590
Alright, they are waiting so let`s get in there.

28
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,050
Today`s guests are these two known as Kokoriko.

29
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,570
E/T-Thank you for having us.

30
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,770
This is a first for me.

31
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,460
Is it?

32
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,770
Yes, a first time for me.

33
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:40,530
This show looks at the lives of celebrities and discusses with them their accomplishments and struggles they deal with: "Golden Biographies."

34
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,480
He told me that I could do it all by myself, so he decided to leave.

35
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,720
It was so difficult.

36
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,610
That is a good time to write your will.

37
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:02,550
He said he was quitting, so I asked if there was any room to work with Takeshi's group.

38
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,790
Today we look at Kokoriko and the course of their career.

39
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:16,000
These two began working together in their 20`s with a history even before that.

40
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,780
I think I wasn’t taking it too seriously.

41
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:26,840
The biggest crisis in the history of their famous comedy duo.

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,900
He said "what were you doing" and grabbed me by the shirt and we started punching each other.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,300
…And the medias publications of Endo`s divorce.

44
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,990
Well this was one reason for the divorce, but I never really said that.

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,100
And they will discuss even bigger never before mentioned secrets from other people in their lives.

46
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,750
They really were there to help me,

47
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,650
they asked me "what do you really want to do with your life?"

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,200
Additionally we will hear from members of the show that worked with them.

49
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:12,850
He would focus on one thing and that was all he would concern himself with.

50
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,730
He would say well today is the day for me to have the kid,

51
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,680
and we would talk about things like that.

52
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,680
Today we will speak uncensored with Kokoriko.

53
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,250
Okay Let’s get started by introducing our guests Kokoriko. Thank you for being here.

54
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,250
E/T-Thank you for having us.

55
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,470
So Hosei you said you see them almost every week?

56
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,470
Yes, I have seen them almost every week for the last 20 years or so.

57
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,560
Yes, that’s right

58
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,760
So, you must know a lot about them.

59
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,160
Well they feel like a part of my family.

60
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,940
E/T-Thank you.

61
00:03:51,720 --> 00:04:03,990
Their partnership has continued for over 23 years. Let’s take a look how that has gone on this graph which shows happy and unhappy.

62
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,120
So for happy or unhappy from 21 to 26 the graph is as follows.

63
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,730
This is interesting because we actually asked for their answers separately but they both show the exact same pattern. It is astonishing.

64
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,670
Well the two of them were constantly together so they must have had the same feelings.

65
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,530
You could definitely say that we were neighbors as well.

66
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,000
So you two were classmates, right?

67
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,870
E/T: Yes we were.

68
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,390
From the early days of elementary school...

69
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:34,980
They were both from Osaka and have been best friends since elementary school.

70
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:43,890
When they were 20, Endo suggested to Tanaka that they try their luck in performing.

71
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,770
They moved to Tokyo where they auditioned for the Yoshimoto organization and passed. Which is where they broke into the scene.

72
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,370
It was there where they broke into the scene.

73
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:03,180
So we did the audition and then we were just kind of there,

74
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:10,650
but then about half a year later we performed for the V cinema.

75
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,650
*V-cinema is a direct to video industry owned by Toei

76
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,350
Both of you?

77
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,470
Both of us, yes

78
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,910
That's amazing.

79
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:20,100
Well at that time it was honestly so easy for us.

80
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,100
That's right but at 22?

81
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Yes, this performance just a few months after their debut they made it big with this performance that we have prepared, please look.

82
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,660
You know what I’m going home.

83
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,190
What are you talking about? You are just going to leave me to do this alone?

84
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,190
How can you say that when you have no experience?

85
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,830
Did you say something?

86
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:54,700
These roles lead them to more opportunities to act

87
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:00,000
and it was at this time that Tanaka said he realized his dream to be an actor.

88
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,220
I was actually just along for the ride since he asked me to go with him.

89
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:13,750
I didn't think I was a good comedian or anything,

90
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:21,420
but I went to Tokyo was acted in a few films and performed in front of a live audience.

91
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:30,140
While I think I really only got them to laugh 20 percent of the time the feeling it gave me was so joyous.

92
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,000
Their reaction?

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:43,400
Yes, the way they reacted to my writing, to make them laugh that feeling made me so happy.

94
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
So you wanted to ride that wave?

95
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
I wanted to ride that wave yes.

96
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,200
So that was how you got into comedy but what about Endo? Did you ever write anything?

97
00:06:52,200 --> 00:07:02,500
Yes, I did but when I would show it to Tanaka he would say that it was wrong

98
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:17,080
from there all I really did was work on the logo for Kokoriko or things like that or names of the shows and things like that.

99
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah that sounds like something you might do I think you would be good at that.

100
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,030
So, at this point I would like to show a bit you two did, this is important so let’s take a look.

101
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,500
Here we take a look at a piece done by the young duo.

102
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,450
Here is our performance: The Mosquito

103
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,420
You're amazing!

104
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,350
Oh its nothing.

105
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,540
No you're amazing!

106
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,820
I said its nothing.

107
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,330
You are so cool!

108
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,330
No it was nothing.

109
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,060
Wow it's huge!

110
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,770
That`s embarrassing.

111
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,690
No that`s a great piece, isn't it stylish?

112
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,490
"Stylish"?

113
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,960
Yes, very stylish.

114
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
This is stylish?

115
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,810
You must have been happy to get those laughs.

116
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,810
Yes

117
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:45,000
The first year for these two was a great start however the graph shows a sharp drop over the next years, why is that?

118
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,970
So in only half a year we hit it off well, right? So, we thought it would just keep up like this.

119
00:08:52,970 --> 00:09:02,140
We thought we could just play like this in the world of television, but it proved to be much hard that this.

120
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,210
In these years we really did not have any work.

121
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,210
Here we had some juniors, we were in Ginza when that performance stage was made

122
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:23,550
and the pair London Boots number 1 and 2 and the duo Penalty also appeared at this time.

123
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:33,290
This was the first time we had the feeling of groups following us and the inertia of it, especially with London Boots(LB)

124
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:46,770
J-Yes LB was quite the spectacle, they were something coming in after you two. We actually have a piece from them that we would like to watch.

125
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,620
Hello this is London Boots number 1 and 2.

126
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:59,020
This group which began two years after Kokoriko is the group London Boots one and two

127
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:06,060
they came in to the scene out of nowhere and were known for having a very close relationship in private as well.

128
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,630
We asked them what their impression of Kokoriko was at the time.

129
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:18,000
So when Tanaka asked me directly to come have a drink with them it was actually three years into our career.

130
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,590
I think it takes some time for Tanaka to warm up to people,

131
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,480
and I was unsure if he was holding back when we were spending time together.

132
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,000
After we started going out and drinking together I feel like we got a lot closer.

133
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:38,310
Tanaka was a really fan of eating bread.

134
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,310
Yes, he loved his bread.

135
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:45,450
When I went to his house one time I remember he must have had 2 or 3 toasters.

136
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,940
I felt that one toaster is more than enough right?

137
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,510
It looked like as if he were living in a house where knock off products were made.

138
00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:01,010
I feel that when he gets fixated on one thing he tends toget stuck on it.

139
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:08,490
I remembered thinking "I hope he isn't doing anything illegal" and he seems to be doing fine.

140
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,200
And what do they have to say about Endo?

141
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:25,580
For me, probably, he may be  the one person I respect most in this world.

142
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:38,330
I mean of course he is comedic and interesting which is why he can still operate in this field world. but in private as we were eating

143
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:43,970
he really was there to help me, he asked me what I really wanted to do with my life.

144
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:55,730
I told him that I wanted to work as hard as I could while the work was available and try to stay in the acting world as long as possible

145
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:01,410
but Endo said to me that he wanted to make "Endo`s perversion school"

146
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:12,690
I was laughing as I listened but he said he was serious and that he truly wanted to make this school.

147
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:21,680
So, I asked him why and he said that he felt that Japanese peoples displays of affection needed to be more intense

148
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:29,680
and that it would benefit the world and he kept talking about it and I remembered thinking I will never meet another person like him in my life,

149
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,780
and thought it was just incredible.

150
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
There you have it.

151
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,540
One moment,

152
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,540
did they make any other comments than that?

153
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,900
That was basically the main point in the comments that were made: Endo's perversion school.

154
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,030
I mean it was a long relationship with countless conversations I am curious as to why he only thinks about that one.

155
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:58,940
Well, he did say you are the person he most respect even with your perversion school.

156
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:18,400
3 years after their debut, they still had no regular spots on tv while their fame was growing Kokoriko's happiness sank with it hitting bottom at age 24.

157
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,200
What were things like between the two at this time?

158
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:34,910
So we started at 21 and had decided that after three years if we could not become regulars on any kind of show we need to quit

159
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:42,870
and it was right about that time that our limit was coming up

160
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:52,330
and that was probably the worst time in our relationship as a duo and in private as we would blame the lack of work on each other.

161
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:58,470
And I am sure that first break you got made this time that much harder to cope with.

162
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,020
I’m sure that did not help.

163
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,800
That may have been the only huge fight in Kokoriko to ever take place.

164
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:13,480
Here these two nearly broke up the duo in this terrible fight.

165
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,370
He said what do you think you are doing?

166
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,370
And we started hitting each other.

167
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:29,230
3 years after their debut as Kokoriko but as they had no steady work they started to have issues and ignited a fight that nearly broke up the duo.

168
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:35,240
So this is really the only big fight that ever took place in Kokoriko up to this point.

169
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,240
This was some fight huh?

170
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,110
We were grabbing each other’s shirts and then we started punching each other.

171
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,220
Each other?

172
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,410
Yes.

173
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
This was after a performance?

174
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,420
Yes, we finished a performance and during our conversation of we should do this bit or that bit

175
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:57,060
and I had usually decided what we were going to do but was having trouble making a decision that day, so I was telling him to give me a moment.

176
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,060
That is a big decision though.

177
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:04,840
So eventually what happened was right before we were supposed to go on stage, I made the decision and we went right on stage

178
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:11,340
to do the bit, we had no rehearsal or chance to work on it

179
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:18,280
and I messed up the sequence and it went off the rails and we basically just left the stage like that

180
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,620
and that was when he started by saying "why couldn't you make a faster decision?"

181
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,260
I tried saying that I was having trouble making up my mind but we were having trouble communicating

182
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:35,800
so a lot of bad things came out and it was soon before the time limit we had given ourselves

183
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,980
so Endo said we might as well end this, and I said "what are you talking about?"

184
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:50,630
There we exploded and had a go at each other and really started punching,

185
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,220
but that was really the worst fight that we ever had.

186
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,220
The most serious fight you ever had?

187
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,570
Yes it was.

188
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,570
Yes it was.

189
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:01,830
The duo had no work and a terrible relationship and were on the brink of breaking up,

190
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,310
but they were able to get out of their situation with this…

191
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,180
But here it looks like is where you started to rise back up. Why is that?

192
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:30,320
When we agreed to quit if we did not become regulars on anything, in Shizuoka there was a program Shizuoka Kanekuro.

193
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,320
What in the world is that show?

194
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:42,440
Well it was a live Friday night show in Shizuoka that was live on Friday at five

195
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,310
which is where they got the name and that is where we started to make regular appearances.

196
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,450
And that was the gig that started to get you both out of this slump?

197
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:59,550
Yes, and this was what lead us into Gaki no tsukai so yeah this helped us to get out of that funk.

198
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,550
You were called to Gaki no tsukai and Iitomo from this?

199
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,860
That's right we were.

200
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,860
That's amazing.

201
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,960
Yes it was incredible to see the momentum they picked up from that show.

202
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,630
From really having no work to getting to that level.

203
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,630
I told you that that "your duo is great" you know

204
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:19,300
"and that if they were able to get out in front of the entire country they would surely pull through"

205
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:24,110
but I wasn't sure they could do it.

206
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:30,570
But in spring of the next year they had become regulars

207
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,060
but then I didn't think it was good

208
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:42,500
I was so upset about it I had an aneurism.

209
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:55,710
They appeared in the shows "Warateiitomo", "Gaki no tsukai" and even more shows as their popularity grew and became regulars on 10 different shows

210
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:01,990
and it shows as their happiness chart shows a spike during this period let’s see what happens from there.

211
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,760
Okay so from 26-35 let’s see what happens, so here we see a split in this period.

212
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,930
So, first Endo you plateau here.

213
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:24,680
Yes well everything continued going as it was with Iitomo and Gaki no tsukai so then I was looking to land our own show which was the dream of dreams

214
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,410
and that is when our Kokoriko show "Ougon Densetsu" started

215
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:38,700
As an actor to have your show is really just the dream.

216
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,700
Your name is even in the show title.

217
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:48,270
So yeah with the name Kokoriko's "blah blah blah" it’s just a dream.

218
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:55,140
I mean you look at the paper and to have your name there and we did that in our 20s.

219
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:03,720
That is incredible. then to talk about your show we have some people that worked with you,let’s take a look.

220
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,840
Yukiesan!

221
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,710
Thank you for having me. I’m Yukie Sakaki

222
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:16,800
Meet Yukie Sakaki, an actress of 15 years and coworker on the Kokoriko show.

223
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,400
We asked for her impression of these two when she first started working with them.

224
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:32,410
At first you know they told me that although they were on during golden time this was their first time and asked for me to help in any way I could

225
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:37,050
but there was no time for that at the
beginning but I said "just leave don't worry about it"

226
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:43,660
but there was no time for that at the
beginning but I said "just leave don't worry about it"

227
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,660
and that if it was something that Kokoriko was doing that it would be fine

228
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,550
and things like that to help them relax and they really did well,

229
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:55,850
good for them. They really grew.

230
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,680
So now let’s hear her impression on their personalities.

231
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,590
Well they are like younger brothers to me.

232
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,490
Tanaka was living close to where I was,

233
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:19,760
and his wife was such a lovely woman and their child was so cute and lively.

234
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:25,230
Tanaka was probably the quietest one of the group especially when you got their family together.

235
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,240
So, when I would see him in the city shopping you know in passing

236
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:37,450
it was like he was focused on something in the road.

237
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:45,060
Then for Endo even when we were doing the show

238
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:54,130
whenever a girl he liked would appear he would always say something about her,

239
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,650
and he was very easy to read

240
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,650
I'm sure he likes a strong woman.

241
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,090
That was what she had to say.

242
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,890
Thank you very much.

243
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,890
Thank you very much.

244
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:14,520
So you are running your own show. So yes, that would keep you pretty happy right?

245
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,520
Yes nothing but appreciation for what I had.

246
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,920
On the other hand Tanaka went back down, why is that?

247
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:24,300
Well yes, I mean of course I was happy to have the show

248
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:33,800
but the jump from one show to ten had me question myself like am I going to be okay.

249
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,030
So you were experiencing some anxiety.

250
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,860
You could say that

251
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:50,320
but even from our debut I always felt like without really developing my skills I was just getting older

252
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,640
and getting more work and I had the privilege of performing everyday

253
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,420
but felt like I lacked the right tools for the job

254
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:08,210
like I was not properly matched for the amount of work I had which is what caused that.

255
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:14,300
So the anxiety birthed of all this worked that suddenly came is what this drop is.

256
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,300
Yes that’s right.

257
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,260
At this time the Tanaka felt the duo was so busy they were having trouble communicating with each other

258
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:33,400
and wasn't sure if they had the right tools for the job, but what did Endo think at this time?

259
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:38,010
Endo, what did you think at this time? did you know about the doubts Tanaka was having?

260
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:43,780
We really didn't even have time to stop and think about how we were feeling as we weren't really communicating at this time.

261
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,790
So even though you did not have much time together your work kept coming in and increasing.

262
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:52,040
This maybe the wrong way to say this

263
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,000
but I really think that I wasn’t taking it too seriously when I think back on it now.

264
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,730
Just you?

265
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,730
I mean for our duo.

266
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,180
That Kokoriko was in no trouble with keeping the show?

267
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:08,070
I mean I knew that this show was not the end of our career, that this is good for where we are

268
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:15,880
and there will still be more as long as nothing crazy happens this will continue which was really was my mindset was at the time.

269
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,180
If it wasn't, I feel that I would have probably noticed the trouble Tanaka was having.
Yes to see this separation of happiness within the group and not notice.

270
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,390
Hosei, did you notice the bad terms Kokorico was having?

271
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:26,870
Yes it was so hard for me to be around you two at that time.

272
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,460
The bad part in our relationship.

273
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,090
The bad part in our relationship.

274
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,840
The bad part in your relationship you say?

275
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:36,100
I would come to the stage and Tanaka would sit in front and you would sit over to the side

276
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,720
and I had no issues with either of you so it wasn't a problem for me

277
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,470
but during taping you two had no back and forth so we really had no group conversation

278
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:50,550
I had to either speaking one on one with Tanaka or one on one with, you and I seriously feel it was that way for about 8 years.

279
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,070
Sorry about that

280
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,070
Sorry about that

281
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
At 26 years of age they became very rich and popular,

282
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:13,470
but it was divided as Endo was having a good time of it and Tanaka was experiencing a much different feeling.

283
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:21,880
But at 29 tanks graph shows a spike in happiness let’s find out why that is.

284
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:29,340
But here Tanaka you rise back up here, please let us know what happened here that caused this.

285
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:38,130
This is where the Kokoriko miracle type show began which was a golden time show we got

286
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:44,140
and as we did the show we made our own sketches, it was just too fun.

287
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,140
That is where we really started.

288
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,380
Your show in golden time and that made you both happy.

289
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:58,220
That really made me happy. I mean I still had my worries, but the joy was overpowering

290
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,900
You also appeared in movies?

291
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:05,530
Yes at this time I made appearances in movies

292
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:13,600
and that also made me so happy the ability to act was something so fun for me

293
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,200
and I relearned my enjoyment of acting.

294
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:24,150
The movie Tanaka is referring to is the movie "Minna no ie."

295
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,730
Well that’s what a job is right?

296
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:36,030
Your ambition enlightened me but if you are saying this now I may have some things to rethink.

297
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:41,000
Please make up your mind this week. If you can’t I will find someone else.

298
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,440
Here we see Tanaka in another feature film by Karasawa Koshiaki

299
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:58,050
where he was received an academy award in the new actor category which put him center stage for future projects,

300
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:04,870
but why did Tanaka who was a comedian decide to start acting in movies?

301
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:10,560
So here what happened was when he was in Gaki no tsukai

302
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,520
Tanaka was taken aback by the way Hamada would lose it during pranks.

303
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,520
I mean he would just lose it out of nowhere.

304
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:29,920
He would you know be holding a badminton racket and start hitting Tanaka with it or just punch him.

305
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:38,790
When that happened Tanaka started to tear up and cry.

306
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,790
That's true

307
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,590
And this director noticed him and thought that is the man he wanted for his movie.

308
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:46,460
So, you acting career was thanks to Hamada attacking you?

309
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,550
Very much so.

310
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,300
He wasn't pretending to attack you he really was going at you?

311
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:53,200
Yes, he really was, and I was really crying.

312
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,810
But maybe he was watching you thinking this guy can really act.

313
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,180
No he said I was very pure.

314
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,650
Next we will take a look at Endo who also peaked up here in happiness along with Tanaka

315
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:11,420
where at 31 he met another talented person Chiaki and they wed.

316
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:18,530
Tanaka also got married the following year to an actress he had worked with named Koji Tashie.

317
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:23,370
They both were very happy during this period.

318
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:27,970
So at 31 Endo got married and Tanaka married at 32,

319
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,350
in addition work is going wonderfully and you were also helping out Hosei as well.

320
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,260
He really must have appreciated that right Hosei?

321
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:40,650
Yes, I was very happy, but I was wondering about myself.

322
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,040
I mean they were both married

323
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
but I wasn't invited to either of their weddings...

324
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,840
No that wasn't it at all.

325
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,840
No that wasn't it at all.

326
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:53,080
Didn’t I say we were like family

327
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,350
and felt like what kind of people don't invite their family to their wedding!?

328
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:04,460
I’m surprised to hear this, very surprised. What happened there?

329
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,220
I never had a wedding party.

330
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:19,260
So, there was no party but there was, in my immediate family,

331
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:25,870
I know Hosei is saying we are family, so it’s tough to say this

332
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:33,590
but we took some pictures, but it was just a few people

333
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:42,670
and I know he said we are family but…well

334
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,670
I'm sorry.

335
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,920
You had classmates and such there, right?

336
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,400
I saw these pictures.

337
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,960
Who was in there? What relation did they have?

338
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,080
Well there was Yamamoto...

339
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
Yamamoto and Takeshi were the only ones, right? From that group.

340
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,470
No there were more your junior classmates and others,

341
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:06,710
you don't know do you? I looked at them and had an aneurysm.

342
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,150
You have a lot of aneurysms!

343
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,900
It seems like he remembers this well.

344
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:20,660
Whatever its fine, I mean you have this big gathering but whatever I was busy at that time anyway,

345
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,460
but Tanaka really bothered me.

346
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,410
What happened there?

347
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:33,770
Well for me, I as well had no official wedding party.

348
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,460
We did plan on having celebration, but we were in the middle of so much

349
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,000
we decided to finish the paperwork ahead of time and well

350
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:48,190
we just decided to have a small gathering of close friends…

351
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,160
well yes family,

352
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
and frankly I did not even invite Endo to this event.

353
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,310
Yeah, I didn't go to his gathering.

354
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:08,310
The idea was to have another date where we would hold a large event and that was our plan,

355
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:14,200
but that didn't actually happen…I’m sorry.

356
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,020
I saw your pictures as well.

357
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,020
You look at a lot of pictures.

358
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,020
Well yes, we took pictures there.

359
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Didn’t I see Ryo there?

360
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,890
Ryo…was not there.

361
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,890
He wasn't

362
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,210
No he was there

363
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,580
Someone who looked like him at least,

364
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,010
Maybe your father looked like him.

365
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,490
He was there.

366
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,280
May I say something?

367
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:49,280
when we were not doing well and had no money we would still help Hosei this was what 25 or 26 we started getting on Gaki no tsukai

368
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:58,190
but there was no money and when we would get together we collected a bunch of Nintendo games

369
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:03,600
and Hosei said that if you were to sell these games you could get some money and he told me to go sell them.

370
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:10,640
There were a dozen or so games that I took and sold but it only amounted to 90 yen

371
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:18,820
but he kept saying he was so hungry so I think there was a Korokke that was 60 or 70 yen and we bought it

372
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:25,520
and Hosei said alright lets split this and went to rip it and it came out more like 60/40

373
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
and he handed me the larger piece

374
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:35,000
and looking back on that I feel so bad thinking I did not invite a person that would do that for me.

375
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,880
Right? Right?

376
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,420
I am filled with remorse.

377
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,620
That would cause an aneurysm.

378
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:44,510
Yes, he is and he's wonderful to spend time with.

379
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,950
I was surprised he could only sell them for 90 yen I mean what a poor salesman.

380
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,830
Nintendo game software.

381
00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:02,290
The duo both got married and work was going wonderfully and may be considered the high point in their career.

382
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:09,330
Okay so at this point both private and work lives are going great we would like to hear what this person has to say.

383
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,140
Thank you, this is Yashima.

384
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:21,750
Now we will hear from one of the actors that was in the Kokoriko miracle type show its Yashima Norito

385
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:27,920
lets hear what he had to say about the duo

386
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:40,870
Tanaka is, well coming from me as an actor he is, well, beyond me in terms of acting ability and has a high level of quality as an artist

387
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:57,950
he idea of "I want to do this" is very noticeable so no matter what was going on he was able to focus and become an excellent actor.

388
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,780
Endo, I feel did not really have a passion for acting.

389
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:07,530
so he was good or bad or…

390
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,530
Well he wasn't good.

391
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:13,830
I have no idea what he thinks but I don't think he was interested in the idea of acting by itself.

392
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,240
I think he enjoyed the atmosphere of the stage.

393
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,950
In addition it appears that recently these men have been gathering in their private lives as well.

394
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,450
I think they both like children.

395
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:34,790
Endo gives off the vibe off being like a father

396
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:40,790
and Tanaka who would more play with the kids like "I like this do you like it?"

397
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:46,300
and that would be the difference inthat case, but yeah, they both like kids.

398
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:52,410
I have had Tanaka come visit our home and I have also had Chiaki come visit our home

399
00:33:52,410 --> 00:34:04,990
and Endo after work would say things like "today is the day you are staying with dad" and things like that would go on in our house.

400
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:23,140
So, on those day Endo and I would give a number of kids’ baths and when we would do that you can tell if someone is used to doing these things or not

401
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:31,610
and I could tell Endo knew what he was doing like he played a very active role as a father taking care of the kids.

402
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,530
Getting together as a family.

403
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,750
Yes

404
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,750
Yes

405
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:42,690
So everything is going great you are 35 popular rich.

406
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:46,360
Let’s see what happens from 35-44.

407
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,550
Wow 36 looks like a terrible time why did both of you drop so quickly?

408
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,640
Falling back down! what happened to this duo?

409
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:06,720
I knew I was going to see less and less of my daughter.

410
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:20,770
same as before, and I'm a lazy bum.

411
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,440
So, Tanaka please tell us what happened.

412
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:34,550
Yes this is really when miracle type finished and in addition all these other shows that had us on also all stopped at this point

413
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:40,690
and the end of all these shows is what started the plunge.

414
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,260
You had never experienced something like this.

415
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,260
Exactly

416
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,250
I mean if a show starts it will of course end but this was the first time having your show end.

417
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:54,270
Yes and the shock of that was one thing and our joint effort with the end of our sketches.

418
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:08,090
That is where I met my wife and had all this teamwork and all these programs we still wanted to do and to see that all come to an end was just shocking.

419
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:12,530
I see so this wasn't just the show ending there was a lot more to that.

420
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,460
Yes that’s right.

421
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:20,770
Their show and others all came to an end and sent Tanaka into a mental spiral downward.

422
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,540
What about Endo, why did he fall into despair?

423
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,580
So Endo your graph shows an even further fall.

424
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:31,050
That was the divorce.

425
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,050
Really?

426
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,580
Yes married young and well I think anyone can agree but divorce..

427
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,580
This shows you were married 5 years.

428
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,570
I believe it was 5 and a half years.

429
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:42,570
That really sent you down to the bottom here? only five years in? was it really that bad?

430
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,130
Well looking back on it now...

431
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:53,370
Right I mean now at this point it looks like you two are doing well.

432
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,000
Better than when we lived together.

433
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,510
Well you are filming things together right?

434
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:06,480
It’s much easier when you don't have those problems living together, but at this time I couldn't think about the future or wasn't thinking about it

435
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,720
and the birth of my first daughter was a big thing at that time I mean the wedding was big too

436
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:19,560
but the fact that I was now a father and I was putting 100 percent into raising her

437
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,070
and I knew I was going to see less and less of my daughter and that caused it.

438
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:28,240
So more than the divorce with your wife it was the thought of losing time with your daughter.

439
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,380
Well yeah Chiaki and I discussed many things and could continue to communicate as adults

440
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:38,420
but to discuss this with a child they can’t really process it the same and that really hit me

441
00:37:40,070 --> 00:38:00,240
and then on Christmas day or Christmas eve it was scary that we decided to separate on Christmas eve

442
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,380
and we signed the paperwork that night and the atmosphere in the home was just so bad

443
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:11,380
and I was getting hungry so I figured I would go out to eat and as I was going out to eat

444
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:15,720
I remembered that there was a senior of mine that had helped me out quite a lot during the marriage

445
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:22,160
and well I thought I would call Sanmsan but he was doing a live show...

446
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:32,800
...and does a live show on Christmas eve where he discusses loss and things like that but I had completely forgotten about that

447
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:41,820
but before the show started Sanmasan and I called him and said "Hello this is Endo" and he said "hey what are you up to."

448
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:41,820
This was before the show started?

449
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:51,820
Before it started, and I told him about the divorce and after a pause he said "you pass!"

450
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:58,130
then he asked if I would talk about it on the air. I told him I had no problem about it,

451
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:04,840
but I didn't think it was okay to do that without telling Chiaki about it,

452
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,580
but yeah at that point it was just the worst.

453
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,480
I see now how the graph goes down like this.

454
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,480
Yes so just straight down.

455
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:21,060
Not that this was not the end of your rough patch though, we have another video about an event that happened at that time.

456
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:30,930
Next we will take a look at the events during Endo's divorce.

457
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:39,840
I told Endo this is dangerous, this is not good, but Endo went on to say that he is going to lose all his money.

458
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:52,000
In 2007 Endo and Chiaki divorced and was forced to live separately from his 4-year-old daughter which caused him so much stress,

459
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,180
but even after that Endo faced another problem.

460
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:01,280
I'm still a lazy bum, the epitome of typesetter trash

461
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:09,460
Here we have LB to discuss this other event.

462
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:17,270
So the way he was handling his money was well not good I guess,

463
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:23,310
no matter how much he was earning he would talk about how he would gain money by spending it on investments

464
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:26,810
in like some bizarre dreamland of handling money

465
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:35,750
here we told him "this is dangerous, this is not good" but end went on to say that he is going to lose all his money.

466
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:41,190
I was surprised I saw him in our break room I was so surprised.

467
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:48,900
I knew yelling at him wouldn't work so I simply said to him you're being an idiot.

468
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,900
So what happened?

469
00:40:54,050 --> 00:41:11,590
well the start of the divorce was also in part because of this. I would get money and had this guy who told me about an opportunity

470
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:28,070
where I could double my money in two weeks and Chiaki would say "no you can really make money like this"

471
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:36,480
and said "you have to stop this" and yes at this time I was secretly doing this and then she caught me doing it

472
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,350
and that’s when things started to get worse.

473
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:44,190
So how much money did you spend on these investments in total?

474
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:49,800
Well even if you can't say an exact amount can you give us an idea.

475
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,200
Say it like it were your annual salary, like a baseball player.

476
00:41:56,490 --> 00:42:09,850
The other day my mother brought me a pamphlet and I said "what is it?" and she said "this is such a lovely home"

477
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:26,070
and I said it sure is it was a duplex made of concrete and it was being resold and I think I would have been able to buy it with the amount I spent

478
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:34,540
I wished I could have bought it for her or not and I still think about that to this day.

479
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,790
You are an idiot.

480
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:50,290
Divorce, separating from his daughter, money troubles, Endo was in despair,

481
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:54,730
but here he was saved…

482
00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:07,110
All these things I had kept to myself and was just keeping it all in and then when I got divorced

483
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:12,780
one thing that saved me was well Tanaka,

484
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:21,360
I mean we didn't talk so much but with the divorce and all I had to tell him about it anyway

485
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:35,340
so I told him "you know I am getting divorced" I thought he might get angry with me like "I told you you rushed into it" or something but instead he said

486
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:48,350
"hmm? that’s interesting" like in the world of performers I thought he would be the one to get angry about something like that but instead.

487
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:50,350
Well like what is there to do.

488
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:54,790
I was sure he was going to yell at me.

489
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,790
You must have been happy with his response.

490
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:01,130
So yes speaking with Tanaka at this time really helped me.

491
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:17,650
What saved end was his long time best friend since elementary school Tanaka 23 years together who have gone through everything together and now…

492
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:23,050
their charts are matched here.

493
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:30,560
So here at 41 it looks like you both have leveled out, but this even has a much deeper meaning than in the start.

494
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:36,630
Yes there was so much that happened and yeah to go through it all and end up here.

495
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:41,440
You wouldn't say up here either just right in the middle is interesting.

496
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,740
Do you have anything to add at this point you turned 41 and this happened to return you to 0.

497
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:51,980
you had all these experiences, I mean obviously the zero here is very different from the zero here.

498
00:44:51,980 --> 00:45:04,500
Actually for me the zero here is not so different from this one, well at this point it was like I want to make it big and that was really all I thought about

499
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:15,110
from there many things happened but then returning to 50 I kind of feel the same thing that I want to get big again.

500
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,290
By yourself?

501
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:19,750
No the two of us, I want us to make a big return.

502
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,750
What do you think Tanaka?

503
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:28,390
I agree and feel the same. The 0 at 41 is our 20th anniversary as a duo

504
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:36,660
and looking back on those times and the feeling of getting back out there is something we have been talking about.

505
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,730
At this point to say let’s do it again...

506
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:47,710
Yes Endo said "let’s go for it" and in that sense, I think the feeling of starting again from 0 is the feeling and reason behind us both placing our mark at 0.

507
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:57,690
Going through it all over 23 years, this duo has now decided to once again get out there and returned to the ideas that first got them started.

508
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:03,760
The duo will once again move with the same purpose that held them those 23 years ago.

509
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:10,170
So finally we have prepared a piece for you two looking to the future.

510
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,510
I have a great feeling about these 2 moving forward.

511
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:25,720
When the two of them get together I would love to see them make more sketches the ideas that only the two of them could create together.

512
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:38,830
The atmosphere they create together or even in a group I would love to see what they could add.

513
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:58,410
Recently TV programs have become a little more subdued, and to see the true Kokoriko that crazy duo, to have them both,

514
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:09,190
the perverted Endo and the strange Tanaka come out with something new is something I want to see.

515
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:20,770
Well yes it looks like this is the perfect condition, so what is in the future for Kokoriko?

516
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:27,350
It feels like people are reading a lot into this.

517
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:30,150
I see so it’s hard for you to say anything specific right now?

518
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:38,260
Well you know we still have many things to discuss and while there are those that say we aren't serious

519
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:53,940
yet, there are those that in a good way are not looking at us too hard and I think that will allow us to come out with new material.

520
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,010
Tanaka what do you think about Kokoriko?

521
00:47:56,010 --> 00:48:08,000
Yes, well it is an opportunity to discuss so many possibilities so to have the two of us create something new.

522
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:08,670
We want to see that.

523
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So yes something like that just like the 0 up there where we first started making our sketches,

524
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,660
so we are looking back on that and thinking on that to get going again.

525
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,070
Hosei, any words for your brothers?

526
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:29,140
I would love to see more bits from you guys, I really do.

527
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:37,190
I spoke with Masa some weeks ago and he said that the Kokoriko duo is like a one plus one equals three combination,

528
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:46,330
but if the feeling is more like one plus one is 1.9 you should stop while you are ahead.

529
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:56,770
but the strength of the duo where you would say you two are three is truly remarkable and I feel you can do it again and I really hope you get back at it.

530
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:02,710
Please continue your work Kokoriko thank you for joining us today.

531
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:06,750
All: Thank you very much!
