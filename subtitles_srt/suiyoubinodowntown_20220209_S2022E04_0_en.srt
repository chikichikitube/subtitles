00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,680
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,020
Lets get on with our first presenter please.

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,270
Anyone there?

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,760
It's Viking's Kotouge

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,340
Hello everyone, hello everyone

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,570
No collar person

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,410
The correct term is collarless shirt

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,090
I yearn to teach

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,580
To put it this way, all humans are collarless

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,820
Humans all over the world!
-Get on with it!

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,030
He's the one thats wrong but i'm annoying.

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,860
A collarless person can talk so much!
-Please continue

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,860
Today I bring you an annual project, please take a look.

14
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,540
The 2021 Prank Review

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,870
It‘s here
-That's right

16
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,970
It's that time of year again.

17
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,740
Since 2014,

18
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,840
That was the first
-Yes it was

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
This is the eight time!

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,350
This is the show's longest running... ongoing project

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,020
Breathe!

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,820
Almost there

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,420
I missed my chance to breathe

24
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,270
The most frequently performed project in the program
-Really getting old

25
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,330
Can't you speak without having to take a breath?
-I was short of breath

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,390
So, this is the annual project to see who was pranked the most last year

27
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,030
And a snow mountain balloon taro competition

28
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,560
2021 Celebrity Ranking

29
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,530
First at joint 10th...

30
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:07,040
3JI NO HEROINE's Kanade and JOY with 7 times

31
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,040
So many pranks
-Yeah

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,520
The next two both appeared 8 times

33
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,510
Jungle Pocket's Kobu and Panther's Ogata

34
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,280
I thought it'd be higher

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:25,330
2018 Prank「Fake Navigation Voice Recording」

36
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,660
Turn right after 1000km

37
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,230
After 1000km

38
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,330
Turn right after 10,000km

39
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:35,930
2019 Prank「Dish names at a fake yakitori restaurant」

40
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,960
Work it out already!

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,770
Excuse me, your electric car

42
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,130
Electric car？
-Excuse me

43
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,200
Delicious
-Thank you

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,940
Your Nagabuchi

45
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,940
Nagabuchi?

46
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:43,110
Top-ranked for 3 consecutive years, Ogata drops to No. 7 in 2021

47
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,320
You'd normally realise, right?

48
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,620
The next three people appeared the same number of times

49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,620
Who is it?

50
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:57,650
Sakai, Tsuda and Nadal

51
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,990
Yeah, he has loads

52
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,850
Less than before?

53
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,730
Can you tell me something interesting about when you played soccer?
-OK

54
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:14,680
2020 Prank「Video recorded in advance for a long-distance meeting」

55
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,370
Funny stories from the soccer team

56
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,820
Pre-recorded video

57
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,710
What is it? Huh?

58
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,110
Just played a video

59
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,140
An interesting story

60
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,840
The King of 2020 has failed to achieve a winning streak

61
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,850
Next is a 10-time tie for 2nd

62
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:31,910
Yamauchi and Kawai

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,510
Unexpected

64
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,860
Bitter citrus fruit…

65
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,200
The first Johnny's finalist since 2014

66
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,380
Johnny's, great!

67
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,170
At the top of the list is...

68
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,170
Who can surpass these two?

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,590
Oda with 12 appearences

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,120
This time, he is awarded the title of King of 2021

71
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,410
Yeah, so it's Oda this time

72
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,460
The generations go by so quickly
-Yeah

73
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,600
Komiya is no longer on the list

74
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,540
Now, its time to get down to business
-Yeah

75
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,830
Oda was pranked so many time this year

76
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,880
So he must be pretty sensitive to the whole thing by now

77
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,430
So, this week we did seven pranks on Oda

78
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,120
Then we challenged him to tell us what they were

79
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,470
You also did it, right?
-Yeah

80
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:33,500
I was waiting for the traffic light after work from Nagoya

81
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:44,570
2015 Prank

82
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,960
When the American car that should have been in my house drove past me

83
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,980
Shipped all the way from Tokyo

84
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,560
The staff drove on the expressway to Nagoya
-Awesome!

85
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,300
It's car theft!

86
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,700
Indeed, indeed

87
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,790
One day in December...

88
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,360
Definitely a tiring week

89
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,430
Exhausting

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,050
Oda is notified of the results

91
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:03,650
You came first in the celebrity prank ranking of 2021

92
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,420
Huh? First?
-First

93
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,600
What the hell?

94
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,590
First place?
-That's right

95
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,160
That was scary

96
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,730
Oda's very scary sometimes

97
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm always questioning if things are pranks

98
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,940
Probably because i've been messed with too much

99
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,660
And so the plan is put into action

100
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,660
Everything feels like a prank

101
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:34,780
Can Oda determine the 7 pranks performed in a whole week of pranks?

102
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,960
I think I can probably tell

103
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,590
I won't miss the small details

104
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,230
I've been here too much

105
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,060
I'm too suspicious

106
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,930
To narrow it down to 7...

107
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:59,010
There are often Assistant Directors who rush in from the corridor

108
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,210
I have to react "Oh!" even when I've seen it, just do something

109
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,750
They're really everywhere

110
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,550
Arrangements for the extremely sensitive Oda are as follows

111
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,010
Heightened sensitivity

112
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:15,400
Someone bangs on the wall after shouting occurs at a location shoot

113
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,130
Koga Ken sings the BGM in a Cafe

114
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,660
Realistic

115
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,670
The number of followers round a Z-list celebrity is ridiculous

116
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,920
Wear a police chief's uniform for one day from the moment of leaving the house

117
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,750
He really became a chief?

118
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,250
The entire meeting staff are over 190cm tall

119
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,250
That's tall!

120
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,740
The first appearance of Ado is a fake

121
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,950
Wake up without being woken up

122
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,830
The last one's like Ikyo's question

123
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:58,050
For one week, a camera remains close to Oda to shoot the 7 pranks

124
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:05,110
After one week, he is asked to guess which of the things that happened around him were pranks

125
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,350
After one week

126
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,790
Excuse me

127
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,360
What hat are you wearing!?

128
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,190
Good morning

129
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,190
How much confidence do you have?

130
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,690
I have complete confidence

131
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,900
I have a definitive answer in my mind

132
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,860
There are 7 that I am sure of

133
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,570
If it was 6 or 8, then it'd be different

134
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,870
I'm sure it's seven, and you've arranged for seven, right?
-Correct

135
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,710
I have confidence and also feel a little embarrassed

136
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,710
I'm serious

137
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,450
I apologise

138
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,650
I am really serious

139
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,560
Can you work out the last one?

140
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,210
I think i'm good to go

141
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,890
What does he think is the first prank?

142
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,790
If this isn't a prank then its a problem

143
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:04,900
Being the Chief of Police of Shinjuku Police Station for a day

144
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:10,670
The night before my manager gave us police uniforms

145
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,410
And told us to wear it to work tomorrow

146
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,980
This is the police chief costume you will wear tomorrow

147
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,170
Put it on before you go out tomorrow

148
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,490
Later you'll be in a taxi prepared by the police station

149
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,360
Put it on in the morning, OK?

150
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,060
Now way! Aren't I on "Love it!"

151
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,460
Wear this before "Love it!"

152
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,470
Then switch to the clothes prepared at "Love it!"

153
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,730
Just wear this uniform for the journey

154
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,970
What do you mean?

155
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,240
Start when leaving the house?

156
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,770
That's right, start when leaving the house
-Why?

157
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,580
So you'll be a police chief for a day

158
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,000
It definitely felt ridiculous

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,910
She explained to me that it was because I was going to be a police chief for a day

160
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,650
We had a little argument

161
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,950
Even the police chief changes into their uniform at the station

162
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,190
This is what I said

163
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,790
He talks like my dad

164
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,560
She said: "No, this is the rule for the police chief on their first day"

165
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,460
I genuinely didn't bring my own clothes, the uniform was my clothes for the day

166
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,800
I thought this is definitely wrong

167
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
I just couldn't understand it

168
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,540
So weird

169
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,950
Police chief, police chief!

170
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,510
So weird!

171
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,510
So weird!

172
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,280
This is killing me

173
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,280
Seriously

174
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,740
Too interesting

175
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,150
I saw it on the news
-He was really a police chief for a day

176
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,630
Really?

177
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,860
Did he really work as a police chief for a day?

178
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,930
Seriously

179
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,500
What a mess

180
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,200
I was laughed at by everyone when I entered TBS

181
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,340
If he came in like that you'd definitely laugh

182
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,220
What is this, a drama?

183
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,220
Koga Ken was also wearing a uniform for some reason

184
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,380
It was also Koga Ken's first day as a police chief

185
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,090
So,

186
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,560
Koga Ken too

187
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,700
Good morning

188
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,460
Left the house as a police chief

189
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,870
Actually turned up wearing it

190
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,240
Naturally, Koga Ken knows the setup

191
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,080
What did they tell you?

192
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,720
They just... just gave it to me

193
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,450
When?

194
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,220
Gave it to me yesterday

195
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,490
I thought we'd be taking pictures from the morning

196
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,290
Constantly asking questions to tell if it's a prank

197
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,360
Where, here?
-Yeah

198
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,730
Couldn't we just shoot and change here?

199
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,900
Something was definetely wrong

200
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,870
Very perceptive

201
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,240
When I was on a location shoot,

202
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,850
I was in a room in a big 6-floor apartment

203
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,550
And in the room next door there was "BANG"

204
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,920
Like someone was saying I was being too loud

205
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,720
An impressive one to come up with

206
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,360
It's not easy

207
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,280
It could happen

208
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,100
Get get get get get your spirit up

209
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,410
You're demoralizing me!
-That hurts!

210
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,270
I'm hurt inside, too, asshole, it's your fault!

211
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,510
Scary!

212
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,000
This is pretty real
-Yeah

213
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,630
Next door?

214
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,380
There's someone living there?

215
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,880
Move over there a little

216
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,220
There

217
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,490
Hey, is someone living there?

218
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,990
I didn't say a word from that point on

219
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,900
Yeah, okay

220
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,990
By the way
-Not good, not good

221
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,800
There's a load of subway stations close to here

222
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,220
Not only Musashi Kosugi, but also Moto Sumiyoshi

223
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,010
It's like "King's Brunch"

224
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,340
I thought this is not something you'd usually expect

225
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:12,510
I'm sure i'd scream if it was me

226
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,520
It's impossible for the staff to not consider something like this

227
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,400
Indeed

228
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,890
There are people living next to where we're shooting

229
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:26,940
If it wasn't for the prank I wouldn't have gone there on location

230
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,440
So far, Oda has gotten all the questions right

231
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,880
I was working with Misono

232
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,750
I've collaborated with loads of people

233
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,490
We discussed the cooperation plan

234
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:56,530
At the time, she was surrounded by an unnatural number of people

235
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,190
7-8 people

236
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,820
He realised!

237
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,100
OK, thank you

238
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,070
Can you two wait for a moment, please?
-OK

239
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,410
Poor Misono

240
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,260
It would be weird to see so many

241
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,950
Where did this Misono come from?

242
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,450
I'm very happy we can collaborate

243
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,530
Yes I'm also very touched

244
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,000
You'd definitely be able to tell

245
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:32,090
Misono's hair was in two colors

246
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,160
Was there one person for each color?

247
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,300
This person in charge of this color and another for the other color?

248
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,240
The makeup was setup in such a way?

249
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,130
Why would it be setup like this?

250
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,100
With an agent on hand

251
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,640
Then I was introduced to Koga Ken

252
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,550
Too awesome

253
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,710
I said we have to cooperate!

254
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,600
You'd definitely laugh

255
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,320
I especially like that one part

256
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,980
I really want to collaborate on it

257
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,130
First on the oil pipe

258
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,620
That song was so good, I was amazed

259
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,930
Thank you

260
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,970
You'd definetly laugh
-Yeah

261
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,850
What is the guy on the end doing?

262
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,490
I couldn't stop myself from laughing

263
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,130
I tried really hard to hold it in, but I just couldn't

264
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,170
There was just way too many people

265
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,910
I also asked my agent "Isn't this weird?"

266
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,750
She said: "Maybe musicians are all like that"

267
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,680
"EXILE are also like that"

268
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,490
There's no way you can use EXILE as a reference for Misono

269
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,590
So that was it

270
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,290
Pretty good
-Not bad

271
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,130
There was a pre-taping meeting for a show

272
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,030
Just like this

273
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,830
There was about 4 staff members

274
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,630
Everyone was gigantic

275
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,900
That's good
-Not bad

276
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,640
So it is possible to get them all right
-Possibly

277
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,140
Probably about 190CM

278
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,440
Thank you
-Thank  you

279
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,650
Let's take a picture to finish

280
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,250
He realized at this moment

281
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,920
I'll take the picture

282
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,440
I'll take it
-OK

283
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,090
OK, let's start with a smile

284
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,090
Over 190cm!

285
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,570
So stressful!

286
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,590
OK, cheese!

287
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,670
I might not realize

288
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,900
OK, all good

289
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,500
Next an angry face

290
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,750
It's still possible

291
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,760
Very good, very good

292
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,980
There's a lot of tall people these days
-Yeah loads

293
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,010
I hope we can make a good show

294
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,740
Definitely

295
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,450
Lets cooperate well together

296
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,360
So far, Oda has gotten 4 right in a row

297
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,370
Impressive

298
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,790
Can he achieve the first perfect score?

299
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,790
First...

300
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,240
A report in a music program

301
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,480
Ado who sang "Urusei"

302
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,580
Would you realize if you hadn't seen her before?

303
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,420
It was Ado's first appearance on that program

304
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,090
I was the only person who'd met her before the show

305
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,720
Although she's a bit out of my league

306
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,780
I react to things,

307
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,790
It's my job to react to things that happen

308
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,800
So I went to the studio to see Ado

309
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,030
The recording studio is over there

310
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,600
I want to see the imposter

311
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,740
Can we go, is it ok to go now?

312
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,470
Let's go

313
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,570
It's there, right?

314
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:39,230
The set is a behind the scene's look at Ado's first live appearence on the show

315
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,910
She's a teenager, right?

316
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:49,030
Doing VTR requires me to look around and at the camera

317
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,400
It was an impostor, right?

318
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,380
How'd he know?

319
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,830
Can you look at the camera now?

320
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,300
Eh, really?

321
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,110
It's the first time her face is shown

322
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,930
So here we go!

323
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,270
Oda, please start by shouting "Ado!"

324
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,210
Countdown, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

325
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,620
Ado!

326
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,660
What a gentle face...

327
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,160
It took a lot of effort to control myself

328
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,940
Being gentle is easy

329
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,560
Even if i'm shaken inside, I won't show it

330
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,660
That feeling
-Yeah

331
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,070
She's already a housewife, right?

332
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:38,210
Whoa, suuuuuper gentle-looking

333
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,260
Who decided on this lady?

334
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,610
Not what I expected at all

335
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,280
I said "Not what I expected at all"

336
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,150
But I didn't say "she's more mature than I expected"

337
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,950
This sort of thing shouldn't be said

338
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:54,370
Ado's age was announced to the public as 19

339
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,760
The fake Ado that Oda was faced with was 47 years old

340
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,460
But she doesn't look 47

341
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,630
Ha?

342
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,140
If the other person couldn't hear me i'm sure I would have said a lot

343
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,320
What a reaction

344
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,710
I would have said "who's the middle-aged woman?"

345
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,480
But even thought it wasn't Ado it'd still be pretty rude

346
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Oda's still got two left to get a perfect score

347
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,760
Impressive
-Impressive, right?

348
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,480
He can probably can get a perfect score

349
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,960
Coffee shop BGM

350
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,360
After work a taxi was arranged for me

351
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:35,360
The driver was an African dude

352
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,640
I even asked for his name, it was definitely a prank

353
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,690
Is there any more to this?

354
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,280
Rare

355
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:50,550
The driver was called Masonga and he was from Tanzania

356
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,510
It's really rare to see an African dude driving a taxi

357
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,150
Seriously?

358
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,350
He drove really normally

359
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,050
I asked him his name just to check

360
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,700
How come he took that taxi on that day?

361
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:04,290
I also asked him "Have you been in Japan long?"

362
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,590
This could also happen

363
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:10,300
He was a good driver, also knew the best routes to take

364
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,300
And so, Oda gives his first incorrect answer

365
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,920
Now let's see the true face of Masonga

366
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,080
Where would you like to go?

367
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,380
Really rare

368
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,680
The program staff conducted an investigation based on Oda's description

369
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,360
He was very quick to agree to an interview

370
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,490
Hinomaru Transportation

371
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:38,050
The last prank identified by Oda was...

372
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,860
It does seem like a prank

373
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,000
"Love it!" graduation prank

374
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:52,370
The new year's live broadcast wasn't discussed with me in advance

375
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,640
Kawashima suddenly made an announcement

376
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,150
"Today, Oda is gradauting from "Love It!" for a role in a morning drama!"

377
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,520
I hadn't heard anything about this before

378
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,720
Today he's graduating from "Love It!"

379
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,490
Huh? I had no idea!

380
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,290
How come?

381
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,160
Really? Really?
-Seriously

382
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,480
Wait a second, is this for real?

383
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,000
It's over, you're starring in "Come Come Everybody"
-Yeah, yeah

384
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,860
Starting next week, right?
-Ah, but-

385
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,240
I don't have the morning drama every day,

386
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,870
And there's also times when you don't appear

387
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:28,110
So I thought this must be a prank

388
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,210
For weeks now...

389
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,510
Isn't there a connection between these shows?

390
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,320
Ano's appearence

391
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,790
It seemed possible

392
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,000
It went on for several weeks

393
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,120
So, the results are shown above

394
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,500
You got 5 correct

395
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,500
That's impossible, impossible

396
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,740
I don't think its possible I got anything wrong, which ones were wrong?

397
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,180
Seriously? No way!

398
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,240
Which one do you think?

399
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,650
I'm unsure...

400
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,980
Oh, the police chief thing was definitely a prank!

401
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,750
Correct

402
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,490
Right?
-Yeah

403
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,560
Ado was a prank
-Yeah, a prank

404
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,920
Be confident

405
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:20,160
That was close! That was close!

406
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,830
The "Love It!" graudation was a prank

407
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,530
No

408
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,170
OI!!!!

409
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,870
Tragic! The graduation is real!

410
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,670
No?

411
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:33,340
Why do I have to suffer a double blow?

412
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,340
The remaining 3 correct answers were then stated

413
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,180
Masonga was real?

414
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,190
God, I knew I should have asked more questions

415
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,470
We then asked him to see if there was anything else suspicious that could have been a prank

416
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,360
The ones I just listed were "high suspicion", I also have a few "moderate suspicion"

417
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:02,040
Only the road in front of my house is iced over like a ice skating rink

418
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,710
We don't know anything about that

419
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,710
This really can't be done

420
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,910
A man at Kyoto Station wanted me to do a questionnaire

421
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,010
He asked me how old I am, I said i'm 43

422
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,920
Afterwards he said "Thank you"

423
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,520
I wondered if such surveys are still a thing

424
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,050
Why just ask someone's age?

425
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,050
Indeed, indeed

426
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,550
Look's like he doesn't have the right answer

427
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,860
So, we revealed the remaining two pranks

428
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,850
Goodbye Sunday Followed by Monday Take a Break on Tuesday

429
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,240
Who's heard of this before?

430
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,500
Feedback was basically 0

431
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,170
Didn't hear
-Didn't hear it

432
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,190
Does it ring a bell?
-It does

433
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,000
This is Koga Ken's "Goodbye Sunday"

434
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,130
H-h-h-how, w-what?

435
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,670
What happened? What did you do?

436
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,940
Did you have a meeting at a cafe during this period?
-Yeah

437
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,110
The BGM was this song

438
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,910
Tough!

439
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,770
Next is the last one

440
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,890
The last one is scary

441
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,390
You stayed at Osaka Hotel, right?
-Right

442
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,590
Did you sleep well?

443
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,430
Yeah I slept really well

444
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,930
Good morning

445
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:44,570
Wake up prank without waking up anyone

446
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,910
What are you talking about?

447
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,610
W-w-what's going on?

448
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,430
You'd definitely have this reaction

449
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,950
Ijiri didn't know what kind of emotion to feel

450
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,930
He really went in but didn't wake him up

451
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,650
It's not easy for Ijiri to not wake him up

452
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,100
Came in? Came in? Really?
-Yeah

453
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,130
It must be a lie, right? '
-No, it happened

454
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,640
It's scary to think about

455
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,580
It's a little scary

456
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,190
Why do they look so much alike?

457
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,720
He's wearing his hat!

458
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,240
He's the worst!

459
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,620
He drank it, he drank it!

460
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,910
Drinking an unopened one

461
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,920
Luckily I didn't drink it

462
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,160
Really?

463
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:43,400
After that he stayed in Oda's room for 10 minutes

464
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,780
10 minutes?

465
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,690
He's so close

466
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,500
He didn't realise?
-Terrifying

467
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,010
Good night

468
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:56,720
For the first time, Ijiri exited the room without waking up the pranked individual

469
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,230
What the hell?

470
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,180
Ijiri's pranks are all the same

471
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,520
I really want to see it

472
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,190
Awesome

473
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,990
It's too much
-OK OK

474
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,690
He just got two wrong, what do you think Matsumoto?

475
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:16,700
Ah, I thought he'd be able to get them all correct

476
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,300
But its impressive he realised the banging on the wall

477
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,300
Indeed
-It's very like to happen

478
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,270
What do you think Matsumura?

479
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:29,940
The two incorrect ones did seem a lot like pranks

480
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,920
I've really never such an African taxi driver

481
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,210
It was a tense week for him

482
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,420
He doubted everything
-Even ice in front of his door

483
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,720
Taking a picture, it's time to take a picture, right?

484
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:49,270
It was an unfunny experience for everyone

485
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:54,070
And the fact that the color of his sweatshirt matched the wall behind him was very upsetting

486
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,630
Unpleasant to look at?
-Yes

487
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,440
Let's welcome the next presenter

488
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,000
Okano Yoichi!

489
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,850
Hello everyone

490
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,880
Thanks for having me

491
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,350
Your second time here

492
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:18,620
Yes, I was called to come in such a short period of time twice

493
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,890
Very impressive

494
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,190
There's a reason for that

495
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:27,980
Originally Audrey's Kasuga was supposed to come

496
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,200
But he tested positive for COVID-19

497
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,260
I saw on the news

498
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,070
Oh really?

499
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:38,140
So an immediate search took place for a negative person

500
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,740
That's me
-No, no

501
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,940
Are you a negative person?

502
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,910
I am a negative person

503
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,420
There are still a lot of negative people, right?

504
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,850
No, there wasn't any negative people available for tomorrow

505
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,490
Oh really?

506
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,790
Negative tomorrow

507
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,630
So i'll perform well today also

508
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,320
You can do it

509
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,730
Before we get into, please watch this VTR

510
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,330
OK

511
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,710
Balloonist Taro

512
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,260
Why did he suddenly turn up

513
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,410
Can you do it? That's awesome

514
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,780
Nostalgic

515
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,250
I've seen it

516
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,510
Must admit i've seen it

517
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,450
This staff member
-They're all out

518
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,880
Why do we have to see this again

519
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,550
The hand is stretching out from the inside

520
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,600
Please just watch

521
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:28,390
Get it, get it!

522
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,000
It'll definitely break

523
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,340
What we've just seen is Balloon Taro

524
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,530
Balloon Taro

525
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,170
Do you know him Matsumoto?

526
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,910
I've seen him a few times

527
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,850
How about you, Niiyama?

528
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,890
I know him, i've seen him on VTRs

529
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:49,810
Oh really?
-That's right

530
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:55,380
Today, we bring you a theory related to Balloon Taro, please take a look

531
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,400
Snow Mountain Balloon Taro Competition

532
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,470
What?

533
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,540
Snow mountain?

534
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,870
It's literally what it says in the title

535
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,440
What does a Balloon Taro competition even mean?

536
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,400
Simply put, we will see what happens when you go down a snow mountain dressed as Balloon Taro

537
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,480
In that shape?

538
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,870
Loads of people dressed up as Balloon Taro?
-Correct

539
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,710
To see if you can win against Balloon Taro?

540
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,910
Is Balloon Taro going to participate?

541
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,180
Well, let's see what will happen

542
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,190
I'm not looking forward to it at all

543
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,950
Just look forward to it!

544
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,360
Snow Mountain Balloon Taro Competition!

545
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,080
Loads of people

546
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:48,720
All 8 of the participants, including Balloon Taro himself, are nude comedians

547
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,150
Here we go, the man himself!

548
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,680
I'd like to ask everyone what it feels like to be inside the ball

549
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,210
Nude apart from a pair of tights

550
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,150
Yeah, a pair of tights

551
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,680
A pair of tights but very warm

552
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,420
The sun's light is shining,

553
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:06,660
So there's a greenhouse effect, it's warm

554
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,230
Very hot
-Very nice!

555
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,030
This is a race down a snow mountain dressed as Balloon Taro

556
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:23,140
Rupturing of the balloon is an instant elimination

557
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:21,600
Ah, so it is

558
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,110
That'd be too bad!

559
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,400
Only the first few finishers can advance to the next stage

560
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,680
There will be three matches to decide the final winner

561
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,890
So, what does Balloon Taro himself think of the competition?

562
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,060
To put it bluntly, its rabbit hopping

563
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,990
So it depends on how far you can hop

564
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,990
It's physical strength

565
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,330
It's really uncomfortable to wait like this
-Yeah, the feet...

566
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,430
I really want this to start already

567
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,440
The first stage is 200m

568
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,490
That's quite a long distance

569
00:29:54,090 --> 00:30:01,330
To start, a 15° slope used by intermediate skiers

570
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,690
That's scary

571
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,870
Look's pretty steep

572
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,980
There are also wavy areas in between

573
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,980
Ah, scary scary scary

574
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,530
This is a tough track

575
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,290
This could be part of the winter olympics

576
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,620
The first 4 to finish will advance to the next stage

577
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,790
And so, the first stage begins

578
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,530
On your mark, get set...

579
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,650
Balloon Taro should be pretty good

580
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,510
The first one ahead is Seshita

581
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,320
Ah, so tough

582
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:30,850
But Zakoshi comes up with side

583
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,570
Is this OK?
-It's fine, it's allowed

584
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,100
The green balloon wearing a black hat,

585
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,730
Looks like it's gonna break

586
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,000
Looks really easy to break

587
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,940
Zakoshi is sliding down at a very fast pace

588
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,710
Clever

589
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,120
Suprisingly he can use his brain

590
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,220
Ah! But his hat has fallen off

591
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,950
Looks like an apple!

592
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,190
He transformed into an apple!

593
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,950
On the other side, Kasuga and Akira 100%, both in red, are behind

594
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,940
In this way, Zakoshi didn't jump

595
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,930
Looks like Yogibo

596
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:01,580
Instead, he slid down like a sled and opened up a huge gap between the rest

597
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,580
So fast!

598
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,070
So far!

599
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:08,580
Seeing this, the others decided to take a similar approach

600
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,660
The same trick

601
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,650
Come on, Ono!

602
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,640
All of the participants are either sliding or rolling down the slope

603
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,220
But Zakoshi has stopped

604
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,450
Oh yeah

605
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,620
Because it's flattened out

606
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,810
Oh really
-Yeah

607
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,060
This is a very unexpected race!

608
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,950
Can't slide the whole way

609
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,440
But at this point,

610
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,550
Ow, ow, ow, ow

611
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,220
It's going to break?

612
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,340
It broke!

613
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,920
This is where Seshita's ballon breaks!

614
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:36,230
30 seconds after the start of the first stage, Seshita's ballon breaks

615
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,340
Must be cold
-Really cold!

616
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,020
And...

617
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,590
My back hurts!

618
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,230
Ono's balloon has also broken

619
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:52,490
And Zakoshi is unaffected, retaining a beautiful hold on first place

620
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,160
This is a Zakoshi branded humidifier, right?

621
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,160
Ono's balloon has also broken

622
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:10,860
From here to the middle of the preliminary round is the wavy area.

623
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,850
Zakoshi is impressive

624
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,710
Super fast

625
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,910
Strength is pretty high

626
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,080
Now in second place, the oldest contest at 53, Balloon Taro!

627
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,720
But he's fighting a tiring battle against the ups and downs

628
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,680
The creator doesn't want to lose

629
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,790
Now, Okano's balloon has shrunk

630
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,600
Has his journey come to an end?

631
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,360
That's bad

632
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,130
He's been overtaken

633
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:31,240
But he's desperately trying to stop Jun-ichi Davidson

634
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,690
The air's leaking

635
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,730
It's like that is it?

636
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,620
It can leak

637
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,490
Okano's become so small!

638
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,730
So it can leak...

639
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:38,110
Suddenly from behind, Akira catches up with a forward roll!

640
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,900
The current ranking is shown above

641
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,400
First is Zakoshi

642
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:53,510
And last is Audrey's Kasuga, the man whose very proud of his strength and physique

643
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:00,700
Who will be the first to reach the finish line?

644
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,970
Such hard work

645
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:08,230
But as all of the participants are over 40 years old, have their reached their limit?

646
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:13,000
The participant stopping at this point is obvious

647
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,090
I didn't expect them to all be so enthusiastic

648
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,020
Here we see Kasuga catching up from the rear

649
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,540
In front, Akira 100%'s balloon suddenly bursts!

650
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,580
Akira 100%'s balloon suddenly bursts

651
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,700
Cover up with the pan, quickly!

652
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,750
Ow, ow, ow, ow

653
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,680
Now 3, 4 and 5 are all stuck in a ditch

654
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:52,340
And now Balloon Taro has caught up with Zakoshi to steal first place

655
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,480
Their strength has...

656
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,190
Awesome!

657
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,090
This is just the preliminary round!?
-Yeah

658
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,690
But Zakoshi refuses to be defeated and overtakes

659
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:05,670
Now in last place, Okano is entombed within the balloon and falls

660
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,860
But the air has already...

661
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,230
So difficult without the air

662
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:10,480
The balloon is completed deflated and resembles Tutankhamen!

663
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,210
As his movement is restricted can he get up?

664
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,410
Will he be able to get up?

665
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,750
What can you do

666
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,430
No, he can't get up!

667
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:21,840
He can't get up

668
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,590
Can't stand up

669
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:31,020
And now his balloon bursts and he's the fourth person to be eliminated

670
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,260
Can't believe you got eliminated in the first round!

671
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:40,070
And now he's fleeing as if being chased by a mountain spirit!

672
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,960
What are you talking about?

673
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,760
What an analogy!

674
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:52,940
At the other end, Zakoshi, who is temporarily ahead, loses the lead to Balloon Taro

675
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,160
Such a skillful use of the balloon

676
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,100
And keeps the lead as he finally reaches the finish line

677
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,650
Awesome!

678
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,230
It'd be really bad if it exploded here

679
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,840
The end is in sight for Balloon Taro

680
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,260
Definetly exhausted

681
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,490
Ah be careful

682
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,450
With the last ounce of his strength, Balloon Taro is the first to cross the finish line

683
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:11,730
Hurry!

684
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,700
He has won the first match exquisitely!

685
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,170
Hoping to also finish, Zakoshi is once again sitting down and sliding

686
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,240
He's got the hang of it

687
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,540
It's downhill here, too

688
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,660
A good slide for his final sprint

689
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,730
He's like something that floated downstream in a story

690
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,350
Looks like he's praying for his sins

691
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,230
And he uses his head to finish

692
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:47,650
And Zakoshi finishes second to advance to the next stage!

693
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,850
That's some hard work!

694
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,250
Seriously hard work

695
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,490
So tiring

696
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,760
Hey, which place?
-2nd!

697
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,330
Ah pretty good

698
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,500
Just behind in 3rd place is Kasuga

699
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,700
Catching up!

700
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,760
Kasuga has been jumping!

701
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:05,170
Later, Jun-ichi Davidson also reached the end

702
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,140
Before he was clearly last

703
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,990
Even if it breaks it doesn't matter I guess

704
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,690
So, these four participants advance to the second stage

705
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,010
2nd match

706
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:11,800
I see

707
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,820
Are these four OK?

708
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,950
My legs are so sore I can barely stand

709
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:18,920
You get super sweaty inside the balloon

710
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,090
The people watching probably can't even tell how tiring it is

711
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,590
To begin with, Zakoshi was ahead but ultimately can in 2nd

712
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:31,070
I was sliding as soon as the starting gun even went off

713
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:36,070
I didn't even push off, I just slid

714
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,110
But second is still pretty good

715
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,080
I swooshed!

716
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,710
What the hell?

717
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,810
The first person whose balloon broke was Seshita, right?
-Yes

718
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,620
After being overtaken by Zakoshi I thought i'd slide down too

719
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,560
But I tried to stand up and pulled too tight so it burst

720
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,990
Standing up?
-Yes, it didn't work out

721
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:58,060
PIN——CH

722
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,330
Next is the second stage

723
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,080
That chat didn't go too well

724
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:09,240
The 150-m forest road course is almost all uphill

725
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,230
It is more physically demanding than the 1st course

726
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,780
More tiring than the first one?

727
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:19,780
The first 2 out of 4 players will advance to the final

728
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,480
The stamina of these people is really impressive

729
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,420
So tough

730
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,030
Please take your positions.

731
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,060
What will happen?

732
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,120
Get ready!

733
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:31,850
The tough 2nd stage now begins

734
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,290
Whoa, awesome!

735
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,190
Oh, like this?

736
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,020
Is it okay to make your opponent fall?

737
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,340
Totally fine

738
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,020
Is it necessary to wear the hat?

739
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,870
Not necessary

740
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,450
Zakoshi drops his hat the same as last time

741
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:51,210
Here sliding is impossible due to an incline

742
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,780
Danger, danger!

743
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,800
It's going to break!

744
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,870
Suddenly, Kasuga has stopped

745
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,270
Lost his balance?

746
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,370
Even used a drone for this

747
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,760
It's difficult to get up

748
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,090
Kasgua is standing!

749
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,030
The competition is incredibly intense!

750
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,890
This part is really all about stamina

751
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:16,100
Kasuga shakes off the three from the outside and comes to 1st

752
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:22,330
20 meters from the starting point, Kasuga escapes in a watery melee

753
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,880
Good, good, good

754
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,050
This'll work

755
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,440
The back three are still huddled together

756
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,830
Looks exhausting

757
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,300
Especiall since its the 2nd stage

758
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,880
But Zakoshi and Balloon Taro both suddenly catch up

759
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,280
And this is only the semi-finals

760
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,260
Yeah

761
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,550
Ah, he's down

762
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:49,090
Does he want to roll?
-Where'd he go?

763
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,570
Jun-ichi is a bit far off

764
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,040
Thigs have reached their limit, right?

765
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,040
Is Jun-ichi losing his strength?

766
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,110
Definetly sore

767
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,250
Back must hurt too

768
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:02,510
Zakoshi enters the final 50m

769
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:05,080
2nd is Kasuga followed by Balloon Taro

770
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,120
Zakoshi's pretty strong

771
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:14,920
Balloon Taro!

772
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,170
He's dead!

773
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,900
Wait, he's falling!

774
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,970
No way!

775
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,640
Very good

776
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,080
He's dead, right?

777
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,250
Kasuga actually pushed Balloon Taro off the track

778
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,200
Surely this shouldn't be done

779
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,860
Dangerous!

780
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,090
Halted!

781
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,560
Dangerous!

782
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,630
The balloon seems to have burst

783
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,070
Those branches are dangerous

784
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,190
Ah, watch out, watch out!

785
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:41,690
Ah he can't get up

786
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,180
You can do it!

787
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,730
You can do it!

788
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,480
Don't give up!

789
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:59,150
Trying to grab the tree to get back on the track, he fails

790
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,370
It can't be helped

791
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,920
Kasuga sure is a formidable opponent

792
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,270
Kasuga's evil!

793
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,530
Balloon Taro is eliminated

794
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,090
He's down

795
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:10,760
And Zakoshi is the first to reach the finish line

796
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:13,640
Zakoshi has really good stamina

797
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,070
There's only one spot left to advance to the final

798
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,580
Zakoshi's balloon doesn't even leak

799
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,660
Kasuga is almost at the end

800
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,280
Or will Jun-ichi Davidson make a miraculous comeback?

801
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,370
Oh, is there a chance?

802
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,110
At this point,

803
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,820
What's going on?

804
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,760
Jun-ichi suddenly self-destructs, throwing himself off the track

805
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,100
What's going on?

806
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,910
Therefore,

807
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:42,190
Kasuga successfully reaches the finish line and advances to the final stage

808
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,680
Looked pretty easy

809
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,000
So energetic!

810
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,970
What happened with Jun-ichi?

811
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,400
I can't do it

812
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:58,640
And so, these are the two participants advancing to the final

813
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,300
What a pity

814
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:56,880
What a shame

815
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,610
As expected, right?

816
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,010
Snow Mountain Balloon Taro Competition Final!

817
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,640
It's already night

818
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,600
It's night

819
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,700
Swooosh——!

820
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,090
What is this?

821
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,190
It seems to be snowing

822
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,000
Finalists

823
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,250
It's finally the final

824
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:18,220
The time is 8:00 p.m and the temperature 8 degrees below zero

825
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,890
Freezing

826
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,460
8 degrees below zero

827
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:26,700
The final stage, in extreme cold, is a 70m course

828
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,490
Isn't the angle a bit too extreme?

829
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,630
Not good, and it's winter

830
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:33,290
And almost all of it is a 30° slope, which makes for a very dangerous course.

831
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,970
Really impressive

832
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:31,690
Dangerous!

833
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,780
It's practically a cliff!

834
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,740
It's really impressive, it looks good

835
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,370
You may not really understand just by watching,

836
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:40,080
But from this angle it just looks like a cliff

837
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,850
What are you laughing at?

838
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,180
Snow Mountain Balloon Taro Competition - who will win become the first champion?

839
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:53,900
Is underwear necessary for this?

840
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,870
It'd be dangerous to not

841
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,460
How could that be broadcast?

842
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,700
They're at a snow mountain so they are frozen and shrunken
-Very true

843
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,340
Probably can't see it

844
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:08,670
The Snow Mountain Balloon Taro Competition final is upon us!

845
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,820
On your mark, get set...
-How will it go?

846
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,770
The race begins

847
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,750
Will red or green be the winner?

848
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,220
This is bad, this is bad!

849
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,830
Scary, scary

850
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,620
This would definitely happen

851
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,690
Ah, it burst!

852
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,110
Of course!

853
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,650
It's dangerous for the staff too

854
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:59,080
This doesn't have to be Kasuga and Zakoshi

855
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,120
Face down

856
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,330
Terrible, terrible

857
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,800
They caught a naked old man

858
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,700
No, it burst!

859
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,610
Even though it burst
-Scary, scary!

860
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:19,240
Who won?

861
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,040
I can't see anything!
-So scary!

862
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,510
Too fast!

863
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,980
Who won?

864
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:29,820
The results were unclear to all

865
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,360
I can't see, I can't see Kasuga anymore

866
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:37,990
The winner is, of course, Zakoshi, who reaches the finish line first

867
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,590
Therefore,

868
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,930
The winner of the competition is Zakoshi!

869
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,190
Swoosh——!

870
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:55,210
This game was much more exciting than expected

871
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,110
It was really fast!

872
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,650
By the time i'd come back to my senses, it'd already burst

873
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:04,950
I really only just came back to my senses

874
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:07,220
And a bit damp
-Yes

875
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,090
A bit of a Koshino Junko vibe

876
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,190
Zakoshi sent the staff flying

877
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:18,400
If he wasn't caught he'd have flown into the building below

878
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,140
You can't control yourself here?

879
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,640
I tried to brake

880
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,110
Like I was trying to brake in the car

881
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,870
Thankfully it didn't burst at the point

882
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:29,580
It was very fast

883
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,310
After the start I bounced a few times

884
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,520
Then the ground just disappeared

885
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,590
Bounce bounce bounce then straight down

886
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,020
It was like falling into a trap

887
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:45,660
After the ground disappeared, my head also dropped

888
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,760
The brakes just...

889
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,340
Slip, slip, slip, slip

890
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:58,340
To sum up
The first Snow Mountain Balloon Taro Competition led to 0 injuries

891
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:58,970
Everyone wins

892
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,070
Very good, very good

893
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,610
So what do you think after watching, Matsumoto?

894
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:08,190
I apologize for not being interested initially

895
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,020
It was extremely enjoyable

896
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,030
I watched with great interest

897
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,610
Of course, when watching the video it's tough to gauge the speed,

898
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:18,740
In real life it was incredibly fast
-Yes

899
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,830
The fastest thing I've seen this year

900
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,670
At the scene was it funny to see that sense of speed?

901
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:29,510
I could barely even smile

902
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,540
I didn't know whether to laugh or not

903
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,690
"So dangerous, so dangerous"

904
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,090
Everyone was shocked

905
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:36,650
In the last stage, was it even necessary for people to be involved?

906
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,820
Indeed, anyone could have done it

907
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,790
Even a wardrobe would be fine

908
00:45:43,290 --> 00:46:14,750
