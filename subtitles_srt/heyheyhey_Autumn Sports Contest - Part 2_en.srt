00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510

8
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,030
Mind if I use my original indoor shoes?

9
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,060
Go ahead.

10
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,830
Original indoor shoes.

11
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,700
Ah, you mean you won't take
off your boots then.

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,600
I see.

13
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,810
He's engrossed about his health I see.

14
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,780
Let's not ask why so... whatevers.

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,010
You hair's not gonna come off?

16
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:36,850
Not at all.

17
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:37,750
It'll be okay.

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,580
Let's not focus on this.

19
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,150
Let's pay attention to our objective.

20
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,090
This is it! Here we go!

21
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,860
Ready... and...

22
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,560
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

23
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,460
Kago!

24
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,330
"Jankenpon!"

25
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,630
"Looks like a tie!"

26
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,530
DanceMan!

27
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,760
"Jankenpon!"

28
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,200
"Looks like a tie!"

29
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,970
Kago!

30
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,110
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

31
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,210
"Looks like a tie!"

32
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:05,910
Kago!

33
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,810
"Jankenpon!"

34
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,750
Aha... sorry!

35
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,210
"Jankenpon!"

36
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:10,950
Kago!

37
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,850
"Jan...ken...pon..."

38
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,050
DanceMan!

39
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,620
"Jankenpon!"

40
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,050
Kago!

41
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,860
A strike just now!

42
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,460
A beautiful one!

43
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,030
Kago is the winner for this round!

44
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,180
We had some flying going on didn't we?

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,590
We had some flying going on didn't we?

46
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,650
That's right!

47
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,820
She came off very strong.

48
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,360
So let's continue on with a
second in command battle!

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,890
So the next person from the White
Group will be Go Hiromi!

50
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,500
And from the Red Group... Tsuji Nozomi!

51
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,370
If you please.

52
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,370
Go Hiromi isn't smiling at all is he?

53
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,110
Go-san, this kind of game... you haven't...

54
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,950
It's my first time.

55
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,850
It's your first time?

56
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,950
Go-sama doesn't seem affected at all.

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,450
That's true.

58
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,480
Ah! Handshake!

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,920
That's wonderful.

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,850
He understands pretty well
even if it's his first time...

61
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,160
Let's get started!

62
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,190
Ready... and...

63
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,690
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

64
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,630
Go!

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,430
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

66
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,130
Tsuji!

67
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,870
"Jankenpon!"

68
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,700
"Looks like a tie!"

69
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,700
Tsuji's win!

70
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,740
What are you doing?

71
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,140
She ended up covering!

72
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,680
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,210
Tsuji!

74
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,140
Wrong!

75
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,080
You won that one!

76
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,250
She's quick to protect herself!
Tsuji Nozomi-chan!

77
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,390
Okay? Please remember and do it properly.

78
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,020
Here we go!

79
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,390
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

80
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,560
"Looks like a tie!"

81
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,660
Go-san!

82
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,430
"Jankenpon!"

83
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,890
That's wrong!!!

84
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,530
If you don't strike, you'll lose okay!?

85
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,640
Ready?

86
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,170
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

87
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,210
Tsuji!

88
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,110
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!

89
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,340
Looks like no decision...

90
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,910
Are you able to see?

91
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,580
She wants to protect herself.

92
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,080
She has that kind of feeling.

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,580
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

94
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,480
Go-san!

95
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,320
Safe!

96
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,690
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

97
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,060
Go-san!

98
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,060
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

99
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,200
"Looks like a tie!"

100
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,370
Go!

101
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,180
Once again okay?

102
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,220
Are you two like some hopeless kids?

103
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,290
Okay? Okay?

104
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,690
Here we go!

105
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,690
Ready... and...

106
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,360
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

107
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,530
Tsuji!

108
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,330
"Jankenpon!"

109
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,260
Tsuji! One more time!

110
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,030
"Jankenpon!"

111
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,070
"Looks like a tie!"

112
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,030
Ohh! Go-san!

113
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,570
"Jankenpon!"

114
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,470
Go-san!

115
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,800
"Jankenpon!"

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,600
Tsuji-san!

117
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,210
"Jankenpon!"

118
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,410
One more time Tsuji!

119
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,310
You're the one hitting!

120
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,440
"Jankenpon!"

121
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,640
Go!

122
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,740
"Jankenpon!"

123
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,680
Go!

124
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,650
"Jankenpon!"

125
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,750
Tsuji~!

126
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,850
"Jankenpon!"

127
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,920
Go!

128
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,850
"Jankenpon!"

129
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,890
Tsuji~!

130
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,690
"Jankenpon!"

131
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,690
Go!

132
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,320
Tsuji!

133
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,120
Oh almost! But no good...

134
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,760
Wrong!

135
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,600
WRONG!!

136
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,160
This is getting painful!

137
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,770
This is... long...

138
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,100
"Jankenpon!"

139
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,170
"Looks like a tie!"

140
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,670
Himori!

141
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,680
"Jan...ken...pon!"

142
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,610
Tsuji's win!

143
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,150
"Jankenpon!"

144
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,010
Himori-san!

145
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,150
"Jankenpon!"

146
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,120
Himori!

147
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,220
"Jankenpon!"

148
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,280
Go!

149
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,150
Go Hiromi!

150
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,750
The White Group!

151
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,660
Go Hiromi is the winner!

152
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,810
That match goes to the White Group!

153
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,480
Truly magnificent!

154
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,020
That was quite a drawn-out battle.

155
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,260
Well... that was pretty long wasn't it!?

156
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,460
Our judge is pretty tired aren't you?

157
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,260
We waited a while for sure.

158
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,300
Tsuji-chan, what did you think about it?

159
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,000
So the... it quickly... are you
tired? Was it difficult?

160
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,130
It was hard.

161
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,070
More than you thought?

162
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,470
You see...

163
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,640
I thought I was the one who lost.

164
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,570
But you did lose!

165
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,440
Yes, you did at "Jankenpon" right?

166
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,280
Tsuji-chan thought she would lose.

167
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,840
Kinda like, "I thought I'd win after all."

168
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,410
Tsuji thought she won... at the end.

169
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,350
Actually, I raised the flag for me.

170
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,050
And so,

171
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,190
this... kendo challenge...

172
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,920
the outcome of this kendo
match is entrusted...

173
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,130
to these two.

174
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,690
It's the match of destiny.

175
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,430
A great battle! From the White
Group, Hamada Masatoshi!

176
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
And from the Red Group, Yasuda Kei!

177
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,170
Kei-chan!

178
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,010
Between us it should be
decided pretty quickly.

179
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,110
If we remember one year ago,

180
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,210
in a hard-fought battle, MoMusu's Yasuda
caused Hama-chan's tragic defeat!

181
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,380
Will the outcome be different this time?

182
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Hamada-san, you seem
to be more than ready.

183
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,190
Here we go!

184
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,160
Ready.. and...

185
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,660
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

186
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,060
"Looks like a tie!"

187
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,960
Yasuda!

188
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,960
"Jankenpon!"

189
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,830
Hamada!

190
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,040
Just like the Hamada-san from last year.

191
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,910
Kei-chan, battle hard!

192
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,640
Do your best!

193
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,710
They're battling hard!

194
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,010
Ready... and...

195
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,380
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

196
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,510
"Looks like a tie!"

197
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,350
Yasuda!

198
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,120
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

199
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,820
Yasuda!

200
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,920
"Jankenpon!"

201
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,990
Yasuda!

202
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,390
"Jankenpon!"

203
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,390
Yasuda!

204
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,860
"Jankenpon!"

205
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,660
Hamada!

206
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,930
Go! Go! Go!

207
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,620
Hmm... just now...

208
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,420
Hamada was just barely safe.

209
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,990
"Safe" is the call on that one.

210
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,060
Let's continue on with this match!

211
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,630
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

212
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,100
Hamada!

213
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,300
"Jankenpon!"

214
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,500
Hamada!

215
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,700
"Jankenpon!"

216
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,470
"Tie!"

217
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,340
Yasuda!

218
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,880
She did "scissors" just now!

219
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,220
She won the janken?

220
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,590
She won! She won!

221
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,420
Serious??

222
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,990
Why did you... I was the one...

223
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,260
Well... doesn't count.

224
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,130
With that kind of energy I thought I won...

225
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,500
Just now, she won right? With "scissors".

226
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
"Scissors" right? And Hamada did "paper".

227
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,070
Well, let's keep going then.

228
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,340
Ready... and...

229
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,540
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

230
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,240
Hamada!

231
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,710
"Jankenpon!"

232
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,610
Hamada!

233
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,180
"Jankenpon!"

234
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,880
"Tie!"

235
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,780
Yasuda!

236
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,350
"Jankenpon!"

237
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,150
Yasuda!

238
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,720
"Jankenpon!"

239
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,580
"Tie!"

240
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,420
Go Yasuda!

241
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,790
"Jankenpon!"

242
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,490
Yasuda!

243
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,990
"Jankenpon!"

244
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:23,860
Yasuda!

245
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,260
"Jankenpon!"

246
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,590
So what I'm thinking is, Hamada-san has
to defeat three people in order to win.

247
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,220
So another two people.

248
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,630
Ah, so three people total then...

249
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,190
Aside from the people on the board?

250
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,330
After watching Yasuda, think they'll try?

251
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,900
I'll go!

252
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,800
Really?

253
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,670
For real?

254
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,300
Yossi! Let's go!

255
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,570
So let's hurry then.

256
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,810
Do your best!

257
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,670
Yossi...

258
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,080
And here we go!

259
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,040
Ready... and...

260
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,180
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

261
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,450
Yoshizawa!

262
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,450
"Janken..."

263
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,890
She's getting active...

264
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,690
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

265
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,790
Yoshizawa!

266
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,460
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

267
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,430
"Looks like a tie!"

268
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,560
Yoshizawa!

269
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,530
"Jankenpon!"

270
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,000
Hamada!

271
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,000
"No" right?

272
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,770
No, no, no, no...

273
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,840
That one didn't count now.

274
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,940
Right there.

275
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,810
"Jankenpon!"

276
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,110
Was she mistaken just now?

277
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,250
No good!

278
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,110
I won that!

279
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,220
Hamada won!

280
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,280
I won the "janken!"

281
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,680
I won it right?

282
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,520
Just now you were like,

283
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,090
"Whatever happens I'll hit him anyway!"

284
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,830
That surprised me.

285
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,100
And actually, Hamada won that round.

286
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,300
Really surprising.

287
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,640
I didn't think she was that mean.

288
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,170
It had nothing to do with the match I think.

289
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,310
That was a really beautiful hit just now.

290
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,480
If it was that beautiful, then she's
already won at janken...

291
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,510
She's got plenty of confidence...

292
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,110
I failed at that one.

293
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
Let's keep going.

294
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,450
Ready... and...

295
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,480
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

296
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,420
Yoshizawa!

297
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,020
"Jankenpon!"

298
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,850
Hamada!

299
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,920
"Jankenpon!"

300
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,760
Hamada!

301
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,060
"Jankenpon!"

302
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,960
Yoshizawa!

303
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,160
"Jankenpon!"

304
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,930
Hamada!

305
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,230
"Jankenpon!"

306
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,190
What the hell!?

307
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,830
Do it right!

308
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,830
She's uncertain which hand...

309
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,670
It's all right. Let's keep going.

310
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,770
"Jankenpon!"

311
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,540
Hamada!

312
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,870
"Jankenpon!"

313
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,600
Hamada!

314
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,870
"Jankenpon!"

315
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,110
Hey! What the...

316
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,180
"Jankenpon!"

317
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,240
Hamada!

318
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,280
"Jankenpon!"

319
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,710
Okay... so, Hamada-san's second win.

320
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,340
Right, so one more round right?

321
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,950
Ahd here we go.

322
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,710
So, one more person...

323
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,150
he must defeat in order to win.

324
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,690
Is there anyone who wants to go?

325
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,150
Lots of pressure on this person.

326
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,090
Leader!

327
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,090
Iida!

328
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,160
Let's go with Iida.

329
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,460
Do you have anything to say now?

330
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,430
You smacked my cute members
too much so...

331
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,030
That's okay.

332
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,900
She hit me for no reason!

333
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,010
Been a while since I've seen
something that pretty.

334
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,240
You guys ready?

335
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,380
Yoroshiku onegaishimasu!

336
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,210
Onegaishimasu!

337
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,010
Scary~!

338
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,650
Onegaishimasu!

339
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,650
Ready...

340
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,850
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

341
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,990
"Looks like a tie!"

342
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
Hamada!

343
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,220
"Jankenpon!"

344
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,190
Hamada!

345
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,260
"Jankenpon!"

346
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,360
"Looks like a tie!"

347
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,090
Iida!

348
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,960
She let it fly!

349
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,500
Flew right out of her hand!

350
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,430
Nice! Nice!

351
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,300
I'm sure your feeling pretty hurt right now.

352
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,540
Shall we continue?

353
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,110
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

354
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,140
Hamada!

355
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,140
You can get a little closer.

356
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,310
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

357
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,780
Iida!

358
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,010
Looks like a fail...

359
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,080
"Jankenpon!"

360
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,250
Iida!

361
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,390
"Jankenpon!"

362
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,390
Hamada!

363
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,690
That was... I don't really know.

364
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,120
What did you throw?

365
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,700
The sound wasn't good and
it wasn't very TV-like so...

366
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,200
He's decided he doesn't like it so,

367
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,870
she's safe for now.

368
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,070
So, keep doing your best!

369
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,670
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

370
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,840
"Looks like a tie!"

371
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,610
Hamada!

372
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,780
Ouch!

373
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,940
"Jankenpon!"

374
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,910
"Looks like a tie!"

375
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,180
Iida!

376
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,220
Looks like Hama-chan's the
one truly getting hit.

377
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,590
Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!

378
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,930
Hamada!

379
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,990
"Jankenpon!"

380
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,730
Iida!

381
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,730
"Jankenpon!"

382
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,760
"Looks like a tie!"

383
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,530
Iida!

384
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,300
"Jankenpon!"

385
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,770
Iida!

386
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,000
Well? Well? Well!?

387
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,040
Red!

388
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,300
Morning Musume!

389
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,640
And for the White Group, with two wins at
50 points each, they receive 100 points!

390
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,470
They'll receive them respectively.

391
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,310
Final Match:
Relay!

392
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,950
Right now, the White Group
has a 50 point lead!

393
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:45,930
So, the winner of this last
battle will get 500 points!

394
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,730
And so... this could be... anyone's victory!

395
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,130
Can't it be just a 100 points?

396
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,570
It could be, but they said to
make it a good 500 so...

397
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,370
This will be a relay of 7 laps
arounda  120 meter course!

398
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:07,110
Starting from the studio, they'll race each other
until they reach middle point in the back straight!

399
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,410
Finally, turn the corner into the hall

400
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,120
and back in the studio
to complete the course!

401
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,090
The Red Group Morning Musume's
first runner will be Abe Natsumi.

402
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,160
They'll race half the course in this order.

403
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,130
The anchor, Iida Kaori, will
runa a full lap by herself.

404
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,130
And here are the White Group members...

405
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,800
Hamada Masatoshi!

406
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,430
w-ind's KEITA!

407
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,230
Da Pump's ISSA!

408
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,570
DanceMan!

409
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,070
Kawamura Ryuuichi!

410
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,440
Go Hiromi!

411
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,340
And then Matsumoto Hitoshi will anchor
in this relay of certain victory!

412
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,380
So did you guys practice at
all for this relay this time?

413
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,810
Not at all...

414
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,650
Not so much huh...

415
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,550
That's... yeah...

416
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,720
So uh, for the new members
how do you feel?

417
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,950
Is running your specialty?

418
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,250
Not really.

419
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,250
It's not?

420
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,190
That's not good.

421
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:50,950
Are you shaking a little?

422
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,690
Please try your hardest okay?

423
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,190
Okay.

424
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,290
It's only halfway okay?

425
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:57,890
And then...

426
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,570
We have a lot of members
that did club sports so...

427
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,430
But I'm not too sure about DanceMan...

428
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,840
DanceMan-san's shoes are those... uhh...

429
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,900
fried soles... I mean...

430
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,270
thick-soled boots!

431
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,010
Sorry! With the thick-soled boots!

432
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,740
I'm distracted by his boots there.

433
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,710
You'll be okay?

434
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,580
I'll be fine!

435
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,780
I'm faster than I appear.

436
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,880
I think maybe Go might be our best one.

437
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,550
Ah that's true.

438
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,380
Go-san is considerably...

439
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,920
he seems to be pretty fast at the end...

440
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,890
Everyday you've done some training right?

441
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,890
It's like you were born for this moment...

442
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,590
And so, let's have the first runners
Hamada-san and Abe Natsumi-san

443
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,260
stand over here at the starting line.

444
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,610
Well then, in this gathering
for the sport contest,

445
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,610
I'd like to start this final relay battle!

446
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,410
To these two runners... are you ready?

447
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,780
So then, here we go!

448
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,150
On your marks... Get set...

449
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,520
And they're off!

450
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,320
The first runners are Hamada
Masatoshi and Abe Natsumi!

451
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,860
An overtake!

452
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,660
Abe-san will hand off there.

453
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,130
And the second runner is Konno Asami!

454
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,730
Hamada-san's at the hallway.

455
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,270
Ohh! Hamada's been passed! But!

456
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,170
New member Konno overshot!

457
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,340
Up next is Yoshizawa Hitomi! Yoshizawa!

458
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,740
And Hamada to Kei... Keita!

459
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,880
w-ind's Keita!

460
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,450
w-ind's Keita has a slight lead!

461
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,350
w-ind's Keita and Yoshizawa Hitomi!

462
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,850
How does it look?

463
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,350
Still has the lead!

464
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,320
And Yoshizawa Hitomi will pass
off to Ogawa Makoto!

465
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,790
Ogawa Makoto has the baton!

466
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,130
It's Ogawa Makoto versus Keita!

467
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,630
Keita's out of the hallway
and entered the studio!

468
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,260
Next is Da Pump's ISSA!

469
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,430
Da Pump's ISSA!

470
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,300
Baton's been passed! To Yasuda Kei!

471
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,370
The Red Group's Yasuda Kei has the baton!

472
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,540
Yasuda Kei!

473
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,010
Yasuda Kei to Niigaki Risa!

474
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,080
Niigaki Risa will take the hand-off
in that changing area.

475
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,810
It's been passed!

476
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:06,290
And Da Pump's ISSA is entering
the studio very nonchalantly!

477
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,750
It's DanceMan!

478
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,560
DanceMan running with
those beautiful strides!

479
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,160
This time it's Yaguchi Mari!

480
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,660
Yaguchi Mari's receiving the baton!

481
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,330
She's chasing after DanceMan!

482
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,800
She's catching up with DanceMan...

483
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,740
Almost there! Off to Takahashi-san!

484
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,570
And Yaguchi-san passes off... wow!

485
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,510
Takahashi Ai... right there... overtook first!

486
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,850
Takahashi Ai and DanceMan
coming into the studio!

487
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,620
Next runner Tsuji Nozomi
receives the hand-off!

488
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,720
Tsuji Nozomi!

489
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,850
And to Kawamura Ryuuichi!

490
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,760
Kawamura Ryuuichi is going
after Tsuji Nozomi!

491
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,020
Kawamura might catch up with her!

492
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,930
Will Tsuji be okay? Tsuji
will pass off to Kago Ai!

493
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,330
Now Kawamura Ryuuichi's chasing Kago Ai!

494
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,940
The lead could change!

495
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,140
This will be a close one!

496
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,270
Go Hiromi!

497
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,810
Go Hiromi and Goto Maki!

498
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:08,010
Goto Maki's in front but
Go-san's right behind!

499
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,450
Goto Maki will pass to Ishikawa Rika!

500
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,280
Goto Maki... Ishikawa Rika!

501
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,720
Ishikawa Rika! They're in the hallway!

502
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,490
Go Hiromi's still up front!

503
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,990
Go Hiromi's arrived! Then
comes Ishikawa Rika!

504
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,030
And now...

505
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,290
the batons are passed!

506
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,260
And the anchors Matsumoto
Hitoshi and Iida Kaori!

507
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,300
These two are giving it their all!

508
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,070
She's chasing!

509
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,440
Can Iida Kaori catch up!?

510
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,470
He's 3 meters ahead! 3 meters!

511
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,940
Still about 3 meters!

512
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,110
Look like she tripped a little!

513
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,280
Will she be okay? Mmm... doesn't look good!

514
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,810
And Matsumoto is now...!

515
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,680
Matsumoto's crossed the goal!

516
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,420
Iida Kaori crossed the goal too!

517
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,660
It was about a 1 second
difference this time!

518
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,400
Woo~too close!

519
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,640
We won but, wasn't that a
spectacular battle though!?

520
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,410
Especially at the end!

521
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,870
That was a really great match.

522
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,310
A very good match!

523
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,780
The White Group...

524
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,380
DanceMan for the most part shortened it.

525
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,980
Aah, it was like that towards the end.

526
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,250
DanceMan was like this...

527
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,990
Hiromi Go was like running for real.

528
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,130
Like full-on serious...

529
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,130
Let's take a look at Go-san again.

530
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,040
That's not the face of a star right?

531
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,710
So how was it? This course...

532
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,310
Well... uh... it was pretty
difficult to run right?

533
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,880
But things like getting the
baton I completely forgot.

534
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,450
And so, the result of this
round was 500 points so

535
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,250
it goes to the White Group.

536
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,120
So it's now 800 to 250 which makes

537
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,590
the White Group the winners!

538
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,200
Congratulations!

539
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,100
A hard-fought win!

540
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,300
So they have the overall victory!

541
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,140
And the championship flag will be
awarded to the White Group!

542
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,210
Who will accept it?

543
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,740
Ah, Hama-chan should!

544
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,980
Congratulations!

545
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,260
Even from the start there
were a lot of difficulties.

546
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,260
And from now, we do "Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!" again right?

547
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,730
Wonder how I'm gonna do.

548
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,230
Well the last part of the
contest was the relay...

549
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,500
I think... maybe... during the relay...

550
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,770
they were confused about the baton.

551
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,170
That right?

552
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:53,840
How was it?

553
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,940
For the Red team, the batons
were giving them trouble.

554
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,770
Ya, we couldn't do it properly.

555
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,140
So handing off the baton was
what took them so long.

556
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,410
With DanceMan being there,
it helped us a little...

557
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,550
That handicap over there...

558
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,750
How was it? This time was a
sudden upset victory maybe.

559
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,220
We lost it.

560
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,890
Right.

561
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,360
It's very regrettable.

562
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,760
It was but...

563
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,530
We'll come back and do it again!

564
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:23,470
So how was Morning Musume's teamwork
among the musumes for this contest?

565
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,370
Right but you know...

566
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,440
The 5th generation members joined and
it's their first time in a contest like this,

567
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,410
so I kinda think our teamwork
wasn't that great.

568
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,080
Ah! I see...

569
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,810
Aren't you the only one thinking that?

570
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,050
Well, I thought your teamwork
was pretty good.

571
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,420
These guys here will have to go to camp!

572
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,660
ISSA-san, how was it?

573
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,330
It was a lot of fun surprisingly.

574
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,870
I thought it was a lot of fun, this meeting...

575
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,370
How was the last part?

576
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,340
It was a lot shorter than
I thought it would be.

577
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,440
That right?

578
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,710
And DanceMan-san,

579
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,880
Well, I can't really come down
with these soles so...

580
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,550
That's beside the point!

581
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,120
The fact that you're wearing
them is ridiculous!!

582
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:15,820
He really packed it on.

583
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,420
That was already said wasn't it?

584
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,690
And so, everyone we hope you
had fun while you were here.

585
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,130
So in the HEY!HEY!HEY! Huge
Autumn Sports Contest,

586
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,360
the White Group was the winner!

587
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,630
Thank you!
