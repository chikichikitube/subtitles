00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,700
It'd be good if we could manage to do that again before May...

11
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,530
We could still do that later though

12
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,230
Hey there!

13
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,560
I'm Endo

14
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,300
Today is the day we record Gaki no Tsukai

15
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,260
Usually I have fun recording the shows in such days

16
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,860
But I actually don't feel so high spirited, lately

17
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,800
And that's because there's a reason I couldn't tell anyone...

18
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,260
You know, all together...

19
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,600
Hey
See?
Yeah, I won't mind

20
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,950
Hamada Masatoshi

21
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:29,960
Good morning!

22
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,330
'Morning!

23
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,700
Oh, Yama-chan thanks for the other day

24
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,300
Don't worry!

25
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,430
That's right

26
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,660
The reason is

27
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,530
Hamada-san from Downtown

28
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,560
Looks like Hamada-san is targeting my body, lately

← Twitter

32
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,360
The fact he came to sit here next to me

33
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,860
Even though there are other tons of empty seats...

34
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,900
Is without a doubt a proof he's been targeting my body

35
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,060
Isn't it way too hot in here?

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,500
Is the air conditioning working properly?

37
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,200
So damn hot!

38
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,130
This is a clear attempt of provocation...

39
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,130
But with such a cheap provocation

40
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,100
I'll never allow him to have my body!

41
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,000
I see...

42
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,030
(Talking about golf) Pretty hard, isn't it?
I mean, striking a ball too high or too low, right?

43
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,300
(Talking about golf) Pretty hard, isn't it?
I mean, striking a ball too high or too low, right?

44
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,300
Oh you're right, it's impossible to me

45
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,600
How is it lately?

46
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,930
Oh I don't feel much like doing it lately

47
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,360
For real?

48
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah...

49
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,560
Something's wrong?

50
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,860
Maybe is my new golf club

51
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,500
Are you spinning the driver properly?

52
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,560
I am

53
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,700
Is that so

54
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,700
Care to show it to me?

55
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,660
I see what he's doing..

56
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,130
With this Hamada will have an excuse to touch my body

57
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,300
In other words he's trying to get his hands on me!

58
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,260
So?

59
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,760
Uh-- But, I'm having lunch right now, plus there's
not much time before today's recording...

60
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,530
Uh? Don't worry about it, there's plenty of time

61
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,160
Sorry but, today's no good, let's do it next time leisurely

62
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,600
Come on, it'll be quick

63
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,860
Just show it to me quickly

64
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,500
Oh yeah?
Yup

65
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,330
Come on, get up

66
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:13,760
Sure

67
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,760
Get up already!

68
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,600
How pushy...

69
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,530
For how long has this man been enduring all of this?

70
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,200
Come on, get the stance

71
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,960
Ok

72
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,900
I think it would be better to tilt forward a bit

73
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,900
And you're making way too much pressure on this spot

74
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,530
You should bend your knee a bit more

75
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:32,830
Got it

76
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,900
Come on, bend it more!

77
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,400
Roger

78
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,400
You shouldn't have your arms onwards, the important is that

79
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,460
The movement should come from your waist,
a rotation like this

80
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,460
Crap! I'll get raped!

81
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,600
If the movement of your waist is slow

82
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,530
Then everything else won't work

83
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,000
So be sure to swing 'em this way

84
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,830
Just like this

85
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,490
Shit!

86
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,660
Someone... Someone, help me!

87
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,260
Got it?

88
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:56,700
Yes...

89
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,760
So, we should do it this way
Yeah...  I think so too

90
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,760
The changes of clothes are ready, guys!

91
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,760
Cool

92
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,380
I survived...

93
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,800
By the way, why is Tanaka

94
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,160
Trying to pretend he saw nothing

95
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,260
Even though his partner is going through all of this?

96
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,380
So even if we're a comedy duo,
we're actually just strangers, after all?

97
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,130
Are we going to change our clothes in here?

98
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,860
Yes please, do it here

99
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,860
Oh, ok
Ok, so here

100
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,360
E-excuse me

101
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Are we all changing our clothes in here?

102
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,180
This is bad..!

103
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,260
To get changed right before this abnormally lustful man...

104
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,160
It'll feel like I'm saying "violate me!" right in front of him!

105
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,060
I have to do something about this...
I have to delay the timing of getting changed...

106
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,600
These?
Yes

107
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,830
Yes, hello?

108
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,600
Sure

109
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,260
Yeah I'm a bit...

110
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,400
Yeah I was about to get changed

111
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,000
That's the only thing I can do
to delay the timing of getting changed...

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,660
Endo!

113
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,060
Come on, man!

114
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,760
It seems we don't have much time, come in and get changed!

115
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,260
Sorry, here I am!

116
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,320
Woah, are you kidding me?

117
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,630
That's nothing but a gay party to me!

118
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,360
Sorry!

119
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,160
This shirt's too tight, geez

120
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,230
Yeah, I think you're right...

121
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,960
Mine is a bit loose

122
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,230
That's because they're so long!

123
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,230
Must be it

124
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,230
What's wrong with those nipples?!

125
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,960
They're completely erect!

126
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,960
Ok, let's go!

127
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,560
We're going first!

128
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,700
Shit!

129
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,340
We've been left alone!

130
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,290
This time I'm getting raped for sure!

131
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,230
Just how have things turned out this way...?

132
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,360
I just... wanted to become a comedian
since when I was a kid...

133
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,760
And even though I traveled all the way to Tokyo,
only dreaming to become a comedian...

134
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,200
Why...

135
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,030
Why do I have to be raped by this middle-aged man
around his fifties...?

136
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,860
Just what have I done to deserve this?

137
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,800
Your lunch looked tasty!

138
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,460
It was

139
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,960
You seem to have lost some weight

140
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,330
Maybe a bit

141
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,960
I'm going first
Okay

142
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,560
I see...

143
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,740
He just planned to tease me until now

144
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,230
So he can rape me later all at once...

145
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,600
There's no doubt...

146
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,100
This man is for real!

147
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,000
What the hell should I do...?

148
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,260
Everyone moves towards the location with the rocket bus

149
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,530
Hey, can I seat next to the window?

150
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,100
Sure...

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,630
Sorry

152
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,000
No probs

153
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,500
Crap, I'm getting raped!

154
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,600
Survived... again

155
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,730
But one more time, he sat next to me...

156
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,960
I can't let my guard down even as we're traveling...

157
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,070
Hey are there any of those ice creams?

158
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,900
Can I have one?

159
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,900
Thanks

160
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,860
It's been a while since the last one I had

161
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,860
How is it?

162
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,660
Delicious

163
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,360
For real?
Yeah

164
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,360
Can I have it too please?

165
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,900
Is it sweet, right?

166
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,330
Yup

167
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,670
It's good

168
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,460
Told ya

169
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,400
First off

170
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,600
Lick the tip...

171
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,630
And then...

172
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,760
Lick its back...

173
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,000
Then suck it daringly...

174
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,900
Oh-- this is...

175
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,730
Isn't this the "vacuum"?

176
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,500
I just heard rumors about it

177
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,030
But this is without a doubt an outrageous vacuum!

178
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,460
Eat up, Endo

179
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
Huh?

180
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,430
Does Hamada want me to perform a vacuum too?

181
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,200
Oh, thanks, I'm fine

182
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,800
I just had my lunch before, so...

183
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,670
Don't want it?
I'm fine

184
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,130
But it's sweet, it's good

185
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,200
Yeah but I'm fine

186
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,130
You sure?
Yup

187
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,270
That was close...

188
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,830
Huh!?

189
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,230
He's having a boner!

190
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,600
Sorry, Endo...

191
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,150
Yes?

192
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,800
Remember we talked about having a lunch together?

193
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,400
Lunch?
Yeah

194
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,700
You talked about it... lunch

195
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,500
Is Yamazaki attempting to lay his hands on me too?

196
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,930
That's why he was having that boner before!

197
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,630
In other words, Yamazaki is taking advantage of Hamada...

198
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,300
So he could steal me from him!

199
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,660
I have lots of things to do, I have to refuse the offer

200
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,660
O-oh yeah?
Mh-mh

201
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,710
What?

202
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,310
He has no intention on laying his hands on me?

203
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,910
I'm sorry
No, no, it's okay

204
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,800
Next time I think it'll be okay though...

205
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,800
What?!

206
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,400
Why is Matsumoto staring at me!?

207
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,360
It'll be fine later I guess

208
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,830
Ok, i-it's completely fine to me

209
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,720
Good

210
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,720
I see, so that's it!

211
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,780
Yamazaki wanted to be looked at while he was talking to me...

212
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,650
So he could try to get Matsumoto jealous of him!

213
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:57,560
In other words, the one Yamazaki wants
to lay his hands on is Matsumoto!

214
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:58,930
Well

215
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,830
I'll make you a call

216
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,730
Ok!

217
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:07,980
Shit... Gaki no tsukai is a den of crazy lustful men...

218
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,500
Are you fuckin' kidding me?!

219
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,900
He just came here in a situation where my  privates
are completely exposed and defenseless

220
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,060
Isn't this situation screaming "rape me as much
as you want!" from everywhere?!

221
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,860
What the hell are they planning to do right now?

222
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,810
Are they both trying to abuse me at once?

223
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,260
Shit!

224
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,530
I never expected them to make a team play against me!

225
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,030
Oh crap, he's coming!

226
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,230
I'm guessing that first Matsumoto will do me from behind...

227
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,530
And then...

228
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,180
There's no doubt that Hamada will come from the front!

229
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,930
How long is that taking you? Come on!

230
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,300
I've been spared...

231
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,460
But can I manage

232
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:22,130
To get through the recording we're going to have now?

233
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,660
Four... three... two...

234
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,800
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

235
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,260
Team Gaki vs Team Minami Asagaya Shop District

236
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,700
Grass-lot baseball battle!!

237
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,960
Now, now

238
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,180
This is about to get started!  Yeah, you know

239
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:45,450
Grass-lot baseball battle!!
Everyone from the Minami Asagaya Shop District
will compete in a decisive grass-lot baseball match

240
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,060
Since it got so warm lately we had to give this a try

241
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,860
So, a baseball match

242
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,160
I'm positive if we pour our souls in this match something may happen! - So?

243
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,900
To be honest I didn't want THIS to happen...

244
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,300
Heipo

245
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,700
His existence alone is an event

246
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,600
What are you doing here?

247
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,160
I can do this, I'm fine!

248
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,100
That group of amateurs there from this area

249
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,050
Has told me that you were running with them before

250
00:10:59,050 --> 00:10:59,690
I was running!

251
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,690
Sure you were!

252
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,360
Ok, moving on!
Right, right

253
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,600
I present you the team we're battling against today!
Oh, great!

254
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,460
Here are the members of the
Minami Asagaya Shopping District!

255
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:17,280
Asagaya Shopping District Team Members

256
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,600
Who are they?

257
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,400
For real...

258
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,000
They look strong!

259
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,200
Let's have a nice match!!

260
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,430
Who are these guys?!

261
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,430
Our opponents

262
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,330
Do they have some sort of relation with us?

263
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,830
Nah, nothing like that
No, actually

264
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,700
The hell is up with that handsome guy?

265
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,260
He's really handsome...

266
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,260
...! And that means...

267
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,000
As I thought...

268
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,030
By the influence of that handsome man

269
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,330
There's a chance that Hamada's lust
could spring up all at once..!

270
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,500
Let's have fun!
Let's have a nice match!

271
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Yama-chan!

272
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,230
Please throw a huge one, a huge one!

273
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,800
"A huge one" he said...
Is he talking about that..?

274
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,600
Crap!

275
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,400
I was right, the influence of that handsome man

276
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,360
Hamada's lust is on the verge of exploding!

277
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,930
Strike!

278
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,000
Come on, Yama-chan

279
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,960
Look closely to those balls! Look at their curves!

280
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,960
Balls? Curves?

281
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,130
Goddamn, that batter was just standing erect...

282
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,660
Standing erect?

283
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,120
He said it because he's having an erection right now?

284
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,830
Tanaka please, will you switch your place with mine?

285
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,760
I can't see much from here
Oh, sure

286
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,130
Ok, come on guys!

287
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,630
Now I see... That's how things went...

288
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,660
Seems like Tanaka was already sodomized by Hamada...

289
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,400
He's just pretending not to see his partner's pinch

290
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,200
So Hamada won't threaten to abuse him again, uh...

291
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,560
Just who can I really trust in here?

292
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,560
Ok, who's next?

293
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,630
Who's next?

294
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh, it's me, it's me

295
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,260
Come on!!

296
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,660
I'm ready!
Give it your best!

297
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,830
Go and kick 'em!

298
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,300
Hey, that thing is doing is surely erotic!

299
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,800
To have such an erotic conduct with his partner...

300
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,260
Is literally anyone good for this man?

301
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,000
Ok!

302
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,500
Go!

303
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Yeah!
Go and get 'em! Come on!

304
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,930
It's okay!
Don't worry about it!

305
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,430
It's not going so well

306
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,830
Bring it!

307
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,000
Huh?

308
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,600
The handsome guy is protecting the first base

309
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,350
I have a bad feeling about this...

310
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,350
Show me what you got!

311
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,030
He got it!

312
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,500
Go! Go!
Come on!
It's good!

313
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,600
The hell is he doing?

314
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,630
He's really the worst!

315
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,830
Wait, wait, what the hell just happened!?

316
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:25,090
Wasn't this a clearly premeditated crime
driven by his lustful desires?!

317
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,600
By now that man

318
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,950
Is merely a pervert

319
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,430
Team Gaki

320
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,430
Team Minami
Asagaya
Shop District

321
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,160
Let's end this!
Let's do it!

322
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,030
By saying this...

323
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:43,000
*Hamada said "shimatte iku" (let's end this), Endo understands  "shimeru" instead
of "shimaru". "Shimeru" means "to tie something up", and he literally says
"By tying something up... is he talking about that place..?"

324
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,560
He means to do it on my private parts?

325
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,360
Woah, what the hell!

326
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,200
Is he planning to stick that catcher mitt up my butt?

327
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,300
Come on, Endo

328
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,800
You're being swallowed up by the other team's atmosphere!

329
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,030
Eh?

330
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,030
"Swallowed" what?

331
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,030
Come on

332
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,930
The strength of your shoulders... pull it out!

333
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,960
"Pull it out"?

334
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,260
Right here?

335
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,560
You know, it's that

336
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,250
You're the only one with experience here

337
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,780
Do you want to make this become vain?

338
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:25,600
*Hamada said "tengu ni naru", which could mean lots of things. Hamada meant it
to be "to get stuck", "to become vain", but Endo goes with its other meaning
"to get swollen".

339
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,530
"Get swollen"?!

340
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,600
What the hell, this man

341
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,230
Came all the way here on the mound

342
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,430
Just to spit erotic words right on my face?

343
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,100
Anyway

344
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,130
Let's win against them

345
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,300
Got it?

346
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,360
I'm counting on you

347
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,400
He totally tried to stick his finger up my butt just now

348
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,360
Maybe to Hamada the insertion of a finger

349
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,300
Has the same feeling of a french kiss?

350
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,780
Hmm? What is that sign?

351
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,930
One time...

352
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,930
Two times...

353
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,560
...Three times

354
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,300
Is this man planning on raping me three times?

355
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,160
Shit, someone..!

356
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,530
Someone help me!

357
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,030
That guy is no good...

358
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,900
He completely became a human on Hamada's side

359
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,130
The hell is up with that face?

360
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,230
Could it be..!?

361
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,600
Yeah, there's no doubt!

362
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,100
Matsumoto is jealous of Yamazaki!

363
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,340
Gaki no tsukai's situation is sinking in mud!

364
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:31,080
Shit! I don't care anymore!

365
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,930
Hey, hey!

366
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,800
Hey, hey, calm down, calm down!

367
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,230
Shit, Hamada is coming!

368
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,160
Hamada is coming along!

369
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,530
Is he planning to take advance of this tumoil
I'm shrouded in and abuse me?

370
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,470
Somebody, stop Hamada!

371
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,650
Calm down, calm down!

372
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,030
Let's stop this right now!

373
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,930
Everything's fine, everything's fine

374
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,790
Getting raped by him... is just a matter of time

375
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:20,560
I'm sure tomorrow I'll love you even more than today♪

376
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,660
'Cause I can't stop my overflowing thoughts for you♪

377
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:31,260
And even though I love you this much right now♪

378
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,930
I can't simply put that into words♪

379
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,260
Who's next?

380
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:37,860
Here!

381
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,260
Oh, Endo

382
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:39,830
Counting on you

383
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,330
I'm going!

384
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,460
Settle it in a single blow!

385
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,360
We're counting on you!

386
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,600
Go Endo!

387
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,830
"A single blow"?

388
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,100
Did he came here just to say those indecent words to me?

389
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,360
Come on!

390
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,860
Alright!!
Great!!

391
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,530
Good, good!

392
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,860
Go run around! Around! Around! Around!

393
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,760
Around!

394
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,800
Sigh...

395
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,430
Am I going to get #"%&@d after this...

396
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,930
Almost there, come on!

397
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:17,800
Alright!!

398
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,400
Ok ok!

399
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,330
Ugh... that smiling face is because he's about to #"%&@ me...

400
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,730
Uh?! Isn't anyone actually planning to #"%&@ me?

401
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,360
Not only Hamada, everybody is seeking for my body...

402
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,630
Tanaka...

403
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,800
Yamazaki...

404
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Matsumoto...

405
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,030
And even Yoshinobu...

406
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,900
I think I'm about

407
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,930
To get crazy!

408
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:58,960
Ok, if I manage to get through this handsome guy
The match will end without me getting molested...

409
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,930
Is everything ok?

410
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,200
Hey, are you ok?

411
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,830
Toss me the spray!

412
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,330
Are you okay?

413
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,600
You ok?

414
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,060
Yes

415
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,160
Looks like he's fine

416
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,680
Huh? What is this sensation...?

417
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,360
Why do I feel so irritated?

418
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,570
Am I perhaps... feeling jealous?

419
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,130
You ok?

420
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:33,630
Yes

421
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,430
Looks like he's fine

422
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,230
C-come on, he said he's fine, let's keep going

423
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,400
T-there's not much time left, come on!

424
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,700
Why are you acting like a total dick?

425
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,900
So, let's resume, shall we?

426
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,700
Ok
Let's go

427
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,330
Sorry for that

428
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,500
Sorry!

429
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,260
I'm sorry!

430
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,930
Just... what the hell happened to me?

431
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,060
Okay!

432
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,800
Your turn, Jack!

433
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,600
Come on Jack!!

434
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,400
Show 'em what you got!
Come on!
You can do it!

435
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:22,030
Huh? It feels like... is getting hotter in my nether region...

436
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:26,570
What the hell is happening inside me?

437
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,760
Strike!

438
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,260
Bravo!
Go Endo!

439
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,700
Come on Endo, almost there!

440
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,860
Strike two!

441
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,260
Good, go for it!

442
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,330
Strike three!

443
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,860
In this very moment I've finally realized it

444
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,240
The reason why I'm here

445
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,400
And my authentic feelings I hold for this man...

446
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,700
Let's start saying that getting to know Hamada

447
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,360
Was something I couldn't even dare to dream about

448
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,400
When I was living my high school period

449
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,930
On that melancholic springtime of my life

450
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,800
Hamada suddenly appeared on my cathode-ray tube

451
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,760
And then I was overwhelmed by the impact
that tsukkomi made to me

452
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:34,760
And decided to aim to become a comedian
so I could become a tsukkomi as great as Hamada

453
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,700
How many time has passed since then?

454
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,300
If I think about it, I'm now taking part
with Hamada on the same shows

455
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:49,730
I feel like I'm forgetting those feelings
of admiration I had for Hamada...

456
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:53,500
But now I finally remembered them

457
00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:00,530
All my feelings of gratitude to Hamada,
who lighted a single ray of light in my life

458
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,130
And

459
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,200
This sensation I thought was "admiration"

460
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,360
I just realized is affection

461
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,830
So, Hamada...

462
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,960
I can finally say this:

463
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,600
I... love... you...

464
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
I... love... you...

465
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,330
I... love... you...

466
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,700
The hell are you doin'?

467
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,130
Quit it, geez

468
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,130
The fuck's wrong with you?
Stop it

469
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,360
That's creepy
Ohh

470
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,430
Everyone, protect!

471
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,360
What are you looking at?

472
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Dude...
Come on
Endo!!  - What are you doing?

473
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,130
Maybe it'll be better if you don't come with us today

474
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,330
Woah, he looked at me again!

475
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,000
Guys..?

476
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Why are you being such %&£#§@ to me?

477
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,730
Are you idiot?
Come on, let's get along!

478
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,450
Come on, let's have fun together again!

479
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,060
Ain't happening!

480
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,430
Like this...

481
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,000
Rotate
Ok

482
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,260
Don't laugh!

483
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,260
What the hell, dude! Come on!

484
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,300
As soon as you go there

485
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,800
You'll be surprised and be like "Matsumoto
is going to abuse me from behind!"

486
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,260
And then "There's no doubt that
Hamada will come from the front!"

487
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:16,800
That's what I was thinking

488
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,230
Ok, this one's good!

489
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,430
I'm laughing a bit too

490
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,800
It's hard to endure it

491
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,900
But yeah, it's like the tenth time

492
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,030
Pretty crazy, but we can do it

493
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,430
I guess so

494
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,800
ENDO OUT!
No way!

495
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,070
Your face just now was totally "ENDO OUT"!

496
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,660
For real?!

497
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,830
Now Matsumoto-san will try to make an impression of me
Really? - Yeah

498
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,500
Three... two...

499
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,400
[impersonating Yamazaki]  Come on, you're real-

500
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,030
What the hell!
What was that?

501
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,960
He just

502
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,960
He just said he was mimicking me

503
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:09,880
I couldn't cut away this part lol

504
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:09,880
Just pretend you're not seeing this
