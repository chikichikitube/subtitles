00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
(Editor's Note: After some research, I found that "Dondake" can actually mean "how much?!", "how many?!" or "'til when?!"; It can also be used as onomatopoeia)

Thanks For Watching!

3
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,190
Jokes in general

4
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,520
have been changing lately, right?

5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,890
They sure have been changing.
Of course.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,660
Nowadays people are more sensitive,

7
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,830
and many want more seriousness.

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,400
Hello there!

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,100
— Mikitty!
— How much?!

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,170
Chance is pretty bad news.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,440
Yes, it is.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,210
This is bad!

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,110
In that sense, this show is

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,150
some kind of resistence.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,550
For real?!

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,790
If you think I'm lying,

17
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,060
just take a look at Sandwichman's offer,

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,660
at least once.

19
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,990
I don't think he'll show up ever again.

20
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,090
That makes sense.

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,360
I wouldn't go on this show either, to be honest.

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,860
You can't do this, Fujimoto.

23
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,030
I can!

24
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,170
— Mikitty!
— How much?!

25
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,740
— Mikitty, Mikitty!
— Shoulder throw!

26
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,450
— Mikitty!
— How much?!

27
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,520
— Mikitty!
— How much?!

28
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,090
All things considered,
you just get a yellow for now.

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,630
This is a yellow!

30
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,630
Alright!
Now we're getting into it!

31
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,160
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

32
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,070
With this, huh?

33
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,940
— It's getting tighter.
— What was that?

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,640
No one should laugh at something like this.

35
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,450
Alright, here we go.

36
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,990
What were you trying to do, Fujita?

37
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,520
Well, getting ready...

38
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,820
I was thinking of getting ready for dinner.

39
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,690
—Wanna give something a try?
—Ah? Sure.

40
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,830
Sure, something. Alright.

41
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,130
Ah, that's right. You're older than Kobayashi, right?

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,860
He's older.
When I met him he was a few years above me

43
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,170
Kobayashi, you...

44
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,570
How annoying.

45
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,700
We're in the same generation.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,240
Yeah, I know.
But I thought he was in my same generation, too.

47
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,870
Sorry to bother you.
Everyone.

48
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,780
Ah, something's here.

49
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,640
—Woah, awesome!
—This much just for dinner?

50
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,010
Who's eating?

51
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,680
That's right.
I'm getting hungry.

52
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,750
It's a full banquet.

53
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,480
Your sideburns are...
Pretty interesting today.

54
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,790
—This?
—Yeah.

55
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,390
I just admire someone and...

56
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,620
Who is it?

57
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,830
This American guy from a soap opera.

58
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,030
I saw him and I thought he looked awesome.

59
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,100
—Who is it?
—He's...

60
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,260
You might not know him.
Well...

61
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,430
Does anyone here watch "The Walking Dead"?

62
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,570
I do.

63
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,100
It's Eugene.

64
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,400
Eugene? I know him.

65
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,870
Do you want me to show you?

66
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,340
No, I'm fine.

67
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,040
I just really like Eugene.

68
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,550
Marutai Ramen!

69
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,980
That's the best one!

70
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,580
Can we prepare that?

71
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,380
Prepare? It's already pre-made.

72
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,550
What's the soup?
Prepare? It's already pre-made.

73
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,520
This is pork rib.

74
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,390
—You brought that?
—Yeah.

75
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,760
Directly from the pig?

76
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,930
Not directly, it was kind of pre-made.

77
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,500
Marutai ramen sure is great.

78
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,130
It's delicious.
Marutai ramen sure is great.

79
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:27,200
It's delicious.

80
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,700
My dad used to eat it all the time.
It's delicious.

81
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,770
For lunch on Sundays.

82
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,070
How do you use this?
How did you do it?

83
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,470
Fujimoto-san's dad was attacked—

84
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,640
attacked by some thugs and got killed, right?

85
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,280
Why don't you just put it on the screen?

86
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,480
Please do it!

87
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,050
—Am I wrong?
—What's this?

88
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,480
We're doing a quiz.

89
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,910
A quiz.

90
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,350
—Fine.
—Who's taking the quiz?

91
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,920
Until the ramen's done.

92
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,420
—This right here?
—Yeah.

93
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,490
That guy looks pretty old.

94
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,460
—Ah because of his neck?
—Yeah.

95
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,730
Really? He's not that wrinkled.

96
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,430
Isn't that Sanma-san?

97
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,270
I'd say he's young because of the clothes.

98
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,440
You're close. He might be around that age.

99
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,910
Isn't it Bannai-san?

100
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,610
Who is that?

101
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,910
Ah, looking at it now!

102
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,610
—What's that?
—His jawline is...

103
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,350
It's like squarish.

104
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,580
Isn't it...

105
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,720
Isn't it Makoto-san from Sharam Q? (EN: Jp Rock Band)

106
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,350
He's— He's older than that.

107
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,090
Taisei from Sharam Q.

108
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,560
—Taisei-san?
—It's not Taisei.

109
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,860
Hatake-san.

110
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,360
He's not from Sharam Q.

111
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,830
He's not linked to Sharam Q.

112
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,530
Nanbara-san?

113
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Yes.

114
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,400
—Nanbara-san.
—Nanbara?

115
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,740
—Kiyotaka-san?
—No.

116
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,540
Sugiyama Kiyotaka?

117
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,870
He doesn't have anything to do with Kiyotaka.

118
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,610
Nanbara bang bang bang!

119
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,740
Huh?

120
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,250
I think your taste is a little off.

121
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,910
I was just wrong.

122
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,450
Too hard?

123
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,550
It's a shame.

124
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,050
This is Seko-san.

125
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,220
The former SB.

126
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,560
Woah, no way!

127
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,660
Seko the marathon runner.

128
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,990
No way.

129
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,890
Who's this?

130
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,260
We already saw him.

131
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,000
That's a sweet potato?

132
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,930
Even if you scroll down...

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,230
Even if you scroll down...

134
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,600
Why don't you turn around just once?

135
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,610
I think we might be in trouble here.

136
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,120
It can get pretty hard depending on the person.

137
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,550
Here we go. One, two... three!

138
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,920
Girolamo?

139
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,990
Me!

140
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,590
That's Koba-san!

141
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,690
He looks like Koba-san!

142
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,290
Girolamo?

143
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,990
—He looks like me? But still...
—He's a lot like Koba-san!

144
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,530
But the teeth are too pretty!

145
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,730
He's kind of...
Look at his wrinkles.

146
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,700
—Yeah.
—That's Shimizu Kentaro-san?

147
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,970
The beard is kind of...!

148
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,200
Kiyohara?

149
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,440
It's not Kiyohara-san.

150
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,640
—Little Kiyohara.
—Edamame-san?

151
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,010
Tsumami Edamame-san has this white beard too, right?

152
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,010
But I can tell you he's kind of related to Koba-san.

153
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,850
Related to Koba-san?

154
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,850
He looks quite older.

155
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,220
What's his connection to Kobayashi?
Maybe Choshu Riki-san? (EN: Jp Wrestler)

156
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,390
Correct!

157
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,460
His jaw is pretty clean!

158
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,890
That's a good expression!

159
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,030
He has great teeth!

160
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,530
Really great teeth!

161
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,130
When he goes all "I'm not pissed!"

162
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,700
You know he's never said that?

163
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,670
Yeah, Choshu Riki-san has never said it.

164
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,740
Then what does he say?

165
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,640
"I ain't pissed at all."

166
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,210
That happens sometimes.
For instance in Sazae-san,

167
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,040
wait, no, not Sazae-san.
That character, Hoshi Hyuuma...

168
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,980
...he's actually never flipped a coffee table.

169
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,680
For real?

170
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,680
—But there's this opening—
—Ah yeah, that happened once.

171
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,080
What about Sazae-san?

172
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,090
In Sazae-san, whenever Namihei gets scolded,

173
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,020
they almost never say "you dum-dum!"

174
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,190
But that "you dum-dum" isn't as famous.

175
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,560
Same thing goes for "adultery is culture."

176
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,460
He doesn't say that, right?

177
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah, not really.

178
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,300
But I think Iketani from Joyman

179
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,170
has always said "what's with this guy"
as his catchphrase.

180
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,200
He has, yeah.
"What's with this guy?"

181
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,370
That's all he says.
Every time.

182
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,940
He gets the "what's with this guy?" medal.

183
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,140
It's fine.

184
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,040
"What's with this guy?!"

185
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,110
"What's with this guy?!"

186
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,210
You spit on me. Gross.

187
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,590
"What's with this guy?!"

188
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,320
—Now Mikitty.
—Mikitty!

189
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,790
"What's with this guy?!"

190
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,290
Mikitty.

191
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,600
Mikitty!

192
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,530
-What?
-Junior... Junior.

193
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,630
-What's wrong?
-Who? -What? -Where?
-What?
-Junior... Junior.

194
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,730
-What's wrong?
-Who? -What? -Where?

195
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,400
—What?
—"What's with this guy?!"

196
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,040
—Who?
—What?

197
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,110
Mikitty!

198
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,940
I am so very sorry!!

199
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,250
What? What?

200
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,750
What's with this vest?!

201
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,090
What's he doing?

202
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,290
I gathered the world's colors.

203
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,760
—Asahi Kasei?
—Yes. Asahi Kasei. (EN: Jp Chemical Company)

204
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,460
That's what the world's colors look like?

205
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,000
The world's colors?

206
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,400
Yes!
I had Saturday Night Live in mind.

207
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,200
How so?

208
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,770
Okay, I'll try to make that sound.

209
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,070
The sound.

210
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,240
—Sound?
—I'm going to imitate it.

211
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,080
—A vocal impression?
—Yes!

212
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,910
Okay, um...

213
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,320
I'm going to make the sound of an owl,

214
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,520
while making the face of an iriomote cat.

215
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,390
Okay, everyone take a look.

216
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,420
Yes. I'm making the sound of an owl,

217
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,760
while making the face of an iriomote cat.

218
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,570
Whoa...
That's incredible.

219
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:33,770
No way.

220
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,570
Now it's a cuckoo clock.
No way.

221
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,200
Now it's a cuckoo clock.

222
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,570
He's great!

223
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,750
I can do one more.

224
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,980
I'm going to do the sound of Itsuki Hiroshi-san, (EN: Jp Singer)

225
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,550
when he does the sound of a Formula 1 car.

226
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,780
He's great.

227
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,950
Seiji, are you looking?
You weren't looking!

228
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,250
—I'm looking, I'm looking.
—Do it for Seiji!

229
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,090
I was looking.
I saw the end.

230
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,660
—Do it in front of him.
—Take a good look, Seiji.

231
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,410
This is Kondo Masahiko from the pit.
Chihara Seiji-san! (EN: Kondo is a Jp Singer and former Racing Driver)

232
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,610
Schumacher is the clear favorite this year! (EN: British Racing Driver)

233
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,780
He's using the EF43 engine this year.

234
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,950
This way, this way.

235
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,940
Junior, come on!

236
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,010
You suck at this!

237
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,980
That was too stupid!

238
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,180
It was hilarious.

239
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,620
What was with that pop?!

240
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,350
That was the faintest grin!

241
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,520
It was too bad.

242
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,920
That damned pop!

243
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,660
It was faint but you were smiling!

244
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,430
It was hilarious.

245
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,600
Okay, that was obviously Junior.

246
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,630
But I want to look at someone else.

247
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,170
We can leave that for later.

248
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,000
Let's look at Junior first.

249
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,380
This way, this way.

250
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,180
—There's nothing to say.
—Yeah, I think there's nothing to say.

251
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,720
He even laughed a little.

252
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,900
Yeah, he even laughed.

253
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,900
You ended up reacting to that?

254
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,870
You lost at a damned pop?

255
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,640
There's also...
The brothers, you see.

256
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,900
I saw Seiji.

257
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,240
Let's take a look.

258
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,010
I'm pretty sure Seiji was smiling too.

259
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,280
I didn't see Seiji at all.

260
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,120
You smiled?!

261
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,820
I'm in the clear!

262
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,660
You were smiling!

263
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,660
Don't tell me you believe this bullshit!

264
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,990
You're just trying to save yourselves!

265
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,770
You were definitely smiling!

266
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,740
So all things considered...
Junior gets an orange!

267
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,740
Too quick!

268
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,640
And Seiji gets...

269
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:06,050
That's too strict!

270
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,120
So of course, those points right now go to Chance.

271
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,390
Thank you very much

272
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,220
—He got a lot right now.
—He got two points...

273
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,760
He got two points, yeah.

274
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,660
So uh...

275
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,030
To make sure you don't get away with the e-cigs,

276
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,830
if you overdo it, I'm taking them from you.

277
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,330
That's too much!

278
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,470
We have to watch out.

279
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,400
This is too much!

280
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,340
—Alright, alright!
—Let's laugh before the bell rings.

281
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,290
It grew too much.

282
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,320
Ah that's right!

283
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,030
You made that yourself?

284
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,330
Sorry, I ended up laughing.

285
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,730
—Don't worry about it.
—Sorry.

286
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,300
—You don't add any condiments?
—No egg?

287
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,530
It's just regular plain.

288
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,370
There are like three full plates in here.

289
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,340
You can eat all that?

290
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,870
That's Marutai Ramen.

291
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,040
But don't you like...
gain any weight with that?

292
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,310
But I guess thin people can eat something like that.

293
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,750
I get it, I get it, I get it! (EN: Fujimoto's comedy duo partner's gag)

294
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,250
You suck at this!

295
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,120
Look at his bones...

296
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,520
You really suck at this!

297
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,590
How is it?

298
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,960
Delicious!

299
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,630
I get it, I get it, I get it!

300
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,100
You can complain, you know Fujimoto?

301
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,800
This is your partner...

302
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,240
That was Haranishi-san, right?

303
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,310
Yeah.

304
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,210
You don't know him?

305
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,510
No, I didn't get to see you right now.

306
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,550
Can you do it again?

307
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,950
I get it, I get it, I get it!

308
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,550
You really should complain if you want to, Fujimoto-san!
That's your partner!

309
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,620
Why don't you tell him?

310
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,790
Seiji looks like he's about to laugh!

311
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,860
Look...

312
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,690
Fujimoto-san could do it.

313
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,590
And then he twists his hands, like that.

314
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,200
He's not moving.
He doesn't say anything!

315
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,370
Do it!

316
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,810
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it!

317
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,840
He's overdoing it.

318
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,310
That's one time too many.

319
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,850
So uh...

320
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,580
—You don't move right there.
—It has to feel compact.

321
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,220
This is the part that's important.

322
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,220
Look? Here. It doesn't change. See?

323
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,220
—It won't work if you don't do this.
—Ah, I see!

324
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,290
You reject it, like this.

325
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,460
You're doing it wrong, Junior-san?

326
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,560
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.

327
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,790
Like that.

328
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,560
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.

329
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,870
You stop at the end.

330
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,600
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.

331
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,200
Your direction is wrong, Junior-san.

332
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,270
The direction's wrong.

333
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,710
It's pretty wrong.

334
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,840
You have to do this.

335
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,780
—It's good?
—It's great!

336
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,650
That's hard.

337
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,420
They reject like this...

338
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,850
Try doing just that at first.

339
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,820
Ah, that right there!

340
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,490
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it!

341
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,730
What the hell are you doing?!

342
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
You sure get along.

343
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,140
Being from the same generation must be fun.

344
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,140
Fujimon is worse than I expected.

345
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,880
I guess only the partner can get the gags right.

346
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,480
That means Fujimoto can get all of Haranishi-san's right?

347
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,550
He can.

348
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,650
Can you do that knee thing, too?

349
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,990
I wonder about his coordination.

350
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,990
—You go like this.
—There he goes!

351
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,460
Can you do it, Junior-san?

352
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,840
—That's gross.
—That's awful.

353
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,340
That looks like a hermit crab.

354
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,370
He's a stick insect.

355
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,710
—Stop it!
—Stop what?

356
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,180
Stop playing dumb.
I'm telling you to stop.

357
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,750
Why? Everyone from the same generation can do it.

358
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,580
That's right.

359
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,620
Do that rai rai thing.

360
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,730
This sucks.

361
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,660
This is too awful.

362
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,500
Even considering he can't do it, it's awful.

363
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,270
The Chiharas don't have any coordination. That's it.

364
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,870
—Chance.
—Yeah?

365
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,070
Were you ever on "Gokigenyo"? (EN: Guest-based Jp TV Show)

366
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,840
No, no, no.
No way.

367
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,150
I'd be filthy rich if I had.

368
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,980
Pretend you did, pretend you did.

369
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,220
Alright, go it.

370
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,850
Okay, please start, Chance Oshiro.

371
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,420
I wonder what we're getting.

372
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,030
Okay!

373
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,460
Love stories!

374
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,730
Love stories!!

375
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:55,400
Um... I'm...
When I was 23, I left Tokyo,

376
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,940
and without knowing anyone,

377
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,570
I worked in a convenience store in East Nakano's Yamate road.

378
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,380
I had the night shift,

379
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,180
and then around 3 in the morning,

380
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,150
the same woman with a pretty face would stop by.

381
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,750
And so, well...

382
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,050
I kind of fell in love at first sight,
and since she always stopped by,

383
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,220
I always thought she was so beautiful.

384
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,460
And she always bought some highlight cigarettes.

385
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,460
And so, since I knew she wanted highlights,
whenever she stopped by,

386
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,100
I would take out the highlights before she asked for them.

387
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,430
And so that pretty woman was like...

388
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,000
Always...

389
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,340
"Oh you remembered what cigarettes I like!"

390
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,110
"Thank you very much."

391
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,180
She would look at my nametag and go
"That's Oshiro-san, right?"

392
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,110
"Yes, thank you very much."

393
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,620
So then, my shift leader

394
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,980
asked the pretty woman

395
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,850
if she wanted to hang out with us sometime.

396
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,560
And she was like
"Sure. I'm a little busy right now, but around August I could stop by."

397
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,660
She was like "okay, let's do a double date."

398
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,090
I could just think that I was super happy.

399
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,660
And so, that woman would always come at around 3am, right?

400
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,270
"I'm going to be singing live on TV

401
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,370
at around 4am today." she said.

402
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
So I was like "Oh so she was a musician?"

403
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,110
"Really? I can't see it, though."

404
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,340
Since we didn't have a TV at the store.

405
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,480
She said "Oh so I'll bring you a tape or something next time."

406
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,210
"Thank you very much" I said.
"Right, I'm sorry!"

407
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,280
"You haven't told me your name yet!"

408
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,290
"What's your name?"

409
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,260
"I'm Sheena Ringo" she said.

410
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,760
I didn't know her back then, of course.

411
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,360
So, eventually, I got fired from there.

412
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,670
And Sheena Ringo-san kept becoming more and more popular.

413
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,700
So eventually Tamaki Pinch-san took me to this uh...

414
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,740
sexual service called "Sheena Ingo" in Kabukicho.

415
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,040
The girl was actually named Sheena Mikan-chan.

416
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,910
So uh...

417
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,920
And so there was a Sheena Ringo track playing on the radio.

418
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,120
And there I was thinking that the girl I loved was so successful.

419
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,920
"What the hell am I doing here?!"

420
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,360
"What the hell am I doing here?!"

421
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,660
"Meanwhile Ringo-san keeps selling more and more!"

422
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,190
"What the hell am I doing here?!"

423
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,460
I kept thinking over and over.

424
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,370
And meanwhile Sheena Mikan-chan just said.
"Wanna do a sixty-nine?"

425
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,640
Seiji, it can't be helped here.

426
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,180
No, that was you.

427
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,850
It was a great story.

428
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,350
—Was that true?
—Yeah.

429
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,890
—Incredible.
—For real.

430
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
It was just a good story.

431
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,730
You even said there was a song playing, right?

432
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,160
Was that true?

433
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,860
That was a good story, right?

434
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,200
Okay, so.
It was the one that goes "In the morning near Yamate road"

435
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,000
"I touch my cheek in Yamate road."

436
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,570
That one!

437
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,340
That song is definitely about me.

438
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,470
—No way.
—I came to buy a cigarette.

439
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,840
"You open the cigarette box"
In Yamate road.

440
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,180
And there was some Pinch guy that appeared at some point?
Who was that?

441
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,280
Tamaki Pinchi-san, right! He's an upperclass guy.

442
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,850
I don't care.

443
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,520
So who was it...? Who laughed?

444
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,820
Ah, it was Seiji.

445
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,090
—I knew it!
—It was terrible.

446
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:09,300
He contorted his face,
and held it in for quite a while.

447
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,870
Well, let's just take a look.

448
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,840
So eventually Tamaki Pinch-san took me to this uh...

449
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,970
sexual service called "Sheena Ingo" in Kabukicho.

450
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,780
Come on...

451
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,680
—See?
—There he goes.

452
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,650
He's beet red already.

453
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,520
And so there was a Sheena Ringo track playing on the radio.

454
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,120
And there I was thinking that the girl I loved was so successful.

455
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,090
"What the hell am I doing here?!"

456
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,490
"What the hell am I doing here?!"

457
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,860
"Meanwhile Ringo-san keeps selling more and more!"

458
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,360
"What the hell am I doing here?!"

459
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,600
I kept thinking over and over.

460
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,500
And meanwhile Sheena Mikan-chan just said.
"Wanna do a sixty-nine?"

461
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,710
He's eating ramen again.

462
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,170
—Seiji is doing horribly.
—That was pretty bad, Seiji.

463
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,280
Your face looked like Ebizo's glare.

464
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,780
You managed to hold it in, though!

465
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,080
I wasn't smiling. Not at all.

466
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,650
No good, at all.

467
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,020
The Chihara brothers get an orange.

468
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,420
We're not even an hour through.

469
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,950
The point goes to Chance Oshiro.

470
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,960
Guess you'll have to plan things over
in the zombie room.

471
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,490
You can't do that.

472
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,100
So I partnered with Tamaki Pinch-san,
and became Chance.

473
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,700
So you were Pinch and Chance?

474
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,010
That's how it was?

475
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,640
Alright, here we go!

476
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,340
Wasn't that with Okawa Kogyou?

477
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,010
There we go, there we go.

478
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,750
With Okawa Kogyou?

479
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,250
—There he goes eating.
—For real!

480
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,720
Those are three dishes!

481
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,490
Tamaki Pinch Chance?

482
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,260
We were Tamaki Pinch and Chance Oshiro.

483
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,590
What was the group's name?

484
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,060
Right hearts 800.

485
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,360
Right hearts 800?

486
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,000
I was the right heart.

487
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,470
Ah, that's right.

488
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,900
Because the heart's in the right?

489
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,170
—Really?
—Yeah.

490
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,970
So, Tamaki Pinch's name came from

491
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,510
him being a national 800m champion.

492
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,840
The heart's in the right?

493
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,310
So you became Right hearts 800.

494
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,880
Right hearts 800.

495
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,450
—That's a great name.
—You did manzai?

496
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,150
Yeah, manzai.

497
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,320
Where's the punchline?

498
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,420
No way.

499
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,920
What are you doing, Fujita?

500
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,590
I'm preparing one more dish.

501
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,190
—I can still eat
—For real?!

502
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,430
I can eat until I'm full.

503
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,360
—No way.
—It's too good.

504
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,430
Marutai is delicious.

505
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,330
Um... uh... well...

506
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,340
So Tamaki Pinch was—

507
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,140
I really don't care.

508
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,810
Why are you looking at me?

509
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,910
Let's get along come on.
We're from the same generation.

510
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,850
I can't hear you at all.

511
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,280
So what kind of jokes were Pinch's specialty?

512
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,750
Why are you running away?
So what kind of jokes were Pinch's specialty?

513
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,690
Junior. Why are you running away?
Let's get along!

514
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,990
You know Purupuru perorinpa?

515
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,120
I think you could...

516
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,190
You know Purupuru perorinpa?

517
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,360
Purupuru perorinpa?

518
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,400
What am I supposed to say after Purupuru perorinpa?

519
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,230
Purupuru perorinpa is just...

520
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,840
—What's he doing?
—That's the crab.

521
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:07,410
—The crab! crab crab!
—What's that supposed to mean? (EN: Another one of Haranishi's Gag's)

522
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,350
Crab crab crab!
From crab to xavier!

523
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,120
How the hell do you do it?
How the hell do you do it?

524
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,690
How the hell do you do it?
What the—

525
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
Ah, like this!

526
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,330
Crab crab crab!
From crab to xavier!

527
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Lower, lower...

528
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,530
Have you never even seen the Xavier thing?

529
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,700
How the hell do you do it? Do it.

530
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,210
Crab crab crab crab...
From crab to Xavier!

531
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,440
Hey you...
You're a complete failure to Haranishi.

532
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,100
Try to remember it properly

533
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,000
Hey... fuck you.

534
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,520
If only you remembered it,
you wouldn't be such a failure as a gag guy.

535
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,660
—Hey, everyone.
—What? Gag?

536
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,870
Are you guys washing your hands?

537
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,430
—Ah because of the virus?
—You really should do it.

538
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,340
Are you stupid, Fujita?

539
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,810
This guy's a complete idiot.

540
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,510
This is a pretty strong gel.

541
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,880
It stinks!

542
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,290
It stinks!

543
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,560
This is too much!

544
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,130
It's awful.
Stop this, come on!

545
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,400
What's that?!

546
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,670
This is fucking hell!

547
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,100
We'll have to smell this all the time.

548
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,970
This stinks!

549
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,940
Come on, leave it for later!

550
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:49,940
This stinks!

551
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,580
This stinks!
And we still have a lot of time!

552
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,750
This is shit?

553
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,050
It really smells like shit.

554
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,650
It's a strong disinfectant.
This... fights poison with poison.

555
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
What's this...?

556
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,860
—I dipped some shit in water.
—This really stinks!

557
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,560
I won't be able to eat anymore,
so please stop it.
You sure can eat, huh?!

558
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,430
Please stop this. I'm eating.

559
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,800
How much!
How much!

560
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,770
It stinks too much!

561
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,200
Mikitty!

562
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,400
What's with this guy?!

563
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:20,540
—This stinks.
—I can't take this...

564
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,540
It stinks.

565
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,320
Haranishi-san?

566
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,420
You talking about Hara Nishio?

567
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,930
—This smells like shit.
—I can't get it off!

568
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,560
I can't get it off my hands!

569
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,570
It really stinks.

570
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,930
This is too much!

571
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,480
You have any siblings, Chance Oshiro?

572
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,050
Ah yes, I do.

573
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
Who are they?

574
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,520
I have an older sister.
Sister and brother.

575
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,920
Sister and brother?

576
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,060
Who's your brother?

577
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,700
My brother didn't take a bath for half a year in high school.

578
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,770
—That's filthy.
—Yes.

579
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,930
And he doesn't clip his nails.

580
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,400
That's filthy.

581
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,070
One time we forced him to shower with my mom,

582
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,270
and the water was all black.

583
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,840
—That's filthy.
—Yes.

584
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,640
And he would bite his own fingernails.

585
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,140
That's gross.

586
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:34,980
And he would take his toe nails,
and stretch them all the way.

587
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,680
They were all ingrown.

588
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,050
And so at night, when I was sleeping,

589
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,290
I could hear some scratching coming from the floor.

590
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,960
And so I'd open the door, and I'd go:

591
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,000
"What are you doing?"
"I'm going to the bathroom."

592
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,900
"You're not wearing tap shoes?"

593
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,700
"I'm not."

594
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,770
Once he went to bed, he wouldn't wake up at all.

595
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,980
So mom put construction paper between his skin and his nails.

596
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,280
And used a cutter to clip them.

597
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,750
So she clipped them one by one.

598
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:16,790
She started putting more strength into it,

599
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,590
and ripped it off, and my brother started bleeding.

600
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,570
And so eventually even a deep-sleeper like him woke up.

601
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:29,500
He jumped out of the bed, and started shouting.

602
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,540
It was like the ending of Zatoichi. (EN: Character in an extremely popular Film series and TV show with the same name)

603
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,640
He was like "clack clack clack!"

604
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
He was saying that out loud?

605
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,880
No, it was the sound of his toe nails.

606
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,520
Ah sorry, I suck at telling stories.

607
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,350
How did he make them sound like that?

608
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,490
He was barefoot.

609
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,720
Barefoot against the floor?

610
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,460
They were all ingrown...

611
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,470
And so his nails were all...

612
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,370
Yeah, yeah.
And so he was like...

613
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,540
Yeah, all around here.

614
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,050
Fujimon, you're smiling?

615
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,050
Hey.

616
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,020
—I'm not smiling.
—You are.

617
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,360
Stop saying that out loud.

618
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,560
Um... please zip that up.

619
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,760
Ah, I'm sorry.
Which one?

620
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,580
Okay, that's enough.
That's enough.

621
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:57,460
Give me a fucking break!
What the fuck's this?!

622
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,890
What's with that?!

623
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,000
What happened?

624
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,100
Why are you just screwing me over?!

625
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,540
—Why are you making me laugh?
—That's war.

626
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
He's making me laugh...

627
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,700
That's not true!

628
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,170
—It was a general attack.
—That's not true!

629
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,410
I just stood in the center and—

630
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,910
Why is that Haranishi?!

631
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,340
That's not Haranishi-san...

632
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,310
It's not.

633
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,120
—It's really not.
—It's Gucci Yuuzo. (EN: Jp Personality)

634
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,120
You thought it was Haranishi-san?

635
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,590
You laughed because you thought it was him?

636
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,650
You always thought it was him?

637
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,060
That's how much you love your partner?

638
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,220
—Haranishi-san...
—You thought it was Haranishi-san?

639
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,290
Everyone was thinking that.

640
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,190
You didn't know who was going to show up, Fujimon.

641
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,660
You're all accusing me falsely!

642
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,030
That's too embarrassing.

643
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,670
It's too embarrassing.

644
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,970
Matsumoto's laughing too.

645
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,140
I can laugh, though!

646
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,340
That was a self-conscious accident.

647
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,210
That's not self-conscious at all, man!

648
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,810
—He just has a victim complex.
—A victim complex for sure.

649
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,280
But he does look a bit like him.

650
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,080
Haranishi and Gucci Yuuzo look alike.

651
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,480
So he knew they looked alike and targeted me...

652
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,190
Let's look at it. It was terrible.

653
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,230
That's pretty bad.

654
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,230
He's completely laughing.

655
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,130
I thought he was trying to bring me down.

656
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,600
Just pick a picture that makes it clearer
that it's Yuuzo.

657
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,910
Fujimon! You get an orange!

658
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,710
You laughed out loud,
which is pretty unusual lately.

659
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,150
I'm sure you have plenty of complaints to write for this evaluation,

660
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,320
right Fujimon?

661
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,850
You know I'm not gonna say anything.

662
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,250
What are you saying?

663
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,720
You're gonna say "that wasn't funny at all."

664
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,860
And that's why I'm getting an orange?

665
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,020
—Yeah.
—"Yeah"?!

666
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,690
"That wasn't funny at all" is something he'd say, yeah.

667
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,130
That's too strict!

668
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Come on.

669
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,940
It started!

670
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,810
No, no.
Just make it...

671
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,940
...at least a picture that's clearly Gucci-san's.

672
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,010
Depending on the person,
that could be basically anyone.

673
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,280
Think about it.
You really think I planned it and printed this?

674
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,420
Of course you did!

675
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,450
You could make him look thinner!

676
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,260
Are you telling me to lose weight
just for Gucci's image?

677
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,920
Open it from above.

678
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,290
How does it look from above?

679
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,230
When he opens it from below?

680
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,860
Well, I think it's fine when I do it like this.

681
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,570
It looks different from below.

682
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,170
Try opening it from above.

683
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,670
Don't say it like it's an AKB song.

684
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,940
"Mariko from above."

685
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,170
It's "from below"!

686
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,740
No. It's "from above."

687
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,280
Don't turn this into a romantic thing.

688
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,010
Let's stop this. Let's stop this!

689
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,680
It's "from above"

690
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,350
Do Gucci from above.

691
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,880
—Which one?
—Do Gucci from above.

692
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,390
This is perfectly fine. See?

693
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,060
What do you think?

694
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,890
When you do it like that,
it's definitely Gucci.

695
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:50,800
It's Gucci from above.
Haranishi from below.

696
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,200
Depending on how I open it,
it looks like Gucci.

697
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,140
Is it Haranishi the lower it gets?

698
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,570
Yeah, yeah.

699
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,140
So if I do this it's Gucci...?

700
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,610
That's definitely Haranishi!

701
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,710
That's really Haranishi-san.

702
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,110
It's definitely Haranishi.

703
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,080
Do it so we can tell it's Gucci.

704
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,290
That right there.
That that!

705
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,390
It kind of looks like Oochi from this angle too.

706
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,360
Why are you bringing Oochi up now?

707
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,230
There's some Oochi from above, too.

708
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,900
Is it Oochi from the side?

709
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,630
You could also turn Oochi into Daichi.

710
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,770
It changes depending on the name.

711
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,400
He won't stop eating.

712
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,840
He was really hungry.

713
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,510
Wanna play a game?

714
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,580
Didn't Coo just smile a little right now?

715
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,150
Coo smiled, right?

716
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,320
I didn't smile.

717
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,920
He smiled while doing it himself.

718
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,320
Hey, wanna play a game?

719
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,120
Fujita, you're an idiot.

720
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,720
This has bluetooth?

721
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,790
Yeah.

722
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,760
This reminds me of those Lumine Quizzes.

723
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,660
I told you we'd be playin a game, right?

724
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,400
You sure get along, huh?

725
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,900
You're a really handy guy, aren't you?

726
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,200
You love stuff like this.

727
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,540
You're busy right now, right?

728
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,210
Both him and Rossi are busy. (EN: Rossi is Cookie's Comedy Duo Partner)

729
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,050
Rossi usually looks pretty free, though.

730
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,280
—Is Rossi doing anything?
—That's a sad story.

731
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,350
Stop it.

732
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,950
You want to cry?

733
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,490
Why would I cry?

734
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,960
Because it's sad...

735
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,260
Rossi isn't doing anything, right?

736
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,330
What?

737
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,000
He's working.
Working, working.

738
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,570
Rossi's busy?

739
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,140
He's obviously not busy.

740
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:38,910
He's obviously busy!

741
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,310
He's been busy for a while now though, right?

742
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,910
Yeah, a little.

743
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,650
—At least he's doing what he likes.
—Good for him.

744
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,550
He's doing some baseball thing, right?

745
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,620
—Who?
—Rossi-san.

746
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,750
He doesn't play baseball.

747
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,390
He watches "camp report" a lot, though.

748
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,890
Who told you that?
Stop slurping that.

749
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,360
We're talking.

750
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,660
That's too loud!
Are you sucking someone off?

751
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,730
—He's not.
—I'm not.

752
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,770
—You can tell, right?
—But that sound...

753
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,140
It was just an example.

754
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,910
I think I prefer the term Lingus.

755
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,280
—What?
—Lingus is better.

756
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,640
What's that?

757
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,180
Cunnilingus...

758
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,020
That reminds me of Maeda Akira. (EN: Jp Promoter/Wrestler)

759
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,290
Don't bring Maeda Akira up just like that.

760
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,990
What's with that vest?

761
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,060
He was talking about it earlier.

762
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,330
—He likes it.
—He loves it.

763
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,230
It looks like a pro wrestler's.

764
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,740
It has that half-assed vibe.
It has a half-assed quality.

765
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,740
Why are you so loud?

766
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,410
What's wrong with your earlobes?
Did they get torn or something?

767
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,840
Ah yeah, a thug came by and...

768
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,680
—That's sad.
—That's a sad story.

769
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,450
He attacked me with a stapler like—

770
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,320
When was that?

771
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,290
—When you were working part time?
—Yes.

772
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,030
No way... do this!

773
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,300
Who will hold the remote?

774
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,370
Ah then, Seiji-san.
Can you do it? This is the remote.

775
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,700
Take it.

776
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,170
This won't appear on screen.

777
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,800
Just push this key to start.

778
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,470
Here we go.

779
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,650
—You're moving?
—Yeah.

780
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,080
I don't really know the controls.

781
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,550
That's amazing.

782
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,520
I don't get it. It's hard to use.

783
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,660
Watch out.

784
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,500
I don't know the controls, so...

785
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,330
Can someone do it?

786
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,300
I don't know this controller either.

787
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,270
Do it, Koba-san.

788
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,600
I can't do it.

789
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,350
You can do it, Koba-san!
You can do it!

790
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,350
Watch out, watch out!

791
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,790
Go, go, go!

792
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,920
Koba-san...

793
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,990
No good, huh?
Who can do it?

794
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,630
Fujimon!

795
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,660
Fujita, you do it!
Fujita, Fujita!

796
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,870
Go, Fujita. Do it!

797
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,500
You're holding it wrong.

798
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,310
Go, go!

799
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,480
Let him be. It's gonna be the same.

800
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
Go, go!

801
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,210
Go!
Jump, jump!

802
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,120
—Go!
—Take some impulse.

803
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,430
Is that how the game's supposed to work?

804
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,430
No way, everyone's falling the same way.

805
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:53,000
Go, go!
Start, start!

806
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,270
It's the same.

807
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,170
—He did it!
— Go, go!

808
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,540
It worked!

809
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,910
There we go!

810
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,380
—Who was it?
—Who was it?

811
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,490
Definitely not me.

812
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,720
Was it me?
Was I smiling?

813
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:20,630
No way!
I was biting my lips!

814
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,700
—Who was it?
—Koba?

815
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,760
I don't know!
I was biting my lips!

816
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:27,930
Sorry about this.
This is my own judgment, but...

817
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,610
It was just too funny.

818
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,670
Thank you very much.

819
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:37,240
Well, everyone was at least smiling a little.

820
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:42,520
So I think that generally...

821
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,990
Everyone is going to get a yellow.

822
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,260
—Everyone?
—Pretty much everyone was smiling.

823
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,460
No way!

824
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,660
How many poitns is that?

825
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,200
Well, people with oranges can keep them.

826
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,100
It won't turn into a red.

827
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:02,700
You were all smiling like it was new year's eve.

828
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:11,710
It might be a little premature,
but you're all getting a yellow.

829
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,750
Whoa, no way!

830
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,220
That's too much!

831
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,690
I think it works out!

832
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,760
From now on you're not gonna pull any unnecessary stuff.

833
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,660
We won't, we won't.
This will work.

834
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,030
You're gonna keep going?

835
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,830
I'm leaving this to Cookie...

836
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,230
Please stop this already!

837
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,630
Stop it!

838
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,410
Whoa, that's dirty!

839
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,810
Where is it?!

840
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,750
In the gulf!!
