1
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,570
Even if no one is laughing

2
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,370
I will not be anxious

3
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,210
I will not doubt myself

4
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,110
I will continue my performance and go my own way

5
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,420
Brigham Young once said...

6
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,050
"I have to save Japan"

7
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:47,260
"Although this has never been proven in history"

8
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,030
I just love Owarai

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,600
I love the excitement and I want to face my fear

10
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,410
I want to move one step forward

11
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,980
"Should I go this way?"

12
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,510
"Nope, I'll go this way and turn around"

13
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,760
Jinnai, you're out!

14
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,100
Come on, really?

15
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,900
"You are trying to escape from here"

16
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,530
"You are trying to escape from the family"

17
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,570
Who are you?

18
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,710
You mean me?

19
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,710
Infinite testicles syndrome

20
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,420
You're out!

21
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,450
Mei-eki?   -Immunity (men-eki)

22
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,420
You mean the Nagoya station?

23
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,820
That's Mei-eki

24
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,970
Someone laughed, huh?

25
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,540
Who laughed?

26
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,170
I'll give her an orange card straight away

27
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,480
So harsh

28
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,890
Who's coming?

29
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,840
Long time no see

30
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,040
I'm glad you guys are having a good time

31
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,510
We look like we're having a good time?

32
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,680
I finished early, so...

33
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,040
Yeah

34
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,110
And I thought I left without doing anything meaningful

35
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,180
Well, yeah

36
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,020
So, although I shouldn't be doing this here, but...

37
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,360
Underwear are very important, right?

38
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,720
Men's underwear are important

39
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,520
Yes, very important

40
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,590
So I think we should check someone's underwear

41
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,160
Check someone's underwear?

42
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,760
Who's?

43
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,830
Mine

44
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,100
Okay, that sounds good

45
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,300
So we will check you underwear?

46
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,170
I'm wearing my favorite underwear today, it's really cute

47
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,510
So please take a look

48
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,140
Men and women have different sense though

49
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,550
So cute

50
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,180
Two colors   -Yes, two colors

51
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,450
TORIO (brand)?   -Yes

52
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,990
There's these designs here too...

53
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,120
Very cute   -That was unexpected

54
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,290
Yeah, it looks good, I like the color

55
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,630
Eh?

56
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,400
There's even a pocket here

57
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,100
No...

58
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,300
That's not the main point

59
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,400
Daigo...

60
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,040
Infected?...

61
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,170
It looks like Kaela now

62
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,170
Kaela Kimura is a Japanese pop rock singer famous for having avant-garde and colorful hairstyles

63
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,740
It looks like a metal ball

64
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,040
Eh? Wild turkey?

65
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,540
You mean here?

66
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,580
No, not there, not about your underwear

67
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,150
It looks like a tropical bird, when it's courting and puff out it's cheek

68
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,950
Underwear, look at my underwear

69
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,690
What do you think?

70
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,590
Eh? Is that just one side of the balls?

71
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,360
No, don't you think the coloring looks great?

72
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
The pink color and...

73
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,860
Very cute...

74
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,500
So even his balls are in pink and blue color

75
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,100
Amazing, I can look at it forever

76
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,570
It's artistic

77
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,210
I even thought it's a rock

78
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,170
Thank you

79
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,840
Thank you, too

80
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,340
Thank you for showing us such a precious thing

81
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,080
Thank you

82
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,550
Thank you very much

83
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,150
See you

84
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,050
See you   -Thank you very much

85
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,880
We get to look at it for a long time

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,250
Yeah, it was a precious opportunity

87
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,260
It doesn't look disgusting after it's painted, huh?   -Exactly

88
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,360
It really looks like some kind of bird or plant

89
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,430
Huh?

90
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,730
Huh?

91
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,400
That person...

92
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,340
Nice to meet you

93
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,240
Nice to meet you too

94
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,610
What happened?

95
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,140
Ah, excuse me

96
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,780
I want to make you all to space

97
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,850
Make us to space?

98
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,550
Do you mean take us to space?

99
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,350
Yes, make you all to space

100
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,830
That's neat

101
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,430
Those sunglasses are amazing

102
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,700
She looks like Shiozawa Toki-san

103
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:31,870
*Shiozawa Toki was a Japanese actress and television personality, and she always wears unique looking sunglasses

104
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,670
Oh, really?

105
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,440
Oh, she's Shiozawa Toki-san

106
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,870
Yes, I'm Shiozawa Toki

107
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,570
What are you doing?

108
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,980
What was that?

109
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,980
I want to make you all into this song

110
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,850
No, we want you to take us to space

111
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,810
Not into this song

112
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,520
Is this a TV show?

113
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,920
She's probably the floor director

114
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,160
She's giving the instructions

115
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,130
*It says "(Kurosawa) One more song"

116
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,260
She's showing the cunning paper

117
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,130
The instructions

118
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,860
I'm doing a great job

119
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:03,900
*It says "(Fujimon) This has become a memorable song for me"

120
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,590
This will take us to space?

121
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,570
Well...umm...

122
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,270
This has become...

123
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,710
A memorable song for me

124
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,710
Okay, let's stop for a while

125
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,340
Excuse me

126
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,450
(This dude is just absolute chaotic, incredible)

127
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,480
Let's stop for a while

128
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,150
So after this...   -Yes

129
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,850
The recording has been stopped now

130
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,990
And after this...
(Yuriyan is amazing)

131
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,160
I want you guys to...well...

132
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,760
To speak out loud

133
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,230
Whatever you say, remember to speak it out loud

134
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,830
What should we say though?

135
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:45,270
Well, just say anything that first comes to your mind, that should be fine

136
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,140
Well, how should I put it

137
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,780
Maybe you can make fun of the rustiness of this building

138
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,450
Like "it's super ancient"

139
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,880
Yes, "super ancient" is interesting

140
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,080
In addition...

141
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,350
I want to discuss this further

142
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,490
Should "super ancient" appear for like 4 times?

143
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,030
Once is enough

144
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,760
I want to emphasize this point though   -Once is enough

145
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,230
So please say it once

146
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,170
Is it a must?

147
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,770
Yes, it is

148
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,300
Is it gonna work? "Super ancient" all of a suddent?

149
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,310
Just say what we're thinking, right?   -Yes

150
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,140
And if you stand up from the chair

151
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,310
I believe your feet will be on the ground, so...

152
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,050
Of course it will

153
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,550
And only if you know how to walk

154
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,920
The fabric over there, which is called the curtain   -Yes, we know

155
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,220
If you open the curtain, you can change your clothes inside

156
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,790
We need to get changed?

157
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,090
Yes

158
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:45,460
And you can take a break inside too

159
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,300
What is this?   -What is this TV show?

160
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,870
Please explain everything to us

161
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,340
What is this TV show and what do you want us to do?

162
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,640
And what is your role?

163
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,170
This is Documental

164
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,640
Huh?

165
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,410
This show is Documental

166
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,880
Documental is not scripted though   -Yeah, it's not

167
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,980
It's freestyle

168
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,590
It's not scripted, so...

169
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,050
How should I put it, well...

170
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,890
This is a fight between comedians...umm...

171
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,460
We know the rules, you don't need to tell us what to do

172
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,860
Please do some Boke and...

173
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,330
We will Boke, we will   -We will do it, no worries

174
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,970
We will do it, there's no need to instruct us

175
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,900
Well, how should I put it...

176
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,970
Please do some greeting gags too

177
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,300
People with a greeting gag will do it, no problem

178
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,610
You mean like Miyasako's greeting gag, right?

179
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,640
*"Ginza Yeah" is the title of Tomochika's famous skit

180
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,640
-I can do "Ginza Yeah" too, right?
-Yes, "Ginza Yeah" is intereting too

181
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,810
Which TV station are you from?

182
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,550
I'm from the Doguyasuji TV

183
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:41,650
*Yuriyan made up a TV station based on the name of a famous shopping street in Osaka, Doguyasuji

184
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,280
Huh?

185
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,920
Doguyasuji TV?

186
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,650
We are DTV

187
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,590
This show will only be broadcasted at Doguyasuji?

188
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,120
Yes

189
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,760
You mean that shopping street in Osaka?

190
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,960
That street is full of Chinese people

191
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,830
Yes, our target audience is Chinese poeple

192
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,860
However...

193
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,670
I don't think anyone will find it funny with your script though

194
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,710
Well, Watashi have...Boku have...

195
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:05,410
*Watashi and Boku both means "I", however, for most of the time, only females will use Watashi, and only males will use Boku

196
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,840
Watashi? Boku? What is your gender?

197
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,410
Male or female?

198
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,750
I'm a woman

199
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,550
This person has a lot of gags, please give it a look

200
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,180
Can you do it?

201
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,420
Of course, he has a lot of gags

202
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,820
Recently

203
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,030
I went to the Sennichimae Doguyasuji, at Namba, Osaka

204
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,160
And guess what

205
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,100
There were a lot of Chinese people

206
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,470
About 30 people, and they were walking around

207
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,580
30 people were walking around

208
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,850
Well done

209
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,110
You instructed her to do that?

210
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,950
Yes, I instructed her to do that

211
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,250
Oh, so you asked her to do that

212
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,150
Yes, excuse me

213
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,920
Eh? Isn't it freestyle?

214
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,950
Well, yes it is

215
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,620
But please follow my instructions too

216
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,260
Got it

217
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,860
By the way, there're food and drinks over there...

218
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,320
That's enough, we don't need your instructions   -We don't need it

219
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,890
That's enough

220
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,960
Let's stop recording for a while   -It's stopped already

221
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,630
Umm...

222
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,800
The recording is stopped already

223
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,130
That's enough

224
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,870
You guys are isolating me, huh?

225
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,700
Isolating?

226
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,570
No we're not isolating you

227
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,470
It's already this time

228
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,910
I better go home now

229
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,480
So scary, so scary

230
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,590
Who is it?

231
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,490
Maybe it's just my imagination

232
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,960
Who is it?!

233
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You've been following me from the nursing center, huh?

234
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,570
I told you I'll pay you later!

235
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:59,520
Can I show you all a short video clip?

236
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,550
Yeah, sure

237
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:10,200
Nothing fancy, but...

238
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,030
No worries

239
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,300
Okay, it's ready

240
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,670
I'll play it now

241
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,900
Oh, Ms.Chopchop

242
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,810
Ms.Chopchop?   -Ms.Chopchop

243
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,380
What's happening?

244
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,150
Eh? What's happening?

245
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,420
What are you doing?

246
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,160
What happened?

247
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,100
What's this?

248
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,060
Slapstick comedy

249
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,830
What the heck?

250
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,400
That's all you wanted to show us?

251
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,000
We don't need that

252
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,170
Anything else?

253
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,370
That's enough, seriously, that's enough

254
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,110
We don't need this

255
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,840
That's enough, come on

256
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
You look like Sakata Shisho

257
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,880
That's enough   -Enough

258
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,810
Who's that?

259
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,210
That's me

260
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,850
So cute   -You're big, huh?

261
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,420
When did you take this photo?

262
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,580
Last year

263
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,150
Last year?!

264
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,790
Stop lying, hum!

265
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:11,990
Hum!

266
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,460
Very cute

267
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,360
Her feet are so small

268
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,360
And it's squishy

269
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,070
Aren't those shoes from the Heian period?

270
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:21,970
No, they're not

271
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,470
There're also photos of me growing up

272
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,770
This photo

273
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,210
The girl wearing a red hat?   -So cute!

274
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,040
Red hat?

275
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,070
Nope, not that girl

276
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,910
White hat?

277
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,610
Nope

278
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,840
Which one then?

279
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,820
You didn't change at all

280
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,550
Her feet are so tiny!

281
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,020
That's so tiny

282
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,120
Are those wooden shoes?

283
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,520
No way, those are not

284
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,860
These are wooden shoes...

285
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,830
How is it impossible for kids to wear wooden shoes during sports day?

286
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,700
Maybe it's that kind of school

287
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,130
Wow, it's shaking a lot

288
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,100
We can't see it if you shake it, hum!

289
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,770
Hum! You're right

290
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,440
What the heck is that?

291
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
There's not much time left

292
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,070
Only 40 more minutes

293
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,510
Not much time left, so...

294
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,240
We can't waste time on this

295
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,840
We can't waste time on this, hum!

296
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,240
Someone's coming

297
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,210
Oh, Kanmuri-san!

298
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,720
*Kanmuri Jiro is a famous Enka singer, and "Get fired up! Get fired up!" is a line from his most famous song "Honō"

299
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,580
Get fired up! Get fired up!

300
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,720
Seiya!

301
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,150
Shout it together!

302
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,990
Seiya!

303
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,320
He's Kanmuri Jiro-san

304
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,190
Nice to meet you

305
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,930
I'm Kanmuri

306
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,390
I'm Kan-muri Jiro

307
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,060
His name is Kanmuri, and he calls himself Kan-muri

308
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,500
Why do you call yourself Kan-muri?

309
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,330
Just call him Kan-muri-san

310
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:33,170
Well, please read Kanmuri Jiro as Kan-muri Jiro

311
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,840
*"Pushing myself too hard" is pronounced as "muri", which sounds the same as (Kan-) muri

312
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,840
Because I'm always pushing myself too hard (muri)*

313
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,210
And that's why I call myself Kan-muri Jiro

314
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,280
Instead of Kanmuri Jiro, please call me Kan-muri Jiro

315
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,120
And after he says this, the audience will always say "thank you so much for your lip service"

316
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,220
Oh, it gets a laugh?   -Yes, yes

317
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,490
It gets a laugh?   -Well...

318
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,320
Seiya! That's the spirit! That's the spirit!

319
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,260
You wanna do it? Nope?

320
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,700
Your jacket looks amazing   -It looks fancy

321
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,970
Yes, this is...umm...maybe I'll do it now

322
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:01,930
Sure, do it now

323
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,370
Maybe I'll get an electric shock though

324
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,910
My body is going numb   -Going numb?

325
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,610
Get fired up! Get fired up!

326
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,170
No, you're gonna set yourself on fire

327
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,780
What are those decorations?

328
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,150
This is called Den-shoku (Electric decorations)

329
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,610
Den-shoku (Electric decorations)

330
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,310
Wa-shoku (Japanese meal), Tei-shoku (Set meal)

331
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,120
*"Den" means electric, and decorations and meal are both pronounced as "Shoku"

332
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,120
Wa-shoku (Japanese meal), Tei-shoku (Set meal), Yo-shoku (Western meal) and Den-shoku (Electric decorations)

333
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,620
Did that ever get a laugh?

334
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,020
Huh?

335
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,890
Did that get a laugh?

336
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,050
Well, this is the first time I said it

337
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,760
But I think you can use this gag in your performances too

338
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,960
Oh, really?

339
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,530
Oh, a mic   -A mic

340
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,830
Mike Maki   -Yes, Mike Maki (Japanese actor)

341
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,900
Kanmuri-san, can you please...

342
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,360
Oh, yes?

343
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,470
What? What's wrong?

344
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,770
What happened?

345
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,700
Please, say it

346
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,570
May I help you?

347
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,770
Question? You have a question?

348
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,540
I just thought it wasn't that funny, to be honest

349
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,840
Oh, I bet so

350
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,410
That wasn't funny, huh?

351
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,010
You bet so?

352
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,450
Yes, I bet so

353
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,320
You bet so? So you knew it?

354
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,920
Yes, whenever possible, I reflect on myself from an objective perspective

355
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,830
That is a Den-ki (light bulb), I am Gen-ki (healthy), and you are Non-ki (relaxed)

356
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,430
No, those kinds of gags are...

357
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,660
What? You have a question?

358
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,200
Eh?   -What's wrong?

359
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,700
Well...

360
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,640
It's okay, males should be silent

361
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,540
What can you do with being silent?

362
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,640
*Being silent (Mu-kuchi) and having six mouths (Mutsu-kuchi) have similar pronunciations

363
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,640
I can have six mouths*

364
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,280
So scary

365
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,610
One, two...

366
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,550
Three, four, five...

367
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,510
That's your nose

368
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,220
What kind of Boke is this?

369
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,420
Because I myself am becoming a Boke (dumb)   -Uh-oh

370
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,690
Do you have a stuffy nose?

371
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,690
Stuffy nose?

372
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,860
That's important

373
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,960
Well, my nose is...

374
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,030
For real?

375
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,560
This thing can clear your nose

376
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,330
Clear my nose?

377
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,870
Yes, I've got something that can clear your nose

378
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,670
Eh?   -Please come over here

379
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,840
Maybe give this a try?

380
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,870
Eh? What? What is it?

381
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,870
Just squeeze it in and it will wash your nose

382
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,680
Very simple, just squeeze this in your nose

383
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,310
No worries

384
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,150
I know, I know this, it's basically salt water and...umm...

385
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,310
No more talking please, just...

386
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,050
Oh, really?

387
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,080
So it will come out from the other side?

388
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,130
Amazing, an amazing amount is coming out

389
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,140
Wow, that's amazing   -Are you okay?

390
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,840
He's putting it all in!

391
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,370
Amazing!!   -It all went in!

392
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,810
So strong

393
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,410
So Strong!   -You're amazing, Kanmuri-san

394
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,780
I'm good, I can put even more in

395
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,650
This is enough   -This amount is enough

396
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,820
Huh? What is your name again?

397
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,590
Many people say we look alike

398
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,760
Shoji-san, please show him your gag

399
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,730
Please look at him, he'll show you his gag

400
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,760
You'll remember his name after watching his gag

401
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,300
Please do it

402
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,770
You've never seen that before? He has been doing it throughout his career

403
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,480
Your eyes are staring into my soul again

404
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,540
Please leave!

405
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,810
Your eyes are canzone

406
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:03,180
*"Canzone" and "staring into my soul" have similar pronunciations

407
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:00,910
Canzone!

408
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,180
Yes, they are staring into my soul, canzone

409
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,580
Good

410
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,480
No, please...

411
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,120
What is this?   -Bravo

412
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,950
No, it should be ET

413
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,890
Yeah, ET, it should be ET

414
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,930
Glad that you all know about ET

415
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,060
What's next?

416
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,600
Time to leave

417
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Seiya!

418
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,930
Seiya! Who said it?

419
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,170
Seiya, good!

420
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,200
Ready, set...

421
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,370
Seiya! Hooray!

422
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,040
Bye bye

423
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,810
So powerful

424
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,810
I can't believe he doesn't know about Shoji-san

425
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,710
He probably doesn't watch TV very often, so...

426
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,620
No, it's my fault for not appearing on TV very often

427
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:37,980
Eh?

428
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,950
It's my fault for not appearing on TV shows

429
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,820
No, no, Shoji-san...

430
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,490
It's simply because he doesn't watch TV, don't let it get you down

431
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,820
No...

432
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,530
I'm only on TV shows in Kansai, so...

433
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,660
Nah, you're not even on TV shows in Kansai, right?

434
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,660
Fujimoto-san...

435
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:03,670
Our camera team has entered Documental's lodge

436
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:08,950
*Tomochika is imitating a comedian called Seki Okio, who is well-known for hosting TV shows about urban legends

437
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,380
That's incredible, huh?

438
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,110
There’s no turning back

439
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,950
Seki...

440
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,380
This means that the Pandora's box has been opened

441
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,550
Urban legends...   -That's incredible, huh?

442
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,190
Listen carefully

443
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,890
Seki?...

444
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:23,360
This is the grand lodge, and it's not allowed to enter here, right?

445
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,330
But everyone here has agreed about this

446
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,330
The losers will give one million yen to the winner

447
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:36,940
And the winner can take all of the money, which adds up to 10 million

448
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,940
Am I right?

449
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,480
Only the person at the top...

450
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,150
Look at this pyramid

451
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,010
Look at this

452
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:50,090
Only the person at the top of this pyramid can take all of the money

453
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,290
Listen carefully

454
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,860
That has nothing to do with urban legend though

455
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,260
This is amazon, right?

456
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,500
Amazon, right?

457
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,030
Amazon? Am I spelling it right?

458
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,700
Yes, it's amazon

459
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,370
Amazon, right?

460
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,170
Listen carefully

461
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,500
Cross out the "a", right?

462
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,070
Change it to "s", right?

463
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,680
And that's mason

464
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:20,450
Therefore, this proves that amazon is in fact freemason

465
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,490
The door to the new world has been opened

466
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,530
But you crossed out and changed the words...

467
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,660
You can change it to anything you want

468
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,660
Do you have a smartphone with you?

469
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,100
Yes, I have it with me

470
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,400
Do you have it with you?   -Yes

471
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Come on, this is just...

472
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,600
You can't just cross it out

473
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,770
Don't cross it out or change it...

474
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:46,210
These letters undoubtedly proved that it's true

475
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,310
That's incredible, huh?   -No, Seki-san, that's not right

476
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,750
I'll ask Siri about this

477
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,280
You can change it to whatever you want

478
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,020
Is Amazon freemason?

479
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,790
It says nothing

480
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,660
But that's not because it has nothing to say

481
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:11,070
Instead, there's actually some kind of power that stops it from saying, and that's the truth behind

482
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,740
That's incredible, huh?

483
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,040
The door to the new world has been opened

484
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,050
The Pandora's box has been opened

485
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,850
That's incredible, huh?

486
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,590
You can say whatever you want if you do it this way

487
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,690
This is an undeniable truth

488
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,390
Amazon is freemason

489
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,930
Freemason is Amazon   -No, no...

490
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,930
Believe it or not, it's up to you

491
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,900
I believe you!

492
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,470
Where are you going?

493
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,010
She explained nothing

494
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,340
Maeda, come on...

495
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,480
He's always doing something backstage

496
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,910
I'll go for zombie time then

497
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:10,960
Oh no...

498
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,000
My nose is stuffy

499
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,800
My nose is so stuffy

500
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,940
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

501
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,710
Ouch! Ouch!

502
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:27,180
Ouch, ouch, ouch...

503
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,110
Ouch! Ouch! So hot!

504
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,150
Ouch! So hot! Ouch!

505
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,880
Ouch!!!

506
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,490
This is terrible

507
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,490
I have to use this

508
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,790
I have to use this thing from Fujimon

509
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,430
And soda water

510
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,330
To clean my nose

511
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,970
It hurts so badly! Only soda water can save me!

512
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,670
Ouch! My nose hurts so much!

513
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,940
I can't take this anymore...

514
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,970
Is it fine to use soda water?

515
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,510
I believe only soda water can save me from this

516
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,910
Seriously...I have to do this...

517
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,780
My nose is hurting so much...

518
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,910
I have to use soda water...

519
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,630
Ouch! This is just...

520
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,630
This is just...

521
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,730
You guys have to try this

522
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,940
Honestly...

523
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,850
I feel like my head is cracking...

524
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,050
This is absolutely awful...

525
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,790
Shoji brother, please try it with soda water...

526
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,790
Try it with soda water, brother

527
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,730
Ouch...my head hurts...

528
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,830
Ouch...

529
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,230
Are you fine?

530
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,730
I'm fine, please try it, brother

531
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,600
(How did they hold back? Incredible)

532
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,680
An old grandpa...

533
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,590
An old grandpa...

534
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,230
Are you fine?

535
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,330
Are you fine?

536
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,100
Brother...

537
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,240
(Yuriyan is close, but...)

538
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,510
Brother...

539
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,980
Brother...brother...

540
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,450
Brother...

541
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,800
He laughed!

542
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,440
Why the heck...

543
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,240
He's not moving at all...

544
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:12,810
I can't take this...

545
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,310
That's incredible!

546
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:18,180
Phew...   -Come on!

547
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,190
That was funny as hell

548
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,320
Are you fine?

549
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,420
Not fine, huh?

550
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,690
Why are you staying still for so long?

551
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,060
Like an old grandpa

552
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,390
Let's take a look

553
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,400
An old grandpa...

554
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,710
An old grandpa...

555
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,650
(He's actually already laughing...)

556
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,690
It's cunning to do that at this timing...   -Yeah, but it can’t be helped

557
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,420
Fujimon, you've been this far, last 15 minutes, but...

558
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,390
You're out!

559
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,760
Only 13 more minutes...

560
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:12,970
Please have a good fight in the remaining time

561
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:13,570
Got it

562
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,710
Come on...

563
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,580
Why are you staying still...   -You're the one who asked me to do it

564
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,740
Well, yes, but...

565
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,880
Okay, Fujimon, let's go

566
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,550
Quite a lot of you received no card today

567
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,220
3 people are intact

568
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,090
Their defense is so damn strong   -Yes, very strong

569
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,390
Their defense is very strong

570
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,590
If you're not laughing at that, what else will you laugh at?

571
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,260
Huh?

572
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,530
You three girls

573
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,760
So last 13 minutes

574
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,330
Good luck everyone   -Thank you

575
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,640
That's a complete defeat

576
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,210
Female comedians are just too strong

577
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:54,880
Dodosuko-suko-suko, Dodosuko-suko-suko...

578
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,180
My molars are gone and disappeared

579
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,920
They can perform skits at anytime and anywhere

580
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,260
Oh hey, oh hey, oh Jinnai

581
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:10,590
That dancing scene and the master

582
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:14,600
I was saved thanks to Jinnai laughing

583
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,440
Or else, I'll probably be laughing in 10 seconds

584
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:27,210
Well, I'm actually holding back my laughter all the time

585
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,350
Let's start

586
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,730
It hurts so badly

587
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,930
It's so painful if you put it in your nose

588
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,560
If you put soda water inside...

589
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,100
Is it that painful?

590
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,230
Is it really painful?

591
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,370
I wonder how painful it is though

592
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:56,310
Shall we give it a try?

593
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,240
You people should try it too

594
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,340
This is a precious chance

595
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,640
How do you do this?

596
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,950
Put it inside your nose

597
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,920
Just squeeze it hard

598
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,920
I'll do it now   -Okay

599
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,590
This is soda water

600
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,360
But he's not stopping at all

601
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,000
Amazing   -Very strong

602
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,800
Isn't it incredible?

603
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,580
There's no need to go this far

604
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,240
Don't push yourself too hard

605
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,350
Amazing

606
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,150
Shoji-san only did it once, and yet...

607
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,680
Please...please...

608
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,520
Did anyone see a ball came rolling?

609
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,620
Ball?

610
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,960
No, I don't think so

611
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,510
Shoji-san...

612
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,910
Eh? He laughed?

613
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,910
Shoji-san...

614
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,550
Please don't...

615
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,660
Shoji-san, Shoji-san...

616
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,530
Please help her find the ball

617
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,030
(Arghh, he laughed, huh?)

618
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,300
(He did laugh, huh?)

619
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,500
(Shoji brother is out then)

620
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,810
You've been holding back for all this time, but...

621
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,980
Shoji brother...

622
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,050
I just have to say you laughed...

623
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,110
Eh?!

624
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,050
I just have to say so

625
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:46,850
I didn't laugh

626
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,020
You did laugh

627
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,820
And you tried to muddle through

628
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,860
Yes, like picking his nose...

629
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,340
Shoji-san, Shoji-san...

630
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,180
Please help her find the ball

631
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,640
(What was so...)

632
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,410
(But he did indeed laugh)

633
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,880
Eh? I laughed?   -Yes, you did, you laughed

634
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,090
What was so funny? What happened?

635
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,390
You've been working so hard to get here

636
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,420
I was thinking "what the heck is she doing..."

637
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,460
Shoji brother...

638
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,660
Eh?!   -You're out

639
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,100
Eh? Really?   -It can't be helped

640
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,770
He's still not done yet? It's taking him forever

641
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,210
Why are you so slow, Shoji-san?

642
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,980
Thank you very much

643
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,450
That's unacceptable

644
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:54,220
No, I wanted to do something for you too, but it can't be helped

645
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,690
I know you've been working so hard for me

646
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,520
And you're bringing so many things with you

647
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,930
I can't help but laugh at Tomochika's performance

648
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,600
And Fujimon's tsukkomi as well

649
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,030
It's gonna come out as a bird

650
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,000
You're saying the wrong joke all the time

651
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,570
Tomochika is really good at acting

652
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,710
Did anyone see a ball came rolling?

653
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,210
Her performances are smoothly brought together

654
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,480
So it's really hard to hold back

655
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,330
Let's start

656
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,830
What should we do?

657
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,440
I not a ball

658
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,980
I thought you're a ball, you look alike with it

659
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,590
The children's sumo

660
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,590
(We're done, this dude is the winner)

661
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,290
(This dude has to be the winner)

662
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:12,030
Come on, what the heck is this dude doing

663
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,460
You look exactly the same (as children's sumo)

664
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,400
Maeda-kun   -Yes
(This dude is wicked)

665
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,870
You wanna do it? Sumo

666
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,980
She looks the same as the souvenir popular among foreigners

667
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,980
But in opposite direction...

668
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,650
Ah, same now...

669
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,690
(She's showing her boobs so naturally)

670
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,320
So scary...

671
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,090
*Tarepanda is a cute panda character, which literally means a droopy panda

672
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,090
She looks like Tarepanda   -That was amazing

673
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,060
Incredible, she's Tarepanda

674
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,270
Excuse me

675
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,010
Your thing is exposed   -Yeah, it's exposed

676
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,180
Excuse me

677
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,080
Yes?

678
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:10,090
I'm the lowest level creature on this planet

679
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,420
I knew it

680
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,520
We can totally see that   -You can?

681
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,730
Are you finding a ball?

682
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,160
Yes, I'm finding a ball

683
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,360
Well...

684
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,030
I found a ball over there

685
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,200
Where is it?

686
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,700
Can you please say "Seiya" and cheer for me?   -Eh?

687
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,070
Can you please cheer for me?

688
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,310
Cheer for you?   Yes

689
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,810
How to cheer for you?
(She told you "Eh?" already)

690
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,040
Just shout "Seiya"

691
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,240
Shout it together?

692
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,880
Please shout "Seiya" together

693
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,010
Ready, set...

694
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:36,910
Seiya!

695
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,380
Please shout it a bit louder

696
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,820
Ready, set...Seiya!

697
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,180
Louder, shout it louder

698
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,350
Ready, set...Seiya!!

699
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,290
There it is

700
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,830
That's not the ball I'm finding...

701
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,130
Not this ball?

702
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,700
Not this one

703
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,730
Not this one?

704
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,700
Not this one, dude

705
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,240
Balls?...

706
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:04,470
You sure is the lowest of the low, you know there's girls here

707
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,440
Excuse me

708
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,380
That's the ball that I'm finding

709
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,750
Oh, you mean these balls?

710
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,480
Oh?

711
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,350
I fulfilled your desire

712
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,990
You're finding these balls?

713
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,090
What have you been doing with these balls?

714
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,490
Playing with balls, of course

715
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,130
Oh dear

716
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,830
May I invite you to play with my balls?

717
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,370
50 odd

718
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,910
The worst has happened

719
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,150
A bit lower please...   -Forty thirty

720
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,880
(Okay, that's the worst)

721
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,620
Deuce

722
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,520
Advantage

723
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,750
Receive

724
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,560
That's the worst

725
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,210
Yuriyan is coming again

726
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:15,080
What are you people playing? Ladies and gentlemen?

727
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,910
Oh, who are you?

728
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,980
I'm Machiko

729
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,950
My name is Machiko

730
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:21,990
Machiko-san?

731
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,420
I'm the niece of the owner here

732
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,220
Niece?

733
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,520
Hey, niece, your back...

734
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:38,170
Ever since I've been working for Panasonic, I've been busy working every single day

735
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:45,210
But hey, why aren't you wearing any pants?

736
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,040
Well, umm...

737
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,980
Because I'm the lowest level creature

738
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,680
I knew it

739
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,490
I'm an extremely low level creature

740
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,390
I'll make something for you

741
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:57,950
Huh?

742
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,960
I said I'll make something for you

743
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,190
Don't tell me that you're trying to steal my customer, huh?

744
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,500
Nope

745
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,400
I don't care if you're working for Panasonic or what

746
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,530
But lies are soon found out

747
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,940
This man is my customer

748
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,870
Don't mess around with me

749
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,240
*Yoshiwara was a famous red-light district in Edo

750
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,240
Machiko-san, you're working at Yoshiwara as well?

751
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,640
Yes, I'm working at Yoshiwara

752
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,550
Many girls put on another face and work here at night

753
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,750
(She admitted it)

754
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,150
(Again...)

755
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,620
It hurts!

756
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,790
Not done yet

757
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,760
Almost done

758
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,700
The game is on

759
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,630
Hold it tight

760
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,530
Hold it tight!

761
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,210
It got recorded, it got recorded already

762
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,080
Nishikawa Mineko-san

763
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,590
"Whoever, please! Have sex with me!"

764
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:06,320
*Yuriyan is acting the famous scene of Nishikawa Mineko in the movie "Yoshiwara Enjo", where she is a physically and mentally ill prostitute being locked up in a bedroom
*Actual scene: https://twitter.com/i/status/1049321589387345920

765
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,590
Nishikawa Mineko-san's scene

766
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,320
"Here, right here! Bite me, bite me!"

767
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,320
Nishikawa Mineko-san is very emotional here

768
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,020
"Bite me, just bite me!"

769
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,390
The scene in the bedroom   -Yes, in the bedroom

770
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,460
"Please, bite me, please!"

771
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,470
She's very emotional

772
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,170
I'll quit working at Yoshiwara

773
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,040
I'll quit Yoshiwara, and...

774
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,810
Who are you?

775
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,450
(Phew...)

776
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,480
I'll quit Yoshiwara

777
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,220
Shin-san?

778
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,690
I quitted Yoshiwara already!

779
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,560
Shin-san?

780
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,360
I quitted Yoshiwara, and now...

781
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,530
I came to here

782
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,730
Just to forget about you

783
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,930
Shin-san?!

784
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,600
You're Shin-san, right?

785
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,700
You must be Shin-san!

786
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,600
Hey, you two are not in the same movie

787
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,070
Not in the same scene

788
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,640
Even if you call me Shin-san, Shin-san...

789
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,440
You are Shin-san

790
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,510
If you say that I am Shin-san

791
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,510
Then maybe I am indeed Shin-san

792
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,490
Ever since you started working at Yoshiwara...

793
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,760
Shin-san!

794
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,590
I won't believe you

795
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,530
I won't believe you!

796
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,130
(Why is Maeda touching his dick?)

797
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,860
It's me!

798
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,000
I won't believe you!

799
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,230
(He's definitely trying to get an erection)

800
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,000
No way, no

801
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,770
Keep walking and the street will open for you

802
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,340
*Gosha Hideo is the director of the movie "Yoshiwara Enjo"

803
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,340
I can totally feel that this is in the world of Gosha Hideo's movies

804
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,840
Keep trying and the mountain will move for you

805
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:40,450
Someday, your cheeks will sunken and you'll get dimples

806
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:45,160
Then pour some water to your hollow dimples

807
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,660
Don't stop all of a sudden!

808
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,660
I didn't stop

809
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,400
I won't stop!

810
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,700
I will never stop!

811
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,370
Since the day we met, we are...

812
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,280
(Amazing)

813
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,890
Shin-san...

814
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:19,420
Phew, that was a wonderful battle

815
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,460
That was truly amazing, huh?

816
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,130
That ending was amazing

817
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,430
Maeda, you definitely tried to get an erection, huh?

818
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:34,270
This is the first time to have so many people remaining

819
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,640
And there's even 3 people intact

820
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,510
Haruna, Kurosawa, Yuriyan

821
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,440
3 people

822
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,350
Because these 3 people are intact

823
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:47,550
The person scoring the most points will be the winner

824
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,160
That being said

825
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,630
Today's winner is...

826
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,460
Yuriyan Retriever!

827
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,600
Is it me?

828
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,500
It can't be true!

829
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,500
Excuse me

830
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,240
Well, umm...   -Excuse me

831
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,610
Yeah, because she didn't laugh

832
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,710
Yes, she didn't laugh, and more importantly...

833
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:14,580
I was astonished by her "Children's sumo"

834
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,050
Her breasts were completely exposed

835
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:22,290
And it indeed looked like "Children's sumo"   -Yes, it did

836
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:27,020
Tomochika was very close too, but she won by a hair   -Oh, really?

837
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,030
Yeah, because I laughed

838
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,330
Thanks to you, my sister

839
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,230
Shin-san?

840
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,600
If you say that I am Shin-san

841
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,700
Then maybe I am indeed Shin-san

842
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,940
What the heck is that?

843
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,100
She still has energy left over

844
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,010
Incredible

845
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,940
This is your prize, 10 million yen

846
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,850
I'm so happy! Thank you very much!

847
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,990
I'm happy for you   -Yes, very happy for you

848
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,020
Phew, that's a masterpiece

849
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:01,160
That is a masterpiece, and this is a kettle (similar pronunciation)

850
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,460
She still has plenty of energy left over!

851
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,800
No way, that's not energy

852
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,260
That's the same as Kanmuri-san

853
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,370
That was so close

854
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:13,540
Yes...

855
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,670
Well, but there's actually quite a lot of scenes where I almost laughed

856
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:21,410
Seriously, like the scene between Kanmuri-san and Shoji-san

857
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:24,480
Huh? What's your name again?

858
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,450
Many people say we look alike

859
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:30,450
You teased Maeda's dick with your foot, right?   -Yes

860
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,890
What were you thinking about at that time?

861
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,860
50 odd

862
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,660
When I ordered that tennis costume

863
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:43,300
I asked them to make it like those in vintage porn

864
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:48,070
The staffs from Amazon came to watch the recording too

865
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,510
They are four foreigners

866
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:53,440
Throughout the 6 hours, they laughed the hardest at that scene

867
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,810
Oh, so that was actually quite good?

868
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,810
It was funny for foreigners too

869
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,110
Oh, really?

870
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:02,790
Excuse me

871
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:05,020
Thank you for your hard work

872
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,190
Thank you very much

873
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,820
Congratulations   -Thank you

874
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,060
I'm so happy

875
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,790
This is my first time to hold so cash in real life...

876
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:13,360
*The pronunciation of "in real life", Nama, can also be interpreted as "sex without condom"

877
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:13,360
Although it sounds a bit lewd to say "in real life (nama)"

878
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,770
But I'm so happy

879
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:23,010
It was really like...umm...the world of dream

880
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:24,870
Everything was so interesting

881
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:29,150
I always hang out with Tomochika-san

882
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,150
And she taught me a lot of things

883
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:41,020
If I didn't always hang out and talk with Tomochika-san

884
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:47,560
I don't think we'll be able to improvise that Shin-san scene

885
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,730
We always do that kind of things and mess around in private

886
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:57,670
Although no one else is watching, we always do those things on our own

887
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,650
I can strongly feel them saying like "don't make light of female comedians"

888
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:08,480
Yuriyan was truly mind-blowing

889
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:14,220
It's actually okay to let Tomochika win as well, but...

890
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:20,530
Only the person at the top of this pyramid can take all of the money

891
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:23,730
Listen carefully

892
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,970
That teenager sumo...

893
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,570
I mean that children's sumo

894
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:31,610
That children's sumo just made me think "this dude is a true idiot"

895
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:33,440
They're the same

896
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,880
She looks the same as the souvenir popular among foreigners

897
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,020
But in opposite direction...

898
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,480
Ah, same now...

899
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:49,960
And for Tomochika, she has been rubbing and teasing Maeda's dick in that tennis look, right?

900
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,830
That's just an adult video

901
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,000
50 odd

902
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:01,500
Tomochika is just insane, right?
