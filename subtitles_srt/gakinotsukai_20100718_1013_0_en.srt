00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:07,240
"Shozo Endo's quiz - Maa Maa Maa!"

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:14,600
TN: "Maa Maa" is a word similar to OK. It can mean something is mediocre or so-so, and can also be used to calm people down (like "now now" or "Ok ok")

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,160
Maa Maa Ma Ma Maa Ma Maa Ma

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,400
Maa Maa Ma Ma Maa Ma Maa Maaaaaaaaaa

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,120
So it's begun, this is the Maa Maa Maa quiz

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,080
So this segment is my idea,

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,240
I can't believe they let you get away with this

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,360
Now now Hamada-san now now now that's Maa Maa

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,880
You sure do say Maa Maa a lot

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,840
Well, I entered the break rooms of male comedians,

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,840
And I just said "Maa Maa" until they let me kiss them

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,520
Who the hell cares

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,280
Hamada-san, Maa maa maa

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,160
So I went out and kissed some guys and filmed it, and that's what the quiz is gonna be about

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,600
Quiz?

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,120
They didn't know anything about this right?

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,040
Yes the other comedians didn't know anything
It's just a test to see if I can kiss them by just going "Maa Maa Maa"

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,720
Matsumoto-san what do you think? If I came in with a camera going "Maa Maa" and tried to kiss you?

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,840
That would be "Maa Maa" I guess

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,440
Well you said it

21
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:31,940

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:39,000
In this quiz, the members guess how long it takes Cocorico's Endo to kiss male comedians by saying only "Maa Maa"

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,880
They will win "Maa Maa" dolls for coming the closest

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,880
Well let's begin, this is our first target

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:55,830
London Boots - Tamura Ryo

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:55,830
Situtation - In front of the studio after recording

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,360
Ah Ryo?

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,880
It's Ryo from London Boots. We're the same age, but he is my junior

29
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:02,800
So I was waiting for him after an NTV shoot in front of the studio

30
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,200
Damn that's amazing actually

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,640
So, take it away!

32
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,360
Everyone reveal your answers please!

33
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:29,630
Matsumoto: 21 seconds - Hamada:  5 seconds  Yamasaki: 30 seconds - Tanaka: 3 minutes

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,040
Did that thing just go Maa Maa?

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,640
This is what you mean right?

36
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,280
Ah yes around 21 seconds?

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,000
I think after 21 seconds

38
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,120
I see

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,800
Hamada-san 5 seconds, thats quick

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,640
He's gonna go "Why? Why?", but the camera is there and you're his senior

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,800
I feel like he'll kiss you a bit, and then immediately pull away

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,600
5 seconds is quick though

43
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,600
It could be even quicker

44
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,760
5 seconds is quick indeed

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,720
Hosei-san?

46
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:54,400
Similiar to Matsumoto-san's guess. He'll go like "Wait what?" in the beginning, but yeah 30 seconds really

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
Tanaka-san, oh that's a long one! 3 minutes you wrote

48
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,520
Yeah I think on the contrary it's gonna take a while

49
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,590
I think you've stretched it too long

50
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,830
The correct answer will be revealed now

51
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,160
Man so many small details

52
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,810
Waiting for Ryo's recording to finish

53
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,720
Woah

54
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,640
Yeah I was waiting out here

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,760
This situation

56
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,560
Yeah not sure how this'll turn out

57
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,800
Here it starts

58
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,460
Ah, it's the time until the kiss? I thought it was how long

59
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,120
Yes, until the kiss

60
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,800
Now now, now now (he only says this)

61
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,840
Why?

62
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,920
I made it seem like I want to talk

63
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes

64
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,600
What is this?

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,840
Now now now now now now...

66
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,600
Wha-What?! What are you doing?!

67
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,080
NOW NOW NOW

68
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,240
What?

69
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,560
He's not really resisting

70
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,640
Oh, he saw theres a camera

71
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,440
Yes, he just checked

72
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,640
What are you doing?

73
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,200
There it is, almost there

74
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,400
Alright alright alright

75
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,120
I don't understand

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,420
I was checking to see if he'd bring his face closer

77
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,640
Damn! Tanaka,

78
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,120
I think my guess was close

79
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,240
WHAT DO YOU MEAN

80
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,880
WHAT-

81
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,100
Ok...

82
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,840
Wait!

83
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,320
No this is not Maa Maa (Okay)

84
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,760
Why'd you do it again?

85
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,960
That's not necessary! What's the point of that

86
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,960
Why'd you do it again? It has nothing to do with this

87
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,720
It's already over

88
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,480
Right?

89
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,480
That was too much

90
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,400
Eh? hold on please

91
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,920
Eh?

92
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,600
It's like I'm the one who did something wrong. What is this, seriously?

93
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,480
What is this?

94
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,920
Alright, the closest answer is Yamasaki-san!

95
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,040
He wins 2 dolls!

96
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,440
Thank you very much

97
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,360
I just got it

98
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,400
I thought it was the length of the kiss

99
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,960
And we've got a woman - A rather Maa Maa (not bad) woman

100
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,680
You can't say that man

101
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,240
Thank you very much

102
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,480
She seems Maa Maa (fairly) angry!

103
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Incidentally, the kisses in the videos,

104
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,000
I want to know what you think, there are these Maa Maa buttons. If you think it was a pretty good kiss please press it

105
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,440
Is it possible to not understand someone this much?

106
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,080
What are you saying?

107
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,680
Well just try it out

108
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,160
Maa Maa

109
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,000
If you think its a Maa Maa (decent) kiss then press it

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,920
If I think that then I'll press it

111
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,560
Moving on, the next target is;

112
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:55,800
Miyagawa Daisuke

113
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:55,800
Situation - Backstage after recording

114
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,000
So here we go

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,880
There it is

116
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,680
Daisuke-san...

117
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,520
I think his switch flips on quicjly

118
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,640
This is a tough one...

119
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,160
It's possible that Daisuke will be very eager

120
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,440
I see. Well please write your answers!

121
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,720
I don't think he won't do it

122
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,160
I think he will do it

123
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,800
Yes indeed

124
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,200
It's a question of how many seconds

125
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,600
I think I got it now finally

126
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,000
Please guess the time until the kiss, if you think he'll do it

127
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,880
So, let's reveal the answers!

128
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,080
Matsumoto-san says 17 seconds. So faster than Ryo?

129
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,100
Matsumoto: 17 seconds - Hamada: 20 seconds

130
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,680
I think, Daisuke would do it even faster if there was no camera

131
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,650
Yamasaki: 15 seconds - Tanaka: 6 seconds

132
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,680
For real?

133
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,750
Daisuke is OK with men and women of all ages

134
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,120
So no camera just going Maa Maa?

135
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,640
Daisuke-kun is OK with anything except old men

136
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,280
So if there was no camera and someone like Tanaka went in?

137
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,480
Yes he would kiss him

138
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,400
I think this is the fastest possible time

139
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:13,150
Daisuke returns to his break room after recording

140
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,640
Please relax in here

141
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,160
Ah, he's smoking. But Endo still has to kiss him right?

142
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,600
Yes exactly

143
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,620
Endo smokes too right?

144
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,400
Ah yeah

145
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,040
Alright it's begun

146
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,520
Yup he's gone in

147
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,960
If it was 6 seconds then it would be here

148
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,840
Ahh here huh?

149
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,160
See, this situation...

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,440
What do you mean "Maa Maa"?

151
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,240
Yeah of course he would say that

152
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,120
Oh dear!

153
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,040
Eh?

154
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,720
What is this?

155
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,800
Maa Maa Maa. Maa Maa.

156
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,480
What the hell is this?

157
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,680
Seriously what is this

158
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,520
No not "Maa Maa"!

159
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,240
How many times are you gonna do it?!

160
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,080
Seriously, how many times?

161
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,000
Where are you going?

162
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,560
Hold on, what?

163
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,480
Who is this?

164
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,980
What is this?

165
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,160
So Hamada-san wins!

166
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,800
Thank you

167
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,800
It was 24 seconds!

168
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,880
As expected, Daisuke's switch flips quickly

169
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,280
Yeah it did

170
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,700
So how was the video? If you think it was great please press the Maa Maa button!

171
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,240
Maa Maa. Maa Maa.

172
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,400
I'm the only one who looks like an idiot

173
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,560
So let's keep on going. The next target is;

174
00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:04,420
Ogi Hiroaki

175
00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:04,420
Situation - TV Station Parking Lot

176
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,600
Well basically I haven't really worked with him before,

177
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,400
I see

178
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,760
I've barely ever talked to him either

179
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,960
And well I just wanted to say this now,

180
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,900
He's wearing glasses right? I think that's something to consider

181
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,840
But Daisuke was wearing them too

182
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,960
Maa Maa. Maa Maa.

183
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,760
You're pressing it for that?

184
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,480
Matsumoto: Doesn't -  Hamada: 50 seconds  Yamasaki: 25 seconds - Tanaka: 1 min 25 seconds

185
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:29,360
These are the 4's guesses. So, just what time will it be?

186
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,390
This is not good!

187
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:45,230
Ogi arrives at the NTV parking lot

188
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,040
Here we go

189
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,280
There's someone else

190
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,900
Yeah

191
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,400
After he gets out...

192
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,000
After he gets out

193
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,680
Maa Maa Maa

194
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,080
This is so scary

195
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,480
What is this?

196
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,760
What is it?

197
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,320
You scared me, what is this?

198
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,280
No not "Maa Maa"

199
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,920
He's going to make this difficult

200
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,040
Yeah

201
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,360
It's a matter of whether or not he even does it

202
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,120
Here we go, here we go

203
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,240
Alright

204
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,480
Hosei-san's 25 seconds is coming up soon

205
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,600
C'mon do it!

206
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,280
Do it!

207
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,470
What is it? (x2)

208
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,000
Sorry I don't understand

209
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,880
Endo hurry up and move in!

210
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,480
Yeah

211
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,120
Hold on!

212
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,360
He almost went for it there

213
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,560
Yeah

214
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,720
What?

215
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,880
I think Tanaka got it

216
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,000
Yes

217
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,360
Ah there he goes

218
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,680
Wasn't that too long?

219
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,130
What?

220
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,240
Wh- What?

221
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,800
Why do you do it twice?!

222
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,280
It's always unnecessary!

223
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,680
You don't have to do it twice!

224
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,360
His glasses are coming off too

225
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,880
He's really going at it

226
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
What is this?

227
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,920
So Hamada-san wins!

228
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,560
Thank you very much

229
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,520
You win 2 more Maa Maa dolls

230
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,040
But Endo, Ogi leaned into it once

231
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:30,800
It's a difficult thing to handle. If I do it too soon he might back away, so I have to wait a bit

232
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,400
It's something that does happen

233
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,840
You don't know until you try it huh?

234
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,920
Yes, not until you try it

235
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
Well I'm not gonna do it though

236
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,680
That was quick

237
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,520
Maa Maa

238
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,120
Maa Maa

239
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,790
So there's still more-

240
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,880
YOU HAVE SO MANY

241
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,960
How can you be so good at this

242
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,160
# 4

243
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:01,000
Irie Shinya

244
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:01,000
Break Room at Yoshimoto HQ

245
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,160
The target this time is Yoshimoto's Irie

246
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:06,600
These are their guesses. Hamada who won twice in a row wrote 30 seconds. How will this turn out?

247
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:07,010
Matsumoto: 43 seconds - Hamada: 30 seconds Yamasaki: 52 seconds - Tanaka: 32 seconds

248
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:23,460
Irie enters a room at Yoshimoto HQ for a meeting

249
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,280
OK Start

250
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,120
Good morning!

251
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,560
He saw the TV, he saw the camera

252
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,760
He saw the camera yeah

253
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,200
He's looking around, he thinks he's gonna get hit maybe

254
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,000
What is this

255
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,600
What is it?

256
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,040
So quick!

257
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,800
That was so quick!

258
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,040
This is bad!

259
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,000
What is this?!

260
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,480
GOD DAMN! What are you doing?!

261
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,960
Too quick

262
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,040
You've got your mouth open!

263
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,280
I'm just creeped out

264
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,760
Hamada-san continues to win!

265
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,480
Some more Maa Maa dolls for you

266
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,320
3 in a row is impressive

267
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,960
What kind of talent is this?

268
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,320
#5!

269
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:25,020
Himura Yuki

270
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:25,020
Situation - At a pub after work

271
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,720
The target this time, the #1 kissing comedian, Bananaman's Himura

272
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,680
The 4's guesses are as shown. Will Hamada win a miraculous 4th time?!

273
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:31,020
Matsumoto: Doesn't do it -  Hamada: 46 seconds
Yamasaki: 53 seconds - Tanaka: 1 min 15 seconds

274
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,800
Ah this kind of place

275
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:48,840
Himura arrives to have a meal after work

276
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,920
Ah his manager is there

277
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,520
Doing this would surprise him

278
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,480
He was super surprised

279
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,280
I see

280
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,200
Maa Maa Maa Maa Maa

281
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,800
That's a great face he's making

282
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,280
Maa Maa Maa

283
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,700
What?

284
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,160
Certainly, as Endo said...

285
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,880
What is this seriously?

286
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,160
It's hard to time this

287
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,120
It's so difficult to decide

288
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,920
It is, he can't close the distance at all

289
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,000
If I do it too quickly he'll run away

290
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,480
Ehhh what what what is this seriously

291
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,800
Yeah this is still not the moment

292
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,120
Yeah he can't do it now

293
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,920
Yeah

294
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,440
Eh?

295
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,960
I see, it can turn out like this too

296
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,800
I see

297
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,040
When it gets like this...

298
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,360
You go all the way

299
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,520
Oh my, he's crying!

300
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,160
He did cry

301
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,280
He cried?

302
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,240
What is this?

303
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,600
So Tanaka won this round!

304
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,080
I see

305
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,640
Thank you

306
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,000
Everyone else please try your best

307
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
Why did he cry?

308
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:41,440
I don't know. He said he didn't have any emotions of anguish or happiness or sadness or anything, he just started crying on his own

309
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,440
Then he's pregnant

310
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,200
Crying with no emotion

311
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,640
Is what he said

312
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,800
Alright, lets move on to the next target

313
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,640
The next target is this

314
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:57,540
Kaneda Akira

315
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:57,540
Situation - In the washroom of Yoshimoto HQ

316
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,040
Hanya's Kaneda

317
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,560
This one is super serious

318
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,040
He's really quite a germaphobe

319
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,440
He doesn't really kiss women either, even though he's a comedian

320
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,480
This time I headed to Yoshimoto's HQ

321
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,680
I waited for Kaneda to enter the washroom, and then barged in with the camera

322
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,080
The washroom?

323
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,160
The washroom

324
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,570
Matsumoto: 3 min 15 sec - Hamada: 3 min 32 sec
Yamasaki: Doesn't do it - Tanaka: 1 min

325
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,400
This time it's the germaphobe Kaneda. Will Endo be able to kiss him?

326
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,280
There he is

327
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,120
Kaneda heads to Yoshimoto HQ for a meeting

328
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,240
Kaneda who knows nothing

329
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,960
I think this is gonna be a difficult one

330
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,360
Everyone seems to smoke

331
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,600
Oh right, you'll wait for him in the washroom?

332
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,920
Oh right, the washroom

333
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,440
He's moving!

334
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,840
He's going to the washroom I think

335
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,760
After he finishes peeing?

336
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,960
No I enter right away

337
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,080
Oh right away?

338
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,560
Good morning

339
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,920
Maa Maa Maa Maa

340
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,920
Man this is scary, it's in the washroom too

341
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,200
Eh?

342
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,760
What is it?

343
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,080
What is it? Wait wait wait what is it?!

344
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,280
Hold on! What is this, seriously!

345
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,760
Look!

346
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,720
Nobody has resisted this much before

347
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,760
Wow!

348
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,400
AHHH WHAT IS THIS

349
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,840
You're just forcing him!

350
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,880
OW!

351
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,840
He's trying so hard to escape

352
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,040
STOP WAIT WHAT IS THIS SERIOUSLY

353
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,320
AHHH SERIOUSLY

354
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,120
Seriously

355
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,560
Woahh look

356
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,040
Amazing

357
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,160
Interesting

358
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,640
This is amazing

359
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,920
He ran away

360
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,120
Maa Maa!

361
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,600
He went inside?

362
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,040
Yeah

363
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,840
I was so surprised by this

364
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,680
Maa Maa Maa!

365
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,780
Hold on! What is this?

366
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,410
"Maa Maa Maa"

367
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,310
This could be Yama-chan's win

368
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,180
Yeah it's gotta be mine

369
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,620
What do you mean "Maa Maa"?!

370
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,020
It's like a studio apartment

371
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,790
What is this for real?

372
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,730
It really is! It's like a studio!

373
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,110
Stop! Honestly!

374
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,780
What's he gonna do now?

375
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,480
OW!

376
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,980
He ran away!

377
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,150
What?!

378
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,550
He ran away for real

379
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,850
He did it

380
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,990
Unexpectedly, Kaneda escapes!

381
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,090
He's looking for him

382
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,500
What is this

383
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,100
For real, this guy...

384
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,340
He really doesn't wanna do this

385
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,440
Oh he's there

386
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,210
Wow

387
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,910
This guy...

388
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,780
He really did run away

389
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,820
Maa!

390
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,520
What is "Maa"?!

391
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,660
He didn't kiss him

392
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,550
I see

393
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,360
Ahh I see

394
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,690
Yamasaki-san wins!

395
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,500
Unexpectedly, he didn't do it

396
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:49,930
Even though his senior walked in with a camera going Maa Maa

397
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:54,470
I really did think "The young people these days don't get it"

398
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,310
He really hated it

399
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,510
He made me work so hard

400
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,350
He hit the camera so many times and still ran away

401
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,410
I see

402
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,220
The last target is this

403
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:13,060
Break room before recording

404
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:13,060
Sekine Tsutomu

405
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,590
Sekine-san huh

406
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,160
Damn Sekine-san...

407
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
You all know Sekine Tsutomu-san of course

408
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:19,500
Matsumoto: 8 sec - Hamada: 1 min 22 sec
Yamasaki: 1 min 30 sec -  Tanaka: 1 min 40 sec

409
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:19,460
Their guesses are as shown. How will Endo kiss his important senior?

410
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,440
Sekine enters the break room

411
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,950
Oh it's curry

412
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,590
Good morning

413
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,330
Maa Maa. Maa Maa.

414
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,340
He's eating curry too

415
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,110
Maa Maa?

416
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,580
Maa Maa?

417
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,680
Mmhmm

418
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,550
He's so cautious

419
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,790
What is it man

420
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
He pulled back

421
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,260
Of course he pulled back

422
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,900
You want some?

423
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,470
What is it?

424
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,240
What (x2)

425
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,910
Hmm?

426
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,510
That was rather quick

427
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,050
That was really rather quick

428
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,720
Are you an idiot?

429
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,220
How long are you gonna do it for?!

430
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,260
As expected!

431
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,660
Well done!

432
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,530
Brilliant

433
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,030
His switch flipped

434
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,300
I wanted to see this

435
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,800
I wanted to see this!

436
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,410
The mount

437
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,780
Amazing!

438
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,950
It really was amazing

439
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,020
Maa Maa

440
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,260
Like "We can still do it"

441
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,630
Yeah he was giving off that vibe

442
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,900
So Hamada-san wins!

443
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,600
Of course!

444
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,470
The winner this time is Hamada-san!

445
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:51,550
So the winner Hamada gets a portrait drawn by mangaka Yaku Mitsuru-sensei

446
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,190
I think he'll be Maa Maa happy

447
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,860
I think you'll be Maa Maa happy. Congratulations

448
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,260
Thank you very much. Thank you for this.

449
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,200
So that was the Maa Maa Maa quiz

450
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,860
Is there a part 2?

451
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,600
No way

452
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,940
I asked if we should do it again, and the staff said go for it

453
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,540
They're making the preparations?

454
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,840
They are

455
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,470
Some strange preparations...

456
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:41,000
