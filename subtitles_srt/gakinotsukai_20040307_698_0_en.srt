If you think "this is the card" then it won't be.

38
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,520
It won't be, right

39
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,520
Exactly

40
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,570
I wonder why

41
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,570
That's right

42
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,620
There's times where you don't want a card

43
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,870
but you have to take it

44
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:01,350
'past' based on the given topic.

00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:01,350

00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:01,350
a

47
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:01,350
card will have to tell a story from their

48
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,150
That does happen

49
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,470
But there's nothing you can do.

50
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,100
That's true

51
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,450

59
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,600
It's getting warm out, huh

60
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,600
It is getting warm

61
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,550
Very warm

62
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,270
Well,

63
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,270
I think you all,

64
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,550
probably don't know me very well...

65
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,550
What do you mean?

66
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,550
Well,

67
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,390
there's something I wanted to tell you guys about...

68
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,400
Seriously?

69
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,200
Yes

70
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,820
Have you ever ridden in a time machine?

71
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,150
There's no way we could've

72
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,150
That's impossible

73
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,850
No, right?

74
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,850
Of course not

75
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Well I have.

76
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,920
Again with this...

77
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,920
I rode in a time machine,

78
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,420
and went back and forth

79
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,600
between the past and the future.

80
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,900
Recently?

81
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,020
I stopped doing it.

82
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,420
When, then?

83
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,820
When was this?

84
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,170
I actually, uh

85
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,520
used to go to an

86
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,520
American high school

87
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:17,850
Wait, you went to Teshima Elementary School.

88
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,350
Wait, you went to Teshima Elementary School.

89
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,720
But I went to an American high school.

90
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,100
Oh, just for high school

91
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,100
Just high school.

92
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,300
I never knew where you went

93
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,900
I used to

94
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,500
ride a skateboard to school

95
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,170
Just kinda

96
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,550
I can't even imagine that

97
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,550
I really did.

98
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,120
And in my neighborhood,

99
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,670
uhhh,

100
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,600
There was like

101
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,600
this idiot scientist

102
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,520
"idiot scientist"

103
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,520
"idiot scientist"

104
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,800
There was a scientist,

105
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
He was pretty old.

106
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:44,800
Oh, an old guy.

107
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,850
Yes.

108
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,970
And he

109
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,670
"finally did it"

110
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,670
He "finally made a time machine"

111
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,270
Yea, some old guys say that kind of stuff

112
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,270
A lot of them do

113
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,520
You shouldn't talk to those guys

114
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,520
"It must be something else!"

115
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,820
They just want some money

116
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,820
Is that what they want?

117
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,780
But no.

118
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,530
I thought he meant something else,

119
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,480
but when I checked it out

120
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,060
There was a car

121
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,610
That was the time machine.

122
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,910
Well you hear that story a lot,

123
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,110
about those guys

124
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,240
Right??

125
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,230
Cars are quite ordinary aren't they?

126
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,840
Right?

127
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,570
But when I got in,

128
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,480
before I knew it

129
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,430
I was in the past.

130
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,040
What time period did you go back to?

131
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,850
50's (1950's)

132
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,490
The 50's?!

133
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,040
I went back to the 50's!

134
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,740
50's...

135
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,960
I was like "is this real?"

136
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,690
And then,

137
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:32,260
Someone...

138
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,560
Someone fell in love

139
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,190
...who?

140
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,090
Be a little more specific!

141
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,090
Who fell in love?

142
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,540
My mom

143
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,560
Your mom?

144
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,560
My mom.

145
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,300
Your mother?

146
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,360
My mother,

147
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,270
She...

148
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,500
It was the past, so she was really young

149
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:49,710
Oh,

150
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,710
Since it's the 50's

151
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,710
Right right right

152
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,960
My own mother,

153
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,470
fell in love

154
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,370
with me.

155
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,090
Do you understand what that means?

156
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,650
If I messed

157
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,220
something up

158
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,520
I wouldn't ever be born.

159
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,690
That's right.

160
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,210
And then,

161
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,760
I was like "this is bad"

162
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,530
then,

163
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,430
I played some guitar...

164
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,360
Right, right...

165
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,400
This makes no sense.

166
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:21,980
Then,

167
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,330
My father,

168
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,900
My really young father was there

169
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,400
so I had to do something about it,

170
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,590
And at a party,

171
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,520
I hooked them up

172
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,190
"hooked them up?"

173
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,830
Yea.

174
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,120
Your mom and dad?

175
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,120
My parents

176
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,620
Your young parents

177
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,940
It sounds weird when you say you 'hooked them up'

178
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,940
That just sounds wrong

179
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,000
I hooked them up, and then

180
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,640
some lightning struck

181
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,640
and I was home

182
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:45,840
Yea

183
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,430
I don't understand

184
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,430
I don't get it

185
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,330
You're mixing up reality and...

186
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,330
He drank too much.

187
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,560
You were just drunk.

188
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,430
Were you drunk?

189
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,070
No no no

190
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,160
I hoped you would believe me

191
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,160
No...

192
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,160
It's true!

193
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,040
I mean...

194
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,410
No way that happened.

195
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,410
That's quite the story

196
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,680
Unbelievable...

197
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,500
Seriously

198
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
He's really gotta cut it out

199
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,930
Tensai
Bakabon

200
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:18,310
A Dad Ingenuously Does Stupid Things
With His Son, Bakabon, and Creates Chaos Around Town

201
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:18,310
Bakabon

202
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:18,310
Tensai Bakabon

203
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:18,310
r

204
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,960
I don't want this one

205
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,680
I don't know this one...

206
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,270
Please not me

207
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,340
Ready, flip.

208
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,180
Yamasaki

209
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,590
What's wrong?

210
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,930
Wanna head to the outside hot spring?

211
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,560
Wanna head to the outside hot spring?

212
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,390
What time does it close?

213
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,370
9:30

214
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,330
Let's go.

215
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,170
Wait a second!

216
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:37,590
What?

217
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,930
Can I tell you a story about my family?

218
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,300
Why now?

219
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,000
Why so suddenly?

220
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,160
Well...

221
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,410
My family,

222
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,410
We're a family of 4,

223
00:05:53,140 --> 00:06:00,180
and my dad is

224
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,180
well, an idiot...

225
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,180
well, an idiot...

226
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,020
You shouldn't say that about him

227
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,330
That's right.

228
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,330
Now,

229
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,850
when he sees this on TV,

230
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,460
he's gonna be real sad.

231
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,830
I mean...

232
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,810
"My dad is an idiot"?!

233
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,200
It's not something you say...

234
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,610
I know that, but

235
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,610
And we don't know what to say either

236
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,610
Right?

237
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,320
I'm really sorry, but

238
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,730
How far in school did he get?

239
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,880
He graduated from a college.

240
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,920
What, then he's not an idiot at all!

241
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
Maybe you've heard of the school,

242
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,740
It's uh,

243
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,930
Idiot University

244
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:29,930
What is that?

245
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,680
The hell is that

246
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,740
"Idiot University"?

247
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,180
A few times his friend came over,

248
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,760
Oh, I've heard this

249
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,050
Like he lost something right next to himself

250
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:38,860
Exactly

251
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,270
Really?

252
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,270
Yea yea yea yea

253
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,020
Oh, that guy went to Idiot University?

254
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,760
He went to visit you guys?

255
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,520
That guy's arms,

256
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,620
they were really long

257
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,480
His arms were long?

258
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,600
I don't get it

259
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,600
No, his arms were normal, but

260
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,910
his sleeves?

261
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,910
his sleeves

262
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,560
His shirt sleeves?

263
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,560
they're unusually long.

264
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,240
And there was a guy
who wore a Tokyo University hat,

265
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,310
and pretty much everyone's noses...

266
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,270
were runny

267
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,690
Your father's friends?

268
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,460
Your friends?

269
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,690
Right.

270
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,370
My neighbor,

271
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,650
He was pretty weird too

272
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,880
In what way?

273
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,000
Like, he was always cleaning...

274
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,470
Some people are just like that

275
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,470
That's not that weird

276
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,060
That's pretty normal

277
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,460
No but,

278
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,920
with this giant bamboo broom,

279
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,920
he was constantly cleaning around his front door

280
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,770
What's wrong with that?

281
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,770
It helps make the neighborhood look nicer

282
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,600
He helped a lot

283
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,600
He helped a lot

284
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,600
by doing that

285
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,890
Making it clean

286
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,510
What did the guy used to say?

287
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,960
He would say

288
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:41,690
like,

289
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,100
Re re re no re~

290
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,860
or something like that

291
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,060
All he could say was 're'

292
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,690
"Re re re re"?

293
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,060
Re re re re

294
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,930
He was probably just messin' around with the kids

295
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,170
Well we never really got involved...

296
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,180
We were scared of him, so

297
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,190
So, you avoided him?

298
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,120
Then you should've talked to the police

299
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,980
Right, the police.

300
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,680
The policeman, he...

301
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,650
Over and over,

302
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,030
He would run towards us

303
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,930
just unloading.

304
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,060
Unloading what?

305
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,070
His gun.

306
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,070
What?!

307
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,930
There's no way!

308
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,090
Like 'bang bang bang bang bang!'

309
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,900
There's no way.

310
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,680
He can't do that

311
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,930
I know it's reckless but he was THE officer for that area

312
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,580
That's a problem

313
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,580
But that's how it was

314
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,580
What was his face like?

315
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:26,620
You know,

316
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,350
At first, I was scared so I couldn't see it.

317
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,460
But I took a good look after,

318
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,060
and his eyes were connected

319
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,060
and his eyes were connected

320
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,850
There's no way that's true

321
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,880
That's just idiotic.

322
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,970
Some people have connected eyebrows,

323
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,770
but this guy was his actual eyes

324
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,770
That's scary!

325
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,790
Seriously?

326
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,240
Oh yea?

327
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,310
You lived in a crazy place

328
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,300
That's amazing

329
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,310
After moving, my life's completely different though

330
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,150
You guys have a lot of interesting stories, huh.

331
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,640
That surprised me

332
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,150
That's just, ya know...

333
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,390
The Godfather

334
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:17,270
Michael Corleone
(Al Pacino)

335
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:17,270
The Godfather

336
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:17,270
The Mafia's Boss's Son Michael
Get's Caught in Some Family Trouble

337
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:17,270
r

338
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,650
Ready, flip.

339
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,020
Endo

340
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,070
But seriously, let's head to the hot spring

341
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,310
Alright, let's go

342
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,310
Yea

343
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,290
It's open 'til 9:30

344
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,290
Let's go

345
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,720
If we only get in by 9

346
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,890
we'll have to get right out

347
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,880
It's not enough time

348
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,750
It's too short

349
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,220
We'll have to get out quick

350
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,210
Should we bring some food?

351
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,350
Uhm, I'm really sorry, but

352
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,390
Sorry, I'll make this quick

353
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,370
Really? Are you serious?

354
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,380
What's wrong?

355
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,370
Just tell us in the...

356
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,970
It's not something I should
talk about in the hot spring.

357
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,570
What is it?

358
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,360
Well...

359
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,150
I'm sorry,

360
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,520
It's just there's a problem with my father...

361
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,890
Your dad too?

362
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,910
Yes.

363
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,890
He's, uhh

364
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,130
Well he's the Don

365
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,130
'the Don'?

366
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,200
of well,

367
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,970
a scary organization.

368
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,470
'the Don'?

369
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,460
He's the Don

370
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,910
And well,

371
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,640
He's in a dispute with
another scary organization

372
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,630
What's a 'scary organization'?

373
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,630
'scary organization'?

374
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,460
What kind of...

375
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,970
Put simply,

376
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,970
like the Mafia...

377
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,940
kind of.

378
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,880
And I don't think you'll believe me, but

379
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,810
Stuff like cutting off horse's heads,

380
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,270
and exchanging them.

381
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,770
"Exchanging"

382
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,770
Exchanging...

383
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,330
Horse heads?

384
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,750
What does that mean?

385
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,440
Just harassing each other.

386
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,720
Since they're quarreling.

387
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,930
Oh, with the other scary organization?

388
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,220
But I said I didn't wanna join the family business.

389
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,690
Well of course, it's scary

390
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,180
I was done with it.

391
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,930
Actually, this is

392
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,020
a really long story...

393
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,620
You said you'd make it quick

394
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,810
Well, there's a lot of different parts to it.

395
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:13,470
But in the End

396
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:13,470
But in the End

397
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,470
I Followed in His Footsteps

398
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,470
I Followed in His Footsteps

399
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,440
Wait, you followed in his footsteps??

400
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,440
You're in the Mafia?!

401
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,640
Unfortunately,

402
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,560
I'm kinda the

403
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,560
I'm kinda the

404
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
Don now

405
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,100
What the hell?

406
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,630
I mean,

407
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,410
it's complicated, you know

408
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,820
That's scary

409
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,020
The End?

410
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,820
But anyway,

411
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,060
that's it.

412
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,060
After hearing that,

413
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,430
What's wrong with you!

414
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,420
we can't just go to the hot spring!

415
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,440
Seriously, though

416
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,360
But It's not like that anymore, so

417
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,560
You ruined the fun!

418
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,570
I'm really sorry.

419
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,060
Space Battleship Yamato

420
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:03,390
Kodai Susumu

421
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:03,390
Space Battleship Yamato

422

To Save the Earth From Crisis, Kodai Susumu
and His Girlfriend Mori Yuki Embark on a Space Battleship...

r

424
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,540
Ready, flip

Matsumoto

426
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,180
I'm really lucky today

427
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,170
Very lucky.

428
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,300
Amazing

429
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,300
Right?

430
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,800
Incredible

431
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,800
Truly.

432
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,470
Ready to go?

433
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,480
Let's go!

434
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,940
Let's go already.

435
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,640
Alright

436
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,270
Really, though

437
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,770
Hey hey hey hey hey

438
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,730
Now now now, now now now

439
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,260
What?

440
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,650
We're gonna go, but

441
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,200
just sit down for a second

442
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,750
What is it?

443
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,400
We don't have much time, so

444
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,140
I have something I gotta talk about

445
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,980
uhhh,

446
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,310
Destruction...

447
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,060
Let's go, guys

448
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,060
Wait wait wait wait

449
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,140
Let's go already

450
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,630
There was a time

451
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,720
when I prevented some destruction...

452
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,750
Destruction of what?

453
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,470
The earth...

454
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,480
"The earth"?!

455
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
You know,

456
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,400
I don't think you guys will believe me, but

457
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,370
I kinda protected the earth once.

458
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,640
Seriously?

459
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,640
For real?

460
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,740
Yea.

461
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,250
There's no way you'll believe me, but

462
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,340
There was a really bad...

463
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,720
well it wasn't

464
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,720
a foreigner, but

465
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,470
Not a foreigner, but
like a foreigner to earth

466
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,490
Right

467
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,240
This story sounds important

468
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,240
Yea

469
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,040
This foreigner was
always drinking something

470
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,650
and he,

471
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,510
he would always come up

472
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,450
on this giant jumbo tron thing

473
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,960
What does he say when he comes on?

474
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,010
Like "Ladies and Gentlemen!"

475
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,350
Where are you guys

476
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,350
during this?

477
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,760
But you won't believe me, will you?

478
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,470
We don't know until you...

479
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,470
Just tell us

480
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,400
Well, it was a boat

481
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,650
called the Yamato.

482
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,380
Oh, I know about that

483
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,610
It's a pretty old one

484
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,890
It's famous

485
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,860
Right right right

486
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,480
We rode on the Battleship Yamato

487
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,930
You rode on it?

488
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,770
Well, yea, in space...

489
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,660
Huh?

490
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,220
Who else was with you?

491
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,250
Tare was also there*

492
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:12,060
*Translators note: Couldn't hear the name (Tare)

493
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,850
This girl,

494
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,240
She uh,

495
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,800
I don't really know why, but anyway

496
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,310
the boat had a special function,

497
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,080
where it could warp.

498
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,720
It disappears and reappears ahead.

499
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,170
And whenever we would warp...

500
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,400
and she was a beautiful girl,

501
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,320
but

502
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,640
She would become

503
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,640
completely naked

504
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,140
Only that one girl?

505
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,150
I wonder why

506
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,250
I remember it in my fantasies

507
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,080
I don't really get it...

508
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,360
But who cares about that.

509
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,360
But you know,

510
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,970
I mean...

511
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,270
The parts I never saw...

512
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,810
The parts I never saw...

513
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,060
Honestly, I don't know

514
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,340
anything about this either

515
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,820
Yea...

516
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,820
Not a thing.

517
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,310
I really wanna hear

518
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,310
a story from Hamada-san

519
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,070
Me too

520
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,280
It can't end until he tells one

521
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,860
Maybe he doesn't want to?

522
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,040
I don't have any stories!

523
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,770
We don't need excuses, flip the paper

524
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,800
Alright

525
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,590
So it doesn't matter if I'm lucky?

Ok, let's leave

532
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,240
Wait, do I have to tell this story?

533
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,420
Well, everyone else already went

534
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,420
It would be our second time.

535
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,400
What should we do

536
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,680
Something happened though, right?

537
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,670
What happened?

538
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,680
Just briefly...

539
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,370
Well...

540
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,640
I'm married, right

541
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,640
Right.

542
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,310
The truth is...

543
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,800
What

544
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,890
Up until I got married,

545
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,650
I kind of wanna hear this now

546
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,890
I used a matchmaking service

547
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,370
Really?

548
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,260
A matchmaking service?

549
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,260
I've never heard this

550
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,100
I mean like,

551
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,100
100 times

552
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:10,850
Wait wait wait

553
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,890
That many times?

554
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,900
That's crazy

555
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,220
Were you always that unpopular?

556
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,010
Did you wanna get married that badly?

557
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,310
Even though it's not me, I feel...

558
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,330
It's kinda weird

559
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,100
Did you always break up with them?

560
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,120
No, they all broke up with me.

561
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,150
Every single time?

562
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,020
This is depressing

563
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,010
Really.

564
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,450
No matter what I said to them...

565
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,370
It never worked, huh

566
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,650
Like, I'll protect you...

567
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,410
"I'll protect you for 50 years"

568
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,560
Ah, that's too heavy

569
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,730
It's too much

570
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,060
Too much.

571
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,060
That's offputting.

572
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,050
I see

573
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,570
I was always thinking

574
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,600
about what I should say

575
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,770
you know

576
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,660
And what I thought of

577
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,200
for the 101st girl

578
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,770
was eventually,

579
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,810
to jump in front of a truck.

580
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,800
No no no

581
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:09,760
Why?

582
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:09,760
You can't

583
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
That's dangerous

584
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
You'd get hurt

585
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,600
You'd die

586
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,200
But I said

587
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,470
"I ain't

588
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,470
'gon die!"

589
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,710
to her.

590
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,120
That's so weird

591
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,310
There's no way that worked on her.

592
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,820
Absolutely no way.

593
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,550
Why did you
propose with "I ain't 'gon die"?

594
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
What the hell is

595
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,640
'ain't 'gon die'?

596
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,490
Like, even if I get hit

597
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,630
I'll protect you,

598
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,200
or something like that.

599
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,680
But that wouldn't work

600
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,670
That's too much

601
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,910
The 101st time was also unsuccessful

602
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,330
No, but the truth is...

603
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,930
The truth is she's...

604
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,430
my current wife

605
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,250
So weird!

606
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,310
It's been a while

607
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,460
It has...

608
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,690
These are the people

609
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,250
who we sent home when they wouldn't cheer last week

610
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,580
Oh, this crowd?

611
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,140
Well, not everyone, but

612
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,150
Oh, but generally

613
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,970
I see

614
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,970
I really uh,

615
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,930
went too far, so I got on
the ground to apologize

616
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,490
I wasn't strong enough,

617
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,720
so I had to send you home."

618
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,220
And I asked them to at least

619
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,380
give them some Anko Buns

620
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,560
Anko buns?

621
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,550
At least some Anko buns

622
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,410
But since I was weak,

623
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,060
they gave them meat buns.

624
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,060
Isn't that better though

625
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,060
Oh really?

626
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,060
Meat buns are better than anko buns?

627
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,870
Between those two, yea

628
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,870
Is that so

629
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,400
That's true, anko buns really...

630
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,310
piss me off.

631
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,300
Really?

632
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,070
Like "what's up with that anko bun"

633
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,100
Well some people like them

634
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,110
Seriously?

635
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,770
Probably.

636
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,780
Are you serious?

637
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,450
People like sweet food...

638
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,970
It's sweet, but

639
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,630
there's no point in heating it up

640
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,340
Recently, have you...

641
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,180
said "Huhhh!?" at all?

642
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,470
Like, to a person?

643
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,500
Yea, to a person.

644
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,740
You mean have I snapped?

645
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,770
Yea like, flipped out

646
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,280
I haven't

647
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,450
"Huh?", right?

648
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,850
Like "Huhhh!?"

649
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,840
Not recently

650
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,560
I've been alive for,

651
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,800
40 years, right?

652
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,620
And I've said "Huhhh!?" plenty of times,

653
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,600
Yea, yea

654
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,810
but recently I said the biggest one of all.

655
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,800
What was the situation?

656
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,310
I just couldn't hold it in.

657
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,320
I never thought I'd let out one like that.

658
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,000
There'll probably never be a "Huhhh!?"

659
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,820
bigger than this one in my life.

660
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,270
Really?

661
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,270
Yes.

662
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,510
Tell me, what happened.

663
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,110
Well,

664
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,450
I was drinking at like a bar

665
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,430
Right right right

666
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,810
Right?

667
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,800
Right.

668
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,250
A place with just a counter.

669
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
yea yea yea

670
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,820
Two old ladies come in,

671
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,850
right?

672
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,510
And they were really drunk.

673
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,790
I guess they were regulars there.

674
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,790
I see

675
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,650
So they were really drunk and happy

676
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,850
Then one of them,

677
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:49,720
she said "my bra feels weird."

678
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,110
I was like "what is she saying?"

679
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,640
"My bra feels weird"

680
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,150
This old lady was saying.

681
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,180
Even then, I was like "Huhh!?"

682
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,000
No one wants to hear
that in such a loud voice

683
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,360
Oh, in the bar

684
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,730
It has nothing to do with me

685
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,730
Right, right.

686
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,050
Absolutely nothing to do with me.

687
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,050
Exactly.

688
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,050
"What is she saying?"

689
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,990
That's reverse sexual harassment!

690
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,630
But I just ignored them and didn't look.

691
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,420
It felt weird I guess, so

692
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,080
one put her
hand under the other's sweater

693
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,220
trying to unhook the bra.

694
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,220
Okay.

695
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,460
Like "more to the
front, no towards the back."

696
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,770
"Woohoo, woohoo!"

697
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,640
I just thought
"I'm definitely not gonna look"

698
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,850
I kept ignoring it, but I could tell what was happening by the conversation, right?

699
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,860
I get it.

700
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,080
I know what they're doing, but I just thought "hurry up and finish it already."

701
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,420
And at this point,

702
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,080
no one ever thought,

703
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,340
a "Huhhh!?" that big

704
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,110
Not at this point.

705
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,420
would ever come out.

706
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:53,360
Then they were probably
trying to take off the bra to fix it.

707
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,630
I wasn't watching, but.

708
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,150
Then they said,

709
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,640
"oh, you try to get it off" or something.

710
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,350
I wasn't looking but that's
probably what they were doing.

711
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,770
At one point they got really excited,

712
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,770
Like "WOO!"

713
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,100
Then, just to kinda say

714
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,880
'alright, that's enough',

715
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,060
I quickly looked for like a second.

716
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,540
Then one of the old ladies said

717
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,350
"Stop staring, stop staring, you creep!"

718
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,360
"HUHHH!?"

719
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,540
Pen name 'Kugetto-san"

720
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,840
What kind of pen name is that?

721
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,850
"I hav..."

722
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,240
"I have a question for the famous leader of the Church of Thieves."

723
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:45,340
"What is the most awkward thing for a thief to steal?"

724
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,800
Oh, that?

725
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,450
There sure are some.

726
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,310
You know them, right?

727
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,330
Of course I know them.

728
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,100
Like, 'of course this won't get stolen'?

729
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,570
Things any humane robber wouldn't take,

730
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,020
of course there's some things.

731
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,040
Oh, really.

732
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,230
Thieves are people too, after all.

733
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,230
That's right

734
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,540
There's some things.

735
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,110
Then what are they?

736
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,600
Don't think you can get the answer

737
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,880
so easily.

738
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,770
Don't think I'll answer
just anything right away.

739
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,390
I'm not a drum that will give you a sound right away

740
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,830
I don't know about that, but just tell us.

741
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,850
What do you mean?

742
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,840
I mean,

743
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:55,020
This video was brought to you by Tofu Panda Fansubs

744
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,200
What do
you think it is?

745
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,270
What's the most awkward thing for a thief to steal?

746
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,270
What do you think?

747
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,920
Are you coming up with it right now?

748
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,000
Should I skip it?

749
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,280
'Am I coming up with it'?

750
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,200
It's not something you come up with.

751
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,130
Then please tell us.

752
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,140
Tell you what

753
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,710
Tell us what's the most
awkward thing to steal for a thief.

754
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,190
Awkward thing?

755
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,600
Yea.

756
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,970
No idea. Shoes, maybe?
