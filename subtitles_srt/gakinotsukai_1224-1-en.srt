1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,720
Gaki no Tsukai presents the 1st,

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,020
"Stake your life on this one bite for a chance to win ¥100,000"

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,190
KIKI Cheese!!

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,760
It's the 36th Kiki episode.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,230
I noticed something amazing.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,160
What is it?

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,840
No, what I mean is... It said this is the 36th one from the Kiki series, right.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,870
I've won it 6 times.

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,270
That's impressive!

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,210
That means I've won 1/6 times.

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,910
Kiki Series' winning percentage of 16.7%

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,640
Ain't that one hell of a winning percentage.

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,140
How about it, guys? In this Kiki...

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,020
Holy shit, you stink!!

15
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,550
Yeah actually, this is pretty embarrassing.

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:41,090
Kiki Series' winning percentage of 8.3%

17
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,320
I've really lost confidence in my senses.

18
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,100
It's been 10 years since you've won any.

19
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,020
2004 was his latest win.

20
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:47,130
Last time he won was for Kiki Miso in 2004

21
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,620
10 years?

22
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,920
It's been 10 years.

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,060
Man, I can't remember...

24
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,560
I haven't won any since the divorce.

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,960
Last time he won was for Kiki Oolong in 2003.

26
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,960
It's because of the divorce.

27
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,170
You also failed on the Kiki marriage.

28
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,370
The rules are quite simple.

29
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,210
Out of the 12 brands of cheese, you just have to find your selected cheese.

30
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,180
If correct, you'll win ¥100,000. Who will walk away with the reward?

31
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,380
The first challenger is Tanaka.

32
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,750
The number of cheeses has really increased, eh?

33
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,260
His selection is Koiwai Dairy's Creamy Cheese 6P.

34
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,760
From the mellow scented fermented butter

35
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,360
comes a rich flavor and a smooth texture.

36
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,300
Will he be able to remember this taste?

37
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,440
I'm going to smell it first.

38
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,540
Don't the elementary schools serve it during lunchtime?

39
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,240
Yup, we ate the thin ones  at school.

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,110
Eh, no way.

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
Yup.

42
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,150
Ours was block shaped.

43
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,980
They served it melted.

44
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,120
That's right!

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,180
Nope, it was triangular.

46
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,120
Really?

47
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,820
Yes, yes, yes, it was triangular.

48
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,090
I wonder if I've had it...

49
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,030
Whoa, this is delicious but,

50
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,330
it's too simpley...

51
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,600
Huh? What did you just say?

52
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,400
It's like "the cheese".

53
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,840
...like the father of all cheese.

54
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,570
I suppose so.

55
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,480
That was dangerous.

56
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,780
Whoa, whoa whoa, you held out really well just now.

57
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,500
Hamada-san, that was dangerous just now.

58
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,960
You already knew it was Hamada.

59
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,750
Why me?

60
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,890
Anyways, you've gotta pick one and try it.

61
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,950
I'm sure you've had this before.

62
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,650
Yes I have.

63
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,090
This Yukijirushi's...

64
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,390
Did the package change a bit?

65
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,460
Seems so.

66
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,120
Hokkaido-

67
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,730
This one's the standard...

68
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,390
As always...

69
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,390
You've been saying 'standard' a lot recently.

70
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,680
Why do you keep saying it every time?

71
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,200
Aren't they all standard?

72
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,430
Bon Appétit!

73
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,500
Surprisingly, Tanaka and I've won on the same ones.

74
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,640
There's pudding, castella...

75
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,110
Looks like it.

76
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,510
Nope!

77
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,440
Nope?

78
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,410
I can tell.

79
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,240
Eh, you can?

80
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,750
Yeah.

81
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,680
Is it totally different?

82
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,280
Yup, it tastes totally different.

83
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,420
The taste?

84
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,480
What I had

85
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,650
was NOT Yukijirushi Hokkaido 100 Cheese.

86
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,020
Alright!

87
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,290
Were you sure about it?

88
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,460
I was.

89
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,960
Well come on, he always says that.

90
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,800
But in the end...

91
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,170
I reckon the milk's fragrance was much stronger.

92
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,900
The fragrance?

93
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,900
Yes.

94
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,170
Please continue.

95
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,240
I've heard quite a bit about this cheddar cheese.

96
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,640
Just stop!!

97
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,840
He's just sayin'.

98
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,110
What am I meant to do... Why would you say that...

99
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,350
Why does he need to stop?..

100
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,620
However, Tanaka's momentum doesn't stop there.

101
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,820
Ah, the flavor was much deeper, much richer.

102
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,390
With confidence, based on the taste...

103
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,790
...isn't Chedder Cheese 6P!

104
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,700
...isn't Baby Cheese Plain!

105
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,860
Making it swimmingly so far,

106
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,730
Tanaka clears through three in a row.

107
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,000
Having cleared this much, it's not the time to be praising just yet.

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,310
Family Mart

109
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,940
I'll give this a go.

110
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,980
This...

111
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,740
This is really gonna make us quite full.

112
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,710
How many...

113
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,110
I told them 12 is more than enough.

114
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,380
I'm sorry but it's 12.

115
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,820
What?

116
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,450
Well, there's 12 of them, yup.

117
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,890
"12 of them is more than enough", well, there's 12 of em.

118
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,320
My apologies.

119
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,030
You were trying to say that it should've been 10, right?

120
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,590
Yes, my apologies.

121
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,640
Anyone would make that mistake

122
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,300
Just to let you know, he's had a sudden change of expression.

123
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,470
I take my eyes off a second and his face turned like that.

124
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,970
Like he discovered something...

125
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,580
It's totally the same!!!

126
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,540
What did you sample again?

127
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,310
May I?!

128
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,250
Well, if that's the one, go for it...

129
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

130
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,850
If you're so sure then I suppose you've to go for it.

131
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,680
That's great man!

132
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,120
I'm going for it, for real.

133
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,320
What I had was Family Mart's 6P Cheese!

134
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,460
Come on!..

135
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,130
It was totally off.

136
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,170
Tanaka, you totally got it wrong.

137
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,300
Stop moving around.

138
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,210
Face your punishment properly.

139
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,010
It's time for the punishment.

140
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,200
He's so pissed!

141
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,150
You took ages after knowing you were wrong, just go to the front you idiot!

142
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,020
Nibble away at the cheese you filthy rat of a comedian!!

143
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,260
That lasted ages!

144
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,820
That was so long.

145
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,220
Ow, ow...

146
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,830
That would hurt.

147
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,930
Your face is completely frozen over!

148
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,500
Ow, Ow, ow...

149
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,500
Looks painful.

155
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,780
Next up is Endo.

156
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,780
We have to pick a simple one for Endo,

157
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,520
Thank you very much.

158
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,420
...since he's such an idiot~

159
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,160
Family Mart Collection 6P Cheese.

160
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:52,260
Butter mixed in Hokkaido cheese, this rich flavor is a one of a kind.

161
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,830
Go for it!

162
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,000
Uwaa, the sme- is quite something.

163
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,000
The sme-?

164
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,600
It just blew up in my face.

165
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,610
Compared to the cheese I'm aware of,

166
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,710
it's got a smoked smell to it.

167
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,240
It's not smoked at all...

168
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,480
Smoked cheese is totally different...

169
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,950
That would change everything...

170
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,680
Yeah.

171
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,480
He's such an idiot~

172
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,920
He's talking about the wooden board probably.

173
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,420
Looks like it.

174
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,880
You're smelling the board?

175
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,090
He's smelling the wooden board.

176
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,950
Smelling the board... What an idiot...

177
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,260
Endo is truly an idiot.

178
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,790
Well then, I've already narrowed it down. I think it's between these two.

179
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,660
I can't eat that much cheese so I'm going with this.

180
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm going to try Yukijirushi Hokkaido- 100 Cheese.

181
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,570
You were stressing so much on the smell earlier, seems like you gave up on it.

182
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,240
Ah, this feeling when I hold it...

183
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,180
This feeling when holding it is a bit...

184
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,410
You can't be serious, Endo?

185
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,760
Please give me a moment here.

186
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,850
If that's all you've got to go with, then you're in trouble.

187
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,620
He just wants screen time...

188
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,950
I wanna cut ties with him.

189
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,490
Because he always has short air-time in the Kiki episodes.

190
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,460
But this one is quite bitter.

191
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,260
That's the first I've heard of, cheese being bitter.

192
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,460
I couldn't describe it properly but I know what I meant.

193
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,230
Say it so we can understand...

194
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,270
What an idiot~

195
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,600
A very uniquely processed cheese that had no scent

196
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,340
and made sure that people of Japan would like the taste of Hokkaido...

197
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,540
Just stop!!

198
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,080
What's with you, this whole time?

199
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,050
Well then, excuse me but this isn't it.

200
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:23,190
What I had was not Yukijirushi Hokkaido 100% 100 Cheese!

201
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,220
He can't see because he's aging...

202
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,520
He is aging...

203
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,260
Alright, he withstood it.

204
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,060
What the- so this wasn't it.

205
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,360
You withstood it.

206
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,130
I sure did.

207
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,670
You were absolutely sure that was the one?

208
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,670
I did.

209
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,770
If that's the case, then it will be something I've never had before.

210
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,940
Well then, I'm going to try France now.

211
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,610
Oh!

212
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,740
Uwa! This is all... It's all mushy, totally not it.

213
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,550
Ah, uha ha ha ha ha~

214
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,250
He's really making a mock out of this.

215
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,980
He's really making a mock out of this.

216
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,320
...isn't White Cream.

217
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,060
Convinced with the correct answer, Endo is full of smiles.

218
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,960
Uwa~!

219
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,730
Correctly getting by steadily, only six more to go.

220
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,700
I'm now going to have a go with Mother Farm - Plain Cheese.

221
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:14,270
Damn, the smell... Seriously, they've all got the same friggin' smell.

222
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,580
It's really close.

223
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,820
What?

224
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,090
I didn't hear him.

225
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,990
Guys, the cheese I've had before is this.

226
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,360
This is the one I've had before but not sure about...

227
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,300
Just stop already!!

228
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,430
Of course he would shout at you...

229
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,970
But it's definitely gotta be among these 2... 4...

230
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,740
I'm going for it!

231
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,180
I'd really like to get this right~ Here goes!

232
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,780
What I had is Mother Farm - Plain Cheese.

233
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,690
Uwaa, that's harsh.

234
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,720
Seriously~

235
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,830
I can't do this.

236
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,630
Your guess was wrong!!

237
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,000
The spray time was shorter than Tanaka.

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,840
Endo, it's this.

239
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,840
This one again...

240
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,810
It showed up just before.

241
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,410
It's Family Mart, the one that I fell for.

242
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,880
This is tough.

243
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,880
Ah, this is it.

244
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,750
Well you obviously have to just agree with it...

245
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,020
Next up is Hamada and as for his selection,

246
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,420
Q.B.B Baby Cheese from Kansai.

247
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:46,600
Based on carefully selected cheddar cheese, it's a milky dish with the perfect amount of saltiness.

248
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,770
Will he find this taste?

249
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,780
It's got some elasticity to it.

250
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,610
Elasticity?

251
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,780
If you're going to talk about elasticity, well...

252
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,580
most of them have it too.

253
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,850
and also there's...

254
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,490
some texture to it, as Endo mentioned before.

255
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,020
Where the hell do you see the texture anyway?

256
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,260
It has texture?

257
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,320
This guy is an idiot too.

258
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,490
An idiot right after an idiot.

259
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,960
These ones are probably all soft, as seen during Endo's challenge.

260
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,830
No, no, but you never know.

261
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,730
It might be better just to make sure.

262
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,670
For me...

263
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:27,040
It could actually be the one to stump him once he tries it.

264
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,570
You can tell, right... the moment you hold it...

265
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,810
What the hell is this?

266
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,280
We should hear the 'Ba-baaaan' (Out sound)

267
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,550
I can really tell the difference.

268
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,250
What I had

269
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,850
isn't Sekai Cheese Shokai- President White Cream!

270
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,490
Alright.

271
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,960
Wasn't that cream cheese? Just sayin'.

272
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,090
You can totally tell that it's a different kind of cheese.

273
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,100
Please try those other two...

274
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,030
You're right

275
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,030
Right? Please try one of those two

276
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,470
I agree

277
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,070
This Family Mart's...

278
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,810
Ah, are you going for that one?

279
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,780
Was it this hard?

280
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,420
If you get dragged into thinking about that too much...

281
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,520
it might confuse you more...

282
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,520
Huh?

283
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,420
I'm still speaking here.

284
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,860
There's a limit to how many times you can interrupt when someone is talking.

285
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,430
It had a more cream-ish feel to it.

286
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,400
What the hell are you saying?

287
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,300
What I had

288
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,570
was not Family Mart's 6P Cheese!

289
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,180
Alright.

290
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,310
But he's confident...

291
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,310
Yeah.

292
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,650
Is that confidence for real?

293
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,350
Moreover, with this one being cleared,

294
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,580
that makes it three in a row!!!

295
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,460
Ain't that Itsuki Hiroshi?
(Japanese singer)

296
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,060
It looked like it.

297
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,130
It was similar.

298
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,200
Sounded like in "Chikuma Gawa"

299
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:08,210
*"Chikuma Gawa" is one of Itsuki Hiroshi's song.

300
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,230
It wasn't even close.

301
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,070
Damn, you really pulled "Chikuma Gawa" outta the bag.

302
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,070
Yeah, the song...

303
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,570
"Chikuma Gawa" is outta the bag.

304
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,870
Not really.

305
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,540
How about this one?

306
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,580
Yotsuba Hokkaido.

307
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,820
Well, it's got a similar texture.

308
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,390
What do you mean by texture. God, you're annoying.

309
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,390
The feel is...

310
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,490
You should put it against your cheek then.

311
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,730
Everyone starts to like....

312
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,970
get stuck around here...

313
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,970
That's right.

314
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,300
If you told me it was this one, I would agree...

315
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,840
The texture...

316
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,210
The feel...

317
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,680
Goddammit, how many time is he going to mix em up.

318
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,250
Just bloody stop already!!

319
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,550
Hamada-san!

320
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,750
Yeah, he said "the feel" just now...

321
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,190
Just stop it! You!

322
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,320
The elasticity...

323
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,360
Stop recording!

324
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,620
All the cameras, point towards the ceiling for a bit.

325
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,330
It's going to be a long one.

326
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,330
Point it up once and bring it back down.

327
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,530
Swing it up and bring it down.

328
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,030
The two of you went for it, right?

329
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,830
We did.

330
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,170
We did.

331
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,000
Alright then, I'm going up as well.

332
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:20,610
What I had was Yotsuba Dairy- Yotsuba Hokkaidō Tokachi 100 Mini Cheese.

333
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,950
Well, it figures.

334
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,920
I didn't meet the correct one yet...

335
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,360
This is hard.

336
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,230
Ah~ there he is.

337
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,530
Has your thick brain all melted, ya fuckin' moron!?

338
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,500
Has it melted!?

339
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,240
Take a look, Hamada-san.

340
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,170
Which one was it?

341
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,070
It was a pretty simple...

342
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,810
Ah, so that was it.

343
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,710
I hadn't tried it yet.

344
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,280
Yup.

345
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,050
Well then, why don't you have a taste.

346
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,520
I thought you might actually get this one to be honest...

347
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,850
The feel.

348
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,220
What happened to the texture?

349
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,890
I definitely won't be saying that again.

350
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,630
The fourth challenger is Housei.

351
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,270
His selection is  Family Mart Collection, where Endo also suffered.

352
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:24,080
Butter mixed in Hokkaido cheese, this rich flavor is a one of a kind.

353
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,350
Will he be able to remember this taste?

354
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,450
Alright~

355
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,750
Getting wrong on the ones that showed up before is pretty funny.

356
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,450
That just gives us more pressure.

357
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,050
Yeah, sure does.

358
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,290
I thought you'd perhaps give me

359
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,990
a soft one from a foreign country

360
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,660
He's kicking off with a complaint...

361
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,930
Ah, it's got a light taste to it.

362
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,930
I've probably had it before.

363
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,170
He's smothering it all over his teeth...

364
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,670
Are you alright?

365
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Will it really help?

366
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,910
Are you kiddin' me?

367
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,980
Just go home if you're going to keep that up.

368
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,050
What's wrong? What's wrong?

369
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,550
It's not coming off at all.

370
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,220
I'm going to try and choose which one I think is right.

371
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,490
Go for it.

372
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,360
Here goes, Baby Cheese.

373
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,230
Totally not it.

374
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,440
Absolutely not.

375
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,670
The flavor of the taste...

376
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:32,580
The one I picked wasn't Baby Cheese Plain.

377
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,580
The one he picked?

378
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,650
Ah~ But this is...

379
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,720
It's totally not it.

380
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,420
Clearly?

381
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
Yeah, I can clearly tell it's different.

382
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,390
And another one I've had before is this.

383
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,760
Nope.

384
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,030
Wow, I can really tell.

385
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,840
What I had

386
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,170
was not Yukijirushi Megumiruku.

387
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,110
You're on a good pace.

388
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,680
The pace is good.

389
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,980
Okay, let me try this one.

390
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,550
The one everyone...

391
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,420
Nope.

392
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,760
Totally wrong.

393
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,660
Huh?

394
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660
What did I eat then?..

395
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,630
Well that's what you're trying to figure out...

396
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,960
He's tried this 36 times on this show...

397
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,670
What I ate

398
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,700
was NOT Family Mart's 6P Cheese.

399
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,910
So quick! It beeped the moment you dropped it.

400
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,250
Shocked, aren't you?

401
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,050
Eh, no way?

402
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,020
Shocked, aint you?

403
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,780
They cut you off real quick.

404
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,690
Like it literally hadn't left your hand yet.

405
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,760
Eh~ for real?

406
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,580
It was totally different.

407
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,660
That's what I'm saying, there's no way we'll get it right.

408
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,230
This is going to be hard...

409
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,430
No, this is impossible to get right.

410
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,340
Your stupidity has been fermenting for too long!!!

411
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,670
That went for ages!

412
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,640
It was the previous selection.

413
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,610
I had it just before.

414
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,280
Really?

415
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,780
It came up on your third one...

416
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,980
He got to try the correct one, as well...

417
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,820
He tried it and still got it wrong..

418
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,690
Now all that's left is to try it.

419
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,860
Just because it showed up before...

420
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,660
Just because it showed up before...

421
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,460
All that's left is to try it, surely

422
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,360
this cannot be different.

423
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,630
No, it's different.

424
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,700
That's enough.

425
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,600
It's definetely this.

426
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,770
Just stop!!

432
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,120
The last challenger is Matsumoto.

433
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,660
and his selection is Yukijirushi Hokkaido- 100 Cheese.

434
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,960
Using 100% Skimmed Hokkaido milk

435
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,030
It has a deep taste and has been sold for a long time.

436
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,070
I have no idea at all which one you've chosen...

437
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,970
I guess...

438
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,680
Please try tasting it.

439
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,210
Ah, it's hard.

440
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,180
What the hell, ain't this the leftovers!?

441
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,210
Just hurry up and eat it...

442
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,180
No it's not...

443
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,180
It's fresh new one...

444
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,960
It's really, really plain.

445
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,500
This one's just so plain.

446
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,030
Even at this stage...

447
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,000
The smell is also important.

448
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,400
Ah, but this really

449
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,410
smells like a rubber balloon.

450
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,570
Right?

451
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,480
Don't they both have the same smell, cheese and rubber balloons?

452
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,980
Since he can make balloon dogs.

453
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,980
Ah yes, at home...

454
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,220
Think about it, if I had kept on making it from then,

455
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,250
my daughter would surely be sick of it.

456
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,760
It was extremely plain.

457
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,760
Going by that bit, this plain cheese...

458
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,530
since it's been titled as so.

459
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,970
How about I try one of the ones around here...

460
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,600
and proceed while observing the situation...

461
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,870
Would that be okay?

462
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,980
He's imitating Non-chan.

463
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,120
Smells like rubber balloon.

464
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,110
This'll end it!

465
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,580
I'm going for it.

466
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,920
What to do, if this isn't the one

467
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,990
then it'll turn into an absolutely uninteresting show.

468
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,190
Ah, I know what to do.

469
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,330
I think it's probably this.

470
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,660
But I won't go for it

471
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,300
I'll say it's wrong...

472
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,400
But if I do as such

473
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,370
and it beeps, I'll seriously beat you all down.

474
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,610
I don't get why...

475
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,040
Why would you do such thing?

476
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,350
I'll hit you with my moves...

477
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,050
All of us?

478
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,050
Seriously?

479
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,750
I'll only leave the camera assistant alone.

480
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,320
Why is it only him that's safe?

481
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,690
That man...

482
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,660
I'll take a pass with this,

483
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,490
if this turned out to be wrong, it'd really be

484
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,560
such a waste.

485
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,630
All I'll say about it is that it's extremely close.

486
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,370
Nope, the camera assistant is going down as well.

487
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,140
Just because of that, I feel so sorry for him...

488
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,940
I feel so bad..

489
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,380
Just when he was spared.

490
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,080
You know, I feel like

491
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,580
I'm the victim of this show...

492
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,680
if this isn't it.

493
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:21,160
What I had wasn't Mother Farm- Plain Cheese.

494
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,780
Holy shit, that was close!!

495
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,080
"kyoe~! kyoe~!"

496
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,020
He was all, "kyoe~!"

497
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,490
Well, I'm going from this side.

498
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,120
This is going to be a long fight.

499
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,260
Uwa~ the elasticity is similar too.

500
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,580
Seriously, who picked it?

501
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,310
It was him (Hamada), wasn't it?

502
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,010
It was really all of us.

503
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,380
Everyone's said it.

504
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,220
This has gotta be the one.

505
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,620
That's what we all thought

506
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,020
Yeah...

507
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,190
You can't be picking this again!!

508
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:33,000
Seriously, to think that you'd dare pull this one again.

509
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,330
I haven't the slightest clue.

510
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,500
This is extremely close.

511
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,840
It's just a regular cheese.

512
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,340
But!

513
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,810
It's certainly got a slight bitter taste, so to speak.

514
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:52,050
This Yukijirushi's cheese.

515
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,720
Maybe that's all to it, that bitterness.

516
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,120
I'm really going to get it right today,

517
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,920
so I'm going through this seriously.

518
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,860
What I had

519
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,960
was NOT Yukijirushi Hokkaido- 100 Cheese, I think.

520
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,140
This isn't funny at all!!

521
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,910
You're right...

522
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,440
It wasn't funny at all...

523
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,050
I'm so embarrassed.

524
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,550
I know, right?

525
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,650
So embarrassing.

526
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,190
Yaaa~ that sure was tough.

527
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:34,540
If you have time to work on your body, work on your senses, you baldy!

528
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,470
He's turned all white.

529
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,330
That was a pretty long spray.

530
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,870
Yes, yes, that face...

531
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,440
I'm really embarrassed right now.

532
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,110
You had no clue at all?

533
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,180
Absolutely none.
