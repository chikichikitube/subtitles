6
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,580
Second time on Gaki no Tsukai

7
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,960
Hamada Masatoshi

8
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,960
Matsumoto Hitoshi

9
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,960
downtown

10
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,790
HIYASHI-CHUUKA

11
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,790
How far can we go with Cold Noodles?

12
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,080
Let's find out the limits of "Hiyashi-chuuka"!

13
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,370
Thank you

14
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,520
Have I seen this setting before?

15
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,120
Yes

16
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,700
We did this before

17
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,830
"Second time", right?

18
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,290
This time is different, it's more complicated

19
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,160
How?

20
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,670
Last time we only did "ice coffee", remember?

21
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,550
Today we're doing "hiyashi-chuuka"

22
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,540
See?

23
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,340
Not so different...

24
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,340
Last time, they tried to order an ice coffee by saying
words such as "ice mohi" or "Ouyang Fifi"

25
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,160
I'll have an Ouyang Fifi

26
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,830
Excuse me?

27
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,010
Oh, an Ouyang Fifi, please

28
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,630
An Ouyang ice coffee

29
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,630
Ice--?

30
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,800
Ice coffee, right?

31
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,300
You said it

32
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,300
And today, they'll research the limits of hiyashi-chuuka

33
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,300
COLD NOODLES

40
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,910
So, let's take a quick look at it

41
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,580
Our first one is

42
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,290
"MIYASHI NOODLES"

43
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,290
Miyashi-chuuka

44
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,410
This shouldn't cause many problems

45
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,370
It's our first one

46
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,250
Third one:

47
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,080
"CENTRAL-EAST No.2?"

48
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,080
"Higashi ni-chuu ka"

49
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,080
- It's already too much

50
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,450
Why you think so?

51
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,750
Here's our fourth one

52
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,250
"Chuuka hiyashi-hiyashi". This one is...

53
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,250
"NOODLES COLDY-COLDY"

54
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,250
This is... listen to me, ok?

55
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,120
If this option was one of Ultraman's brother, it would be Ultra 7

56
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,450
I mean, it's different from the others

57
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,800
But I personally wanted to make it happen anyway

58
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,800
Sixth one:

59
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,820
"Hikkoshi shiyouka"

60
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,820
"SHALL WE MOVE AWAY?"

61
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,080
No way this one can do it

62
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,950
This is where it gets hard

63
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,500
Number seven:

64
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,500
"I'M NOT A DAD"

65
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,500
"Oyaji chau ka"

66
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,030
Let's just cut this one out

67
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,120
Here's number eight:

68
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,830
"???"

69
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,830
"He get sea Check car"

70
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,750
It's nonsense, right?

71
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,910
Yeah I just took random words with similar sounds

72
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,800
It's just a list

73
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,830
And our last one:

74
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,700
"NO HOLIDAYS THIS YEAR?"

75
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,700
"Nenchuu mukyuu ka"

76
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,700
And that's how we're doing this

77
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,900
We told you the same last time

78
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,830
But the trick is the way you say it

79
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,900
This time I tried to say them just like "hiyashi chuuka"

80
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,000
Like mumbling

81
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,700
Last time you said them way too clearly
- Yeah, I know

82
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,080
Did they scold you?
- The staff? Yeah

83
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,380
Aren't you a bit old to be scolded?

84
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,760
How far can "hiyashi-chuuka" go?

85
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,670
Yamazaki Hosei

86
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,670
investigation reporter

87
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,620
I'm going to check that out

88
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,960
COLD NOODLES

89
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,960
Hiyashi Chuuka's Limits

90
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,960
~study results~

91
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,460
"Miyashi Noodles"

92
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,460
Miyashi-Chuuka

93
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,580
I'll have ramen
- One ramen, ok

94
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,500
I'll have...

95
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,500
"MIYASHI NOODLES"

96
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Miyashi-chuuka

97
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,550
"COLD NOODLES"

98
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,550
Hiyashi-chuuka, got it

99
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,210
"MIYASHI NOODLES"

100
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,210
Here they are, my Miyashi-chuuka

101
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,700
No problems at all  - Easy

102
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,050
"Miyashi Noodles"

103
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,050
O Miyashi Chuuka

104
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,460
"Central-east No.2?"

105
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,460
Higashi Nichuu Ka

106
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,630
"CENTRAL-EAST No.2?"

107
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,630
I'll have higashi nichuu ka

108

"CENTRAL-EAST No.2?"

110
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,630
Higashi nichuu ka

111
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,420
"CENTRAL-EAST No.2?"

112
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,420
Higashi nichuu ka

113
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,420
"CENTRAL-EAST No.2?"

114
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,420
Higashi nichuu ka? Sorry I'm asking...

115
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,380
Which is it?

116
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,750
He's stuck in a loop

117
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,550
"CENTRAL-EAST No.2?"

118
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,550
Higashi nichuu ka

119
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,550
Oh, you meant cold noodles

120
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,130
He got through it somehow
- Yeah, kind of...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

121
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,130
"Central-east No.2?"

122
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,130
O Higashi Nichuu Ka

123
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,550
"Noodles Coldy-Coldy"

124
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,550
Chuuka Hiyashi Hiyashi

125
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,050
"NOODLES COLDY-COLDY"

126
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,050
Alright, I'll have some chuuka hiyashi-hiyashi

Oh, hiyashi-chuuka, got it

129
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,410
Why should they have that?!

130
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,210
"Noodles Coldy-coldy"

131
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,210

Yeah, it was quick

134
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,710
"Shall we move away?"

135
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,710
Hikkoshi Shiyou Ka

136
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,380
Alright, uh...

137
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,960
That's not enough, right?

138
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,300
"SHALL WE MOVE AWAY?"

139
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,300
One hikkoshi shiyou ka

140
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,260
Didn't catch that

141
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,000
She has no idea

142
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,050
Hm? What is it?

143
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,800
You only had gyoza, right? One more serve of this

144
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,400
Plus...

145
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,010
"SHALL WE MOVE AWAY?"

146
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,010
A bowl of hikkoshi shiyou ka

147
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,170
What is that?

148
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,260
They still don't know
what you said

149
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,550
They're just ignoring you

150
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,710
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't catch that

151
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,300
"SHALL WE MOVE AWAY?"

152
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,300
I'll have one hikkoshi shiyou ka

153
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,910
You're saying it too clearly

154
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,800
"SHALL WE MOVE AWAY?"

155
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,800
One hikkoshi shiyou ka, please

156
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,800
Heard that? Too clear

157
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,550
You're moving away? Where?

158
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,160
They're having a good time

159
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,090
"Shall we move away?"

160
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,090
X Hikkoshi Shiyou Ka

161
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,550
"I'm not a dad"

162
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,550
Oyaji Chau Ka

163
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,260
Excuse me!

164
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,000
Coming

165
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,830
I'll have...

166
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Let's see...

167
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,710
"I'M NOT A DAD"

168
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,710
Oyaji chau ka

169
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,800
What's that?

170
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,700
Her face is scary!

171
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,960
"COLD NOODLES"

172
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,960
Hiyashi-chuuka

173
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,960
Hiyashi-chuuka?

174
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,960
Alright,

175
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
coming up

176
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,250
You said it normally

177
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,200
One hiyashi-chuuka

178
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,760
Yamazaki ordered it normally

179
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,250
I got stuck, it didn't sound natural to me

180
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,350
"I'm not a dad"

181
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,350
X Oyaji Chau Ka

182
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,760
I think I'll have...

183
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,210
"He get sea check car"

184
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,380
Eh?

185
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,170
What?

186
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,010
Come again?

187
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,050
Don't know that, what is it?

188
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,050
Wait

189
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,050
Yamazaki doesn't really know what to do

190
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,700
Man, it's so hot in here

191
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Oh boy

192
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,660
I get what he's doing

193
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,900
By saying it's hot, he's implying cold noodles

194
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,800
Sorry for that

195
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,050
Would you please say it in japanese?

196
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,050
Sure

197
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,620
"Sure", he said

198
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,590
"No holidays this year?"

199
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,590
Nenjuu Mukyuu Ka

200
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,800
"NO HOLIDAYS THIS YEAR?"

201
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,800
I'll have a nenjuu mukyuu ka

202
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,880
No holidays all year...?

203
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,300
"NO HOLIDAYS THIS YEAR?"

204
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,300
Nenjuu mukyuu ka

205
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,170
"NO HOLIDAYS THIS YEAR?"

206
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,170
Nenjuu mukyuu ka

207
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,130
Are you asking me when are we closed?

208
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,550
We're closed on weekends

209
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,510
"NO HOLIDAYS THIS YEAR?"

210
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,510
Nenjuu mukyuu ka

211
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,410
What a bad situation...

212
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,050
May I suggest you our tantan noodles? They're very good

213
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,510
Ok

214
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,080
He went for tantan

215
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,910
As suggested by the waiter

216
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,800
Yamazaki ends up getting his order chosen by the waiter

217
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,510
He said "yes" too

218
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,960
"No holidays this year?"

219
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,960
X Nenjuu Mukyuu Ka

220
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,830
Why did you say "yes", dude?

221
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:23,380
2 - Miyashi Jouka (MIyashi Purge): 〇

222
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:23,380
5 - Hiyashi Chocopa (Cold Chocolate): 〇

223
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:23,380
Non-aired ones:

224
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,160
As you can see, it starts with lots of circles but then it's all crosses

225
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,380
It means they were perfectly ordered

226
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,700
Man, I'm so good at explaining stuff

227
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,750
And so, for our grand finale

228
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,160
COLD NOODLES

229
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,160
Let's push hiyashi chuuka's limit to this:

230
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,540
Suzuki Kyoka

231
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,290
(japanese actress)

232
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,000
That's our arrival point

233
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,200
This won't work

234
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,040
I don't know that... I mean, we had "Ouyan Fifi" for "Ice Coffee"...

235
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,290
And to be honest

236
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,160
It was kind of forced

237
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,290
But this one...

238
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,750
I think this one can do the job

239
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,750
You think so?

240
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,750
I think it can, yeah

241
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,160
Alright, it's time to disguise

242
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:01,550
Will they be able to order hiyashi-

243
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:01,550
chuuka by saying "Suzuki Kyoka"?

244
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:01,550
▀

245
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,300
Again?

246
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,100
Can't be helped, we're doing it

247
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,500
You'll end up crying again

248
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,290
Not today, I swear I won't cry today

249
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,700
What kind of disguise is that?

250
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,500
Flawless, isn't it?

251
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,800
Downtown enter the shop with a flawless disguise

252
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,200
How is it flawless? It barely works

253
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,200
Here we go again

254
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,870
Let's just do this

255
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,330
What are we taking?

256
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,660
Excuse me

257
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,250
Coming

258
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,080
Here

259
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,330
Is this the menù?
- Yes

260
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,760
I'll have...

261
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,960
Suzuki Kyoka

262
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,300
Sui...?

263
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,840
Suzuki Kyoka

264
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,590
STEAMED DUMPLINGS

265
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,590
Sui gyoza? You meant that?

266
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,710
Suzuki Kyoka

267
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,210
Sui-kyou-ka...?

268
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,710
Four of those

269
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,050
You said sui-kyou-ka, right?

270
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,090
Suzuki Kyoka

271
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,960
STEAMED DUMPLINGS

272
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,960
You meant sui-gyouza, right? Or not?

273
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,420
"STEAMED DUMPLINGS"

274
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,420
Ok, sui-gyouza

275
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,120
You straight up ordered dumplings!

276
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,000
Come on, man!

277
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,460
What do you want for real?

278
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,380
Ok, what I really want...

279
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,300
"NOODLES COLDY-COLDY"

280
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,300
Is chuuka-hiyashi-hiyashi

281
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,590
Cold noodles? You sure?

282
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,850
Give me a break!

283
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,650
You two are incredible

284
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,550
What's this about?

285
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,510
I'm gonna talk about this on 4chan, you know!

286
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,800
We got exposed

287
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:48,670
He easily figured out they were

288
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:48,670
actually Downtown, despite of their flawless disguise

289
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,710
Cold noodles, one serve

290
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,450
What the hell, dude?

291
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,250
"NOODLES COLDY-COLDY"

292
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,250
Chuuka hiyashi-hiyashi...

293
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:08,210
X Suzuki Kyoka

294
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,790
I see, I made a mistake

295
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,660
What?

296
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,950
"STEAMED DUMPLINGS"

297
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,950
I didn't consider there was "sui-gyoza" on the menù

298
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,950
Even so, there's no way "Suzuki Kyoka" would ever work

299
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,540
"NOODLES COLDY-COLDY"

300
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,540
Yeah but... we also know that chuuka hiyashi-hiyashi perfectly works

301
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,700
Satisfied now?

302
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,800
Can I...?

303
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,250
Oh, sure

304
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,210
Downtown got a sign request by an employee

305
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,330
Here

306
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Translation & typeset by Shion (@FGRNDNoises)

307
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,700
Thank you so much

317
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,380
I hate this

318
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,000
Turn that off

319
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,620
He's crying again
