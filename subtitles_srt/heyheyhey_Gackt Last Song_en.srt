1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,310
Here's Gackt!

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,810
Aren't you sleepy?
- Ah, because he doesn't sleep much.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,110
Is it not a problem at all?
- I'm more energetic if I don't sleep.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,410
Well I suppose you sure
are energetic now...

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,710
No he's not!

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,650
I mean comparatively...
- Then, when in your life have you ever...

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,410
thought "Man I slept well!" and how long was that?

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,410
Maybe about 3 days...

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,610
You slept for 3 days?
- I have.

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,710
That's like being in a temporary
state of death!

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,350
If you were like that for any longer, cotton
would have been stuck up your nose!

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,410
I'm glade you woke up on the third day.

13
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,350
You don't sleep that much either do you?

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,210
I don't sleep much either but
not as much as him!

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,680
Why don't you sleep?
- If I sleep for long I get a headache.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,410
Man... you'r weak!

17
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,980
What the hell is that?
- I get headaches when I wake up after a long sleep.

18
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,410
I'm the same.
- So when you open your eyes,

19
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,810
you're like "My head hurts..."?

20
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,480
I wake up from the head aches.

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,680
So while sleeping you feel head aches and wake up?

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,210
Like "Uh, it HURTS!".

23
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,410
That's horrible.

24
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,810
Apparently he's training his body a lot now.

25
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,510
(can't catch exactly what he says, but he
doesn't seem to approve much)

26
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,110
Gaku-chan can do that thing... Jackie Chan push ups.

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,350
What's a Jackie Chan push up?
- This was just a randomly found,

28
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,710
recently among my group...
- You're totally intent on doing it!

29
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,810
Can I show it?
- Yeah show it.

30
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,910
You okay?
What's it like?

31
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,450
We just randomly started seeing if we could do this.

32
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,250
Well...it's like this.

33
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,010
Oh, that's impressive!

34
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,410
No way I can do it!
(Ma-chan do it!)

35
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,010
I JUST SAID I CAN'T DO IT!!

36
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,010
He clearly just said he can't do it!

37
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,510
I don't even feel like trying that!

38
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,410
Don't even feel like making
a fool of myself.

39
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,310
No way, impossible.
It's definitely going to hurt.

40
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,010
I was hoping that you would
Matsumoto-san.

41
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,050
Isn't there anything else?
This is a little to hard.

42
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,510
We do lots of things among the
members, just to see if we can do it.

43
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,010
We do this one often at the moment.

44
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,910
That would be hard too! Maybe you can
do a one handed push up?

45
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,910
Why is it always me doing everything?

46
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,010
I probably can't do it.

47
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,010
No way! This is going to be impossible!

48
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:07,310
Like this right?

49
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,210
No, no, no.
This is painful.

50
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,910
Why would you think of trying this?

51
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,710
Oh yeah, there's some talk that we
should have contest

52
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,810
as we haven't done one for a while.

53
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,210
Remember how you did it before?
And he couldn't win at all so...

54
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,110
What should we do?

55
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,210
Tell me something that you've
won at before.

56
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:43,110
I don't want to suggest something and
win, because it would be too easy.

57
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,210
What is there..?
Are you good at bowling Gak-chan?

58
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:53,110
Bowling?
I don't like the style of bowling.

59
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,210
This? (bowling movement)

60
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,310
You know how I always
wear black clothes?

61
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,710
Why the hell are bowling shoes white?

62
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,710
Well yeah, I suppose I haven't seen many
black bowling shoes before.

63
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,710
Just wear black ones then...

64
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,210
But they don't have any for rent!
They're always white...

65
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,510
Just buy them!
So they have to be black?

66
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:21,210
There already are black balls...
- No, the ball is black and I'm in black,

67
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:27,810
why is just this part white with some sort of blue stripe!?

68
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,510
Well I understand. Can you handle
the white bowling pins though?

69
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,810
That's okay.
- Eh? Why?

70
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,850
Because I've got nothing to do with it.

71
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,310
Oh because it's not
something you wear...

72
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,110
And it's pretty far so...
- Oh I get it.

73
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,710
Well we'll have a talk with the directors and arrange a black alleys and black pins.

74
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:52,610
If it's possible to have it pitch black.
- Oh if it's pitch black I'll do it.

75
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,110
Or better yet completely dark. (as in lightning)

76
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,910
Well we'll have a think about it...
- Alright then, the song's name?

77
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,650
Last Song.

78
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,710
This is a song released in December
last year rearranged acoustically.

79
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,410
You're reading it in monotone!
