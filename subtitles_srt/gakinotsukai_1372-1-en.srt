1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,730
Today is that man's birthday

2
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,460
I came all the way from NTV here in these clothes,

3
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,200
Nobody laughed at it

4
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,480
Nobody laughed?

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,840
I came in these clothes on my 54th birthday,

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,480
Literally nobody laughed

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,460
You'd think it would get a few laughs

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,460
Yeah

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,240
Well, we have a cake as well. It's a birthday after all.

10
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,040
Thank you. I'm really pleased.

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,530
Let's celebrate together!

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,180
Hold on, sorry, hold on

13
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,260
It went out...

14
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,800
Sorry, we were singing too loud...

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,800
It went out from our singing?

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,700
Our breath put it out?

17
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,550
This is an awful age

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,930
It blew out right?

19
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,820
Oh it's all melted now

20
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,820
You can't even read the number

21
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,200
The 5 is gone now!

22
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,200
Are candles this hard to light?

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,460
They both went out

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,750
That's not even a 5 anymore

25
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,510
Is there a plate?

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,510
This is...

27
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,310
A bad impression

28
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,310
It is!

29
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,310
It really is

30
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,420
They have one, behind you

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,600
Is there a 4?

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,260
There's no 4?

33
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,880
Just the 5 is fine

34
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,260
Just the 5?

35
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,750
This will work

36
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,850
How many times have we done this with these members?

37
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,710
That's true

38
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,710
Like 30 times?

39
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,080
Is this the 29th year of this show?

40
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,110
So at 55, it'll be 30 years

41
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,960
30 years is amazing isn't it?

42
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,960
It is, yeah

43
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,930
The cast hasn't really changed that much either huh

44
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,200
We had a lot of backroom talks about replacing some of the cast though

45
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,220
You guys don't talk about that right?

46
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,930
The company told us too

47
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,310
Yoshimoto tells us, and so does NTV

48
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,080
"you guys should change the cast soon"

49
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,320
They thought that Yamasaki would finally quit the show when he moved to Osaka

50
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,020
I would "finally quit"?

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,570
Cause, you know, coming just for this

52
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,930
Yeah getting on the bullet train every time

53
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,300
The conductor of the bullet train was saying it too

54
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,770
Even an employee of Japan Railway?

55
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,060
"Do we really need to let this guy on" he said

56
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,310
"Where the hell do you need to go?"

57
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,800
Tokyo of course

58
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,070
"Is there any fuckin point in him going there?" is what the conductor said

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
"fuckin point"?

60
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,750
What a foul mouth

61
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,590
A foul mouth, seriously...

62
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,950
The girl with the J-Diner was saying it too

63
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,220
The trolley thing

64
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,220
The trolley girl?

65
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,220
That's called a J-Diner?

66
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,220
"Why does this person show up sometimes?"

67
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,130
Since I got my start on Gaki,

68
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,110
It's been 21 years

69
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,840
Always,

70
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,290
You were so kind to me

71
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,330
The hard work of making comedy,

72
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,360
The brilliance of creating comedy,

73
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,910
Those two things, always,

74
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,300
I learned up close from you

75
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,620
Matsumoto-san, Matsumoto-san,

76
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,880
Thank you for everyday

77
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,530
When I'm feeling and don't know what to do,

78
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,220
Matsumoto-san, Matsumoto-san,

79
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,080
Thank you for everything,

80
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,420
Those times, always,

81
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,100
You turn it into laughter

82
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:10,150
Thank you for being born

83
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,820
Well, yeah,

84
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,840
How was that?

85
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,080
No not, "yeah", it's your birthday

86
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,060
It was nice, thank you

87
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,110
Thanks

88
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,120
A nice surprise

89
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,080
I didn't mean to startle you

90
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,860
The words "thank you"...

91
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,380
They seem like simple words but they're really,

92
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,370
Hard to say

93
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,890
They're hard to say

94
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,950
This was a special opportunity

95
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,240
Right, this was a good celebration

96
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,500
What do you think?

97
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,500
What do you mean?

98
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,110
That he did this for you

99
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,150
I already said I was glad,

100
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,150
Songs are nice aren't they

101
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,640
You can say the things you can't normally say

102
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,000
I see. What about the lyrics?
Did you like them?

103
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,950
I did yeah. Tanaka's,

104
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:04,710
Well he's not a professional of course, he has his own ability,

105
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,710
That's true, of course,

106
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,420
But still struggling hard despite the lack of talent,

107
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,040
He still managed to sing the song

108
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,810
That's what I felt

109
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,350
Who cares about the singing

110
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,170
Was he able to convey his feelings to you?

111
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,170
Yes, I said

112
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,570
I said YES already

113
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,460
Let's just get along

114
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,830
This is a birthday party after all

115
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,830
Since it's a special day

116
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,330
It's fine if Matsumoto-san gets a little happy

117
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,930
That's enough for me

118
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,710
There's no reason I wouldn't be happy

119
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,730
I'm glad! That makes me happy

120
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,350
You wrote these lyrics Tanaka?

121
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,350
Of course, yes

122
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,020
How old were you when you joined Gaki?

123
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,710
It was in the 4th year

124
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,890
4th year

125
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,680
You joined in the fourth year?

126
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,660
Around the 4th year

127
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,020
Around 25

128
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,660
That's fast

129
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:03,330
So in another sense, there were only 4 years of Gaki without you

130
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,300
I'm so grateful

131
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,300
From the warmups

132
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,770
You guys were called Cocorico Bombers right?

133
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,930
And part way through you got rid of Bombers

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,150
I introduced Tanaka to you right Matsumoto-san?

135
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,000
Yamasaki came to get me

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,620
It was during the Bubble Era,

137
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,550
When I get to Tokyo on the first bullet train,

138
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,710
There's a massive line of taxis,

139
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,820
So I asked Yamasaki, "sorry, could you please line up for me?"

140
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,950
Like 30 minutes before I arrive

141
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,020
And I think maybe Tanaka was lonely by himself,

142
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,040
It was the very first time I met you

143
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,420
Me and Yamasaki were in the back, and Tanaka was next to the driver

144
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,010
He didn't say a single word the entire drive

145
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,720
Of course you don't get nervous now

146
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,680
It was your first time meeting him

147
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,680
Of course yes

148
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,690
We saw from behind, his face was like mud coloured

149
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,510
His face was like earthenware

150
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,730
Honestly, and he wouldn't move either

151
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,420
He wouldn't move or talk at all

152
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,430
It wasn't an issue of whether he was funny or not

153
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,880
I was nervous, yeah

154
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:23,510
I was introduced to him after that

155
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,510
I wanted to say this

156
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,840
Do you remember, the first time

157
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,420
The first time

158
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,730
As a Gaki member,

159
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:51,400
I hit on a girl and picked her up

160
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,770
And brought her with me

161
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:03,920
I was a pain in the ass

162
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:11,350
At the Nakameguro Video Rental Store "Dan"

163
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,860
I had no money,

164
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:24,750
"Use my card,

165
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:31,280
"Just rent it", is what you said to me

166
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:38,130
To me, who can't see a future

167
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:44,910
You gave me a light

168
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:51,530
The person who gave me my comedian passport,

169
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:58,150
Matsumoto-san, it was you

170
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:04,770
Let's go stay on this road,

171
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:11,320
And run as hard as we can

172
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:18,060
I am grateful to you

173
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,800
Brillaint

174
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,950
He sang for you

175
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,600
How nice. How was it?

176
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,680
It was great, yeah

177
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,680
What was?

178
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,260
Like "Oh yeah that happened"

179
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,260
I see

180
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,130
A video store called Dan?

181
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,220
Yes, in Nakameguro. It's gone now.

182
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,550
It's gone now, I saw it when I passed by it after a long time

183
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:46,150
After shooting Gaki, he let me ride in the Jaguar he had

184
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:50,110
I didn't have any money, so Matsumoto-san said "rent it with this"

185
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,860
What kind of video?

186
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,420
A perverted one

187
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,330
Just you two? Didn't even pick one movie?

188
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,440
We didn't, we just got dirty videos

189
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,700
How many? How many did you rent?

190
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,000
We got about 7, and with Matsumoto-san in the car,

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,730
Matsumoto-san was going through them like,
"This was yours right Endo?" "This one was mine"

192
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,860
That's what I remembered, it was so nostalgic

193
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,150
They don't have DVDs like now,

194
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,480
You can't tell by looking at it, you need to remember the title

195
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,110
We messed that up sometimes right?

196
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,950
But yeah, after Gaki, we'd do things like that

197
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,020
I learned a lot from you

198
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,070
Like massages

199
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,820
"I know a good place"

200
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,400
What kind of massages?

201
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,770
Like they massage your shoulder and neck?

202
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,240
...A perverted one

203
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,840
A perverted? What do you mean?

204
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,910
I had no idea. The name of the place was "Magic Hand"

205
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,950
I can't tell what it's supposed to be

206
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,520
"What kind of magic is it"

207
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,530
They used some amazing magic on us right?

208
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,440
A very petite woman, with a mysterious bag

209
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,040
I tried to look, but they said I absolutlely couldn't

210
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,260
Then she dimmed the lights, and after that...

211
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,770
To the point I have no memory of it, she did a lot of things to me

212
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,820
Her name was Eri-san by the way

213
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:19,460
TN: "Tsuru no Ongaeshi" is a story about a man who saves a crane from hunters, and that crane later secretly becomes his wife, and has to transform in a room while he's not looking.

214
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,730
I've heard that name before!

215
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,730
It wasn't exaclty "Tsuru no Ongaeshi",

216
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,110
But she was like "Please don't look at all"

217
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,060
Inside?

218
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,000
What did she do to you, in the end?

219
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,490
I, became a little girl,

220
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,530
You did? Shozo you became a girl?

221
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,000
Yes, in that moment I became a girl

222
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,280
And she had me in this position,

223
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,750
She did so many things. SO many things.

224
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,750
I don't think it's that strange

225
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,730
Became a girl right?

226
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,220
I'm gonna record this episode

227
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,680
Today's broadcast?

228
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,510
Something like Hamada Shogo would be good now

229
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,260
Thank you,

230
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,120
For using me Matsumoto-san

231
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,330
And in the future too,

232
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,190
Please Matsumoto-san

233
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,530
Thank you,

234
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,600
for laughing, Matsumoto-san

235
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,400
And in the future too,

236
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,470
Please, Matsumoto-san

237
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,770
Stoic when it comes to comedy,

238
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,310
Ability that I can't match

239
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,950
He's super witty,

240
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,420
I really admire that

241
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,040
The pinnacle of comedy,

242
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,620
The most creative ideas,

243
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,440
The front line in the comedy world,

244
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,930
Can't imagine someone who won't laugh

245
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,930
Can't imagine someone who doesn't admire

246
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,170
People aspire to you,

247
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,770
You bring light to a dark world

248
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,210
Thank you,

249
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,920
For laughing Matsumoto-san

250
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,970
And in the future too,

251
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,970
And in the future too,

252
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,520
Please, Matsumoto-san

253
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,520
Please, Matsumoto-san

254
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:54,760
Please

255
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:54,760
Please

256
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,070
Happy Birthday!

257
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,770
This one was unusual

258
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,770
There was some rap

259
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,250
They're youngsters

260
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,880
We are the youngest ones here yeah

261
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,880
We though we should do something new

262
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
Something different from you guys

263
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,040
I couldn't do it I don't think

264
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,930
I turned everything I wanted to convey into rap lyrics

265
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,200
I thought it was just gonna be Imoto

266
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,460
Matsumto-san I've been on Gaki for 18 years

267
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,150
Do you still think my name is Imoto?

268
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,040
Matsumoto-san said it without thinking

269
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,330
He called you Imoto?

270
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,940
It's Inomoto

271
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,080
I thought it be just him singing

272
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,910
txt267

273
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,000
txt268

274
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,190
txt269

275
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,090
txt270

276
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:54,080
txt271

277
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,190
Oh really?

278
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,360
Do you remeber?

279
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,590
After the recording

280
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:36,970
You treated me with dinner

281
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,270
Always, on the way back

282
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:50,210
"I'll shop at the store near your house on my home"

283
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:56,550
You muttered, dropped me off,

284
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:03,490
And disappeared into the store

285
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,470
"Good work today!" I bowed my head

286
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:16,010
And then went home

287
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:20,240
And the days since then,

288
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:29,490
You told me,

289
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,860
"Back then,

290
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,590
"I never needed to buy anything"

291
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,630
But for your sake,

292
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:50,110
I dropped you home

293
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,960
The beginning though was...it was kind of...

294
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,960
It got better and better near the end

295
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,300
In the start he was,

296
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,470
Were you trying to do an impression?

297
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,240
No not at all. I'm scolded about this a lot.

298
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,480
By who?

299
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,480
What?

300
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,950
It was kind of like Hamada Shogo

301
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,080
Sorry, it's just that our singing voices are similar

302
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,480
Do you remember what he talked about?

303
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,530
Yeah, I think we all do things like that

304
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,260
I think Hamada-san has done it too.

305
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,110
Seniors actually look out a lot for their juniors

306
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,620
Like if I pay for his taxi,

307
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:52,950
That's kind of bothersome to the senior having to hand over 1000s of yen

308
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,410
Yeah, so, it's fine to just drop him off nearby

309
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,860
Often, yeah, I didn't need to buy anything but I'd go there

310
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,850
I see

311
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,850
This is not that big a deal

312
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,590
He did it for me every time

313
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,590
I think anyone would do it

314
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,350
But still, I'm thankful for it

315
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,080
Back then, we were together 4-5 times a week

316
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,870
I also had nobody really,

317
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,770
He's actually the first one to come to Tokyo

318
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,540
And then half a year later DownTown-san came right?

319
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,680
Matsumoto-san was really all alone

320
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,080
I was also alone

321
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,950
I was also alone, so it was us two together everyday

322
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:43,290
Did anything happen like Endo's story, like some place you went to

323
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:48,730
Often at the video store in Nakano Sakaue

324
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,690
Back then I used Matsumoto-san's card to rent a video,

325
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,500
We got a bunch, we got around 6,

326
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,510
And I've completely forgotten to return them

327
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,350
Back then Yamasaki wasn't married yet,

328
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:06,280
And he doesn't really tidy up, his room was all cluttered

329
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,930
It got lost?

330
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,930
It got mixed up and lost

331
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,060
He genuinely snapped at me for that

332
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,820
They didn't let me rent when I went there

333
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,910
I said all sorts of things to him in that hour. All sorts of abuse.

334
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,530
I didn't think he would've been so angry at me not returning the videos,

335
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,530
But it was my fault

336
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,180
Since then when I would yell at him,

337
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,260
Yamasaki would start drawing Doraemon

338
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,530
Not to run away,

339
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,530
He wants it to save him

340
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,000
If I draw Doraemon it'll save me

341
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,370
I'm not doing it conciously,

342
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,760
You're not drawing it while he's yelling at you right?

343
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
I am

344
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,350
It's a habit

345
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,950
That would make him more pissed

346
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,580
No way, for real?

347
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,440
If he sees me doing that he doesn't get mad

348
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,710
It's like I'm Gian

349
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,150
Oh really

350
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,690
After this, a super unexpected guest!

351
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,850
We hung out with girls too

352
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,660
We would hang out together,

353
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,620
And then became friends,

354
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,020
And then us and the girls would meet again, us 4

355
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,990
And there, a girl I met for the first time,

356
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,460
"Hey, do you wanna drink something, Jiin?"

357
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,730
She called him "Jiin"

358
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,530
Jiin?

359
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,530
Jiin?

360
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,970
She took it from Hitoshi

361
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,970
TN: Hito (人) can also be read as Jin

362
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,240
She took the Hito from Hitsohi and got Jiin

363
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,450
"Jiin, you're not drinking anything?"

364
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,480
It was the first time you met her right?

365
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,480
It was the first time

366
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,800
You're fine with that?

367
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:33,200
Well yeah, it's probably cause, that girl was really,

368
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,400
When we were alone together...I embraced it I guess

369
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:44,570
Like "I guess Jiin is fine"
Closed the distance quickly

370
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,570
Closed the distance quickly

371
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,570
And Yama-chan was like "What is she saying"?

372
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,260
Yeah. I thought oh crap, calling him Jiin,

373
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,820
It was back when he was angry and rambunctious,

374
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,950
I thought he would go like \n"WHO YOU CALLING JIIN?"

375
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,050
But no he was all smiley

376
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,130
"He can accept that" I thought

377
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,130
He can accept it

378
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,880
That must've been amazing, Jiin

379
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,880
There a lot of different memories

380
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,840
It's a long history

381
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,770
Matsumoto-san happy birthday!

382
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,970
Thank you !

383
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,400
Oh, thank you very much!

384
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,820
Next Week

385
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,660

386
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,840
