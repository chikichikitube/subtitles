00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,770
How boring.

Hakamada
Law Office

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,210
What's going on here?

00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,310
Attorney:
Hakamada Yukio

6
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,410
Hello, Hakamada Law Offices.

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,950
Yes, one moment, please.

8
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,620
Hello, Hakamada Law Office.

9
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,580
Sensei, we've got trouble.

10
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,560
Shinozuka-san, the bread is done baking.

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,240
They're croissants.

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,790
Never mind the croissants.

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,270
We're in a crisis.

14
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,890
What?

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,040
Hakamada
Law Office

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,920
What's going on?

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,500
No one ever lines up at our office,

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,150
but now there's a line of people.

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,380
Maybe they were lured by
the aroma of my bread.

20
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,810
Of course not!

21
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,220
They're clients.

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,090
And phones have been
ringing off the hook.

23
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,840
That can't be what this is.

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,500
There's no way a crowd
like this would come here.

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,170
Excuse me, coming through.

26
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,660
Excuse me, excuse me.

27
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,860
Wow, what an amazing line!

28
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,330
Looks like it was effective, Kanae-chan.

29
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,770
Maybe so.

30
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,230
Excuse me, I'm the landlord.

31
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,240
Yoshie-san, do you know what's going on?

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,300
Let me in first.

33
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,810
Here, take a look at this.

34
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,480
Monthly Publication Monday

35
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,480
Monthly Publication Monday,
hot off the press!

36
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,020
Oh, that's the monthly magazine
with Kanae-san's syndication.

37
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,450
Kanae-chan's manga seems to be
getting quite popular lately, so...

38
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,390
Hakamada's assistant:
Nonomura Kanae

39
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,590
I took advantage of the situation.

40
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,590
Office landlord:
Toyama Yoshie

41
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,330
Look!

42
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:03,060
"Compensation Lawyer" If you want a divorce and to get compensated, come to the Hakamada Law Office

43
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,970

Law Office of Hakamada in great peril?

46
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,450
Is that why they're all here?

47
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,620
The advertisement was way
more effective than we thought.

48
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,930
Sensei, you better get started.

49
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,530
Monthly Publication Monday

50
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,200
Rake in lots of compensation fees.

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,240
Ah, and I'll bill you for the ad later.

52
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,030
Why didn't you ask me first?

53
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,650
Thank you for waiting!

54
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,600
Who is first in line?

55
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,540
I am.

56
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,660
Please come in.

57
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,280
Excuse me.

58
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,120
Everyone, please wait a while.

59
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,650
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,580
Please wait.

61
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,190
My name is Hakamada, attorney at law.

62
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,050
I am Otsuka Masayo.

63
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,790
Client:
Otsuka Masayo

64
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,790
I'm a housewife.

65
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,990
What can I do for you today?

66
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,830
Are you all right?

67
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,440
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,190
I can't forgive my husband.

69
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,920
Please relax, and give me the details.

70
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:31,080
My husband is cheating on me.

71
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,520
He's cheating.

72
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,950
Everyone. Please enjoy while you wait.

73
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,780
What's this?

74
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,990
Bread made by Hakamada-sensei himself.

75
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,560
This is...

76
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,570
Awful.

77
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,010
Sorry, can I have a glass of water?

78
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,120
Me, too.

79
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,240
Oh, yes. Right away.

80
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,320
He's been coming home late lately.

81
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,650
Sometimes after 7 P.M.

82
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,090
Do you consider that to be late?

83
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,800
My husband is a public official,
he works at a government office.

84
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:18,930
Masayo's husband, public official:
Otsuka Toru

85
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,530
His work always ends at 5:30,

86
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,270
so if he came straight home,
he should be home by 6:30.

87
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,220
But, he comes home at 7:00!

88
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,630
There's a gap of thirty minutes.

89
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,840
Thirty minutes?

90
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,680
Yes.

91
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,660
Excuse me.

92
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,760
Thank you very much.

93
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:42,030
I have instructed my husband to report
to me his daily schedule and whereabouts.

94
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,190
I check his cell phone
history every night.

95
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,820
I have set a GPS inside his briefcase.

96
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,700
I am always informed of his whereabouts.

97
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,330
What an oppressive ball and chain.

98
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,120
It's perfectly normal.

99
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,610
I've been addicted lately to this
foreign drama, where I got the idea from.

100
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,080
Iron Spy Woman Marilyn.

101
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,080
Iron Spy Woman
Marilyn

102
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,200
Commandant X,

103
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,450
thank you for this amazing mission.

104
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,120
That show's getting popular.

105
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,100
The result is this.

106
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,410
I have discovered my husband
is taking a ceramics class.

107
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,220
That's suspicious in itself, isn't it?

108
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,760
So I went to the ceramics class,

109
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,370
and spied on him from outside.

110
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,790
And as I suspected...

111
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,080
The instructor is a woman.

112
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,510
Not only that, the woman's
hands and my husband's hands

113
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,280
repeatedly touched each
other during the class.

114
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,440
Maybe she was showing
him how to mold pottery?

115
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,860
You can teach someone how to mold pottery
without touching each other's hands.

116
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,210
I suppose so...

117
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,810
Anyway, I can't forgive my husband.

118
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,070
You can bill him for gobs
of compensation, right?

119
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,970
When you say he's cheating...

120
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,950
Are you referring to
the touching of hands?

121
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,170
Yes. That's right.

122
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,720
Otsuka-san.

123
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,220
We cannot sue for compensation based on
touching hands with the opposite sex.

124
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,240
Huh?

125
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,760
There must be an illicit affair,

126
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,370
which would be grounds for divorce.

127
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,690
Otherwise it would be impossible
to get approval for compensation.

128
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,860
Can you give me a concrete
definition of "illicit affair"?

129
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,190
Simply put, that would be "sex."

130
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,410
Se-Se-Sex?!

131
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,300
Otsuka-san?

132
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,320
Otsuka-san?

133
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,230
Wouldn't that be grounds
for a death sentence?

134
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,170
Who decided that an illicit
affair has to be sex?

135
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:51,310
As far as I'm concerned, touching hands
with the opposite sex is illicit.

136
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,990
It has already been determined by law.

137
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,520
It would be difficult to sue for
compensation based on your situation.

138
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,660
You're changing the storyline, then.

139
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,390
The storyline?

140
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:08,290
This manga character is
you, isn't it, Sensei?

141
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,830
Look what it says here.

142
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,240
Is it a lie?

143
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,430
"There is no compensation
fee I cannot get for you!"

144
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,430
"There is no compensation
fee I cannot get for you"...

145
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,990
What the heck is this?

146
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,400
Water. Water!

147
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,450
Why did you give us that to eat?

148
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,380
Sensei had good intentions.

149
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,720
Kanae-san, may I see you for a moment?

150
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,250
Oh. Yes!

151
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,650
What is the meaning of this?

152
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,060
This is the main
protagonist's catchphrase.

153
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,060
But I've never said
anything like that.

154
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,520
Well, actually, the other day...

155
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,900
We got the results for
February's reader votes.

156
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,380
You're 9th.

157
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,470
Amazing! I'm in the top ten.

158
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,130
That's no ranking to be happy about.

159
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,170
Editor at Tokiwa Publishing:
Tabata Misato

160
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,840
You're 9th in popularity
out of eleven syndications.

161
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,660
Oh, I see.

162
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,430
If you continue flying
under the radar like this,

163
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,880
you could potentially get canceled.

164
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,230
Canceled?

165
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,010
The reader poll rates your
story contents highly...

166
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,060
but the majority of comments said
the leading character is too plain.

167
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,560
I think he needs to have some kind
of quality that attracts the readers.

168
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,770
An attractive quality?

169
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,200
For example, the protagonist
should have a cool catchphrase.

170
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,210
A catchphrase... for example?

171
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,770
Like, "If you have any sympathy,
give me compensation!"

172
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,880
That one sounds familiar.

173
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,640
Then how about, "I won't die
until I get compensated!"

174
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,520
What kind of situation
would that apply to?

175
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,830
"I'll pay the entire
compensation back to you!"

176
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,800
Why would he pay back the compensation?

177
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,420
You are completely wrong.

178
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,510
What?

179
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,060
Cafe waitress:
Mizutani Sara

180
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,050
"There is no compensation
fee I cannot get for you!"

181
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,440
There is no other suitable
catchphrase for your protagonist.

182
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,270
The manga popularity will rise
with it, there is no mistake.

183
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,880
You applied the waitress's
suggestion literally?

184
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,140
She both seems to be and not be
some kind of spiritual medium.

185
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,350
Don't you think a person like that
would be nothing but suspicious?

186
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,310
But don't you think it's
a pretty good catchphrase?

187
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,820
No, I don't.

188
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,420
"There is no compensation fee I
cannot get for you" isn't good.

189
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,160
A lawyer must not
guarantee specific results.

190
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,730
So that's why there's
a crowd out there...

191
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,090
What's the story, then?

192
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,280
You will get me compensation, won't you?

193
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,870
Based on your situation, I
don't think it's possible.

194
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:46,240
That means this is false advertisement.

195
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,240
"There is no compensation
fee I cannot get for you!"

196
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,070
I will report this to the
appropriate authorities,

197
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,330
and they will take appropriate measures.

198
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,230
I will contact the publisher
of this manga, as well.

199
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,180
No, no, please don't.

200
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,660
Why not?

201
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,890
Because Sensei can do it!

202
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,790
Huh?

203
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,400
Huh?

204
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,860
Hakamada-sensei is a professional
in lawsuit compensation.

205
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,000
He will assuredly produce satisfactory
results for you, regardless of the situation.

206
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,150
So, it's true then!

207
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,160
Kanae-san, can I have a word?

208
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,240
A lawyer mustn't guarantee
a specific result.

209
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,820
Sensei, please.

210
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,470
It's a crucial time for me,
my syndication just started.

211
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,620
If some weird claim gets associated
with it, it'll quickly get canceled.

212
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,620
Yes, but...

213
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,570
Even if you can't get compensation,

214
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,440
isn't there some way you
can satisfy the client?

215
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,020
But what's impossible is impossible.

216
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,190
You haven't paid me yet
for last month's work.

217
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,060
Huh?

218
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,930
Me, neither.

219
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,030
I can contact the appropriate authorities
and have them take appropriate measures.

220
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,210
This way, please.

221
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,650
Sensei, this way.

222
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,240
Please be seated.

223
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,060
Um, when can we get legal counsel?

224
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,320
I'm sorry, you will have
to wait a little longer.

225
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,200
I didn't come here to eat
this strange, awful bread.

226
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,840
We should go somewhere else.

227
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,380
One moment, please!

228
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,590
I will introduce you to him right away.

229
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,770
He's still talking to a client.

230
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,510
If the people leave, I paid for
the advertisement for nothing.

231
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,900
We just have to listen to what they've got to say.

232
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,390
That's crazy.

233
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,530
Hakamada-sensei can have
the final word, but

234
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,090
we have divorce experience ourselves.

235
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,320
Yes, but...

236
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,340
Kanae-chan, you have
experience with divorce.

237
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,170
Use it as reference,
and hear them out.

238
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,030
Next in line, please.

239
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,680
This way please.

240
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,390
The rest of you, please wait outside.

241
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,790
Hakamada Law Office

242
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,710
She is cheating on me.

243
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,500
So, I want compensation.

244
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,790
When did she start cheating on you?

245
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,970
Client:
Oyama Takayuki

246
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,380
A friend of mine witnessed it

247
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,270
about two months ago,
and told me about it.

248
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,070
I was told Aya was flirting
and walking with another man.

249
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:07,810
Takayuki's lover
Inui Aya

250
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,060
This has been going on
for two months now, then?

251
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,810
And that's not all!

252
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,230
My other friends have
seen things, too.

253
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,420
I asked them what they saw, and
it seems she's with different men.

254
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,820
She's not only seeing two,

255
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,720
there are maybe three or four other men!

256
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,830
By the way, are you
planning on divorcing her?

257
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,250
Divorce?

258
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,400
No, we're not even married.

259
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,570
Huh?

260
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,900
I'm only in high school, you know.

261
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,860
High school?

262
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,070
And who is this Aya-san?

263
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,540
She's my girlfriend.

264
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,780
We've been going out for almost a year.

265
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,090
Your girlfriend, I see.

266
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,380
Sensei, our client is here.

267
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,950
Yes, yes. Please have a seat.

268
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,700
Are you sure you want
me to call you "Sensei"?

269
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,350
I might not look it,

270
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,760
but I was once a tutor
for my friend's kid.

271
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,000
So the "Sensei" part isn't false.

272
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,790
Now, what can I do for you?

273
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,500
Client:
Sawada Chiharu

274
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,640
I think my husband is cheating on me.

275
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,580
I see.

276
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,310
What, may I ask, is your
husband's profession?

277
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,130
He's a high school teacher.

278
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:20,550
Chiharu's husband, high school teacher:
Sawada Shuji

279
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,450
It must fall into the forbidden pattern
of the teacher-student love affair!

280
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,550
No, it's not with a student.

281
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,690
Oh. How boring.

282
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,690
Boring?

283
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,220
Ah, pardon me.

284
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,300
So, who is the partner?

285
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,100
I have a picture.

286
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,370
Two weeks ago I coincidentally
saw my husband in town.

287
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,080
It was at a place far from school.

288
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,340
It bothered me so I followed him.

289
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,150
And there it is.

290
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,450
Where's the partner?

291
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,780
That's the partner.

292
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,920
Rock Hard
School

293
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,660
My husband is addicted to sex clubs.

294
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,010
Sex clubs?

295
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,780
This is horrible.

296
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,930
How long must we wait?

297
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:17,290
After work, my husband often
brings flowers home for me.

298
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,380
Sounds to me like a nice husband.

299
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,000
What's so nice about him?

300
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,470
He's interested in the young
and cute flower shop girl.

301
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,380
I have witnessed my husband
purchasing flowers once.

302
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,500
He had a lecherous look on his face
while she picked flowers for him.

303
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:37,480
I counted it, he looked
into her eyes seven times.

304
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,400
That could lead to adultery
in a big way, couldn't it?

305
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,800
Well, I'd say that wouldn't...

306
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,620
One time I saw a tag on
the flowers he brought me.

307
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,410
It said "jealous" on it.

308
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,050
That note was meant to challenge me.

309
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,030
It was a message from
that flower shop girl,

310
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,510
that she is jealous of me and
my husband's relationship.

311
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,210
But, those tags are poetic
descriptions of varieties of flowers...

312
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,250
Oh yes, and another thing.

313
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,090
I inspected his briefcase
the other day,

314
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,400
and there was a handcuff
and eye-mask in it.

315
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,290
My husband is entering
the world of S&M!

316
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,170
Um, Sensei,

317
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,070
I need to ask you a question.

318
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,350
I need your help, too.

319
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,340
Could you please wait a moment?

320
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,100
Over here.

321
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,580
Yes.

322
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,490
Here.

323
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,300
Sensei, aren't you done with her yet?

324
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,950
It might take a while.

325
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,040
Why do you ask?

326
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,060
We didn't want to keep the clients
waiting, so we took to counseling them.

327
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,390
Please don't take that
kind of initiative!

328
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,010
When a person poses to be
a lawyer and gives counsel,

329
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:56,240
Unauthorized counsel

330
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:56,240
When a non-lawyer gives legal counsel for the purpose of obtaining fees

331
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,120
it's called unauthorized counsel...

332
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,420
You could get arrested for that.

333
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,160
What? Really?

334
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,240
We were just taking down client
information for you, Sensei.

335
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,000
Can compensation be gotten in
the case of a dating couple?

336
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,900
Do sex clubs fall in the
category of adultery?

337
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,380
Can you get compensated by them?

338
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,880
I don't want to say I can't, but...

339
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,240
Would it be difficult?

340
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,950
Maybe there won't be a monetary payoff?

341
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,670
What, there won't be a monetary payoff?

342
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,630
I wasted time listening to her story.

343
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,590
I feel so stupid.

344
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,060
I'm going home.

345
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,680
Looks like business is booming here.

346
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,580
It might get lots of
requests for investigation.

347
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,800
Freelance Investigator:
Umemoto Kurumi

348
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,480
Sorry to say, but I don't
think you'll be needed.

349
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,130
I'm hungry!

350
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,280
Um...

351
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,760
Sensei! Sensei!

352
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,810
What's the matter?

353
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,030
Why are all of you here?

354
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,540
All of us have the same pain.

355
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,090
I was counseling them.

356
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,060
You can't do that here...

357
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,890
You both have been put through so much.

358
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,010
But don't worry.

359
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,890
Leave it to this Sensei.

360
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,280
He will get you plenty of compensation.

361
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,180
I cannot guarantee results.

362
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,040
"There is no compensation
fee I cannot get for you."

363
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,350
"There is no compensation
fee I cannot get for you."

364
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,650
"There is no compensation
fee I cannot get for you."

365
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,410
Sensei, please help us!

366
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,620
Let's do our best, Sensei.

367
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,180
Then let me ask you this.

368
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,130
Do you hate your mates?

369
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,290
Do I hate him?

370
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,800
Well, sort of...

371
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,640
Of course I hate her.

372
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,060
I hate him.

373
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:52,750
Then you are ready to
completely crush them, right?

374
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,740
You are, aren't you?

375
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,550
Yes.

376
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,470
You are, aren't you?

377
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,760
I am.

378
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,230
I need your help.

379
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,480
I acknowledge all of
you are ready, then.

380
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,300
Let's send your hated
mates straight to hell.

381
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,370
Umemoto-san, it's your turn.

382
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,470
Huh?

383
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,370
She is our freelance investigator.

384
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,650
She will do a background
check on your mates.

385
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,920
Is there a fee for investigation?

386
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,250
It is essential for us to
win and get compensated.

387
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,470
But don't worry, the
investigation fee is on me.

388
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,950
Umemoto-san.

389
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,490
Please go capture solid evidence
of adultery, immediately.

390
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,140
Right now?

391
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,350
Can you do it?

392
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,590
What are you talking about.

393
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,400
There is no evidence that I can't find.

394
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,580
Just like Marilyn says,

395
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,240
"There is no evidence
that I can't find."

396
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,550
Marilyn.

397
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,640
There is no rest for the spy woman.

398
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:30,140
Write a list of suspicious women
your husband got involved with.

399
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,910
Understood.

400
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,070
Sensei, why are you having her do that?

401
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,490
In her case,

402
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,790
it would be difficult to establish proof
of an illicit affair with a specific partner.

403
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,150
So, I will tackle this problem
with the quantity of partners.

404
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,630
In case of a court trial,

405
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,660
the information might prove useful.

406
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,220
There's a possibility that
this will go on trial?

407
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,720
It depends on how your
husband will respond.

408
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,900
But even if it goes to
court, there's no problem.

409
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,940
All I have to do is crush your
husband while others watch.

410
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,410
Understood.

411
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,580
Instructor of the ceramics class
The young wife who's been married for one year at the government-office cafeteria
The woman in miniskirt sitting across him on the train
The high school girl who asked him directions on the street
The female cashier he paid money to at the convenience store

412
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,590
This is only part of what I can
remember, but that's most of it.

413
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,690
Instructor of the ceramics class
The young wife who's been married for one year at the government-office cafeteria
The woman in miniskirt sitting across him on the train
The high school girl who asked him directions on the street
The female cashier he paid money to at the convenience store

414
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,730
"The woman with a child who
sat next to him on the bus"?

415
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,080
Yes. He was pretending
to adore the child

416
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,370
while trying to make
a move on the mother.

417
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,140
That's too brief of an encounter, though.

418
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,080
It's enough.

419
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,880
Huh?

420
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,360
By the way, what is your
husband doing today?

421
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,150
Let's see.

422
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,480
Today is a half-day, so
he's off work at noon.

423
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,820
How convenient.

424
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,770
Let's allow him to do what he wants today.

425
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,880
What? Why?

426
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:01,490
Aren't you curious to know what
your husband does in his free time?

427
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,640
A relationship of merely "seeing
each other" has no legal protection.

428
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,360
Does that mean you can't
sue for compensation?

429
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,430
Please hear me out.

430
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,180
Even in the case of dating,

431
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,010
if there has been promise
of future marriage,

432
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,630
a compensation lawsuit is possible if
there has been a breach of that promise.

433
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,800
By the way, did the two of
you plan to get married?

434
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,860
No, I'm still in high school.

435
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,530
Huh?

436
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,520
Yes, he's a high school student.

437
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,420
How old are you?

438
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,900
I'm eighteen.

439
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,290
And your partner?

440
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,470
She's nineteen.

441
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,970
She's in vocational school.

442
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,900
Then you're both of the age
to get legally married.

443
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,380
It shouldn't be a problem.

444
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,640
Have the two of you ever
discussed marriage?

445
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,910
Did we ever discuss marriage?

446
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,280
Did you attend someone's
wedding together,

447
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,530
or make mutual promises of marrying
each other, that kind of thing.

448
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:04,080
She did say she wanted
to get married early.

449
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,480
I think we might've texted
each other about it.

450
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,750
Here it is.

451
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,300
Yay
Hey
What would you do if I said
I wanted to get married?

452
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,070
I'm in high school you know? I can't plan that far ahead (lol)

453
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,820
That's a little weak.

454
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,550
Because it's a one-sided
question that she'd posed...

455
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,210
Is that so?

456
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,430
Oh, then what if I propose to her?

457
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,250
That is something we could try.

458
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,010
Depending on her reply, we could
have it as outstanding evidence.

459
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,600
Isn't that a little unfair?

460
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,090
But, you want give her hell, don't you?

461
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,570
The end will justify the means.

462
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,780
Yes.

463
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,630
Frequenting sex clubs is an
outstandingly illicit affair.

464
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:53,900
I've had several cases in the past of
compensation lawsuits on those grounds.

465
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,270
Is that so?

466
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,910
By the way...

467
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,570
when is the last time you
had sex with your husband?

468
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,910
Sensei, how could you ask that?

469
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,830
It's often the case that when husbands

470
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,450
begin frequenting sex clubs,
marriages become sexless.

471
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,510
If we can prove his illicit activity of
sex clubs and that your marriage is sexless,

472
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,920
that would beef up the
compensation fee.

473
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,480
When was the last time?

474
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,600
The day before yesterday.

475
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,740
Huh? That's quite recent.

476
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,170
We do it at least twice a week.

477
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,240
That's quite feisty.

478
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,020
In that case, please
recall in fine detail.

479
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,520
For example, ever since he started
frequenting hostess clubs,

480
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,630
foreplay has become sloppy,

481
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,560
or he has become naughtier...

482
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,310
Is there any little change
you can think of?

483
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,250
What's gotten into you, Sensei?

484
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,310
You seem to be enthused all of a sudden.

485
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,210
You were so reluctant at first.

486
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,390
I acknowledge everyone's
willingness to fight.

487
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,800
I'm only responding accordingly.

488
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,330
Um...

489
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,230
Hello, Hakamada speaking.

490
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,410
Masayo's husband:
Otsuka Toru

491
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,340
It's Umemoto.

492
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,130
I'm currently tailing Otsuka
Masayo-san's husband, Toru-san.

493
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,000
He seems to be on his way to the flower
shop, toward his alleged adulterous partner.

494
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,970
Have you captured any
evidence of adultery?

495
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,820
No, not yet.

496
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,220
Even for you, investigating for three
people at once must be difficult.

497
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,030
No.

498
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,900
In season 6 episode 2,

499
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,240
Marilyn did background checks on
eighteen people simultaneously.

500
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,500
Compared to that, this is a cinch.

501
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,110
I'll leave it in your hands.

502
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,860
I've got some noteworthy
information, however,

503
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,480
I sent you an email.

504
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,470
I'm continuing my pursuit.

What has my husband been up to?

510
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,730
The GPS is showing
he's all over the map.

511
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,340
It appears he's taking full
advantage of his freedom.

512
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,230
I should have plenty of evidence soon.

513
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,710
I see.

514
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,170
Sensei. I proposed to her like you said.

515
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,200
I appreciate the sentiment,
but you don't have to say that

516
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,200
I've been thinking I want to marry you after all.

517
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,200
She turned me down.

518
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,570
Don't fret.

519
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:21,950
We have no problem if we have
proof that you want to marry her.

520
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,290
I understand.

521
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,700
Sensei.

522
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,220
Did you find out anything
about my husband?

523
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,410
Please don't worry.

524
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,490
An outstanding investigator is
currently investigating him.

525
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,260
I think we will have
evidence quite soon.

526
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,320
Is that so?

528
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,440
Are you here for legal counsel?

00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,440
Yes.

530
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,010
How long have you been waiting here?

531
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,340
Since 8:30 this morning.

532
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,870
I'm so sorry.

533
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,900
We will get to you right away.

534
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,230
Oh no, I can wait till
the others are finished.

535
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,710
My case isn't a big deal, so...

536
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,120
It's okay, Sensei is just kneading
bread dough right now.

537
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,330
Please come in.

538
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,990
Sensei, we have another client.

539
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:35,970
Huh?

540
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,870
She has been here since early morning.

541
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,200
Nice to meet you.

542
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,530
Understood, please have a seat.

543
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,910
Please have a seat.

544
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,870
Excuse me.

545
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,840
Client:
Kumagai Setsuko

546
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,930
I've been married to my
husband for fifteen years.

547
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,450
Our marriage had been arranged
by both our parents.

548
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,970
Everyone, please don't eavesdrop.

549
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,690
Lawyers are sworn to client
confidentiality, you know.

550
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,850
Come on, lighten up.

551
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,180
Yoshie-san, when did you come back?

552
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,670
You shouldn't do this.

553
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,330
I live for gossip.

554
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,730
Don't take it away from me, I'll die.

555
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,710
My husband's partner is a friend
of his from back in college.

556
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:37,180
My husband has introduced me to her,
and I've seen her several times since.

557
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,350
So, when did your
husband's adultery begin?

558
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,080
Probably...

559
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,690
from before we got married.

560
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,950
What?

561
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,360
This is good.

562
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,740
He had been seeing her
before we were married.

563
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,960
It appears the relationship still
continued after our marriage.

564
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,110
Adultery for fifteen years, wow.

565
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,410
This is quite a case.

566
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,210
Maybe it's worth more than
ten million in compensation.

567
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,370
Amazing.

568
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,600
Ten million yen...

569
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,810
Their secret trysts are perhaps
once or twice a month.

570
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,520
His partner has a husband as well.

571
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,780
A double-adultery to boot.

572
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,970
This is a big fish.

573
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,500
Don't lose it, Sensei!

574
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,190
That's enough, really.

575
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,650
So you say, but you're
pulling me so weakly.

576
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,400
You want to eavesdrop, too, don't you?

577
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,570
How much compensation
are you hoping for?

578
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,030
For compensation...

579
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,680
I want nothing.

580
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,880
You do plan to divorce him, correct?

581
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,840
No.

582
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,190
I have no intention of divorcing him.

583
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,010
It's laughable, I know,

584
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:08,960
but, I love my husband.

585
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,040
My husband is a kind man.

586
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,540
We talk a lot over dinner every day.

587
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,110
We travel a lot together.

588
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,050
I have many fond memories.

589
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,250
If I were to divorce him,

590
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,720
it would be tantamount to
throwing everything away.

591
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,430
Those memories will turn into regret.

592
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:43,000
I absolutely wouldn't
want that to happen.

593
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,920
What then is it you want, Kumagai-san?

594
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,740
What I want...

595
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,480
is for my husband to stop
seeing the other woman.

596
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,680
That is all.

597
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,380
Understood.

598
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:14,680
I will send a notice within a few days to
your husband's adulterous partner.

599
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,290
I will state that there are grounds
for lawsuit compensation,

600
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:23,370
but if the adulterous
relationship were to stop,

601
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,580
compensation will not be pursued.

602
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,530
Since she is married as well,

603
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,770
I'm sure she'd want to
protect her own household.

604
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,510
I will probably get her quick consent.

605
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,600
Sensei, thank you for everything.

606
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,520
You can thank me when
everything works out.

607
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,360
Are you sure you don't
want compensation?

608
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,300
Yes.

609
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,330
Understood.

610
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,120
Everyone, thank you for waiting.

611
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,600
I've made preparation to take a bundle
in compensation from your hateful partners.

612
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,670
Let me explain your respective strategies.

613
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,970
Who should I start with?

614
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,370
Please go ahead of me.

615
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,750
No, I'll wait.

616
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,470
Otsuka-san was here first.

617
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,590
Understood.

618
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,760
Please come with me.

619
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,080
What's the matter with you all?

620
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:47,350
I think I'm going to give
it a little more thought.

621
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,420
What?

622
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,010
I think I want to do that too, maybe.

623
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,150
Sort of.

624
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,000
Me, too.

625
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,290
But why?

626
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,640
We've got plenty evidence, you know.

627
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,720
These are photos of
Otsuka-san's husband.

628
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,570
When he was freed of his shackles,

629
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,380
he seems to have enjoyed his freedom.

630
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,070
At the flower shop.

631
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,870
At the ceramics class.

632
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:19,390
There were cute ladies present
in both establishments.

633
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,590
Our investigator spoke
with both those women.

634
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,740
And it seems your husband goes to those
places based on dubious pretexts.

635
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:32,300
Masayo-san, you and your husband
are having a ten year anniversary, correct?

636
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,260
He's been telling those women,

637
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,370
that he's preparing
secret gifts for you.

638
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,670
At the flower shop,

639
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:43,920
he said he was going to choose
his own flower bouquet.

640
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,240
At the ceramics class,

641
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,530
he said he was going to make
original his-and-her teacups.

642
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,630
As to the handcuff and eye-mask,

643
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,850
it seems he was going to perform some kind of
magic trick to surprise you on your anniversary.

644
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:59,010
Supposedly, he wants to show you how
much he appreciates your watching over him.

645
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:03,670
Pretexts like that are quite common.

646
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,920
It's a way of appealing to
partners, letting them know

647
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,480
they're married, so all
they want is to be lovers.

648
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,030
What a devious husband he is.

649
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:19,500
Next, Oyama-san.

650
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,280
Our investigator sent these photos.

651
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,370
Huh?

652
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,170
An obstetrics clinic...

653
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,750
Obstetrics Clinic

654
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,850
It seems Aya-san
has a child in her womb.

655
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,150
Huh?

656
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,370
According to investigation, she's
been pregnant for three months.

657
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,230
But, then again, who knows
whose baby it could be.

658
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,540
And it seems she's going
to have the baby.

659
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,840
To save up for raising the child, she
started working at a hostess club.

660
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,450
She's quite dandy, and is popular
with the customers there.

661
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,850
I hear her job is to accompany those
customers out to town, and quite often.

662
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,030
Accompany...

663
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,840
So it seems quite clear now,

664
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,320
that she's been wanting
to marry you for real.

665
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:12,200
Now, we can easily prove that
she's made a breach of promise.

666
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,550
And Sawada-san, regarding your husband...

667
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:20,300
He went straightway to the
establishment after school today.

668
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,400
Look how crisp the photo is.

669
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,370
This is sufficient evidence
for illicit activity.

670
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,720
However, there's one thing
I need to let you know.

671
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:35,340
The establishment your husband went to
was not the sex club on the third floor.

672
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:40,620
He went to the establishment with
a gay clientele, on the fourth floor.

673
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,380
Gay Bar
Me and My Bro

674
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,210
What?

675
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,160
So that's how it was...

676
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,330
Not only that,

677
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,150
as confirmed by the establishment,

678
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:52,160
your husband would select a young
man there, who was a former student of his.

679
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,160
They said he was never
there to enjoy himself,

680
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,830
but would talk to the young man,

681
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,140
trying to convince him of things.

682
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,530
They said he was trying to find the
young man another place of employment.

683
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,430
The people at the establishment
find your husband to be a nuisance.

684
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,660
Anyway, who cares why
he goes to that place.

685
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,610
We have this photo, which
is sufficient evidence.

686
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:21,880
Now, who wants to
start their case first?

687
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,620
I'm going home for today.

688
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,720
Why is that?

689
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,130
Today is our ten-year anniversary.

690
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,400
I should have a present
ready for him, too.

691
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,340
But maybe your husband
didn't get you anything.

692
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,520
It's all a pretext to meet with
those female employees.

693
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,480
He's not that kind of man!

694
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,560
I'm sorry.

695
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,550
I see...

696
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,410
Me, too!

697
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,350
I owe her an apology.

698
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,440
What for?

699
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,870
She's the one that should apologize.

700
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,450
The baby she's carrying... is mine.

701
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:24,460
You can't know that.

702
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,290
She's been seen with many
different men, hasn't she?

703
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,070
Aya isn't like that!

704
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,060
It's all my fault.

705
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,130
I'm pathetic.

706
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,360
I should've said I wanted to marry her.

707
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,670
She wouldn't have had to
go work at a hostess club.

708
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,550
So I'm...

709
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,240
going to propose to her again!

710
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,040
And of course, I'll look for a job!

711
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,590
I see.

712
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,660
I'll be going home, too.

713
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,370
But why?

714
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:13,180
The boy who works at that establishment
was an outstanding student.

715
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,110
My husband had high hopes for him.

716
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:22,680
I think my husband was trying
to free him from the sex industry,

717
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,310
and find him legitimate employment.

718
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,330
No, no.

719
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,190
He's probably a closet homosexual.

720
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,720
That's not possible!

721
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:38,950
I told you my husband and
I have frequent intercourse.

722
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:44,550
I said it was the day before
yesterday when we did it last...

723
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,800
But we did it last night, too.

724
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,160
He must be shouldering
concern for his student.

725
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,590
He was more intense with me than usual.

726
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,100
I see.

727
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,520
I know I'm overstepping my bounds,

728
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,890
but all of you are foolish.

729
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,370
You have me as your
legal representative.

730
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,800
There is no compensation
fee I cannot get for you.

731
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:30,310
Are you all telling me, that you
want something more than money?

732
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,910
Yes.

733
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:35,910
Yes!

734
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,880
I do.

735
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,160
Understood.

736
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,250
Well, that's that, then.

737
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,960
Hakamada Law Office

738
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,560
I'm back...

739
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,680
Good work, Umemoto-san.

740
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,400
Good job.

741
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,550
That was a lot of work.

742
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,830
Oh yeah, Sensei.

743
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:06,140
I kept pursuing those targets,
and took these pictures.

744
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,820
Sensei, did you know it was going to
turn out like this from the start?

745
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,180
Of course not.

746
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:56,030
I just gave everyone the facts.

747
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:59,650
But, as to how they would
process those facts,

748
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,390
it was entirely up to the clients.

749
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,570
Before you start basking in your glory,

750
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,230
you owe me for the investigations.

751
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,440
Invoice

752
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,600
Huh?

753
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,170
You said you were going to
foot the bill, didn't you?

754
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,090
Well, can you please wait a little?

755
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,280
Why?

756
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,620
You should've made a bundle
with all those clients.

757
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,740
I didn't make any money
from the clients today.

758
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,720
Because counseling is free, right?

759
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,650
Do you realize how much hardship
we're having because of you?

760
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,080
I assure you, I will pay
you at a later date.

761
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,720
Here's the bill for the
ad in the manga mag.

762
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,500
I'll leave this to you, too!

763
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,810
I received an official reply
from your husband's partner.

764
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,900
She consented to the term in the notice,

765
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,840
and will call off her
relationship with him.

766
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:00,920
Sensei, I am truly sorry.

767
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,830
Why are you apologizing?

768
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:11,730
I shouldn't have asked a lawyer
to step in to ask for her to call it off.

769
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:15,360
Well, it's an unusual case,

770
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,670
but there are many ways
I can be of assistance.

771
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,690
I don't know much about these things.

772
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,390
I've asked other lawyers in the
past, and they all turned me down.

773
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:31,540
You have taken on an
unreasonable request.

774
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,630
I am truly grateful.

775
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,630
Please don't be concerned.

776
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,340
I never turn down anyone
who is truly in need.

777
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,470
Hey, did you drop the catchphrase?

778
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,140
Where he says, "There is no
compensation fee I cannot get for you."

779
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,290
I did.

780
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:59,280
The protagonist's
catchphrase is now this.

781
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,180
Huh?

782
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,880
"I never turn down anyone
who is truly in need."

783
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,880
I never turn down anyone
who is truly in need.

784
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,220
I think this catchphrase
suits the protagonist better.

785
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,130
I think it's good, too.

786
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:10,860
Huh?

787
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:15,230
There can be no other
catchphrase for this protagonist.

788
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,200
She changes what she says
from one minute to the next.

789
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,840
I never turn down anyone
who is truly in need.

790
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,880
Hakamada-sensei's father?

791
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:39,350
Next episode

792
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,810
Hey Yukio, long time no see.

793
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:34,680
His client is his long lost father!

794
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:34,680
They meet again after 30 years...

795
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:35,410
That person is the most
disreputable person in the world.

796
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:39,350
Hakamada's younger sister's wish...

797
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,530
My father is being tricked.

798
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,350
To settle the feud between father and child!

799
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,020
Please protect your father!

800
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,620
That man is not my father.

801
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,820
This drama is a work of fiction

802
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,800
Why must you be so obstinate?
