1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:07,890
Tonight's Gaki No Tsukai, a revival of the Classroom series after 8 years,

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:15,200
In Murakami's place, a new teacher will conduct the lesson

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,530
and also,

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,640
Suda Masaki will take part!

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,640
To leave with a smile, that's it

6
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,240
Ahh this is the worst

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,760
It's so hot

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,950
Is this, that thing?

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,760
Cookie, will be leading the classroom,

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,980
Up until now,

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,980
we've had so many

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,600
What classroom, well we can already guess

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,020
Cookie's Woman Diver (Ama-san) Classroom

14
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,620
I won't say it though

15
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,200
Shoji-san isn't doing the classroom anymore?

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,740
It does feel like Cookie stole this idea

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,880
Well he stole it, and also Shoji-san passed away,

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,020
No, no he's still alive

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,030
Shoji-san is dead right?

20
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,780
No he's still around

21
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,780
He's rotaing his shoulders like crazy

22
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,390
There's no ocean here at all

23
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,800
It's a mountain

24
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,760
It is a mountain

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,380
Found him

26
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,620
He's so high up

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,610
Who?

28
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,220
Ama-san Classroom

29
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,220
C'mere!

30
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,210
Why the hell's he so far away for?

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,390
Over there would've been fine!

32
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,030
Where?

33
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,650
You should be over there!

34
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,650
Right?

35
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,800
Come here!

36
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,800
Why is he there

37
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,320
YOU come here!

38
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,860
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

39
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,100
He's so angry

40
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,860
We couldn't hear that!

41
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,080
Come to the marked spot!

42
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,380
I'm telling you, we can't really hear you

43
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,180
The marked spot?

44
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,140
Marked spot?

45
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,020
It's somewhere here

46
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,720
OK, well done

47
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,110
Who the hell's that?

48
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,480
He's back. He always tags along.

49
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,800
A great morning today,

50
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,330
Everyone ... Thank you for coming,

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,230
Why is he laughing

52
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,160
He's like a Chief Executive in SHOCKER

53
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,160
TN: SHOCKER is a fictional evil organisation from Kamen Rider

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,550
He really is

55
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,230
There's no ocean here

56
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,190
We're in the mountains

57
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,360
And I never said I wanted to be a woman diver!

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,720
There's no sea?

59
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,890
There's no sea!

60
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,000
Ji Ji Ji!

61
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,450
That's so Ji Ji Ji bro!

62
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,510
I'm gonna come down now, wait for me

63
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,720
I'm gonna smack each one of you

64
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,730
Why? Why why?

65
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,020
That's scary man

66
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,400
Emotional Unstability

67
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,510
And he has to come down at the end

68
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,580
Exactly

69
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,140
There, there right?

70
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,110
So slow!

71
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,460
That's a grandfather's pace

72
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,410
Cause it's steep

73
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,980
What the hell

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,640
So very cautious

75
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,600
Good work

76
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,530
Good work

77
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:07,640
Today's class will be led by Cookie,
and the old man from the Fishing Association, Adachi

78
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,900
Excuse me, this is a diving class right?

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,700
Yeah women diver

80
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,280
Why those clothes?

81
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,700
In my class, the Ama-san don't wear such old clothes
This is a wetsuit

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,930
But this is a ZOZO-suit, not a wetsuit!

83
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,340
It's making me laugh

84
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,980
You made a mistake?

85
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,610
I made a mistake

86
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,300
Hey Macchan, can I go on Suberanai Hanashi with this story?

87
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,750
No way idiot!

88
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,760
It'll all be cut!

89
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,860
All cut?

90
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,270
The only unfunny story?

91
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,020
Why? Right Hosei-chan?

92
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,370
It's hot, and hard to hear!

93
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,230
Yeah this is annoying

94
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,750
Oh really? Sorry

95
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,040
Alright then, I'll lend you this,

96
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,020
It's just right,

97
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,360
Probably something useless

98
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,780
I went to Sakata Toshio's house for a shoot, and he gave me this

99
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,260
Sakata Toshio's hat

100
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,660
That definitely is his real hat

101
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,220
He would buy that

102
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,040
That definitely is his real hat

103
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,950
It's really his

104
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,580
That's real!

105
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,540
It's the real thing

106
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,890
You stole it?

107
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,850
He gave it to me

108
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,690
"You're fashionable, so have this"

109
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,690
Who the hell would wear this

110
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,380
This weird fabric

111
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,880
Take care of that please

112
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,740
Can you wear it? I'm embarassed

113
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,930
Hama-chan, put this on

114
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,140
Why do I gotta wear it?

115
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,810
It'll look good on you I think

116
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,220
You...

117
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,220
It's cute

118
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,980
It's Sakata's right?

119
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,630
TN: Sakata Toshio is a very senior and respected comedian
Hamada is referring to him without any honorifics

120
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,980
Sakata? It's Sakata-shishou

121
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,870
Put his hat on please

122
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,140
Put it on

123
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,800
Why are you smelling it?

124
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,650
You would smell it too

125
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,140
"would smell it too"

126
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,000
So lame

127
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,530
The Shishou's hat is so small

128
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,680
Yeah he has a small head

129
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,680
SO lame

130
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,690
It's fashionable

131
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,290
And somehow, everyone,

132
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,770
Some good news,

133
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,420
There's a part 2 of this episode

134
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,390
2 weeks of this?

135
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,840
Eh? Really?

136
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,980
No way

137
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,620
However, you guys aren't entertaining enough for 2 episodes,

138
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,820
Too weak

139
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,670
You're really saying that

140
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,540
You don't have the charisma,

141
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,290
But we have some quality charisma available to us,

142
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,290
Really?

143
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,490
There is 1 extra person joining,

144
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,210
Let's show them all a refreshed, brand new Gaki No Tsukai!

145
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,300
Why do you care for Gaki No Tsukai?

146
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,270
Of course I'm caring for it, look at us here now

147
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,580
You just happen to be doing an episode

148
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,110
You say that but I'm doing a lot!

149
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,450
On that, No Laughing special,

150
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,300
You guys didn't call me back on!

151
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,320
It's so hilarious

152
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,520
Cookie's specialty is short explosive skits,

153
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,660
There is a worry he can't sustain 2 episodes

154
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,900
I'm gonna call in the new guy, okay?

155
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,460
It's a real guy right?

156
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,040
Why is he calling him like that?

157
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,020
If he's in the same clothes as us he might not hear

158
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,770
He's here, he's here

159
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,440
Oh he's here

160
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,680
Same clothes

161
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,220
Seriously?

162
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,380
I look forward to working with you

163
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,530
For real?

164
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,800
Why did you come for this ocassion?

165
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,400
This ocassion is no good

166
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,660
There will be no happy ending

167
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,220
There will be at least 3 misfortunes

168
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,500
Bringing charisma to the Ama-san class  -  Suda Masaki's unexpected appearance

169
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,500
I'm not really sure,

170
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,460
I'm not aware of the plan

171
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,730
I'll just have to go along with them

172
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,970
Suda-kun?

173
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,400
I heard I can promote myself here

174
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:52,910
Konto Ga Hajimaru

175
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,070
Promote your show?

176
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,440
I'm not at all surprised

177
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,260
See, exactly

178
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,390
Is it related to Ama-san?

179
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,060
It's unrelated

180
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,140
Cut it out then, let's stop this

181
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,900
Why women divers?

182
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,980
This is Murakami Shoji-san's thing right?

183
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,460
You know about that

184
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,210
It's the Classroom Series

185
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,450
Then I'm not looking forward to this

186
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,900
Yeah this series sucks

187
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,550
We have to make 2 episodes using your charisma

188
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,060
Eh? My charimsa?

189
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,060
Exactly

190
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,080
These comedians are too old
And this guy can't be managed by Yoshimoto

191
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,460
Unmanage-Yoshimoto can't manage him?

192
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,040
Yes

193
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,180
He's a pain in the ass

194
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:29,490
Before the training, they will recieve items that woman divers need

195
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,140
First, clearly you need ear plugs

196
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,970
A woman diver definitely needs these

197
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,100
Oh really?

198
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,700
Then, Endo,

199
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,170
OK, Oh, I have to get it?

200
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,820
No shit, am I supposed to go there?

201
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,350
I thought you might-

202
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,900
The teacher coming to you?

203
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,060
Oh I'm sorry

204
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,900
You, listen, you

205
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,750
OK OK sorry, I'm sorry

206
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,490
Why woul-

207
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,930
Enough, enough, that's too much

208
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,900
Now I can see, you have so many wrinkles

209
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,750
We don't get any?

210
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,740
Everyone, everyone gets one

211
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,770
Thank you

212
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,800
Next, uhhh, Tanaka

213
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,330
Why's he the second batter?

214
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,330
A Sukeban Yo-Yo

215
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,820
Sukeban Yo-Yo...

216
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,110
Is it related to woman divers?

217
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,260
Of course it is!

218
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,920
When you run out of oxygen, suck in from this crevice

219
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,740
The crevice...

220
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,110
Oh, it's started

221
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,010
The unfunny streak has started

222
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,820
It's your fault!

223
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,060
Look closely, after his joke bombed, his face turned red

224
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,510
It's red! It's turning red!

225
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,610
Oh! It's turning red!

226
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,320
No it isn't

227
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,680
It's not

228
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,300
When you bomb it's a signal

229
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,890
Someone of your class can't bully me!

230
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,890
Why does that matter?

231
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,140
I can bully you

232
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,370
So next, uhhh, Matsumoto

233
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,820
What is it?

234
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,800
White glasses, they're Fu-kun's glasses

235
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,980
Why do I gotta look like Fu-kun from when he divorced Tsuchiya Kaori

236
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,420
From when he was in that thing

237
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,420
TN: I can't make out what Yama-chan said

238
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,990
Oh yeah, from that thing

239
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,020
I'm fine like this?

240
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,430
Yeah you're fine .You're wearing that for the rest of the day

241
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,560
Rest of the day

242
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,230
I didn't get anything that special

243
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,220
Umm, Suda,

244
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,130
Suda, you, you take, take this

245
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,840
You're so stylish, those clothes are a pity. This should be good.

246
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,780
The hell's that?

247
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,610
That's too warm

248
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,340
I have to wear this on top of everything?

249
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,970
It's Fu-kun's aloha shirt

250
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,830
Fu-kun's back

251
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,140
Fu-kun again

252
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,190
Give that to me then,

253
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,350
Finish my outfit then

254
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,980
As a set

255
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,550
So hot

256
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,790
Yeah it's too hot

257
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,090
So Hamada,

258
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,270
Hamada already got something

259
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,760
Hamada, come here

260
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,500
He already has something

261
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,900
Hamada, here,

262
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,560
There's something else

263
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,520
Really?

264
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,220
Hamada already got the hat

265
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,790
The hat is just for fun,

266
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,420
Should we stay here?

267
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,230
YEAH DAS FINE

268
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,410
Why that tone?

269
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,780
Why's he taking Hamada by himself

270
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,290
Why do I have to go so far? Just leave it

271
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,260
Do it someone else, why me?

272
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,640
Is it always like this?

273
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,230
Well, yeah. Speaking of always...

274
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,680
A weird atmosphere

275
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,040
We just have to leave it to him

276
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,590
What is this?

277
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,490
Sidecar, a sidecar

278
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,460
It's only the side car

279
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,140
What's the point of just the sidecar

280
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,880
It won't move

281
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,770
Great, aint it?

282
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,300
This part looks like a rocket

283
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,980
Put your legs in

284
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,280
Great yeah

285
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,560
You're filming from here today, okay?

286
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,000
The whole time, you there,

287
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,780
Wait, wait, I'll come back

288
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,660
I said you're staying there

289
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,350
Hamada should just sit in the side car!

290
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,200
You chimapnzee  bastard!

291
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,700
He's talking so much shit

292
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,620
The hell are you doing?!

293
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,630
He's so angry, he's talking so much shit

294
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,020
Hamada is,

295
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,650
You guys find Hamada annoying right?

296
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,100
No we don't

297
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,930
I got him stuck in the sidecar

298
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,700
That's not right,

299
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,850
Can't Hamada-san be with us?

300
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,660
San? Hamda-san? What do you mean -san?
Is that guy important?

301
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,730
He's our senpai

302
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,770
He's our senpai

303
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,380
More than Macchan?

304
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,400
The same, the same position in the industry

305
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,400
He's very important then

306
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,640
Yeah it's not good. Hurry u-

307
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,140
He didn't know who he is?

308
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,450
The way he runs!

309
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,450
What's with that running?

310
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,020
He has to do something each time

311
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,410
He doesn't watch much TV maybe

312
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,410
Yeah

313
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,410
Hamada from DownTown

314
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,710
I thought you were a super low rank person. Sorry!

315
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,150
Eh? What?

316
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,390
Why should I be a low rank person?

317
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,500
Good, good, good

318
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,570
He deserved that much

319
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,140
I wish he hit harder

320
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,140
Exactly

321
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,350
A good one now

322
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,890
Can't be helped

323
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,100
You're a pain in the ass!

324
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,170
Just do the class!

325
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,110
He said "I thought you were a super low rank person"

326
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,450
It seems he didn't know

327
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,250
Somehow, it seems he didn't know you

328
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,800
His clothes are so dirty

329
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,380
So dirty now

330
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,220
I think that's enough for one episode

331
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,510
Hell no!

332
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,170
Not yet

333
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,800
Not at all

334
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,830
Don't underestimate Terrestial Broadcasting!

335
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,170
I wanna finish this soon

336
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,820
I want to finish this soon, actually

337
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,980
"Finish this soon, actually"

338
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,200
My chest hurts a bit

339
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,320
Can't be helped

340
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,500
Was Igor Vovchanchyn here?

341
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,500
You kicked me like Igor Vovchanchyn

342
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,030
Let's continue the training,

343
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,230
When you enter the sea,

344
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,800
The scariest thing in there, is fish, right?

345
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,450
Fish?

346
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,450
And the scariest one of all, is Tuna

347
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,870
Tuna?

348
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,870
You aren't aware of a Tuna's ferociousness

349
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,650
But why would tuna attack an Ama-san?

350
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,510
There's tuna that seeks out Ama

351
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,010
Don't say "Ama" like it's Amagasaki

352
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,010
TN: Amagasaki is DownTown's hometown

353
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,260
Oh, Ama, uh, Amagasaki, huh

354
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,900
What the hell!

355
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,300
What happened?

356
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,750
Get a grip, Teacher

357
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,500
This guy is our teacher?

358
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,570
He's really terrible today huh?

359
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:09,200
Also, that guy, Suda-kun's manager, didn't laugh at all

360
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,190
Pay attention to them sometimes

361
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,870
You have to look over sometimes

362
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,560
Not laughing, at all

363
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,220
Oh! Long time no see!

364
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,720
You know him?!

365
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,730
Liar

366
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,250
You were the guy in that Roppongi club,
holding your Zima going like this

367
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,690
Stop it,

368
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,740
Cut it out

369
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,050
Don't involve him

370
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,740
He's got a great manager

371
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,490
This guy is messed up

372
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,740
I didn't want to picture that

373
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,470
Back to training, time to fight Tuna

374
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,340
I'll be the guinea pig, you guys come at me like a Tuna

375
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,250
Really?

376
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,110
What is it?

377
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,110
I thought I could film your faces as you hit me

378
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,160
I don't like that somehow

379
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,420
It's unwanted

380
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,220
He's like some college student

381
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,690
It's unnecessary

382
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,840
I don't want that to go viral

383
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,620
Matsumoto,

384
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,900
Matsumoto-san, if you will,

385
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,060
How hard should I hit?

386
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,540
Yeah

387
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,630
How hard?

388
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,420
However hard a Tuna hits, according to you

389
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,130
Oh yeah like that, yeah

390
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,660
Ah, no good, no good

391
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,910
That shit, your footwork is no good for a Tuna

392
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,980
Why?

393
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,500
Why? Uhh, yeah, umm,

394
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,110
Like how a Kei-Truck, in a small-

395
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,240
If you can't say it clearly then who cares

396
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,490
He was just mumbling

397
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,740
I ended too early?

398
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,570
You didn't end it properly

399
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,140
Then, next, Hama-chan you go

400
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,610
Harder than before is better right?

401
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,310
Yup, harder

402
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,360
Looks the same as the last one to me

403
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,100
It's something like that

404
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,140
Absolute rubbish

405
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,200
That was like, you know, ...

406
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,510
Uhh,

407
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,010
Just forget it

408
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,510
Like Concorde,

409
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,420
Concorde?

410
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:59,070
It's like, when Concorde has its nose down while taxiing,
and the tip slightly grazes you

411
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,160
That won't hit you

412
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,200
So weak

413
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,400
Next, Suda takes the challenge

414
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,340
I think I gotta hit harder

415
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,060
Harder would be better

416
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,340
I got it, Teacher, let's do this

417
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,330
Suda, for you,

418
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,730
So cute

419
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,970
High Heel's Ringo (Apple) Dakimakura

420
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,720
Why?

421
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,410
Yoshimoto is really taking the piss recently

422
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,570
Yup,

423
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,440
This is the Ama, you are the Tuna

424
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,500
We can do it the other way around too

425
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,280
This can be the Tuna

426
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,580
It's better for Suda-kun to hit

427
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,340
Harder than last time right?

428
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,690
Of course

429
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,260
Amazing

430
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,270
Is that what Tuna is like?

431
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,270
Ringo was embraced

432
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,730
Don't be an Orca!

433
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,910
That was an Orca

434
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,390
You said to hit hard

435
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,700
So let's move on, to defeating the Tuna underwater

436
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,550
What do you mean

437
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,090
Underwater?

438
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,120
Underwater fight training

439
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:18,450
Next, fighting the real Tuna

440
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,830
I'll be the Tuna

441
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,810
Macchan, let's do this

442
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,900
This thing, watch out it's a knife

443
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,790
It's supposed to be real now

444
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,070
We fight using this?

445
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,900
In real life, imagine this is a giant blue dragon

446
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,520
Then prepare that,

447
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,420
I think killing a dragon with this will be too difficult

448
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,580
Think of it as the real thing

449
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,050
Sorry, there were budget concerns

450
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,730
The hell does that mean

451
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,860
Matsumoto fight - Cookie-sensei's plan?

452
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,060
Try to stab the Tuna

453
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,660
Try to defeat the Tuna

454
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,420
What is this...

455
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,960
This guy is annoying. I seriously want to hit him once this is over.

456
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,660
Be our guest,

457
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,760
When my face changes, the battle starts

458
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,180
Oh, it changed

459
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,410
It did indeed

460
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,420
Here he go-

461
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,420
Not yet, not yet

462
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,050
Cookie in the flesh, trying to find the best moment

463
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,220
It changed though

464
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,600
It did look like it changed

465
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,650
Taking so long, seriously

466
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,040
Step back please,

467
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,970
STEP BACK!

468
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,550
STEP BACK CAMERA!

469
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,290
GET BACK, CAMERA!

470
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,540
Did it change yet?

471
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,380
It did look like it changed just now

472
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,550
Oh! It changed, it changed!

473
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,540
It hasn't changed yet, ok?

474
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,300
Still?

475
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,850
IT CHANGED NOW!

476
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,150
So easy, I'm dodging

477
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,740
Dodging so much, super easy

478
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,550
Totally, totally dodging you

479
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,020
Totally dodging you

480
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,020
This is the best moment?

481
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,620
This is hell

482
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,380
This is hell

483
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,400
Hell indeed

484
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,300
Messing with Macchan like this is no joke!

485
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,990
Oh no

486
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,640
He's Yoshimoto's treasure

487
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,220
He's Yoshimoto's treasure!

488
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,400
Exactly!

489
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,200
I have no idea what to do

490
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,910
Cookie-sensei chooses Hosei next

491
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,780
This is the scary part. Normally it would be over with that.

492
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,980
Yama-chan, this is gonna be hell

493
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,640
I'm motivated to do this

494
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,670
Really?

495
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,040
This thing, this way is-

496
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,380
It's like,

497
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,180
Like Jackie

498
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,860
Cookie-sensei told us to add Kung-Fu sounds here

499
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,270
How is this gonna end?

500
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,400
What the hell is this?!

501
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,360
Who would laugh at this?!

502
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,020
I'm not laughing,

503
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,980
or you!

504
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,020
Nobody's laughing!!

505
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,060
Next uhh -  These territorial disputes are nasty huh?

506
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,840
Who's?

507
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,510
Between Ama's

508
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:11,670
Also, the fishermen don't take Ama's seriously

509
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,070
You need to be good at scolding,

510
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,870
So let's try that, OK?

511
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:23,160
Dealing with territorial disputes - Necessary for this, is training to yell

512
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,020
Ready, steady,

513
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,180
Seriously,

514
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,200
Kay?

515
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,470
Asashoryu~

516
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,470
TN: Asashoryu is a sumo wrestler

517
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,940
Asashoryu~

518
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,310
And finally,

519
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,540
Maino-umi~

520
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,540
TN: Mainoumi is a sumo wrestler

521
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,820
Yeah! Skill Department Store!

522
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,830
If you say that, you win

523
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,400
You won?

524
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,390
If you say "Skill Department Store" you win

525
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,420
I'm so confused

526
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,900
Ah, really?

527
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,530
Over there,

528
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,490
There's a bike, go over there

529
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,210
There

530
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,720
So far away!

531
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,370
Pain in the ass!

532
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,250
Pain in the as!

533
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,200
The cameraman won't come with you either

534
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,260
That's quite a distance

535
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,710
For the "Mainoumi"?

536
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,310
For the "Mainoumi"

537
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,590
Oh sweet! He looks just like Fu-kun from the back

538
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,050
That's not good

539
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,270
What do you mean "not good"?

540
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,490
Not bad, not bad

541
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,820
Why the sidecar?

542
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,100
Yeah

543
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,550
Okay! Head Crown Restoration!

544
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,020
Don't say stuff like that

545
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,620
Okay!

546
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,900
Suda OK!

547
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,420
What training was that

548
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,880
Voice training

549
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,580
Suda, your agency didn't approve this, so run over

550
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,520
He is running

551
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,020
Why are you running so slowly?

552
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,920
I ran quite a bi-

553
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,500
You run like that while everyone's waiting?

554
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,800
It's supposed to be like this right? Like this!

555
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,730
This is how you should run!

556
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,360
Definitely like this!

557
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,800
Next, Hamada and Suda reply from the top of a hill

558
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:36,140
So now I'm gonna ask both of you questions, in turn. Reply in a loud voice.

559
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,180
Questions?

560
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,700
First is Suda

561
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,060
What's another good name for Suda Masaki

562
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:51,280
If Suda Masaki wasn't your name, what would another good name be? A cool name

563
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,280
Micheal

564
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,040
Micheal J Fox

565
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,480
That's already taken!

566
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,060
He's a huge star!

567
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,380
So, still you Suda

568
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,120
What is Yamasaki Hosei-san lacking?

569
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,900
Go ahead!

570
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,580
Hatred, I think

571
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,210
Such a nice guy

572
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,120
No maliciousness you mean

573
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,880
A good answer

574
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,530
So next, Suda

575
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,060
Still me?

576
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,300
This is hell, hold on

577
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,240
What is this?

578
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,890
A new name that Cocorico should adopt

579
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,030
Your answer?

580
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,510
Turtle & Rabbit

581
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,240
What is that? What does that mean?

582
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,400
Turtle...

583
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,000
Turtle & Rabbit?

584
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,080
Not Rabbit & Turtle then

585
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,600
Exactly

586
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,500
I got it wrong...

587
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,950
C'mon man

588
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,790
Hamada, I'll give you one question

589
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,090
1 good thing about Dorians?

590
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,800
Dorians is a comedy duo that Hamada is friends with

591
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,030
He does take care of them a lot

592
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,070
1 good thing about Dorians?

593
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,090
They come whenver I call them!

594
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,090
He's being serious

595
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,470
That's not a good reason to like them
