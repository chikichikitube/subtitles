00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,430
Presenter: Toshiaki Kasuga (Audrey)

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,990
It's Kasuga from Audrey

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,000
Toos!

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,430
The crowd is going crazy

9
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,500
What a welcome

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,300
Alright, alright, here comes the Kasuga

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,770
I wanted to ask you something: have you ever played golf before?

12
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,340
I wanted to ask you something: have you ever played golf before?

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,080
I know Hamada plays it

14
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,080
I do, yes

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,310
Quite a lot of you--- oh, you too, Degawa?

16
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,310
- Do you play golf?

17
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,880
I really suck at it, but I occasionally play it

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,080
So you like it, huh

19
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,620
You too, Nana Suzuki?

20
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,890
My husband's father plays golf

21
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,290
Yeah?

22
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,420
And I want to get along with him

23
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,420
I see

24
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,190
So I promised him I'll play it with him

25
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,060
That's gonna make him happy, right?

26
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,060
- Yes

27
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,130
And you, Yamashige?

28
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,030
I--- yeah

29
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,560
I've been playing for 4 years

30
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,560
- Do you play?

31
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,330
But...

32
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,030
No matter what I use, I can't get past 150 yards

33
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,600
No matter what I use, I can't get past 150 yards

34
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,740
Even with a driver?

35
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,740
That too

36
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,570
Yeah, no more than 150

37
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,570
With an iron club?

38
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,070
I don't even know if that's a bad thing to begin with

39
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,980
I don't even know if that's a bad thing to begin with

40
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,980
That's right

41
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,280
It's not clear

42
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,280
So, the two from Harisenbon and Matsumoto don't play

43
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,210
We don't

44
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,680
But one day I'd really like to try it~

45
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,680
Hey, it's Nana!

46
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,550
It's Nana-chan

47
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,860
So you're considering it, right?

48
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,560
Alright, alright...

49
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,190
Today I've brought with me a golf-related theory, here it is:

50
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:28,170
Theory: A person who doesn't know golf rules
will end up believing any rule they impose on him

51
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,730
That's definitely gonna work

52
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,240
- I'm sure of it
- They're gonna believe anything

53
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,510
No doubt about it

54
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,280
Some things are obvious for experienced golf players

55
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,150
For example, if your ball enters the bunker

56
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,280
You can't touch the sand with your club before you hit it

57
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
You can't touch the sand with your club before you hit it

58
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,680
Really?

59
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,880
You just have to hit it

60
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,620
It's full of stingy rules like this one

61
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,620
- That's true

62
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,690
I want to find out how far can we go with them

63
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,520
I want to find out how far can we go with them

64
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,520
- I see, I get it

65
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,190
We made lots of experiments with it

66
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,360
VTR: startz!

67
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
Why the laughs?

68
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:05,570
A person who doesn't know golf rules will end up believing any rule they impose on him

69
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:05,570
Theory:

70
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:05,570
Verification

71
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,400
There's no way they won't believe them

72
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,400
- 'Morning

73
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,140
Today's theory testers are going to be...?

74
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,140
Good morning

75
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,980
Golf experience:

76
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,980
Golf experience:

77
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,980
Golf experience:

78
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,980
few times

79
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,980
years

80
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,980
years

81
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,980
Audrey

82
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,980
Haranishi Takayuki

83
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,980
Kasuga Toshiaki

84
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,980
Kotohge Eiji

85
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,980
Viking

86
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,150
These three experienced players will be in charge

87
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,580
staff) I want you guys to trick today's target

88
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,720
staff) I want you guys to trick today's target

89
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,950
staff) I want you guys to trick today's target

90
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,990
staff) Your target doesn't know about golf, and he's...

91
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,890
staff) Your target doesn't know about golf, and he's...

92
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,690
Nishimura from Viking

93
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:43,510
Nishimura Mizuki

94
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:43,510
Target

95
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:43,510
Viking

96
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,790
I see...

97
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,220
- He's gonna fall for it

98
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,420
It's possible he has seen some golf on TV before

99
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,190
It's possible he has seen some golf on TV before

100
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,600
So we should be careful not to do anything too absurd

101
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,300
So we should be careful not to do anything too absurd

102
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,570
Still, he's rather dumb, or better

103
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,430
Still, he's rather dumb, or better

104
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,240
- He's gonna believe them
- Yeah, it's not like you pay
attention to rules

105
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,100
He's the type who easily believes what people say

106
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,240
He's the type who easily believes what people say

107
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,140
So I think he's gonna believe us if we don't go too far

108
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,510
So I think he's gonna believe us if we don't go too far

109
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,840
- It's not like he knows the rules
- That's true

110
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,580
And now, our three masterminds

111
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:52,020
Are going to come up with fake rules Nishimura would believe to be real

112
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,480
- Sounds fun!

113
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,450
Comedians' first-experiences tours!

114
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,820
Comedians' first-experiences tours!

115
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,120
- Oh yeah!

116
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,820
- Let's do this

117
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,290
Fake episode filming: start

118
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,730
And with this, the plan is going to begin

119
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,360
Any newcomer here?

120
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,360
- Who is it?

121
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,800
Any newcomer here?

122
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,800
Here I am

123
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,160
Oh, Nishimura?

124
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,200
Yes

125
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,970
You never played it before?

126
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,970
- Not even once

127
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:15,640
Fake Golf Rules

128
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,770
The rules they have come up with

129
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,610
Have been arranged in levels

130
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,640
For a total of 12 levels

131
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,150
Is Nishimura going to believe in all of them?

132
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,150
Is Nishimura going to believe in all of them?

133
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,550
Before they start playing

134
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,450
- I think he's going to

135
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,450
It's time to check the outfit and equipments

136
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,450
Alright guys

137
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,520
I can see you all have collars

138
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,520
Yes

139
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,320
Golf has his dress code, you know

140
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,320
- That's right

141
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,060
Golf has his dress code, you know

142
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,990
That's important

143
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,360
Are you saying that I can't play without this?

144
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
- That's right

145
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,130
- Is this true?

146
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,760
Only polos are allowed

147
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:43,200
Actual etiquette

148
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:43,200
T-shirts, jeans, sandals and such are not allowed

149
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,130
- Oh, so that's actually true

150
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,560
Really?

151
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,900
That's right, and not even jeans-- you're fine with that

152
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,030
- I didn't know that

153
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,030
- So stingy...

154
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,900
Not only that...

155
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,940
Do you all have this with you?

156
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,940
- Yeah, I do

157
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,210
I have it

158
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,210
- You have it? Great

159
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,610
This is your score card

160
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,910
We use it to write down our score

161
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,140
We use it to write down our score

162
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,650
And here comes the first fake golf rule....

163
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,780
So, we write our score in our score cards, right?

164
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,190
We can make this rule where you have to write with a fountain pen

165
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,260
We can make this rule where you have to write with a fountain pen

166
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,590
We can make this rule where you have to write with a fountain pen

167
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:14,600
Being a sport for gentlemen, you have to carry a fountain pen with you

168
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:14,600
Fake rule:

169
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,260
You know, being a sport for gentlemen and all

170
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,860
- He's falling for it

171
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,530
And of course, Nishimura has no reason to carry a fountain pen with him

172
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,260
- It sounds plausible

173
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,670
- It sounds believable enough

174
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,870
Sorry but err... there's no pen here

175
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,200
Sorry but err... there's no pen here

176
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,300
Fountain pen?

177
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,840
Haven't you brought it with you?

178
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,540
Huh? I--...

179
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,840
Huh? I--...

180
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,570
I haven't brought it with me

181
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,010
I haven't brought it with me

182
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:23,680
You haven't? Oh, right, he's a beginner after all

183
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,810
You haven't? Oh, right, he's a beginner after all

184
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,810
- I see, makes sense

185
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,050
So, what now?

186
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,280
How about you borrow it from the caddy?

187
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,280
- Sure, excuse me

188
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,220
Sir

189
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:30,820
The fountain pen will be 3000￥(28$)

190
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,320
The fountain pen will be 3000￥(28$)

191
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,660
Wha-- that much?

192
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,560
Wha-- that much?

193
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,090
That's more or less its price

194
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,230
It depends on the golf field

195
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,360
- It's cheap to be honest

196
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,230
Didn't know that

197
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,000
- That's right

198
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,970
Can I have the receipt?

199
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,530
- At least for a fountain pen

200
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,130
He bought it without questioning anything

201
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,130
He bought it without questioning anything

202
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,070
He bought it without questioning anything

203
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,070
He bought it without questioning anything

204
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,570
He bought it without questioning anything

205
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,570
He bought it without questioning anything

206
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,740
- I can see this being an
actual golf rule

207
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,210
3000 yen for this thing?

208
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:55,840
Whatever dude, just get over it

209
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,210
Whatever dude, just get over it

210
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,140
It's that-- it's pricey, it's a bit pricey

211
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,310
It's that-- it's pricey, it's a bit pricey

212
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,510
- It doesn't seem far from
a golf concept

213
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,320
Bring a fountain pen with you

214
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,320
Fake Golf Rules

215
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,320
█████████████

216
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,780
Let's see what's our next level 2 fake rule

217
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,280
You see

218
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
It's usually 2 liters for a 18 holes field

219
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,550
- That thing is huge!

220
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,350
It's usually 2 liters for a 18 holes field

221
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,220
You have to drink it all before we finish the game

222
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,350
- Too big

223
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:17,400
Fake rule:

224
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:17,400
You have to drink two liters of water before the game ends

225
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,220
- And this is only level 2?!

226
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,220
All of it?

227
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,220
- Yes

228
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,830
We're only doing 3 holes today

229
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:14,830
- Yes

230
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,030
- This is torture

231
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,400
You gotta drink it all within those

232
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:17,900
Eh? But what happens if I don't?

233
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,460
Eh? But what happens if I don't?

234
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,470
- Isn't it too early for this?

235
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,630
You lose one point

236
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,630
Eh?

237
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,800
You get one penalty

238
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,670
- One penalty...

239
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,470
What if there's only a tiny bit left?

240
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,470
It's gonna affect your score

241
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,440
Whoa~ so strict!

242
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,870
Whoa~ so strict!

243
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,170
- It's too early for this!

244
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:29,770
What were they thinking back then?

245
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,980
What were they thinking back then?

246
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:32,940
And even this one

247
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,880
- You're right

248
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,040
Cleared without problems

249
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,040
Cleared without problems

250
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,450
Cleared without problems

251
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,450
Cleared without problems

252
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,450
Is being trusted without questioning it

253
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,180
- He's incredible

254
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,680
Wow, this is ice-cold

255
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,450
And then...

256
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,150
- This is hilarious

257
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,890
- Wow!
- Nice shot there

258
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,590
Really good shot

259
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,760
Look at that

260
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,190
Perfectly landed

261
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,490
The game finally starts

262
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,030
The game finally starts

263
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,900
The game has finally begun

264
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,030
- What a nice shot

265
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,030
Wow!

266
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,700
But our beginner Nishimura...

267
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,070
- He hit that

268
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,270
Well, it flew

269
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,740
He struggles to make his ball fly straight ahead

270
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,410
- The fact he hit it is good enough
- I guess so

271
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,510
Oh no!

272
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,840
On his third hit, it falls in the pond

273
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,450
On his third hit, it falls in the pond

274
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,450
On his third hit, it falls in the pond

275
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,750
It disappeared

276
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,480
It's buried in the pond now!

277
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,620
It's buried in the pond now!

278
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,620
- The ball just disappeared

279
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,950
And of course this means...

280
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,520
Looks like we have a lost ball, go to her, she's got the papers

281
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,790
Looks like we have a lost ball, go to her, she's got the papers

282
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,760
Looks like we have a lost ball, go to her, she's got the papers

283
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,890
I'll have you fill out this form here

284
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,060
- Sure

285
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,960
I'll have you fill out this form here

286
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,830
Sorry if stuff like this takes time

287
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,690
Eh? This...

288
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,100
Eh? This...

289
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,860
Do I have to write my address too?

290
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,470
Fake rule:

291
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,470
If you lose a ball, you have to file a report which will be sent to the police

292
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,730
It's because it went missing, you know

293
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,270
It's the standard practice

294
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,470
To the police?

295
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,640
The police is going to deal with it

296
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,040
Is the police involved?

297
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,010
We gotta forward it to the police, you know there's money involved

298
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,640
We gotta forward it to the police, you know there's money involved

299
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,340
We gotta forward it to the police, you know there's money involved

300
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,110
That's 'cause one can just take it and make it his own, you know

301
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,950
- Makes sense...

302
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,950
That's 'cause one can just take it and make it his own, you know

303
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,280
- So irritating!

304
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,880
He's still a bit doubtful

305
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,580
- "Lost ball"...

306
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:45,750
Convincing reasons

307
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:45,750
Convincing reasons

308
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,290
Convincing reasons

309
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,290
Convincing reasons

310
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,620
But their convincing reasons and serious expressions are doing the job

311
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,090
Serious Expressions

312
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,090
Serious Expressions

313
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,290
Serious Expressions

314
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,290
Serious Expressions

315
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,720
And there's more

316
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,190
Wait, stop, listen to me

317
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:55,930
Yes?

318
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,460
This is the cart road

319
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,460
- Yes

320
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,930
The cart road is not considered part of the golf field, got it?

321
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,930
- Yes?

322
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,300
The cart road is not considered part of the golf field, got it?

323
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,670
The cart road is not considered part of the golf field, got it?

324
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,640
'Cause it's a road

325
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,640
- Exactly

326
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,000
If it's outside the field

327
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,110
You can't completely step on it

328
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,110
- What?!

329
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,880
You gotta raise your feet

330
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,110
How? Like this?

331
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,680
Yes

332
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,350
Ooohh...

333
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,120
Fake rule:

334
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,120
You must stand on your tiptoes to hit a ball outside the field

335
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,610
- The hell is this?

336
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,920
- I've never seen this

337
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,350
It's fine, like this

338
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,190
- What's going to happen
at the end?!

339
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,050
Here I go

340
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,030
Whoa, it flew so far

341
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,230
Whoa, it flew so far

342
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,230
- Nice one

343
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,930
Is the shot ok?

344
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,930
- Too much!

345
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,560
- This is crazy

346
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,570
Why couldn't you hit it properly?!

347
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,970
Why couldn't you hit it properly?!

348
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,500
You're pretty good on two feet

349
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,010
Bring a fountain pen with you

350
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,010
Drink 2 entire liters of water before the game ends

Fake Golf Rules

352
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,010
If the ball isn't on the field, you must
hit it while standing on tiptoes

353
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,010
Lost balls must be reported

Nishimura easily cleared everything up to level 4

359
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,310
Here comes the next fake rule

360
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,310
- There's still more?

361
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,310
It shouldn't be a problem

362
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,910
It's in!

363
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,580
Yeah, is it?

364
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,620
It's in

365
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,620
- Great job

366
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,850
I'm impressed

367
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,250
You were pretty far too

368
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,550
All he needed was a flick

369
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,390

What's that? What's that?

00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,530
It's a spoon, duh

372
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,160
And you're supposed to use that?

373
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,160

Fake rule:

When you get a ball into the hole, you have to scoop it out with a spoon

376
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,970
You gotta use a spoon?

377
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,970

378
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,970
- That's right

379
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,230
If you get it in, use a spoon

380
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,070

382
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,970
- No, I don't

383
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,440
And that means

384
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,240
Spoon bought for 1000 yen

385

And then...

389
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,450
- Incredible...
- He's spending so much!

390
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,510
It's in!

391
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,450
- He's good, actually

392
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,150
He made it

393
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,190

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,760
The spoon is so small...

397
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,490
He retrieved his first ball with a spoon

398
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,490
And as he scoops out his first ball with his spoon...

399
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,490

559
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,290
There are no limits to the England System's set of rules

560
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,290
They've cleared two of them

561
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,960
How about the next one?

562
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,790
Chashumen!

563
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,060
Nice shot there

564
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,430
Hamburg steak!

565
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,230
Oh shit!

566
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,130
There it goes

567
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,030
Move some more, come on

568
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,470
Do we have to shout something ?

569
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,470
- Yes

570
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:39,740
Fake rule:

571
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:39,740
Shout a food's name when swinging

572
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,370
I usually go with that

573
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,970
It depends on your timing

574
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,140
You even said "chashumen", right?

575
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,740
That's right, it's usually that

576
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,080
It's like a rhyming game... usually it's food, yeah

577
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,680
It's like a rhyming game... usually it's food, yeah

578
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,450
It's like a rhyming game... usually it's food, yeah

579
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,720
Omurice!

580
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,320
Nice one

581
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,050
Chashumen (type of Ramen)

582
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,050
Hamburg Steak

583
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,050
Omurice (Rice Omelet)

584
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:52,760

Omurice (Rice Omelet)

590
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,620
What is Nishimura going to shout after Chashumen, Hamburg and Omurice?

591
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,760
- I'm so curious

592
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,430
(fermented chili bean paste)

593
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,430
Doubanjiang!

594
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,570
Nice, nice, it's going well

595
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,110
An unexpected condiment

596
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,110
Fah!

597
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,480
1 penalty

598
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Those are the rules, you know

599
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:26,690
Fake rule:

600
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:26,690
If the player with the current highest score shouts "fah"

601
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:26,690
Last one to shout it gets 1 penalty

602
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:26,690
everyone must follow him and shout "fah" as well

603
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,910
Ok? Alright, let's go then

604
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,920
Fah!

605
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,250
Shoot, it was me...

606
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,190
You're a bit cold, today

607
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,020
It's 'cause I'm very focused on the game

608
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,030
Bring a fountain pen with you

609
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,030
Drink 2 entire liters of water
before the game ends

610

If the leader shouts "fah"
you have to follow him

614
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,030
If you put a ball in a hole,
use a spoon to retrieve it

615
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,030
Lost balls must be reported

616
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,030
Shout a food's name during the swing

617
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,030
The first ball you ever cup in
is going to be attached to a backscratcher

618
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,030
You must carry 18 golf balls in your pockets

What's the next England System's rule?

633
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,970
Spicy eggplant!

Fake rule:

635
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,770
You can use your hands to throw the ball

636
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,730

637
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,540
I knew it

'Cause he plays baseball

639
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,770
His hand technique is pretty good

640
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,270
- He's good at English System

641
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,270
He's got a good hand

00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,470

653

This is not golf or anything in particular anymore

654
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:05,730
Nishimura doesn't doubt anything as they play an unknown game

655
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,300
- You got it!

656
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,660

657
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,400

Can I just...?

Oh boy, this ain't gonna be easy

685
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,540
- What now? What's that?

686
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,410
What's that?

687
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:19,840

It's a cue stick, a cue

What? Do you use that in the England System?

692
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,150
Only when it's on the putting green

693
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,460
You can choose not to use it

694
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,460
Oohh...

695
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,190
So is it a substitute for the putter?

696
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,190
- Yeah, sort of

697
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,430
Nishimura easily believed every single rule

698
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,430

707
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,380
And now he's doing his best at billiard

708
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,380
- He's so genuine

709
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,360

711
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,830

712
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:07,860
Final hole: completed

723
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,370

"Commemoration for
Nishimura Mizuki's
first golf hole"

726
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,480
- You know...

727
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,080
When I was a kid I used to think "why is this thing here?"

728
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,680
When I was a kid I used to think "why is this thing here?"

729

All the dads used to bring this home back then

731
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,250
- Makes sense

732
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,020
That's why there's a golf ball attached to it

733
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,020
That's why there's a golf ball attached to it

In the end, he believed them all

738
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,790
- He's so pure...
- The hell is wrong with him?!

739
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,790
He's so pure it hurts

740

SPECIAL THANKS TO KEDOMAS
FOR THE QUALITY CHECK!!

741
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,390
So, what do you think of it?

742
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,200
He believed in all of them

743
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,060
Really...

744
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,400
He never showed signs of doubt

745
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,430
That's impressive

746
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,300
Correct me if I'm wrong but

747
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,840
I assume you never told him it was a prank, right?

748
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,840
- Yes, that's right

749
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,740
What?!

750
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,580
Also Nishimura had a lot of fun playing golf, he said it himself

751
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,740
So there's a chance

752
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,780
He's going to play like this again with someone else

753
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,780
- No way!

754
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,280
You have to tell him!
