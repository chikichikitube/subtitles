1
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,340
This year was tough too, huh?

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,840
TN: They're talking about the No Laughing Special

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,860
Yes, it was

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,160
It was, yes

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,380
It was exactly 1 week ago right?

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,400
Exactly 1 week ago

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,140
That ruins my health usually

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,140
At least it's over

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,620
At least it's over

10
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,320
I'm the youngest one, right?

11
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,180
Yes on Gaki no Tsukai

12
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,020
I'm 43 years old

13
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,720
I'm the youngest at 43,

14
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,540
But the next day, the pain on my ass, the body fatigue I have

15
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,840
I'm always thinking actually,
Tanaka's ass hurts the most

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,680
I have a strong impression of Tanaka's ass hurting

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,340
Our asses hurt too

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,420
They hurt

19
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,340
They hurt but I bet Tanaka's really hurts

20
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,960
It's probably the Thai kick

21
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,180
Exactly thats it. I get the Thai kick every year

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,760
That has stayed with me the whole time-

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,800
You need to tell the staff to cut it out

24
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,060
te-tell them ..

25
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,060
Tell them?

26
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,420
You don't tell them that's why you get kicked

27
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,420
I can tell them?

28
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,660
I told them, that's why I don't get kicked

29
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,660
You didn't tell them anything!

30
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,560
Tell them to stop it

31
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,320
I can't just tell them to stop

32
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,520
I wrote them a statement, to cut it out

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,520
You can't do that!

34
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,940
You wrote them a letter?
"Please stop the Thai kicks for me"

35
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,880
"Enough Thai kicks. Please stop"

36
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,480
Then I'll write one too!

37
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,600
He didn't write anything, just conveyed his feelings

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,280
"Stop the Thai kicks"

39
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,960
BUT THIS TIME I got kicked cause of this asshole!

40
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,580
Yeah I couldn't believe that

41
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,760
He really said, my name?

42
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,760
And without honorifics!

43
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,500
oh yeah

44
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
You really did that to your Senpai

45
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,920
That was cause I was still thinking about a previous segment

46
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,840
There was a segment like that before that happened

47
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,820
First time in a while I got kicked

48
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,000
I think there's something here I need to apologise for

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,500
This "Thai Kick" batsu game,

50
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,600
Ignoring actual Thai boxers,

51
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,540
I invented this Thai Kick for variety shows

52
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,940
Matsumoto-san introduced it

53
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,160
I should have spoken up more back then,

54
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,360
"This could be dangerous"

55
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,500
"Cut it out"

56
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,840
I should have said so

57
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,520
But it got laughs,

58
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,120
But now it's like a staple batsu game

59
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,800
Like an obvious thing to do

60
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,000
It's like an an axle

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,920
But a Thai kick is something you do to apples

62
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,840
That's something you use to defeat an opponent

63
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,220
Exactly

64
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,280
It's something a pro does to another pro

65
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,120
It's not something a pro does to us

66
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,180
Exactly

67
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,920
So this is all your fault

68
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,580
This is something I want everyone to understand

69
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,560
Also, we don't need that youthful vigor

70
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,500
Like, on that tag game

71
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
The slipper guy

72
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,220
Those young guys have too much strength

73
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,460
I know what you mean

74
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,460
Yeah

75
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,240
I wish they used like 40 year olds

76
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,140
40 year old middle aged men will catch us?

77
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,800
We don't need that youthful vigor

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,480
Speaking of, "that" guest came on that segment

79
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,280
"That" person

80
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,020
That miraculous guest

81
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,480
That guy was amazing, he really didn't wanna get caught

82
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,980
He was seriously running away

83
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,720
There's no need for him to run away so desperately

84
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,840
In the end the Oni couldn't keep up

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,800
Couldn't catch that guy

86
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,500
We had to catch him ourselves

87
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
That person is like that

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,060
Is that a good way to be?

89
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,060
That guy is ... that guy is

90
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,120
I'll say it - he is painful

91
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,460
Painful

92
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,900
He isn't aware of that painfulness

93
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,900
We can't really say that to him

94
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,680
We have to deal with it

95
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
There's no helping it then

96
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,840
It was amazing though

97
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,980
It was amazing, really amazing

98
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,980
It's been 9 years right?

99
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:35,080
No Laughing Batsu -  Airs December 31st, from 18:30 to 24:30

100
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,120
Yes, it's been a new year special for 9 years

101
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,980
Yes 9 years

102
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
We're doing too much ...

103
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,840
NTV is messed up in the head after all

104
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,100
Speaking of that,

105
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,020
The No Laughing and Yamasaki vs. Moriman,
we had two ongoing series

106
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,960
That was a lot back then

107
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,340
It was a lot

108
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,080
Yamasaki's screen time was really something

109
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,660
Honestly I thought the same thing back then

110
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,960
We don't need that youthful vigor

111
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,960
If you ask me why,

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,700
"don't need that youtful vigor"

113
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,840
They do simulations, right? (for the punishments)

114
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,060
Exactly

115
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,840
To make sure there are no injuries

116
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,320
Yeah to prevent injuries

117
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,480
Exactly, exactly

118
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,500
But all the people doing the simulation are young guys

119
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,800
Right?

120
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,440
They're 20 - 23 years old,

121
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,960
but the one actually recieving the punishment is a 40+ old man

122
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,560
But these young guys can deal with it,

123
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,200
I get what you mean,

124
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,060
But there aren't many old comedians that can do the simulations.
Basically only Lytton Commision

125
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,820
They're even older than us

126
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,500
What's wrong with that?

127
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,600
Older than you?

128
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,600
Lytton are older than us

129
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,140
Should we make them do it?

130
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,280
Lytton-san should do the simulations

131
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,900
They can wear "Matsumoto" and "Hamada" T-shirts

132
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,260
You think that will work?

133
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,940
I think that will work

134
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,300
Will that work for us juniors?

135
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,460
The simulation won't work

136
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,660
Ah is that so

137
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,260
Yes certainly

138
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,380
Oh yeah

139
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,160
Today, you might have noticed

140
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,320
An American

141
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,860
Something's different

142
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,820
Yeah

143
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,800
What is this?

144
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,200
They're covering us for an American TV show

145
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Is this real?

146
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,100
It's not like that "African Channel TV" right?

147
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,220
Exactly exactly

148
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,220
No, no, no, it's real

149
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,340
They're not gonna write "Act stupid!" on a cue card right?

150
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,880
subbed by /u/senor_wristband

151
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,860
What brings them here?

152
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:28,540
There's an American TV show,
"The Greatest Shows On Earth"

153
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,540
TN: This show was renamed to "Planet Primetime"

154
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,700
From all the famous Japanese variety shows,

155
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,680
Gaki no Tsukai was chosen to be covered by them

156
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,760
That's crazy

157
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,860
Seriously?

158
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:43,320
Covering us today, "The Greatest Shows on Earth", a show that will air next year in America

159
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,320
TN: I think Gaki appears on the first episode of Planet Primetime.

160
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,460
A show that features TV from around the globe,
examining the different cultures and audiences

161
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,120
And the first episode, representing Japan,

162
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,120
is Gaki no Tsukai

163
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,820
Amazing

164
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,580
Isn't that amazing?

165
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,720
We did it!

166
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,760
"We did it!" ?

167
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,560
That's amazing isn't it?

168
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
I think Shoten would be better though

169
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
TN: Shoten is an ogiri show, airing since 1966

170
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,180
Shoten would also be a good choice, of course

171
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,540
Of course, of course

172
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,480
They've been airing longer too

173
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,240
Why this show, I want to ask

174
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,300
Yes, let's ask

175
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,860
Let's ask them to come in

176
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,160
Allow me to introduce them,

177
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,540
This is the host of "The Greatest Shows on Earth",

178
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,540
Karla Cavali-san

179
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,140
Welcome, Karla-san

180
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,280
Nice to meet you

181
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,480
Is this real? This all feels like a prank so far

182
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,720
This is serious

183
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,060
Really?

184
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,060
Have you seen this show before?

185
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,760
TN: She is speaking English

186
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,400
What did you see from this show?

187
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,700
What did you think was funny?

188
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,720
The Omonmari

189
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,280
Is your brother a pervert?

190
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,800
I guess you don't need to understand the dialogue for that
You can watch it and understand from the movements

191
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,080
I see

192
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,680
Have you seen anything else?

193
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,880
The tataite kabutte

194
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,620
That thing

195
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,160
That's a really old one though

196
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,180
That's world famous right?

197
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,840
We haven't recieved any money from that though

198
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,180
It's world famous?

199
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,520
Yeah yeah

200
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,240
It's been adapted by different countries

201
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,100
Silent Library? That's amazing

202
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,520
Really? That's wild

203
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,660
So after seeing that,

204
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,280
Karla-san wanted to cover this show

205
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,120
No, no,

206
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,260
We wanna ask why this kind of comedy isn't popular

207
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,840
Are any one of us popular in America?

208
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,160
The show as a whole is popular

209
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,620
C'mon do it

210
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,620
Housei-san's gag?

211
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,560
She wants to see your gag from the New Year specials

212
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,540
The thing from the new year specials?

213
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,540
You can do it right away right?

214
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,040
Right before breakfast

215
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,280
This is a huge chance!

216
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,220
I can spread my wings!

217
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,480
She's requesting after all

218
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,640
You can do it casually

219
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,640
You don't know what gag would be good huh?

220
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,460
Oh the New Year's Party

221
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,340
The thing from the New Year's Party

222
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,340
Oh that thing? That hilarious one?

223
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,340
Who said it's funny?

224
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,600
That's not really your gag though
It doesn't matter though

225
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,920
You guys, stand up

226
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
First you guys stand up

227
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,000
Stand up
Say "Hai Hai Hai Hai"

228
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,740
Set up the comedy for me

229
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,220
Face this way?

230
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,200
Should we spread apart?

231
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Just do it like normal

232
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,400
This is a huge chance

233
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,300
A huge chance. You might get tons of laughs.

234
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,320
You're gonna get huge laughs

235
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,480
I got it, you're gonna get huge laughs

236
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,280
I'm telling you, you're gonna get huge laughs

237
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,680
I'm really glad about this

238
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,400
I'm gonna do it!!!

239
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,900
Hurry up man she's waiting for you

240
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,900
Ready?

241
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,580
She really likes this

242
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,720
She's laughing so hard

243
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,640
Turn your face towards America's cameras!

244
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,240
He's adding variations to it

245
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,780
This is not very Japanese

246
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,280
Enough already

247
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,780
Enough already

248
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,060
What did you think of that?

249
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,020
That's great

250
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,840
I will say though,

251
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,280
LITERALLY anyone can do that

252
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,220
I see

253
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,420
That was good though

254
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,340
That was good

255
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,180
Karla-san, is there anything else you'd like to see?

256
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,860
There's no way man

257
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,000
Wants to take part?

258
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,140
What are we gonna do?

259
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,980
Cause I've been the champion before

260
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,520
Oh yeah

261
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,780
Champion, champion

262
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,060
Certainly

263
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,760
Ah I see

264
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,520
Cause I'm the champion

265
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,720
I mean you are the champion

266
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,780
I'm going to play seriously

267
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,700
Wouldn't it be better to have the mat here

268
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,320
You have to teach her how to play

269
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,120
Do you know what to do?

270
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,660
Janken?

271
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,040
Oh yeah she might not know janken

272
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,240
She has a basic grasp on this

273
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
You gotta teach her rock paper scissors

274
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,860
Do you understand?

275
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,180
You're supposed to be teaching her!

276
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,900
You gotta teach her

277
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,780
Do you understand?

278
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,780
There's also the timing

279
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,560
Tataite - Kabutte - Jan-ken-pon

280
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,680
Remember the song

281
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,240
And this .. like this

282
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,540
Try and sing it

283
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,180
Do it slowly first

284
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,260
Are you taking the piss?

285
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,940
Only Endo needs to sing it

286
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,840
But what the hell is "Habachaba?"

287
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,120
Let's start this

288
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,840
If I win I'm gonna need to hit you

289
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,420
I might hit hard

290
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,080
Avoid the face

291
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
Just the head

292
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,080
This is kinda scary, I'm nervous

293
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,860
Yeah, this is like

294
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,940
At times like this Endo really hurts people like @!@#$

295
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,920
He really said that name, @!@#$

296
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,120
An American Show Came to Gaki No Tsukai!

297
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,160
Tataite Kabutte Jankenpon - 1 Round Battle!

298
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,480
Here I go,

299
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,340
We're beginning

300
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,400
Let's begin

301
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,880
Ready, steady,

302
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,820
Of course, of course

303
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,640
Hold on a second

304
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,100
I lost!

305
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,220
I lost!

306
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,720
This is like some Kyoto teahouse

307
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,560
You're having so much fun

308
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,540
Having a ball of a time

309
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,540
This not the end,

310
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,700
There's more Karla-san still wants to see

311
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
We didn't need a translation for that

312
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,480
Chinko Machine

313
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,140
Yeah I understood the "Machine"

314
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,660
A producer?

315
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,540
Which producer?

316
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,260
Oh her producer?

317
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,300
Yeah I thought it was gonna be Suga-chan

318
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,860
Will be it able to hit Robin properly?

319
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,900
Yeah

320
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,760
It's not desgined for his size

321
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,360
Eh? Isn't this impossible?

322
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,800
Robin is freaking huge

323
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,660
It seems fine

324
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,000
Does Robin know this Chinko Machine existed?

325
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,020
He knows!

326
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,920
This is amazing

327
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,600
Is this gonna be OK/

328
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,240
It's gonna be 3-2-1-Go

329
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,160
It's really scary huh?

330
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,700
Robin you can do it

331
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,600
Get ready Robin, here we go

332
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,100
That really hurt him

333
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,980
It hurt Robin

334
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,240
He went "Ow"

335
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,400
That's the end

336
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,280
I see

337
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,440
From America's "The Greatest Shows on Earth",

338
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,420
Karla-san!

339
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,520
Thank you!

340
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,640
Thank you!

341
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,200
Thank you very much

342
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,820
So that was real after all

343
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,860
This will be broadcasted by them

344
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,700
We should have copyrighted the Chinko Machine

345
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,620
They might copy it

346
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,040
They'll copy it

347
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,780
Right?

348
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,340
We would be able to get royalties for it, if we trademark it

349
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,580
Chinko Machine?

350
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,940
What the hell is a Chinko Machine anyways?

351
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,360
It'll be as popular as Karaoke abroad

352
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,500
Chinko Machine, Karakoe,

353
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,900
Chinko Machine

354
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,020
At amusement parks and such

355
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,740
They can have them there

356
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,880
This year's batsu game, what do you think after reflecting on it?

357
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,640
For me it's, after all,

358
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:57,680
Before the No-Laughing started, I injured my abs once again

359
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,860
A week before it started, I was told to be very careful

360
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,480
Sorry could you explain that again?

361
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,240
Why did your abs hurt?

362
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,960
Nobody understands why you kept saying that

363
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,720
Why did they hurt?

364
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,000
Right, right, right,

365
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,500
I'll tell you why, but before that,
If this happened to you, you'd definitely skip work

366
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,460
That's how much I endured, acting like it was nothing

367
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,560
No, no, no, no

368
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,200
Tell us what happened first

369
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,880
It was an iron pole I said

370
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,140
This is the first time hearing that

371
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,140
For the people watching TV

372
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,660
No I've said this at other places, it was an iron pole

373
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,640
What happened with the iron pole?

374
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,720
I was doing flips at a park

375
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,000
Alone at the park ... doing flips?

376
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,860
You were doing flips and hit a pole?

377
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,060
When you're doing flips, you have to keep the bar close to you right?

378
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,240
I understood that

379
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,860
So I did one flip like that

380
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,800
But when I did another flip,

381
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,180
I was too far from the bar

382
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:06,060
So then when I reached the top of the bar, I fell down and hit my abs on it

383
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,640
And that stopped me

384
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,680
And that's what happened

385
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,900
So you got bruised?

386
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,120
A bruise ... well well

387
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,640
It was a straight up fracture

388
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,740
No way

389
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,620
There's no way you got a fracture

390
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,920
You've never done that before

391
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,180
You didn't go to the doctor?

392
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,800
I didn't go to the doctor

393
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,820
Then how the hell do you know it's a fracture?

394
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,300
I've done so many flips before,

395
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,620
I am my own specialist doctor

396
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,620
I could just tell

397
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,240
No way

398
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,240
You've never broken your ribs before

399
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
I didn't make a sound or anything

400
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,500
This guy can't even sneeze quietly

401
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,840
You went to the doctor then?

402
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,560
It was just a bad bruise, right?

403
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,140
It's totally broken

404
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,140
It split apart like *PAN*

405
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,880
It broke?

406
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,000
He didn't go to the doctor!

407
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,760
It really broke

408
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,020
He never got an assessment done

409
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,760
If it was broken it would stab your organs

410
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,340
If there was even a tiny little fracture-

411
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,420
He didn't have a fracture

412
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,700
It really split apart,

413
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,880
And the meat got stuck in between them

414
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,940
It got stuck, that hurt as well

415
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,520
It pierced your organs?

416
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,240
Between your bones?

417
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,140
What the hell are you saying?

418
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,540
You wouldn't know you got organs stuck
between your bones unless you went to the doctor

419
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,480
Exactly

420
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,440
I saw in the mirror I had a divot

421
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,440
You could see that?

422
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,020
That's a serious injury then

423
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,600
Yeah that's crazy you could see it from the outside

424
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,600
It was really terrible

425
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,600
And I debated taking time off,

426
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,020
But I decided not to

427
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,920
It was really terrible, but I pushed through

428
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
My sense of service

429
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,060
It was a collection of willpower

430
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,760
And you didn't say "Ahh that hurts" even once

431
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,320
That's my sense of service

432
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,820
Yama-chan when your shoulder was hurting,

433
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,140
It did hurt still

434
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,980
You didn't go "Ahh" ocassionally?

435
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,440
No, no, that's my sense of service

436
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,880
So it didn't hurt?

437
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,880
No, no, it was my sense of service

438
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Sense of service?

439
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,920
Yup

440
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,500
My sense of service

441
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,700
To who? To what?

442
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,300
Please tell us

443
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,360
A sense of service?

444
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,360
I'm speaking to people who don't understand that right now

445
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,320
No we understand what it is

446
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,920
You had a sense of service to that job?

447
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,200
Well it hurt right?

448
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,460
But if I said anything you guys might worry
And that will dampen the comedy

449
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,540
I didn't want any sympathy so I endured it

450
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,200
So when Yama-chan was going "It hurts it hurts"
What did you think?

451
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,580
"This guy is seriously so useless"

452
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,000
He kept telling us it hurts

453
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,880
"40 year old shoulder" he says

454
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,260
It's supposed to be "50 year old shoulder"

455
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,280
Why the hell did you decrease it by 10 years?

456
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,100
In what world does a 47-48 year old have "40 year old shoulder"

457
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,580
That's 50 year old shoulder

458
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm still in my 40s

459
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,020
That's why I said 40 year old shoulder, I'm still not 50

460
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,160
You're 47 years old though

461
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,260
I'm still in my 40s!

462
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,520
You are 47, Housei-san

463
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,040
And my hemorrhoids were killing me too

464
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,460
So it was a double whammy

465
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,720
You said your hips hurt too

466
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,180
Oh yeah, that's a triple then

467
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,280
It was a huge pain in the ass

468
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:19,800
No Laughing is definitely the most physically taxing job we have all year

469
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,560
That's for sure

470
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,840
So you know we try to stay careful,

471
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:30,100
But staying careful we still get caught up in those kinds of events

472
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,480
What the fuck Endo? I'll kick your ass

473
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,240
M-

474
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,700
Me?

475
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,780
Why, me?

476
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,140
He's the one said the least to you

477
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,740
Said the least to you, just nodding in agreement

478
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,800
The one who sympathised

479
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,860
Yeah

480
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,460
You've been pissing me off since the day you debuted
