00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,980
This is 'Suiyōbi no Downtown'.
Welcome, everyone

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,120
Hamada Masatoshi
(Downtown)

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,950
Bakarhythm

4
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,950
Matsumoto Hitoshi
(Downtown)

5
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,950
Nonomura Yukiko

6
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,950
Yahagi Ken
(Ogi Yahagi)

7
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,990
Hello

8
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,990
I can do it for you

9
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,490
So, here's our first presenter. Come in!

10
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,660
Are they there?

11
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello

12
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes, it's Mitorizu!

13
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,930
Lily

14
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,930
Moriyama Shintarō

15
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,930
Presenters



(Mitorizu)

16
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
(Lily) Hello

17
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
(Moriyama) Hello, we're Mitorizu

18
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,930
Back from defeat at M-1?

19
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,840
Hold on a minute,
we don't know yet

20
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,540
There's a second-chance system

21
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,540
We're aiming for victory through that

22
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,580
By the time this airs, we might already be champions

23
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,680
So then, everyone...

24
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,350
You're all already
super-successful legends here

25
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,680
So you don't go out
on location anymore, right?

26
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,690
(Lily) You used to
but not anymore

27
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,690
You're hardly ever...

28
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,690
No, no, no.
That's not true at all

29
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,690
Everyone...

30
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,760
What's the most important thing when on location?

31
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,360
Well, of course, you have
to speak louder, don't you?

32
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,370
Also, people will talk to you

33
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,370
Make your voice a bit louder

34
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,440
Members of the public

35
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,440
Right, you have to handle them

36
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,970
And when you're eating,
you need to have a big reaction

37
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,640
Wrong, everyone!

38
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,850
The most important thing on location is...

39
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,450
The camera

40
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,480
It's the camera

41
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,480
The camera...

42
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,480
No, well, that's...

43
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,920
That's true for TV in general, no?

44
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,820
That's too obvious. The camera...

45
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,160
There's no doubt about it.
So, today...

46
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,160
We've brought you a theory related to cameras on location. Here it is!

47
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,740
Theory: Even on a crazy on-location shoot where there are no cameras anywhere to be seen, it is possible to proceed without the guest pointing it out

48
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,240
Huh?

49
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,240
No camera?

50
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,240
So...

51
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,180
What are we going to be looking at?

52
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,010
We were recording from far away

53
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,020
You wouldn't just
interview them later

54
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,320
I was surprised

55
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,420
I thought we'd just be listening to audio

56

57
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,200
So, today...

58
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:12,910
Amusement park

59
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:12,910
Food report

60
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:12,910
Transit bus

61
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,640
we'll be taking over these locations

62
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,980
for camera free on-location shoots

63
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,320
First, our plants facilitating
the shoot at the amusement park are...

64
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,990
(Both) Hello

65
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,990
(Staff) Hello

66
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,990
These two

67
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,950
Jinnai Tomonori

68
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,950
Main Guest

69
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,950
Sakashita Chiriko

70
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:33,970
* TL Note (pause to read): Jinnai's first name, Tomonori, kind of sounds
like 'Wants to be friends' shortened ('TOMOdachi ni NARItai' → 'Tomonari')

71
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:33,970
There's someone who wants to be friends!

72
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:33,970
Tomonari!*

73
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,320
In this fake show

74
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:34,000
a celebrity who says they want to make friends will appear halfway through a shoot

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,500
That means
even if it's a weird shoot with no camera

76
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,510
if Jinnai and Sakashita have
started filming as normal

77
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,340
the target joining them halfway through won't point it out

78
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,650
Or so we hope

79
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,780
Staff) So we're doing a shoot with no camera...

80
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,420
Yeah

81
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,190
So there's no cameraman

82
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,190
So it's 'will they notice?', right?

83
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,460
Staff) Like, will they just let it happen...

84
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,190
No, they won't

85
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,160
They'll say

86
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,860
"What's going on?" is what I'd say, immediately

87
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,000
Like "There's no cameraman! What's going on?"

88
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,000
Even I'd say something

89
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,970
Right?

90
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,300
At this point...

91
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,240
Cameraman

92
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,240
Cameraman

93
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,310
We change to a camera-free formation

94
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,950
Wait a moment

95
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,280
Is this the camera...?

96
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,820
(Jinnai) You mean
this person is following?

97
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,650
Yes, on a normal shoot...

98
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,320
the crew make this formation,
with the camera at the front

99
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:33,830
Camera

100
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:33,830
Camera

101
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:40,830
Audio

102
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:40,830
Director

103
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:40,830
Mic

104
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,990
but this time...

105
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:40,670
in the cameraman's position, there's an empty-handed mystery man

106
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:40,830
Mystery
man

107
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,770
So they can just talk at the mystery man?

108
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,170
So, from this point...

109
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:51,780
Audio mixer

110
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:51,780
Bag

111
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:51,780
Chest pocket

112
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:51,780
Gun mic

113
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:51,780
Gun mic

114
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:51,780
Makeup bag

115
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,240
Using hidden cameras in places like
the audio equipment

116
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,680
we will capture everything

117
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Hold on...

118
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,450
What if someone says 'look at that'?

119
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,410
No no no no

120
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,890
No, this is too much

121
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,850
Wait, just wait

122
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,890
I won't be able to not laugh

123
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,660
That movement's annoying, right?

124
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,160
The camera's like this, right?

125
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,630
Yeah

126
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,460
Wait a minute...

127
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,060
They're going to say something

128
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:18,500
And so, the crazy shoot in which this guy acts as though he's a camera begins

129
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,310
Staff) Jinnai-san, in 5 seconds

130
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,040
We've begun!
There's someone who wants to be friends

131
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,150
Hold on, I'm going to laugh

132
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,050
Hey, this is no good

133
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,050
We're making eye contact

134
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,620
Hold on, it's no good, I'll laugh

135
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,220
(Sakashita) Hey, Jinnai-san→

136
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,590
I'm making eye contact, with this old man

137
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,220
So...

138
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,890
I can't. Where should I look?

139
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,660
Wait a minute

140
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,760
Please don't look at my face

141
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,930
Don't look into my eyes

142
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So, with the opening scene complete...

143
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
the old man with a built-in camera
moves from behind them

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,600
to a position in front of them

145
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,510
Staff) When we go inside

146
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,850
Staff) The guest will be there, so let's switch over

147
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,850
OK

148
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,250
And so...

149
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,790
Person number one will come in now

150
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,750
It's this person. Come in!

151
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,430
Wanting to make friends today, it's Tokyo Hoteison

152
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,460
Nice to meet you

153
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,460
Welcome

154
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,800
Our first target, who wouldn't have much experience with on location shoots

155
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:21,370
Shōgo

156
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:21,370
Takeru

157
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:21,370
Tokyo Hoteison

158
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,470
is Tokyo Hoteison

159
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,570
Nice to meet you

160
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,570
We're Tokyo Hoteison. Nice to meet you

161
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,400
Yeah, from Mayweather's hand!

162
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,240
Mayweather held this in an interview

163
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,980
(Takeru) Sorry

164
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,980
Get it right

165
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,980
Thank you for letting me do it

166
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,280
By the way, for this...

167
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:42,220
Shōgo already knows what's going on

168
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,220
Only Takeru is the target

169
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,020
So, what do you think Chiri-chan is like, Takeru?

170
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,060
Well, really...

171
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,560
I've never had a celebrity tell me they want to be friends so

172
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,660
Ah, that's good

173
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,200
I'm really really happy

174
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:59,170
It seems like he still hasn't noticed
that there isn't a camera in the film crew

175
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,940
Next, a walk around the park

176
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,780
(Sakashita) Wow

177
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,780
(Shōgo) Wow, it's really pretty. Look

178
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,680
This Ferris wheel

179
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,780
(Shōgo) It's really pretty

180
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,780
Which?

181
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
(Jinnai) This Ferris Wheel?
(Shōgo) It's really pretty. Look

182
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,620
(Takeru) Which?
(Shōgo) It's really pretty

183
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,020
Anticipating the movements of
the camera-free cameraman

184
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,260
the crew continues acting as though
they need to avoid blocking its view

185
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh, a merry-go-round?

186
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,600
I want to go on the merry-go-round first

187
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,230
I'll get nervous if I'm suddenly in a locked room

188
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,970
Definitely

189
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,970
Right

190
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,300
OK, let's have some enthusiasm

191
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,170
Some enthusiasm please, Takeru

192
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,910
How will we become friends using the merry-go-round?

193
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,540
Definitely

194
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,980
It'll make us as close as best friends

195
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,980
(Jinnai) Ah, I see. Good luck

196
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:50,890
For a moment, he seems to be
looking for a camera but...

197
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,990
Definitely

198
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,360
He gives a quick one-liner in no particular direction

199
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,330
This is going really well

200
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,330
It is...

201
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,240
Huh?

202
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,240
How come?

203
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,240
Huh? No way

204
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,410
Why is it going so well? Who and what was he talking to?

205
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,280
Where was he looking at for that comment?

206
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,280
He was lost for a moment

207
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,480
(Shōugo) Yeah
(Jinnai) For a moment

208
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,950
Who's he showing enthusiasm to?

209
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,950
Then...

210
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,850
Very good. Hey, could you give us a wave?

211
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,590
(Jinnai) Could you give us a wave?

212
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,330
Who's he waving at?

213
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,330
Who's he waving at? What's he waving at?

214
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,870
He's glancing around

215
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,500
He's searching for it

216
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,500
He's definitely searching

217
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,600
But he doesn't know it's that person

218
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,100
That that's the cameraman

219
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,840
Next, we try something even more audacious

220
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,620
Because he's focusing on the game

221
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,720
the scary, head-swiveling
old man goes unnoticed

222
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,760
However...

223
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,830
(Jinnai) Isn't it 2-1?
Ah, Chiri-chan, tough luck→

224
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,600
Takeru, Takeru, bad luck Takeru

225
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,300
(Takeru) This is hard

226
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,610
(Jinnai) It's over! So, the result is...

227
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,010
With a score of 3-1, Chiri-chan wins!

228
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,740
Wow!

229
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,620
At this point Takeru finally notices how strange this situation is

230
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,620
(Jinnai) No but Chiri-san,
you're young

231
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,620
And your appearance

232
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,620
(Sakashita) Hey, Takeru-san's...

233
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,190
Takeru, is something wrong?

234
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,190
No, not at all, not at all

235
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,430
You seem a little troubled...

236
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,130
(Sakashita) Something was wrong

237
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,430
No, no, no. Actually it's...

238
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,600
I'm too happy

239
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,500
However, because the other members are proceeding as normal

240
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,510
He doesn't point it out, despite being suspicous

241
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,970
(Jinnai) Where to next?
(Sakashita) This way

242
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:56,310
So, for the last spot, we do something even more bold

243
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,550
I'm a bit nervous. How about you two do it?

244
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,390
I want to go on a roller coaster!

245
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,390
Well, have a look at this

246
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,460
Navel Coaster

247
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,260
Looks like a roller coaster

248
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,930
Having one camera is strange too

249
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,270
For sure, at a shoot like this

250
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,270
That's right

251
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,570
And so...

252
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,840
The empty-handed old man with a built-in camera boards in front of them

253
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,280
So he'll turn around to film them, right?

254
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,280
Then...

255
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,970
Woah! Scary, scary, scary

256
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,300
Seriously, who is this person?

257
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,040
Finally, as you'd expect in this situation...

258
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,510
He finally points it out

259
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,640
(Sakashita) Here we go! →

260
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,650
Eeek!

261
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,150
Woah, hold on a second. This is too much for me

262
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,420
Woah, wait a minute! Agh! Wait!

263
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,290
Hold on a second...

264
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,790
And, who the hell are you? Seriously!

265
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,960
Whoooo?

266
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,660
At this point...

267
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:20,230
We reveal the prank

268
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,340
Staff) Was there anything strange about today's shoot?

269
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,970
Well that person was looking at me so much

270
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,610
Like during basketball and on the roller coaster

271
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,940
I was like 'Ew!'

272
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,550
Staff) Who do you think he was?

273
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,320
Huh?

274
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,290
He was among the staff so I thought he must be someone important's son

275
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,020
Like he came here to see the shoot...

276
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,830
Was there a camera?

277
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,130
Ah, there wasn't

278
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,400
Then, after we've explained today's plan...

279
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,500
You missed it

280
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,980
No... Well, I'm sorry. I wouldn't say 'missed it'

281
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,880
But the weird guy bothered me more than the lack of a camera

282
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,890
When the crew's so big, you don't wonder who's filming

283
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:14,890
Right

284
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,420
There are already GoPros, right?

285
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,930
I thought maybe they can make a contact camera now

286
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,000
So. for our next target we try a...

287
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,700
Camera-free food report

288
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,230
Here's who'll be appearing for us today. Welcome!

289
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,840
(Both) Hello

290
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,840
Hello, welcome, in the middle please

291
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,180
With almost no experience with
variety show shoots...

292
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:41,610
Okuhara Hinako

293
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:41,610
Tokunaga Remi

294
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,010
it's these two AK48 members

295
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,010
Nice to meet you!

296
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,680
They don't notice at all in the opening

297
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,020
Sure enough...

298
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,920
I'm a 9th grader, aged 15, Tokunaga Remi

299
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,090
And so...

300
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,090
From here...

301
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,960
We add another human with a built in camera

302
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,660
A-cam

303
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,660
B-cam

304
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,700
The food report starts in a 2-camera formation

305
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,400
But first...

306
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,970
Staff) Is it okay if we calibrate the white balance now?

307
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,870
Excuse me

308
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,640
"Calibrating the white balance"

309
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:14,750
Action of calibrating the color of the image

310
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:14,750
White balance

311
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
means to adjust the color of the image

312
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,710
by doing something like this

313
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,520
Of course, in this shoot too...

314
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,060
But the two beginners to on-location shoots...

315
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,030
Ignore it

316
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:38,170
Then, we go with something bold for the food report

317
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,170
(Both) Itadakimasu!

318
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,110
I think I'll eat this first

319
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,580
Like Spiderman

320
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,650
Together with the lighting,
he closes the distance at once

321
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,960
It's really elastic, and very tasty

322
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,290
Safe

323
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,290
Next...

324
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,000
I think I'll have this now

325
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,800
These grated vegetables are really cute

326
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Really, every single one

327
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,340
B-cam old man leans down over the udon

328
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:24,650
Perhaps because she's built up a tolerance to be stared at by old guys from her work

329
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,550
But, surprisingly,
this is also safe

330
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,690
Safe

331
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,750
It's really stretchy

332
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,890
Staff) OK. Now, we're going to stop for a while

333
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,160
Staff) I'd like to do some inserts of the food first so

334
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,330
Staff) It's okay if you eat for real now

335
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,330
Okay

336
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,630
So, in the corner of the room

337
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,640
The crazy insert filming begins

338
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,810
Staff) Could you pan down please?

339
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,050
Staff) Turn down in 5 seconds...

340
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,790
1 2 3 4 5

341
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,490
6 7 8 9

342
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,890
Staff) Alright, thanks

343
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,730
Staff) Now with the chopsticks held up please

344
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,800
(Staff) 3 2 1

345
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,300
B-cam) Hold it still

346
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,300
Staff) Sorry

347
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,270
B-cam) Now stop

348
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,270
Staff) OK

349
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
(Staff) Is it okay if we do it again?

350
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,210
As the strange men complain while gazing at the udon...

351
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,820
the pair look away instinctively

352
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
Then...

353
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,660
Staff) Jinnai-san, Sakashita-san, I'd like reshoot you walking outside

354
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,990
Staff) You two can stay here and eat while you wait

355
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:45,030
We try leaving the two targets alone for a while...

356
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,630
It's probably okay to sit cross-legged for a while

357
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,670
Ouch

358
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,540
I don't know which one the camera was

359
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,670
Where's the camera?

360
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,670
I don't know

361
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,370
Where were you facing?

362
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,010
Like, the light...

363
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,180
was really...

364
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,410
was really... close

365
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,110
That old guy who got really close...

366
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,110
I didn't know

367
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,950
I don't know.
I said earlier

368
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,950
I didn't know at all

369
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,090
What was that? Was he filming with it?

370
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,890
Huh... I don't know

371
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,460
Anyway, let's eat all of this

372
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,460
It's good

373
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,330
This is really tasty

374
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,330
It is, isn't it?

375
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,730
It's like 'well, whatever' isn't it?

376
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,640
Last, we're investigating
on a transit bus shoot

377
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:32,010
Camera-free transit bus

378
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,640
And to go with it, we've
added some plausible plants

379
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:32,010
Kojima Natsuko

380
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:32,010
Main Guest

381
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:32,010
Mieharu

382
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,280
And...

383
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,650
The target is...

384
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,580
(Mieharu) Hey

385
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,580
Oh, good morning!

386
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,250
Mieharu-san!

387
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,020
Michio

388
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,020
Tom Brown

389
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,990
They get on the bus straightaway but...

390
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,990
at this point...

391
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:55,000
(Mieharu) Kojima-san, why
are we on this bus with Michio-kun?

392
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,300
In contrast to the two targets before him...

393
00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:02,270
He starts trying to confirm the camera's position immediately

394
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,940
However...

395
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,940
The two people he's meeting for the first time continue as normal

396
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,080
So he didn't point it out

397
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,780
The autumn leaves and that bridge...

398
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,790
But...

399
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,090
(Mieharu) The leaves

400
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,090
And the red torii gate

401
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,360
Michio-kun, it's better on this side of the bus

402
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,630
Ah, over there

403
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,560
The view, yes

404
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,530
(Mieharu) Aren't the autumn leaves nice?

405
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:38,010
Now he's noticed the old man
who reacts to their comments

406
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,010
Michio gets agitated

407
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,980
(Mieharu) On the mountain road there are...

408
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,480
And, after 30 minutes since the shoot started...

409
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,420
That bicycle shop's really good. Look, behind us

410
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,990
(Mieharu)
That bike shop's really good, isn't it? →

411
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,660
It's so stylish→

412
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,660
Yes...

413
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,660
I'd have thought by now...

414
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:05,100
For some reason, there seems to be
something physically wrong with Michio

415
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,110
Are you okay?

416
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,110
Oh, I'm fine

417
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,910
I can make this normal

418
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,940
But...

419
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,650
After that, the madness continues...

420
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,620
(Kojima) Michio-san,
are you alright?

421
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,620
(Mieharu) Your jokes and tricks...

422
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,620
At this point...

423
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,150
We reveal the prank

424
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,320
Staff) Good work

425
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,560
Staff) Was there anything weird about today's shoot?

426
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,000
Ah, yeah...

427
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,130
There was no camera at all

428
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,900
It was so scary, my head started to hurt

429
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,440
I was so scared...

430
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,210
These two were calmly talking throughout so I got really scared

431
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,380
I thought they were insane

432
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,650
What is this?

433
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,350
Staff) This is Suiyōbi no Downtown

434
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,350
Wow, what a relief. I was so scared

435
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,020
Thank God!

436
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,590
I thought it was a scary show...

437
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,390
Like I was thinking that old guy had a camera in his eye

438
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,060
And so...

439
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:08,270
Investigation Result

440
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:08,270
They get scared but
they can't point it out

441
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,100
I see, I see

442
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
That was funny

443
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,770
Everyone, how was it?

444
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,770
Not good! Not good

445
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,780
You even damaged Michio's health

446
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,010
Tom Brown
Michio

447
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,850
His headache

448
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,850
Not good

449
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,450
But it was funny, wasn't it?

450
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,450
Compared to the missing camera...

451
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,880
The impact from the old man was greater

452
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,290
For the whole thing, they
didn't know what he was doing

453
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,790
If it were Hamada-san,
he'd be like this for sure

454
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,790
If an old man goes near him like that,
he's like 'who are you?'

455
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,800
You get physical?

456
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,970
It makes the footage shaky

457
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,870
Because that old man isn't being filmed

458
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,340
Because that old man isn't being filmed

459
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,970
(Lily) So why believe him?

460
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,970
Ah, I see, I see

461
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,110
Our next presenter
is this person. Come in!

462
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,920
Hello, hello

463
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,920
It's Viking's Kotouge!

464
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:03,950
Koutouge Eiji

465
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:03,950
Presenter



(Viking)

466
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,990
Hello, everyone

467
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,590
So, I have a question for you.
Do you know "Mother's Song"?

468
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,560
"Mother's Song"

469
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,590
"Mom's been working all night", right?

470
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,930
Yes, "Knitting you gloves". That one

471
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,930
It's often used in police dramas, when they're interviewing someone

472
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,940
True

473
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,940
When they're tugging at the criminal's heartstrings

474
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,940
In old dramas

475
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,940
In the past, though

476
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,780
It's got an old feeling
but stirs something up

477
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,480
I've brought with me a project that uses "Mother's Song". Here it is.

478
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:37,190
Theory: No matter how much you tug at someone's heartstrings, it's difficult to make someone cry by finishing with "Mother's Song"

479
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,360
Ah, I see

480
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,400
Especially with that 'sesseto andadayo' line
("worked hard knitting" in a regional dialect)

481
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,830
I think it'll make them wonder "What's 'andadyo'?"

482
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,970
Like 'what dialect'?

483
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,970
'Andadyo' is...

484
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,800
In the style of Shimura-san

485
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:15,290
Investigation

486
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:15,290
Theory: No matter how much you tug at someone's heartstrings, it's difficult to make someone cry by finishing with "Mother's Song"

487
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:20,500
all night

488
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:20,500
♬～My mom worked

489
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:39,820
My mom worked all night.


Knitting by hand


She knew the cold wind would blow


So she worked hard knitting


The letter from my hometown came through


I could smell the fire

490
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:26,340
♬～Knitting by hand

491
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,870
A song that makes you think of
your mom and your hometown

492
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,540
and a big hit in
the '60s

493
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,510
"Mother's Song"

494
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,880
♬～'andadayo'

495
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,190
Today a senpai comedian

496
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:54,730
Tearjerker story

497
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,860
will lay the groundwork with a tearjerker story

498
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:50,390
and attempt to make their kōhai cry
while singing "Mother's Song"

499
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:54,730
"Mother's Song"

500
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:54,730
Tears

501
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,570
And so...

502
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,100
Our first challenger is...

503
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,540
(Staff) Good morning

504
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,540
Good morning

505
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:04,310
Cookie!

506
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:04,310
Yasei Bakudan

507
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:08,380
And the kōhai who'll be his target is...

508
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,710
Ah, umm, by train

509
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,680
Poko

510
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,680
Target

511
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,050
What are you doing for New Year's Eve?

512
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,650
I'm staying at home

513
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,920
Can't you visit your parents?

514
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,390
I'm going there soon

515
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,560
But since it's so close, you can't go home in between?

516
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,560
I don't think so

517
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,860
I haven't seen my mom and dad at all

518
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,530
You don't take care of your parents, do you?

519
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,840
I don't, no

520
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,840
Right

521
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,270
But couldn't you just make an appearance?

522
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,210
They'll be happy just to see you, really

523
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,950
He naturally changes the
subject to talking about parents

524
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,380
Your dad...
Your dad and your mom...

525
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,380
Ah, yes

526
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,150
Here's the wagyū steak

527
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,590
Eat some steak

528
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,090
Thank you very much

529
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,090
I really love steak

530
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,430
I grew up poor so...

531
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,930
If someone asked what I wanted to eat, I always said steak

532
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,830
Once when I was in middle school, my mom got a part-time job

533
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,970
She started working part-time

534
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,440
They were building in the Shiga countryside

535
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,370
Apartments and condos

536
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,170
So they'd dig a hole and boom

537
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:16,610
My mom was like a worker to check if the ground was solid or not

538
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:21,250
You know? She'd look inside and go into the hole and sweep at the dirt with a brush

539
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,750
You can do it like that?

540
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,020
So it was like...

541
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,160
If they found any pottery, they'd report it

542
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,330
It's to, like, report back the strata had changed

543
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,800
So when I'd cycle home with friends in middle school

544
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,330
Mom would be right there digging holes

545
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,430
I hated it so much

546
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,700
"Kuu-chan! Welcome home" she'd say

547
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,670
I'd be thinking "stop that"

548
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,980
So in the end I told her

549
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,050
"Seriously, can you not do that kind of job? It's embarrassing"

550
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,050
Then my mom looked sad and said

551
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,280
"Alright, got it"

552
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,290
And she really quit

553
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,420
I felt so guilty about it

554
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,830
Then, I don't know if it was because I felt guilty but...

555
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,260
I started delivering papers

556
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,870
You did that?

557
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,030
It's a good story

558
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,730
It's good, this story

559
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,810
When they're healthy you don't think about your parents

560
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,810
Yeah

561
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,080
I don't know if they're getting weaker or not but

562
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,010
For some reason I've been thinking of mine a lot lately

563
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,180
I mean it's not like I'd feel it if the worse were to happen

564
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,290
But I feel like if they're unlucky they might die soon

565
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,020
That's how it feels

566
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,020
That's right

567
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,560
But at the most it's going to happen in the next 20 years

568
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,600
Because they're already 80

569
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,470
Not like the next 10, or 5 years?

570
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,830
You're right, within 10

571
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:52,780
When the time comes, all they've done for me these last 45 years...

572
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,950
It's like, how can I pay that back in the next 5 years?

573
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,950
Oh man

574
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:02,620
That's tough, right? Like what should I do?

575
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,620
You've already paid them back

576
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,520
I haven't! I've done nothing

577
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,720
I don't even visit

578
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,900
Look at me. Mine are in Tokyo and I still don't

579
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,960
(Cookie!) Well...

580
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,270
Now, with the sad mood established...

581
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,440
It's finally time for "Mother's Song"

582
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,340
How about you go meet your mom?

583
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,640
Yeah

584
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,050
Since she's close, you can visit her a lot

585
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,880
Because moms are important, you know?

586
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,450
You're right. My mom...

587
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:48,130
My mom worked all night, knitting by hand

588
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:53,900
She knew the cold wind would blow

589
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:59,040
So she worked hard knitting

590
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:05,080
The letter from my hometown came through

591
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,290
I could smell the fire

592
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,860
He didn't cry

593
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,290
And so...

594
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:27,240
My mom spun the hemp yarn, spun it for a day

595
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,040
He throws in the unfamiliar 2nd verse

596
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,340
♬～Working the straw

597
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,880
Do your best as well

598
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,590
I miss my hometown in winter

599
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,860
At least let me listen to the radio

600
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,330
You're laughing now, come on!

601
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,660
Kuu-chan laughs so easily, doesn't he?

602
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Because the 'let me listen to the radio'
line made him start laughing...

603
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,140
We reveal the prank

604
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,310
At this point...

605
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,980
Wow...

606
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,210
Cry!

607
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,950
No, I won't cry. I definitely won't

608
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:18,420
I mean you're laughing already

609
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,820
Staff) Investigating the strata?

610
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,330
It was a lie

611
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,330
Jeez

612
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,900
Staff) Delivering newspapers?

613
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,460
A lie

614
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,460
Jeez

615
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,640
And so, the next challenger is...

616
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,410
Anthony

617
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,410
Matenrou

618
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:39,680
And the kōhai comedian who'll be his target is...

619
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,350
Thank you very much

620
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:45,450
Jumbo Takao

621
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:45,450
Target
Rainbow

622
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:53,190
Once again, after the groundwork has been laid...

623
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:53,190
It's time for "Mother's Song"

624
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,290
That's so true

625
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:09,470
My mom worked all night, knitting by hand

626
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:16,380
She knew the cold wind would blow

627
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:21,550
So she worked hard knitting

628
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,720
The letter from my hometown came through

629
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:32,960
I could smell the fire

630
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,870
Fantastic!

631
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,870
No, well...

632
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,300
Based on the mood, he's accepted the song but...

633
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:44,110
Jumbo does not cry

634
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,680
At this point...

635
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,980
My mom is...

636
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:52,320
He starts verse 2

637
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,320
But then...

638
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,750
She knitted...

639
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,820
He unexpectedly joins in

640
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,990
♬～knew it'd be cold

641
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:08,470
She worked hard knitting

642
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:08,470
She worked hard knitting

643
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:14,500
The letter from my
hometown came through

644
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:14,500
The letter from my
hometown came through

645
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:19,580
I could smell the fire

646
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:19,580
I could smell the fire

647
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,110
But, as expected...

648
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,980
He didn't cry

649
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:28,320
So, our last challenger is...

650
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,890
Harisenbon

651
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,890
Kondō Haruna

652
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,360
And...

653
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:38,730
Ogawa Haruna

654
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:38,730
Target
Spike

655
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:45,200
I don't need to do it to know it'll be hard for her

656
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:50,770
She's really honest and pure, a really good girl

657
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:56,510
I think she'll cry. Ogawa-chan will

658
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,250
So you haven't visited them at all?

659
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:06,360
I haven't, no. Ever since coronavirus...

660
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,020
About 2 years

661
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:13,700
Here too, she naturally changes
the subject to parents...

662
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,700
Mothers, you know, they notice changes like that

663
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,700
Yeah

664
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,710
Like in the finals of THE W

665
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:29,850
Mine as well, when I'm in the final of a competition

666
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:34,320
I get really worried and nervous

667
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,390
At a time like that...

668
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:43,530
She doesn't really know anything about my work

669
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,660
And I don't talk about it

670
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,900
But it's like she can sense that tension and anxiety

671
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,970
She made me a lucky charm

672
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,210
Wow!

673
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,110
And gave it to me

674
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,010
She's so kind

675
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,490
So, like...

676
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:22,400
My mom worked all night, knitting by hand

677
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,340
I'm going to cry

678
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:29,210
She knew the cold wind would blow

679
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,180
So she worked hard knitting

680
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:42,450
Laughing senpai

681
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,450
Crying kōhai

682
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,690
So, here's the...

683
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:53,430
Prank Reveal

684
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,390
Huh.. what...

685
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,060
Huh, what?

686
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,570
What is this?

687
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,140
Staff) "No matter how much you tug at someone's heartstrings...

688
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:05,080
Staff) it's difficult to make someone cry by
finishing with 'Mother's Song'" is the theory

689
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,640
Definitely

690
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,250
Despite that, you cried so much for us

691
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,280
Seriously, it was a really good story

692
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,950
What made me feel like she understood was that story about high school

693
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,320
Ah, yeah, yeah

694
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,860
I was like "Wow". And also that lucky charm she gave you

695
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,790
The lucky charm

696
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,790
The lucky charm was fake

697
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:32,640
Investigation Result

698
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:32,640
We had intended it for it to be
an impossible theory instead of a difficult theory but something unexpected happened

699
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,000
And with that...

700
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Definitely

701
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,010
One person succeeded

702
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,010
She cried

703
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,680
Amazing. But now...

704
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,010
I have to ask.
At a time when you're making someone cry...

705
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,380
Why did Haruna
order a sushi boat?

706
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,120
Sushi boat

707
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,690
2 of them

708
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,690
That caught my attention

709
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,020
2 people ordering a sushi boat's pretty rare

710
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,020
It's massive

711
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,020
2 people ordering a sushi boat...

712
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,390
And also, when Cookie!-san
was talking about his mom

713
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:03,230
Yasei Bakudan
Cookie!

714
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:00,060
When Cookie!-san said she's
80 so she has 20 years left

715
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:03,230
Poko

716
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,630
Habu-san was like
"well, 5 or 10 years at most"

717
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:07,040
Shortening her life expectancy without asking

718
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:07,340
You know,
I was wondering about that one

719
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:17,980
Yasei Bakudan
Cookie!

720
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:18,380
Poko

721
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,670
Like 'why say that?'

722
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,640
If it were reversed, I'd get it
'5 to 10 years'

723
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,640
'No, she could last
another 20 years'

724
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,650
I'd understand then. But when he said

725
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,650
Right, right

726
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,680
'another 20 years', he was like...

727
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,250
No, at most 5 to 10 years, surely

728
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,050
You can't say that if you're not related

729
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,360
Here's our next presenter. Come in!

730
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,360
Are you there?

731
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,030
Yes, it's Kirin's Kawashima!

732
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Kawashima Akira

733
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Presenter



(Kirin)

734
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,030
Hello everyone

735
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,700
Thank you for that
"Love It!" theory, really

736
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,670
Ah, really?

737
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,670
We were on that show, right?

738
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:56,790
Theory: A female guest on "Love It!" remotely
controlled by an army of comedians can get more laughs than the regular members

739
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,040
It's a live
morning show

740
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
It was insane,
you know!

741
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,010
You really got me

742
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,020
I really was

743
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,020
Were you shocked at first?

744
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,020
I was seriously
worried

745
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,050
I thought she
was on drugs

746
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,720
But...

747
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,720
You're right

748
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,390
We have no proof
Ano-chan doesn't do drugs

749
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,320
Hey, that's enough

750
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,320
She doesn't!

751
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,990
So, since today's show is a special

752
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:08,300
I've brought with me the 3rd
installment of a special project

753
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,630
And that is...

754
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,900
Real Prank

755
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,300
Ah...

756
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,300
So, this time...

757
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,110
"Advert" Real Prank

758
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,110
"Scandal Article" Real Prank

759
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:18,070
the theory I've brought with me about
something that turns out to be true is this!

760
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:29,490
Theory: If someone happily accepts the offer of an MC job on an 'obi program', even if the show turns out to be about introducing kimono obi, it's hard to say "in that case, we won't do it"
(Note: Obi means belt or sash)

761
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,650
I'm done

762
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,290
You don't have to do that!

763
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,690
We definitely have to make sure

764
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,360
Normally, when you say 'obi program'

765
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,330
it means a program airing from Monday
to Friday, covering the schedule like a belt

766
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,330
Yes, that's right

767
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,700
But it turns out...

768
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:48,540
It's a special show about kimono obi

769
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,710
That's harsh...

770
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,670
How about it? Yahagi-san,
if this happened to you

771
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,040
Hmmm

772
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,350
"You want me to do it?" is what I'd ask

773
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,350
Like "I'm not familiar with them!"

774
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,280
If it's about obi

775
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,280
When you discover it's about kimono

776
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,650
But, everyone, the main
point is still to come

777
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,320
Today it's a Real Prank

778
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,620
We actually recorded this obi program

779
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,530
And we'll really broadcast it

780
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,290
Broadcast it?

781
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,300
TBS kindly gave us a slot
for our obi program

782
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,630
to air as a special

783
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,970
As a different show?

784
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,640
It's not just on this program

785
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,640
You're doing it properly

786
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
So it's the same as before, isn't it?

787
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,970
That's right

788
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,970
The ones who are positive about it→

789
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,340
If along the way they start doubting it

790
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,340
are the ones who get it

791
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,340
or saying "what's this?" too much

792
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,310
then they get disqualified

793
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,680
Who's going to watch a show like this?

794
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,650
In fact when it comes to the kimono obi program...

795
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,720
The quality doesn't matter at all

796
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,320
No, no.
Do it properly please

797
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,030
We just have to make it happen

798
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,590
We can't do more than that

799
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:46,000
Some people will watch it
without knowing about this

800
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I hope it's funny

801
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,330
Of course, whoever is our target
will do everything they can

802
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,970
I want them to do "obi snapping"

803
00:34:54,970 --> 00:35:08,380
Investigation:

804
00:34:54,970 --> 00:35:08,380
Theory: If someone happily accepts the offer of an MC job on an 'obi program', even if the show turns out to be about introducing kimono obi, it's hard to say "in that case, we won't do it"
(Note: Obi means belt or sash)

805
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:12,660
Today, the targets for our
obi program Real Prank will be

806
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,660
These 3 groups

807
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:20,630
Magical Lovely

808
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:20,630
New York

809
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:20,630
Saraba Seishun no Hikari

810
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,330
And the pair that shows a positive attitude

811
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:20,630
towards the program right to the end

812
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,340
will be invited to what is, without a doubt, the first variety program specializing in obi in history:

813
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,640
"Wonderful Obi Life"
(Suteki ni Obi Life)

814
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,010
where they'll be participating as MC

815
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,680
And so...

816
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:40,080
in the first week
or so of November

817
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:40,080
their respective managers inform them that they've received an offer to be MCs for an obi program

818
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:43,690
The first group were last year's M-1 champions

819
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:48,560
Magical Lovely

820
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:48,560
Murakami

821
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:48,560
Noda Crystal

822
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,690
and very popular
in variety shows this year,

823
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,690
Magical Lovely

824
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:52,800
Manager

825
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,800
And we've got one more thing from TBS

826
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,000
It is going to be at night

827
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,440
They'd like you to be MCs for an obi show

828
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,710
An obi show?

829
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,710
What kind? Comedy?

830
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:09,150
Well, I still haven't been told any of the details

831
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,320
It seems we'll be meeting them in the next few weeks

832
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:18,450
We set it up as if the manager
doesn't know the details either

833
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:22,790
Daily from Monday to Friday?

834
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,730
(Manager) That's right

835
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:27,800
Well, I still don't know what form it's going to take

836
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,400
This is incredible

837
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,700
Manager

838
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,770
Next, it's...

839
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,700
New York

840
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,700
Shimasa Kazuya

841
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,700
Yashiki Hirosama

842
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:40,240
We've had an offer from TBS about a late-night obi show

843
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,240
Obi? Really?

844
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,950
Yes

845
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,950
We'll do an obi show?

846
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,380
It'll be at night

847
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,520
For TBS

848
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,480
Wow, great

849
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,990
Something like "Wonderful"?

850
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,890
I don't know about that right now

851
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,230
But we've got a meeting about it next week

852
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:00,030
It seems like it'll be with the production staff

853
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,270
Wow, TBS

854
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:05,740
A late-night obi show for TBS

855
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,940
Manager

856
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:07,940
Higashi Bukuro

857
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:07,940
Morita Tetsuya

858
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:07,940
Saraba Seishun no Hikari

859
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,510
with you two as MC

860
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,510
Huh? Obi?

861
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,510
Obi...

862
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,580
Monday to Friday?

863
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,550
It seems we'll be meeting very soon to discuss the details

864
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,720
Both of us?

865
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Yes, both

866
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,990
Bukuro too?

867
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,990
Bukuro too

868
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,990
What do you mean, 'too'?

869
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:27,260
So they're fine with Bukuro?

870
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,220
What's that mean?

871
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,130
That's great

872
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,300
Bukuro too?

873
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,300
How many times will you say it?

874
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:40,400
And, of course, they mistake it for what's known in the industry as an obi show

875
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,340
It's clear the 3 groups are happy

876
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,310
It'll be like a night version of 'Love It!'

877
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,680
In that case...

878
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:48,280
They could let us use the 'Love It!' set with some changes

879
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,750
Wouldn't it look good with, like, smoky colors?

880
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,320
But with the same set

881
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,690
And on-location shoots too. Maybe a vomit search

882
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,660
Searching the town for vomit

883
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,160
'Here's a problem for you, Uekami-san'

884
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,830
'What on earth is this round green thing?'

885
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,500
He's really talkative, isn't he?

886
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,070
He's getting really excited

887
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,040
He's already getting carried away

888
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,140
And so, Magical Lovely start dreaming about their late-night obi show

889
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,380
And then, when it comes to Saraba...

890
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,820
What I'm worried about is you

891
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,820
In what way?

892
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,020
You and your scandals

893
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,020
It doesn't matter

894
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:33,360
No but if we start an obi show, a scandal would end it

895
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,360
No, I don't know anything about anything like that

896
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,330
I don't know about that

897
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,330
You "don't know"?

898
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:38,430
Saying "don't know" isn't going to cut it anymore

899
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:42,130
We'll do the obi show and ... I don't know about that

900
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,130
No, don't say that to the staff

901
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,570
That's why we'll have a meeting and umm...

902
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,210
It's probably better to say "I don't know!", right?

903
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,340
In that case

904
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,910
So then I can say "I already told you that"

905
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,380
Yeah

906
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,350
Is there something else?

907
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,350
What's wrong with you?

908
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,450
Well, there isn't but...

909
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:00,820
There isn't but I don't know about something like that

910
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,690
I don't know what might get exposed

911
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,620
You should say that

912
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,730
"I don't know what might get exposed" is what you should say

913
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,800
So after they say "you're definitely doing it", I'll say that

914
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,730
Once they say that

915
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:18,170
"We're going with Saraba"

916
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,170
After they say "you'll do the obi show"...

917
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,540
Once if feels like they can't back out anymore

918
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,540
What do you mean back out?

919
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,240
So after it's gone that far?

920
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:32,720
They discuss underhanded strategies to
make sure they don't lose the MC job

921
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,220
Is it best to say that as we're leaving the meeting room?

922
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,690
In a sort of lighthearted way

923
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:41,890
No no, like... I don't think that counts as telling them

924
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:48,160
Is that really going to be okay on a professional level?

925
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,160
If we go back into the room it'll be bad

926
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,970
But if it's near the elevators, we'll go down, and it's done

927
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:51,900
We would win then

928
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:58,340
With all 3 pairs having high hopes for their first obi show MC job...

929
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,380
it's the end of the day.

930
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,110
Obi...

931
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,880
Obi MCs

932
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:10,020
And so, about a week after their
manager told them about it

933
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:10,520
Mid-November

934
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,960
the 3 groups are invited over under the pretext of meeting the staff

935
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:22,300
Director

936
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:22,300
Producer

937
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,360
At last...

938
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:22,300
It's time to announce it's about kimono 'obi'

939
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:26,940
So, this nighttime show, we've put a lot of effort into it

940
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,710
and with New York-san's participation

941
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,710
I think it could be a really good show

942
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,680
Thank you very much

943
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,680
Thank you very much

944
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,680
Looking forward to it

945
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,950
Well then, shall we discuss the program's content?

946
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,380
If you could just turn to page 1?

947
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,320
(Yashiki/Shimasa) Sure

948
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,920
So, this show...

949
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,690
is called "Wonderful Obi Life"

950
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:49,560
Modern people have almost forgotten
about the beauty of Japanese clothes

951
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,400
so this is a program to "delve
into and rediscover the obi"

952
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,570
It'll air from 12.26am at night, for one hour

953
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,140
Ah, for only 1 day...?

954
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,610
That's right, yes

955
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,610
Ah, it's a one-off?

956
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:06,310
Yes, a one-off. Just 1 episode

957
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,310
Ah, I see...

958
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,340
So it's a special

959
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,350
So it's not an obi show

960
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,810
That's confirmed

961
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,050
That's right, it's a special

962
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:17,890
It's scheduled for Wednesday 22 December

963
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,390
The obi show...

964
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,460
Is it... this?

965
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,960
Ah...

966
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,760
Ah, I see

967
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,230
Ah, I see, sorry

968
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,300
The obi show's a show about obi...

969
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,500
A show about obi, yes

970
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:34,240
Is something wrong?

971
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,240
No...

972
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,510
It's...

973
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,510
It's... nothing

974
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,280
Is it okay?

975
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:42,310
Yes, totally

976
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,410
Would it be alright if we were to proceed?

977
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:44,410
Yes

978
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,220
Calling a show about obi an obi show...

979
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,520
I see

980
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,220
It's a kimono obi, you know?

981
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,760
You call this an obi show?

982
00:41:53,990 --> 00:42:00,360
Because of the unbelievable "obi show" mix-up...

983
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,360
Yashiki pokes fun without thinking

984
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,860
Is it okay?

985
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:01,860
Yes it is

986
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:04,070
Is it okay
if we continue?

987
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:06,370
Excuse me, please continue

988
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,740
We're going to stay focused now

989
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,710
So it's an obi program

990
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,010
Just obi?

991
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,010
Just obi

992
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:15,310
They're thinking "we can't mention this on radio"

993
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,980
Program TBA

994
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:26,720
Suiyōbi no Downtown

995
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,350
And so, after this...

996
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:20,020
starting at 12.26am

997
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:26,720
A whole hour about kimono obi!
The first obi variety show in history

998
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:26,720
Wonderful Obi Life

999
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,350
a fake-looking but real program

1000
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,390
"Wonderful Obi Life"

1001
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,690
will actually air on TBS

1002
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,690
Here?

1003
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,690
Yes

1004
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,560
Today, after this, for an hour

1005
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,630
Amazing

1006
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,630
An hour!

1007
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:37,000
Who on earth will the MCs be?

1008
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:49,650
TL Note: I'm not translating the obi show but you're really not missing much. Search for 'Suteki ni Obi Life' if you want to watch it

1009
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,090
Could you please turn to page 1?

1010
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,490
So, this program's name

1011
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:07,330
is "Wonderful Obi Life".

1012
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:11,500
By delving into obi, we'll discover things like

1013
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,370
what it is to be Japanese person

1014
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,300
A late-night show about obi

1015
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:20,040
Ah, an obi show...

1016
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,040
Ah...

1017
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,110
It's not an obi show but about them

1018
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,680
Yes? "About them"... what?

1019
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,010
(Murakami) Ah, the...

1020
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:30,120
The... obi is

1021
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,120
L-

1022
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,120
L- Late night...

1023
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,650
Yes, it's late

1024
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,020
So, there's only going to be one episode?

1025
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,790
Yes, that's right

1026
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,330
A special?

1027
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,330
A special, yes

1028
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,360
(Murakami) Oh

1029
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:43,030
On second thought, there's no way it's an obi...

1030
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,800
In comedy... well...

1031
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,670
In TV terminology, "obi show" means

1032
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,070
Right...

1033
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,670
We probably got a bit carried away, you know

1034
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,610
It's too early for us to have an obi show

1035
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:59,480
And so, Magical Lovely's hopes are replaced with an equal amount of disappointment

1036
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,350
And, as for the Saraba pair...

1037
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,320
You're OK with this guy too?

1038
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:05,320
We are

1039
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,690
So I can do the obi show too

1040
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:08,790
Thank you very much

1041
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:09,930
Will it air live?

1042
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,600
No, it won't

1043
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,600
Ah, it's not live

1044
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,430
For now...

1045
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,460
Please look at the project booklet...

1046
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:22,170
The program's called "Wonderful Obi Life"

1047
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,440
Ah...

1048
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,240
Huh?

1049
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,140
Ah...

1050
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,510
Ah... oh?

1051
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:30,510
Ah

1052
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:29,780
Ah yes...

1053
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,280
Huh?

1054
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,310
Huh? Yes...

1055
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,250
Is there a problem?

1056
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,050
About... about obi

1057
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,090
Obi from Japanese clothing

1058
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,020
Yes

1059
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:42,990
This is a show focusing on those kinds of obi

1060
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,360
Ah

1061
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,060
Ah, obi show...

1062
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,860
It's a show about obi

1063
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,140
What's wrong?

1064
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:54,140
No, we're grateful, we're grateful

1065
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,270
Ah, obi. Yes, yes...

1066
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:00,110
What? Is it okay?

1067
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,110
It's fine...

1068
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,750
No, it's fine...

1069
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:04,750
We must have misunderstood

1070
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:09,490
It seems there's a lot they want to say...

1071
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,390
Well, we've got 3 main projects in mind

1072
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,420
There'll be...

1073
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,560
Yamamura Momiji-san's on-location shoot.

1074
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,200
Obi, right? Obi

1075
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,830
We're thinking of having her go shopping

1076
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,900
You two will watch that in the studio

1077
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,170
and add some commentary about it

1078
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,940
As for when it'll air, it's after "news23" for an hour

1079
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,170
After "news23"?

1080
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:36,680
It's like, we want to keep the "news23" audience levels intact

1081
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,680
So we'll take over from that?

1082
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:43,190
Then, once the staff have left the room...

1083
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,160
What?

1084
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:50,060
Well, I suppose it's technically an obi show

1085
00:45:55,930 --> 00:46:01,140
No way... would they put this after "news23"?

1086
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:07,010
Well, I guess it's like a joint production of serious shows

1087
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:14,450
Could he be possibly thinking that
"Wonderful Obi Life" doesn't exist?

1088
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,890
Morita seems to be suspecting something

1089
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,390
Then...

1090
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,760
For cameras?

1091
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,760
He's searching

1092
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,060
It's done

1093
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,060
Stop it!

1094
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,100
He looks around...

1095
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,470
and searches for hidden cameras

1096
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,670
Because it's strange

1097
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:42,110
Why not kimono? An obi needs a kimono

1098
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:44,780
Why didn't they say kimono show?

1099
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,950
Why obi?

1100
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:53,920
Magical Lovely

1101
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:53,920
New York

1102
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:53,920
Similarly, for the other two groups, the staff leave the room so we can hear their true thoughts

1103
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:57,260
I'm sorry, I said obi show. Um...

1104
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,430
Sorry

1105
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:00,830
I must have not heard them say "about"

1106
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,300
I'm really sorry

1107
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,500
This doesn't need us at all

1108
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,600
Wouldn't Suehirogarizu be better?

1109
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:14,640
But I'm happy if we've started getting jobs like this, about things that we don't have a connection to

1110
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:19,950
So, at this point, we would probably be able to say no

1111
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:23,950
It's fine, isn't it? Like, even if we flop

1112
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,160
It's like "who could make this funny?"

1113
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,790
So, like, it's alright. If that's the case

1114
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:32,030
"Why don't you try it!?"

1115
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,030
We'll say "Why don't you try it?"

1116
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:34,560
I mean, who can make it funny?

1117
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:35,830
Obi show...

1118
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:38,970
I'm sorry. I, um, misunderstood too

1119
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:42,170
Well, let's chat later

1120
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:44,270
about the obi show being an "obi" show

1121
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:49,410
It's not confirmed yet, including the schedule

1122
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:52,080
Well, if the schedule works

1123
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,620
It seems funny, actually

1124
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,620
Totally

1125
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:58,890
Wow, an hour on terrestrial TV as MCs

1126
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:08,130
And so, there are two groups who considered the obi mix-up a funny mistake and are positive about the show

1127
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,470
Early December

1128
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:11,700
Yet another week later...

1129
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:19,010
We invite the 3 groups to a meeting to
discuss the specific content of the program

1130
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:27,080
Real!!

1131
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,710
From this point...

1132
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,050
To make the most of the "Real!!" at the end...

1133
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:27,080
We daringly add more tricks to make it seem fake

1134
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,750
So, first...

1135
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,990
Excuse us. Sorry we're late

1136
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,990
Sorry, hello

1137
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:47,000
The meeting staff wear kimono

1138
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:47,000
Trick to make it seem fake

1139
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:45,000
Thank you for coming

1140
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Not at all

1141
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,410
I'm looking forward to working together

1142
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,340
(Murakami) Thank you

1143
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,580
I like the kimono

1144
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:57,080
We thought we'd get into the spirit of it

1145
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,520
(Staff) The staff thinks it's a good look

1146
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,520
Ah, totally

1147
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,450
Yeah, it's cool isn't it?

1148
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,550
(Murakami) It's good isn't it?

1149
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:02,250
It keeps us focused, kind of

1150
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:05,550
Of course, as MCs, you two will also wear these

1151
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,690
Ah, really?
I'm glad

1152
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,690
I'm so happy

1153
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:13,960
Next, it's the ones who were already suspicious
about the program at the last meeting, Saraba...

1154
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,200
Ah, hello. Sorry we're late

1155
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,200
Sorry

1156
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,040
Hello

1157
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,340
Hello

1158
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,340
Hello

1159
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:29,810
I just want to say...

1160
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:34,450
I'm looking forward to working together on this obi show

1161
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,480
Yes

1162
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,450
Ah... yes...

1163
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:39,990
It seems as though Morita's
doubts have been confirmed

1164
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:43,490
Moving onto New York...

1165
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:46,160
Excuse us. Sorry we're late

1166
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,830
(Yashiki) Good morning

1167
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,830
Sorry we're late

1168
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:49,730
Good morning

1169
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,730
Hello

1170
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:51,200
Hello

1171
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,100
Sorry. Thanks for coming

1172
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,200
Thank you

1173
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,600
Good morning, hello

1174
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:00,740
Well then, would it alright if we started the meeting?

1175
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,740
Sure

1176
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,910
Faced by a gang of kimono wearers...

1177
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,880
for some reason, both of them give no reaction

1178
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:14,890
Trick to make it seem fake



During the meeting, there's matcha tea and teacakes

1179
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:15,090
After that, while they're being treated to matcha tea and teacakes...

1180
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:17,990
Would it be okay if we moved onto the script?

1181
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:20,660
We'd like each of you to do various one-liner obi gags

1182
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:31,010
Trick to make it seem fake

1183
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:31,010
Unreasonable request for obi gags

1184
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:24,030
(Murakami) Obi gag? Obi gag?

1185
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:26,500
How about it? Do you think you can do some?

1186
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,370
Obi gags...

1187
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,010
I see. Well... hmm

1188
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,140
Some gags related to obi

1189
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,610
Ah...

1190
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:36,610
Ah... something...

1191
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,610
Ah... something... yes

1192
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:38,410
We'll think of something

1193
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:39,210
Yes

1194
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:42,380
We'd like to have a few scattered around

1195
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,820
Obi gags?

1196
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:44,820
Gags related to obi

1197
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,420
Do you have anything right now?

1198
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,360
Now?

1199
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,990
(Staff)
Does anything come to mind?

1200
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:49,360
Now? About obi?

1201
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,360
He looks angry

1202
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:54,030
He's already in a bad mood

1203
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,330
He's got angry eyes

1204
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:56,670
I see. Like...

1205
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,500
Y-you have to wear an obi

1206
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,800
Oh.. the obi...

1207
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,970
Hello, I'm Obi Ologun. Something like that

1208
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,280
Personally, I like it a lot but...

1209
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:14,620
It's good, right?

1210
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,850
No, it is good

1211
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,720
I think it's really good

1212
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,850
Furthermore...

1213
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,720
Just before VTRs, it's different from the obi gags but...

1214
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,590
This gesture, like pulling an obi

1215
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,960
Ah, like in period dramas

1216
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,570
And Noda-san will be like "Aa-ree!"

1217
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:32,500
(Staff) Like you're entering the VTR.
Something like that

1218
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:35,800
Trick to make it seem fake



Being compelled to do an unfunny VTR intro

1219
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,970
Will you do it?

1220
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,970
You don't have to

1221
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:38,270
Aa-ree!!

1222
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:38,270
VTR

1223
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,940
Ah, other way

1224
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,940
The obi is the other way

1225
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,710
Counterclockwise

1226
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,980
It's fine.

1227
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:45,980
It's fine. Got it

1228
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,250
Just one more time then

1229
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:50,620
Aa-ree!!

1230
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:50,620
VTR

1231
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:49,990
That's it, that's it

1232
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,790
This way, this way, this way

1233
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,690
Could we turn the "Aa-ree!!" into Harley?

1234
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:56,990
From, like, the second time

1235
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:59,090
"Harley", like the motorbike?

1236
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,090
The motorbike Harley

1237
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,660
Aa-ree!!

1238
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,660
First, Aa-ree!! then

1239
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,100
Harley!

1240
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,900
Couldn't that be an obi gag?

1241
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:08,240
As an obi gag?

1242
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,240
You've already made one really good obi gag

1243
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,740
Aa-ree...

1244
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,740
Harley

1245
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:17,810
Magical Lovely are already showing a high amount of adaptability towards making obi gags

1246
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,550
Next...

1247
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:24,320
Thanks for filling in this questionnaire for us

1248
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,520
I was wondering if we could review...

1249
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:31,430
Trick to make it seem fake



A super-long preliminary questionnaire about obi

1250
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,060
Sure

1251
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,060
your answers to these questions now

1252
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,960
We don't have much to say about obi

1253
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,960
(Shimasa) For sure

1254
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,300
I was hooking up with a girl wearing a kimono

1255
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:46,240
Are there any obi you'd like to wear in future?

1256
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:46,240
Has anything funny happened to you while wearing an obi?

1257
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:46,240
I was hooking up with a girl wearing a kimono

1258
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:46,240
I'd like to try on some high-end classic ones

1259
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:46,240
Please complete this questionnaire for TBS Special "Wonderful Obi Life"

1260
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:46,240
We kindly ask for your cooperation in creating material

1261
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:46,240
What do you think the obi industry needs

1262
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:46,240
When I did karate, I didn't really get past white belt.

1263
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:46,240
Wonderful
Obi
Life

1264
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:46,240
Yashiki's answers

1265
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:46,240
Young girls like Meruru and Yuuchami
and popular gyaru-style girls...

1266
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:46,240
and I had a really hard time untying it

1267
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:46,240
to thrive in future?

1268
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,170
and I had a really hard time untying it

1269
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,670
Why does that happen? Seriously

1270
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:46,240
Picking up girls wearing yukata or kimono

1271
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:46,840
Thank you very much

1272
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,240
We appreciate your writing so much

1273
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,240
No problem

1274
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:54,050
I see you've done karate

1275
00:52:49,240 --> 00:53:01,820
Do you have any sad memories related to obi?

1276
00:52:49,240 --> 00:53:01,820
Has anything funny happened to you while wearing an obi?

1277
00:52:49,240 --> 00:53:01,820
Higashi Bukuro's answers

1278
00:52:49,240 --> 00:53:01,820
It was in karate but I liked black.
I think firework-patterned obi are pretty

1279
00:52:49,240 --> 00:53:01,820
It was in karate but,
I remember struggling hard going from purple to brown belt so
I don't like purple obi

1280
00:52:49,240 --> 00:53:01,820
My classmate Takahashi-kun couldn't reach black belt so
everyone teased him, calling him the eternal brown belt.
He was brown belt for so long, it started to fade
and gradually become a white belt.

1281
00:52:49,240 --> 00:53:01,820
On the other hand, what colors and patterns do you dislike?

We kindly ask for your cooperation in creating material

1284
00:52:49,240 --> 00:53:01,820
What are your favorite obi colors and patterns?

1285
00:52:49,240 --> 00:53:01,820
When I was a 3rd grader and couldn't tie my obi yet...

1286
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,680
Ah, yes...

1287
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,050
Yes, I did

1288
00:52:54,150 --> 00:53:01,790
In contrast to Higashi Bukuro,
who surprisingly answered
this puzzling questionnaire
in great detail...

1289
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,460
Morita-san, are you not a fan of questionnaires?

1290
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,460
It's fine

1291
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,200
I'm sorry. I'm a bit...

1292
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:12,370
Has anything funny happened to you while wearing an obi?

1293
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:20,010
Bright colors

1294
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:20,010
Do you have any sad memories related to obi?

1295
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:20,010
I don't think so

1296
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:20,010
Morita's answers

1297
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:20,010
None at all

1298
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:20,010
None in particular

1299
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:20,010
On the other hand, what colors and patterns do you dislike?

What are your favorite obi colors and patterns?

1303
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:09,030
When it comes to obi

1304
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,930
I don't really have anything, sorry

1305
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,130
that comes to mind...

1306
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:20,010
Could it be that Morita thinks Wonderful Obi Life doesn't exist and so didn't fill it in?

1307
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:20,010
Has anything funny happened to you while wearing an obi?

1308
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:22,210
The obi you'd like to try on in future

1309
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:37,130
Are there any obi you'd like to wear in future?

Tatsumura Kintai

1318
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:33,460
Did you already

1319
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,550
Well...

1320
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:33,460
Did you already know it before this?

1321
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:32,550
Well... like...

1322
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:37,130
I think I'd like to try it sometime

1323
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,260
Oh, man

1324
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:40,700
30 minutes before the meeting

1325
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,430
This is so hard

1326
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,230
We've got to write something

1327
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:47,200
This is so bad. There's a script already

1328
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:53,610
There's no choice but to search it online and write that

1329
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:55,740
I don't even know what my favorite color obi is

1330
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,740
There's no choice but to search

1331
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,680
It's a bit unrelated but do you two have...

1332
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,250
belts on right now?

1333
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:02,520
Well, I don't

1334
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:02,520
I do have a belt on, yes

1335
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:05,220
Like this, yes

1336
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,620
Since the belt is kind of a competitor, to the obi

1337
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,960
Competition?

1338
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:15,600
Trick to make it seem fake



Belts are competition for the obi so they can't wear them

1339
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:11,060
To the obi?

1340
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,600
Belts?

1341
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:15,600
Because it's wrapped around you

1342
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:18,630
Just for the day we're recording it, please don't wear one

1343
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:21,770
Belts are competition?

1344
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,770
Competition?

1345
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,770
Yes

1346
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:23,940
It's totally different though

1347
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:23,940
Like, sweatpants...

1348
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,410
Like, sweatpants...

1349
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,440
They'd be useful

1350
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,610
You don't usually wear one?

1351
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,580
I don't...

1352
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:30,580
I don't really I guess

1353
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,480
I'm sure those in the obi world will be happy about that

1354
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,920
If you could mention that

1355
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,920
People in the obi world

1356
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,720
They regard belts as something of an enemy

1357
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,920
Is that so?

1358
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,020
You're perfect for an obi MC

1359
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,960
And then...

1360
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:47,830
If you get an offer from a rival channel for a show about obi

1361
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:50,230
We'd appreciate if you could refuse it

1362
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:54,000
Trick to make it seem fake



Banned from appearing on rival networks' obi shows

1363
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:54,000
Well, there won't be

1364
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:54,000
Well, there won't be for sure

1365
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,600
There won't be any, will there?

1366
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,110
We don't think there'll be any but

1367
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,110
Sure

1368
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:03,810
If you could just let us know if you do

1369
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,410
(Staff) Thank you very much

1370
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,410
Sure

1371
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,340
Sure

1372
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,810
No problem

1373
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,380
And now it's time for...

1374
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:09,720
The final check

1375
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:15,390
As before, after the meeting the staff leave them alone so we can hear what they think

1376
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:20,400
Why did they wear kimono in today's meeting?

1377
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,500
Well, because they're obi people

1378
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,500
That's what it means?

1379
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:35,780
Is he totally convinced it's a prank?

1380
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:40,680
This time too Morita starts searching for cameras

1381
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:44,120
On the other hand,
Magical Lovely...

1382
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,590
They suddenly started the "Aa-ree!!" bit

1383
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:50,360
"It's this way" "No that"

1384
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,730
Was that on purpose to try to get a laugh?

1385
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,330
We had to laugh more

1386
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:57,700
Offers from another network...

1387
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:01,270
There won't be any. No way

1388
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:01,270
Those people are so weird, aren't they?

1389
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:03,670
They're weird, no doubt about it

1390
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:09,380
It's because they're weird that they said "do this belt show"

1391
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:14,020
They get excited badmouthing the staff

1392
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,350
This is something else too

1393
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:21,890
This set too. They're really overdoing it with all this

1394
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:23,460
It was tasty though

1395
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:26,430
It was really delicious, right?

1396
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:26,430
Really delicious

1397
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:30,200
And, as expected, since he feels suspicious...

1398
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,500
He starts looking for cameras too

1399
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,040
But in this midst of
all this, New York...

1400
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:40,310
What do you think? Does this program seem OK?

1401
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:43,850
I wonder what it'll be like

1402
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:43,850
I really have no idea

1403
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:49,150
It seems they're uneasy but
there's no sign of suspicion

1404
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:53,420
And so, the MC role for
"Wonderful Obi Life"...

1405
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:58,030
go to the pair who were positive throughout.

1406
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:01,830
Wonderful
Obi
Life

1407
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:01,830
New York's

1408
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,030
We select New York!

1409
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:05,100
As for the 2 groups who
unfortunately searched for cameras

1410
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,240
We tell them it's Real!!

1411
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,500
Here...

1412
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,210
Staff) Good work

1413
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:21,750
Well we did think it was a bit suspicious

1414
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,750
That's true, yes

1415
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,320
I was already a little suspicious from the start

1416
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,450
Staff) The start?

1417
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:29,190
From when the 'obi show' turned out to be a 'show about obi'

1418
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:35,260
But after that, when this didn't happen, I was like "is it real?"

1419
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:39,030
After being approached by
staff holding a sign

1420
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:44,070
they're totally sure it's a prank, but now we tell them it's real

1421
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:47,810
Staff) The story was that you'd be obi show MCs right?

1422
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,840
Yes

1423
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:48,480
Staff) Actually

1424
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:51,850
Real!!

1425
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,280
Wait, what?

1426
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,920
It exists?

1427
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:54,920
Staff) Yes

1428
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:57,650
"Wonderful Obi Life" exists?

1429
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,650
Staff) Yes, it does

1430
00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:00,220
You're making it?

1431
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,220
Staff) We are. It's scheduled

1432
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:03,890
You've been doing this prank for weeks now

1433
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:06,390
I don't get it. It's confusing. I'm not sure which it is

1434
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,030
So you're saying this isn't a prank?

1435
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:09,560
Staff) That's right, it's Real

1436
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,100
It was Real?

1437
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,300
Staff) It's Real

1438
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,300
When you think it's a prank

1439
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,900
(Staff) Yes

1440
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:14,000
It's like the opposite of an opposite

1441
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:18,740
Then we tell them they're disqualified...

1442
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:25,050
So we'll be the ones who just complained about it

1443
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,050
Staff) You did complain

1444
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:28,020
Without a doubt

1445
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:32,220
Staff) So how do you feel about having lost the MC job?

1446
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:35,290
I feel like it's always going to be in the back of my head

1447
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:36,960
What happened with this show

1448
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,030
It was quite a burden

1449
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:42,430
I felt a bit of pressure

1450
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:45,630
There is a feeling I've been released

1451
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,570
Next,
the Saraba pair

1452
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:49,600
Prank Reveal

1453
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,880
What the hell?

1454
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,880
Staff) Good work

1455
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:58,380
What the hell? What the hell?

1456
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,380
No no no no no

1457
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:01,880
I'm so annoyed. So annoyed

1458
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:01,880
Staff) How was it?

1459
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,620
What do you mean 'How was it'? What is this?

1460
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,290
Well I already...

1461
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:12,130
I was really suspicious from the previous meeting

1462
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:14,630
Huh, huh? So it doesn't exist? 'Wonderful Obi Life'?

1463
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:16,130
Staff) Just to make sure

1464
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:19,600
Staff) The story was that you'd be obi show MCs, right?

1465
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,400
Yes

1466
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,400
Yes

1467
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,340
Staff) That story...

1468
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:24,440
is Real!!

1469
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:30,480
Staff) So it's Real

1470
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:30,480
Real?

1471
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:30,480
Real?

1472
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,080
(Staff) And because it's Real...

1473
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,080
What do you mean? What is this?

1474
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:38,450
Staff) "Wonderful Obi Life"

1475
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:38,450
Staff) "Wonderful Obi Life" really will

1476
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:38,450
Staff) "Wonderful Obi Life" really will be broadcast

1477
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:38,450
Wha?

1478
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,450
What? It exists?

1479
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,090
You're making this?

1480
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,090
It exists?

1481
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,090
Staff) We are

1482
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:46,160
Staff) Just as scripted, we'll be recording it but

1483
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:46,130
Huh, seriously?

1484
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,490
Yes

1485
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:52,800
Staff) Because Morita-san was suspicious last time

1486
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,940
Staff) and today as well...

1487
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,940
Of course I was, in such a weird meeting

1488
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:03,010
After we explain today's project and their disqualification...

1489
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:06,080
Do things right for once!

1490
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:10,420
No no no no no. We could've done it! See, they're doing it

1491
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:11,850
Huh? You're really doing it?

1492
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:11,850
Staff) We really are

1493
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:15,760
Huh, what are you? Which side are you on?

1494
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,930
Which side?

1495
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:20,830
No, I didn't know either

1496
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:23,330
So we weren't positive enough?

1497
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,330
Obviously not

1498
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:27,470
I was just thinking I could do a show on terrestrial TV

1499
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:29,700
No one normal will think this is real

1500
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,640
This guy wants to be on TV so much he just couldn't see it

1501
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,010
He was just like this

1502
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:37,580
So first I lost the Monday to Friday show

1503
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,710
Then, I was like 'I'll do this 1 thing'

1504
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:42,780
And now I've lost that too. I've lost 6 things

1505
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,890
What? You wanted to do it?

1506
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,690
Well, I did

1507
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:48,590
I thought I could do a show about obi and was excited

1508
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:52,060
(A kind of traditional textile↓)

1509
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:52,060
Because I've already been researching Nishijin-ori

1510
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,530
Ah, "There's no area in Kyoto called Nishijin...

1511
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:56,630
That area is roughly called Nishijin."

1512
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:57,900
I learned all that already

1513
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,370
So you'll air it on Suiyō?

1514
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:00,370
Staff) Yeah

1515
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:02,800
After that? I'd want to do it then

1516
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,500
(Staff) After that

1517
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,710
Staff) No no no, but you can't

1518
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:10,710
If it there's no Suiyō, that show would be awful

1519
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,350
I see

1520
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,350
So then...

1521
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:16,690
So it's New York

1522
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:16,690
That's right, as obi show MCs

1523
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:19,350
We selected
New York

1524
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:22,190
After that...

1525
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:23,530
I really want to watch Obi Life now

1526
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:25,060
I hope they do it right

1527
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:25,060
I know, right?

1528
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,330
By the way,

1529
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,930
We've actually already filmed it

1530
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,330
Really?

1531
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,330
Wow!

1532
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:32,300
Great

1533
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:32,300
You have?

1534
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,670
But New York still...

1535
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:35,070
haven't had the prank revealed

1536
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:37,170
They don't

1537
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:37,170
They don't know we're involved?

1538
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:39,840
Only that they've been introduced to kimono obi

1539
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:42,210
And that they've recorded a strange program

1540
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,180
But of course, at some point

1541
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,180
we've got to tell them. So...

1542
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,650
Today, we've called them to the studio

1543
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,650
What do you mean?

1544
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,320
(Bakarhythm) Ah, like that

1545
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,230
(New York)

1546
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,230
Shimasa Kazuya

1547
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,230
Yashiki Hirosama

1548
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,060
(Yahagi) I see

1549
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:06,500
Yes, we brought them to TBS just like this

1550
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,500
Well, you'd have to

1551
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:10,370
Yes. Actually, 1 hour before recording this...

1552
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,240
1 hour before recording
Yoshimoto Kōgyō Tokyo HQ

1553
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:13,540
We captured New York
as they were finishing work

1554
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:15,410
Ah, this is so scary

1555
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,750
What? I'm scared already

1556
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:18,010
Where are we going? What is this?

1557
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:23,690
We don't even want them to know their destination is TBS, let alone what the program is...

1558
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:27,020
So we bring them to TBS without telling them anything

1559
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:29,020
So, then...

1560
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,560
OK

1561
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,560
Please take off your blindfolds

1562
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,330
Good morning

1563
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,330
Huh, so what is this?

1564
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:37,330
Good work

1565
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:37,330
Woah

1566
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:39,300
Huh? Ah... huh?

1567
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:41,300
This is "Suiyōbi no Downtown"

1568
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,300
Yes

1569
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,040
No, this...

1570
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,040
Yes

1571
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:44,670
doesn't make sense

1572
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,040
Is that so?

1573
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,040
Well, probably not

1574
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,810
Well it's not like...

1575
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,810
You were just going about your lives...

1576
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:51,810
we're going to do
anything to you here

1577
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,350
It's all already done

1578
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,880
We already did something?

1579
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,920
Finished?

1580
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,920
It's already finished

1581
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,520
Huh, what is it?

1582
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,520
Yes, really. Good work

1583
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,490
(Bakarhythm) Really, well done

1584
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,490
Does anything come to mind?

1585
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:05,790
(Shimasa) Finished it?

1586
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:05,790
Huh, what?

1587
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:10,370
Ah, that.
Could it be...

1588
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:13,500
The 9-hour on location shoot for "Love It!"

1589
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,070
(Shimasa) That...

1590
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,070
That was a prank

1591
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,540
Ah, it was. In Nikkō

1592
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,540
From the end of the live show until 11 at night

1593
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:20,840
Please don't think
that's something weird

1594
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,910
Yashiki-san, lately,
have you had any strange jobs?

1595
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:26,180
Right

1596
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:26,180
Yeah

1597
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:29,250
Yes, Yashiki-san?

1598
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:33,720
That light-night TBS show.
The one we recorded at night

1599
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,090
That!

1600
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,090
What was the program called?

1601
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:37,830
I forgot the name

1602
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:39,060
I forgot the name

1603
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:39,060
TBS

1604
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,030
That one was so so weird

1605
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,160
That's the question!

1606
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:44,700
(Shimasa) It was that, that one...

1607
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,700
That one!

1608
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,700
Yes! I've got it

1609
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:49,070
Shimasa-san?

1610
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:51,640
Wonderful Obi Life

1611
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:51,740
Correct! Very well done

1612
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:55,110
Was it that?
I get it now

1613
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,480
I thought I was going to die recording that

1614
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:00,580
Really? We still haven't seen it

1615
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,550
So we don't know

1616
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,550
So, that was...?

1617
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:06,050
That was entirely
a "Suiyōbi no Downtown" project

1618
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,390
That was close!

1619
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:11,390
So the project you two have done is this:

1620
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,230
Obi Show Real Prank

1621
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:16,630
Yikes

1622
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:20,100
Ah, but... yes... huh?

1623
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:20,100
Yes

1624
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,070
Do you get it now?

1625
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,070
So...

1626
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:24,070
That was a prank then?
It was so bad

1627
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:26,070
Ah, but the set...

1628
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:26,070
Yes?

1629
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,410
It was, it was. Totally

1630
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,410
was so fancy!

1631
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:32,380
And there were so many people in the staff

1632
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:32,380
Read it properly. Obi Show Prank

1633
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:34,150
What's "Real Prank" mean?

1634
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:35,180
The Real Prank is that "Wonderful Obi Life"

1635
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,520
Huh?

1636
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,520
really will be broadcast

1637
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,520
What do you mean?
I don't get it

1638
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,020
Well, because it's real

1639
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:46,860
Apart from New York, we also targeted Magical Lovely and Saraba Seishun no Hikari.

1640
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:49,530
But, even after learning it was about kimono→

1641
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:52,400
the ones most positive and willing to continue→

1642
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:52,400
That's right

1643
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,200
were New York so that's why
you were chosen as MCs

1644
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,740
So it's recorded, and
later, really...

1645
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:01,410
We will of course broadcast it

1646
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:04,080
Like an hour later

1647
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:04,080
When will it air?

1648
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,580
After this airs

1649
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,580
Huh, it's going to air on TV?

1650
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:22,600
A whole hour about kimono obi!
The first obi variety show in history

1651
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:24,770
Wonderful Obi Life

1652
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:34,740
Suiyōbi no Downtown

1653
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:09,380
After "news23"...

1654
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:09,380
After this show, there's "news23"

1655
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:12,050
It's really going to air?

1656
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:12,050
it's "New York's Wonderful Obi Life"

1657
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:14,090
Well, it is Real after all

1658
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:16,120
Ah, wait. Knowing it's a prank...

1659
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,160
Ah... but

1660
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,430
It's probably fine even if you don't broadcast it

1661
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,100
Matsumoto-san, what's great is that...

1662
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,770
This morning's TV guide had it as "TBA"

1663
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:28,700
Program TBA

1664
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,900
When this show airs...

1665
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,840
The digital guide will change to
'New York's Wonderful Obi Life'

1666
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,540
A whole hour about kimono obi!
The first obi variety show in history

1667
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:34,740
Wonderful Obi Life

1668
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,840
I see

1669
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,840
This is something...

1670
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:34,740
A whole hour about kimono obi!
The first obi variety show in history

1671
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:34,740
Totally unprecedented

1672
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:38,380
Because it'll say "New York's", right?

1673
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:38,380
Yes, "... Wonderful Obi Life"

1674
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,880
It was really bad

1675
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,880
That's not true at all

1676
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,850
How do you mean?
What was so bad?

1677
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:46,720
It's really too specialized, about obi

1678
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:46,720
Well, it's an obi show

1679
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,020
Really though

1680
01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:51,060
It's really not funny

1681
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:52,360
As a show

1682
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:52,360
Whoever doesn't watch this "Suiyōbi no Downtown"

1683
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:56,030
and only watches "Wonderful Obi Life"

1684
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:59,600
Will think New York are extremely boring

1685
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,540
No no... this is wrong

1686
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,870
No... that program...

1687
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,870
Oh no

1688
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:05,370
They're probably just being modest so...

1689
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:09,610
So we've prepared a compilation VTR

1690
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:09,610
To watch now?

1691
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:23,420
Sometime in December

1692
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:23,420
Wonderful Obi Life recording day

1693
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:23,390
On the day of recording 'Wonderful Obi Life'

1694
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:26,230
Excuse me. I'm looking
forward to working with you

1695
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:28,860
10:00 PM


MC meeting

1696
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:28,900
I'll be working on the floor as well

1697
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:28,900
Yes

1698
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:33,370
First, in preparation for the show,
the performers and staff

1699
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:36,770
Trick to make it seem fake



Of course, the floor staff are wearing kimono too

1700
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:36,140
have a kimono-filled meeting

1701
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,810
Staff) Regarding the "VTR Aa-ree!!"s

1702
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:43,080
Staff) I'd like for us to roughly sketch out where they'll go

1703
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:46,310
Staff) Later, when we get the chance

1704
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:48,720
Staff) We can do it when you check where you'll stand

1705
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,050
Alright then, we'll do that later

1706
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:59,490
10:30 PM


Rehearsal

1707
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:53,690
Then, right before the show

1708
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:57,430
They enter the studio
for the rehearsal

1709
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:01,360
Just a basic karate posture

1710
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:04,330
Staff) Yes, please stand like that

1711
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:06,570
Staff) It's alright if you sit during the VTRs

1712
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:06,570
Understood

1713
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:08,840
Staff) By the way, your position for the opening gag

1714
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,410
Staff) Could you look at the camera?

1715
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:13,940
Ah, now? Is that better? Sure

1716
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:19,910
You'll go there? When doing the gag

1717
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:20,380
Yeah

1718
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,220
Is here fine?

1719
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:22,380
Staff) Wherever's easiest

1720
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,550
I think it's better

1721
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:25,490
Staff) Hold on a second

1722
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:26,890
Sure

1723
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:26,890
Staff) For the size on camera

1724
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:29,620
It doesn't make sense to change it during the show

1725
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,930
Ah definitely

1726
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:31,660
If you look at the size of the shot

1727
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:32,930
(Staff) Will you move around a lot?

1728
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:33,930
That won't be funny later

1729
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,930
Actually I won't move at all. I'll do it all like this

1730
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,170
I'll do the show

1731
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:43,670
I'll just stay like this from now on

1732
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,670
Is it OK? We'll keep that one as a backup

1733
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,140
Instead let's do one that's definitely funny

1734
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:46,140
Ah

1735
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:48,610
Sorry if it's not funny

1736
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:49,880
(Staff) Not at all

1737
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:51,310
You're raising the bar too high

1738
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,850
Raising the bar too high?

1739
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:57,750
Then finally, the unprecedented obi show recording starts

1740
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:00,960
Serving as MCs for this noble program

1741
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:05,360
,We're too short for an obi but too long for a sleeve. It's New York!

1742
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,430
Welcome

1743
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:11,600
Yes

1744
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:11,600
I see

1745
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,170
Ah, oh...

1746
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,140
What an atmosphere

1747
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,940
It is

1748
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:20,110
We'd like you to brace your obi and yourself

1749
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:19,940
(Yashiki) Of course

1750
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:22,710
Everyone, please join us for the next hour

1751
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:23,380
Please join us

1752
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:26,380
With the filming proceeding smoothly...

1753
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:29,720
Japan's 3 Biggest "Obi" complete

1754
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:29,220
and the 1st
segment finished...

1755
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:32,890
They take a break

1756
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:33,050
Break time

1757
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:36,160
Guest

1758
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:36,160
Iwashita Hisafumi

1759
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:36,160
Did you do a lot of research before this? About obi

1760
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,030
No, not at all

1761
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,030
None

1762
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,490
I thought not

1763
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:43,830
I didn't know anything about the round obi

1764
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,270
At the moment, I don't think we're getting much usable footage

1765
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:53,210
Trick to make it seem fake



Lecture from Hako-chan during the break

1766
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,840
Really?

1767
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,180
(Iwashita) I'm just saying

1768
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:55,710
I'm not saying this for the sake of you two

1769
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:57,110
Huh?

1770
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:57,110
This affects me

1771
01:08:57,610 --> 01:09:00,980
I went to the trouble of coming here so late

1772
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,980
Nothing good is coming of this

1773
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:06,350
I'm just thinking "these guys aren't a big deal"

1774
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:08,060
I'm saying because it's bad for me

1775
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,190
This is a complaint

1776
01:09:09,690 --> 01:09:11,690
I'm sorry

1777
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:14,330
The others are thinking it too

1778
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,400
You're not sincere

1779
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:21,170
Staff) Sorry, we're about to start the second half

1780
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:23,700
Staff) Could you please make your way to the studio

1781
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:24,410
Thank you

1782
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:24,410
Thank you

1783
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,670
Just keep that in mind

1784
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:26,740
Thank you, yes

1785
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:26,740
Excuse us

1786
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:31,080
All the others are too important to speak to you

1787
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:33,580
So I'm going to be the hated one

1788
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:33,580
Thank you very much

1789
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:36,150
Staff) The second half is about to start

1790
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:41,760
After being put into a bad mood
by a puzzling lecture...

1791
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:46,590
The second half of filming starts

1792
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:48,430
Shimasa, how do you choose your obi?

1793
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,000
Ah, well, I've never chosen one

1794
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:54,040
You've never bought one?

1795
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,170
No, I haven't

1796
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:58,940
This is hell...

1797
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:02,180
Then...

1798
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:02,240
1:30 AM at night

1799
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:04,180
Have a wonderful obi life!

1800
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:07,050
Staff) Alright, that's OK. Thank you

1801
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:12,650
The recording of the fake-seeming but real program is complete

1802
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:17,930
And then, like this,
they record promotional messages

1803
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:24,530
To everyone watching King's Brunch, 'Wonderful Obi Life'

1804
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:26,170
Watch it!

1805
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:27,800
Simple!

1806
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:32,510
Staff) Alright, OK! We're done. Filming over

1807
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:37,680
The long-term
Obi Real Prank is complete

1808
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:41,650
Do you think it'll be okay? Like that

1809
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:44,520
It's strangely funny

1810
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,690
How will it look on air?

1811
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:46,690
I know, right?

1812
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:48,860
What about the next episode...

1813
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:52,130
There won't be one

1814
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,130
I think there won't be another

1815
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:55,830
We should watch it for sure, to see what it's like

1816
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,270
Yes, good work

1817
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:01,540
The staff didn't laugh at all

1818
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,370
Well it  wasn't very funny, was it?

1819
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:07,910
No no, what?

1820
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:07,910
What kind of jokes did you do?

1821
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:10,950
For the VTRs, it was like this

1822
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:14,320
Ah, isn't it the other way?

1823
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:15,750
Ah, it's backwards. This way

1824
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:19,420
This isn't good, this thing

1825
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:19,420
You spin against the obi

1826
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,960
The sponsors are watching

1827
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,960
You're winding it backwards

1828
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,430
That's it

1829
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,430
VTR

1830
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:26,930
Aa-ree!!

1831
01:11:29,230 --> 01:11:32,100
It's funny though

1832
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:32,470
(Bakarhythm) Not bad, not bad

1833
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:34,870
It's getting
more and more funny

1834
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:36,870
We did it maybe 3 times

1835
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:39,710
According to the staff, during recording

1836
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:42,210
there was a lot of going in circles

1837
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:44,980
Well, that's accurate. Seriously

1838
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:48,080
If an obi's going in circle's that's not good

1839
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:48,550
Right

1840
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:50,550
No, the staff were weird

1841
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:52,590
Now...

1842
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:53,190
Even Matsumoto-san's not funny

1843
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:54,560
Obi are unfunny

1844
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:58,890
If it's about obi it's unfunny

1845
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:15,440
New York's Wonderful Obi Life is after this from 12.26am

1846
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:15,440
Some areas excluded

1847
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:02,530
So, 'New York's Wonderful Obi Life'

1848
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:05,870
will air today, 1 hour after
this 'Suiyōbi no Downtown' ends

1849
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:09,540
From 12.26am
it really is a hour whole long

1850
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:12,540
It's really 1 hour?

1851
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:12,540
We're going to air it

1852
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:15,510
Please watch it

1853
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:15,510
Wow

1854
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:18,310
I think if it were like 30 minutes
I'd watch it but not an hour

1855
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:50,510

1856
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:20,650
I think it's really bad.
It really is bad

1857
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:22,650
I hate that atmosphere

1858
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:25,020
Well, there's that but also

1859
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:28,090
After this,
the three of us, me and New York

1860
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:30,060
are going to record a commentary track

1861
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:32,360
For 'Obi Life'?

1862
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,330
For 'Obi Life'

1863
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,330
I see

1864
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:37,700
We'll have no viewers left
if it's too awful

1865
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,370
So we'll watch Obi Life together
with Kawashima-san?

1866
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:42,370
The three of us, yes

1867
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:45,270
That's probably going to be the most painful
thing for us

1868
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:59,850
New York's

1869
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:59,850
Some areas excluded

1870
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:59,850
Starting 12.26am

1871
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:59,850
Wonderful
Obi
Life

1872
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,850
After this

1873
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:54,950
'Wonderful Obi Life'

1874
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:58,120
It's the Obi!

1875
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:58,920
Please watch it! Thank you!
