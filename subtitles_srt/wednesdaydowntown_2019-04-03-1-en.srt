00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,570
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,830
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,620
Harisenbon

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,170
In the past there was a verification

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,280
Will tsukkomi comedian's say "You're gonna sing it?"
-Yes

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,700
Situations were created to encourage them to say "you're gonna sing it?"

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,930
We verified it with 5 people

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,090
Only FUJIWARA's Fujimoto said it

9
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,620
Ah really?
-Is that so?

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,000
Mr. "You're gonna sing it?" Hamada...
-No, no, no...

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,550
I can't believe you didn't say anything.
-Well, I really wouldn't

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,300
That was a bit shocking
-It was really shocking

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,800
He's usually quick to attack
-No, no, no

14
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,850
This is it

15
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,910
Because of this, it is necessary to bet on the reputation of spiteful comedians

16
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,890
So, we bring a new spin on this

17
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,370
Like "you're gonna sing it?" tsukkomi comedians will retort regardless of the situation

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,190
I hope they'll do it
-Hopefully

19
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,940
Really hope

20
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,450
For the boke you can't really tsukkomi either

21
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,710
It's impossible

22
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,950
It's like trying to open your mouth with the sides shut

23
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,890
I can't do it

24
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,110
No, no, no...your analogy is too much

25
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,350
Awful, ~Deep kiss~

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,390
Aren't you resisting a bit too much?

27
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,750
Next, will they really say "you're gonna XXX?"

28
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,850
It'll be verified in different contexts

29
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,600
Also...

30
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,170
If you can't take it, get out

31
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,100
Discouragement contest for mild-mannered entertainers

32
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:12,740
Also, is it true that comedians regularly receive memorable and creepy fan letters

33
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:38,400
Like "you're gonna sing it?" tsukkomi comedians will retort regardless of the situation

34
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,550
In the previous "You're gonna sing it?" verification

35
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,210
You're gonna sing it!?

36
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,040
Fujimoto was the only one who reacted as expected

37
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
These were the results

38
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,290
Indeed

39
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:04,160
This time, we created 5 scenarios other than singing to conduct a similar verification

40
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,630
The first target is

41
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,450
Hashimoto

42
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,860
Last time

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,100
He failed to retort

44
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,700
What is the phrase he is expected to say this time?

45
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,720
"You're gonna eat it?"

46
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,000
The setting is a sushi restaurant

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,200
The person making the sushi will suddenly eat it after presenting it

48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,340
What will happen?

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,910
This happening in private would be pretty scary

50
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,210
How do you know about this place?

51
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,010
Feels so high-class

52
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,010
They first have some appetizers

53
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,050
Singapore seems like a hot place

54
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,620
Seems so

55
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,760
Is it okay to just wear sunscreen there?

56
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,980
Uh, yeah...

57
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,060
Are you still in touch with your previous girlfriend?

58
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,190
No contact at all

59
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,490
Don't you want to get in touch again or something like that? Could you?

60
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,960
Talking about career and love as if they were OLs, during the the middle of their conversation...

61
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,950
Finally, it's time for sushi!

62
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:25,770
Will Hashimoto say "you're gonna eat it?"

63
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,760
Hard to say

64
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,420
Here is the snapper
-Thank you

65
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,970
You'd be shocked, right?

66
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,380
The same as last time!

67
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,440
He couldn't tsukkomi

68
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,320
This is very difficult, its too surprising, right?

69
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,510
Here is the snapper
-Thank you

70
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,380
Here is the snapper
-Thank you

71
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,720
Taste test...

72
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,920
Is it because I'm a comedian that he's playing with me a bit?

73
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,050
Still doesn't understand the situation

74
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:15,920
As there was no immediate retort, it seems he's not aware its a prank

75
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,240
So, we continue to verify

76
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,710
Squid

77
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,210
A little frightened

78
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,610
Great! Great!

79
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,940
Start from squid, great!

80
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,680
I thought it was a trick. Scary

81
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,950
White shrimp

82
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,620
It's squid.
-And shrimp?

83
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,970
We let him eat two rounds to relax

84
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,460
Sashimi

85
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,460
Master...

86
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,800
What's going on?

87
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:07,140
After that, this occurs one in three rounds

88
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,550
Wait...

89
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,750
No, no, wait...

90
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,290
As a result, he's unable to say anything

91
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,630
So, we disclosed the truth

92
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,320
That's no good

93
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,700
Wait... that's enough

94
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,520
His face is red

95
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,800
Brain... his brain is sick, right?

96
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
What the hell?

97
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,570
Do you know what the program is?

98
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,880
The only one who would do such a thing is that show, right?

99
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,450
Something like "you're gonna sing it?"

100
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,180
Tsukkomi comedians will tsukkomi in any situation

101
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,320
This isn't normal

102
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,990
In this kind of high-end restaurant, no one would do it

103
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,120
Its too confusing for it to be taken away

104
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,660
But I thought maybe that was just his style

105
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,760
You wouldn't say "you're gonna sing it", but how about something similar?

106
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,770
In front of the camera and in ordinary daily life

107
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,340
It's a completely different story

108
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,440
I don't live my life like i'm constantly on Wednesday Downtown

109
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,900
So, acknowledging the comments made

110
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,670
Next we decide to conduct an on-camera verification

111
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,850
The next target is

112
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,320
Komoto

113
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,150
Although he is not the tsukkomi of his group

114
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,470
He often takes such a role on variety shows

115
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,680
The key word for this challenge is

116
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,900
"You're gonna kick it?"

117
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,220
In a fake soccer show

118
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:47,180
The referee will suddenly kick the ball

119
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,720
Will Komoto say "you're gonna kick it?"

120
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,200
Let's go everyone!

121
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,450
15 minutes into the game

122
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,510
Komoto is fouled

123
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,580
And has a chance to take a free kick

124
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,020
Clever setup

125
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,940
What a serious expression!

126
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,940
Not a comedian right now

127
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,940
Scatter a bit, you're too bunched together

128
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,760
So serious, feels as if he'll be angry

129
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,680
He is on camera after all

130
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,380
Doesn't understand

131
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,350
Couldn't say it

132
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,450
Who could?

133
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,960
Nice goal!

134
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,340
The truth is revealed

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,810
Why do you keep playing soccer like nothing happened?

136
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,540
Unbelievable things have happened!

137
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,440
Not stopping?

138
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,280
Hey, it's not right, it's not right

139
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,810
Thank you for your hard work

140
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,350
Thank you for your hard work

141
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,850
We wanted to see if you'd say "you're gonna kick it?"

142
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,720
Its not something to say in this situation

143
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,320
So, the next target is

144
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,750
Jinnai Tomonori

145
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,320
This one is reliable

146
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,870
What is the situation this time that will encourage him to say "you're gonna do it?"

147
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,660
Art Star Discovery Center

148
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,720
In this fabricated show

149
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,070
Hiking Walking is a guest

150
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,150
I will drink the coke and hold back my burps

151
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,020
While saying the station names of the Yamanote Line loop in one breath

152
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,630
In this setup

153
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:20,000
The female host will burp instead

154
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,960
It should be easy to say in this situation, right?

155
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,990
The result?

156
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,370
To say it to a woman though...

157
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,740
I mostly drink ten bottles a day

158
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,340
This one's gonna be funny

159
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,110
This gets laughs in the theatre

160
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,830
He'll say it, right?

161
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,550
He's not in "off" mode

162
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,440
Tokyo

163
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,680
Araracho

164
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,790
Shinbashi

165
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,890
You're gonna burp?

166
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,100
Awesome!

167
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,660
As expected of Jinnai

168
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,060
He did it

169
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,440
Shinbashi

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,370
You're gonna burp?

171
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,840
You're gonna burp?

172
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,370
What's going on?

173
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,170
Wait. Wait a minute. Hey?

174
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,380
You burped too, so sloppy!

175
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,050
What a slob. Who was it?

176
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,290
Here we reveal the truth

177
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,960
What a quick response!

178
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,920
Thank you for your hard work

179
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,440
As expected

180
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,150
Eh?

181
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,590
Thank you for your hard work

182
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,590
We wanted to see if you'd say "you're gonna burp?"

183
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,660
Oh, eh?

184
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,470
I didn't say it on purpose, it was a reflex

185
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,470
If this was real it'd be bad

186
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,130
I really said it by accident

187
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,440
So, the next target is

188
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,830
Toshikazu Miura

189
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:46,180
What is the situation this time that will encourage him to say "you're gonna do it?"

190
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,660
A flash mob marriage proposal

191
00:11:51,620 --> 00:12:00,300
This time there will be a flash mob of women sitting on chairs in this open square

192
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,940
The propsal will be made by

193
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,810
A seemingly unconnected person

194
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,860
So, the "surprise proposal" has begun

195
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,190
I'm Toshio

196
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,600
As you can see, the fake show is shot from the beginning

197
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,980
Then, on site

198
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,790
Music seems very appropriate

199
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,610
Without further ado, the flash mob starts

200
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,150
Ah, here we go

201
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,820
Not bad. Which one is the boyfriend? Not here yet?

202
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:05,960
At this point, Toshio is watching in the car

203
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,700
And the scene suddenly shifts at the end

204
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,460
He will witness the moment first hand

205
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,440
You still don't understand the situation, do you?

206
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,880
Hasn't figured it out yet

207
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,980
Thinking "what's this? It's great"

208
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,990
Oh, the number of people has increased

209
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,000
Where's the boyfriend? Hasn't made an appearance yet?

210
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,430
Such a long lead up

211
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,180
Then at this point

212
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,420
Boyfriend-type

213
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,760
Finally someone with the aura of an important person comes into view

214
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,870
So

215
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,420
Ah this one? Boyfriend? This is the guy, right?

216
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,160
Toshio is led correctly

217
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,800
So, the verification is setup perfectly

218
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,450
At the moment when the flash mob was approaching its climax

219
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,670
The scene comes to its conclusion

220
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,440
Why do I feel so nervous?

221
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,510
Hello

222
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,550
So embarrassing

223
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,080
Good afternoon

224
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,560
Must think it is the right person

225
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,800
The result?

226
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,110
Hmm?

227
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,300
Wait...

228
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,220
No...

229
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,820
Eh?

230
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,530
Couldn't say it

231
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,000
Eh...

232
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,530
I will make you happy all your life

233
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,970
Is it this one?

234
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,940
Please marry me

235
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,110
Ok

236
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,410
Eh? Is it supposed to be this guy?

237
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,610
Hang on

238
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,350
Hey hey hey

239
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,810
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

240
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,210
I'm so confused

241
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,480
Eh? Is he your boyfriend?

242
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,420
Yes, he is.
-He's your boyfriend?

243
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,220
It's you?

244
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,720
Eh...

245
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,330
Not you? No, no, wait

246
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,700
Hey!

247
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,300
Really?

248
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,300
Questioning him non-stop

249
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,170
Hooo—

250
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,840
No, it's not the time to make a scene

251
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,970
It's not the time to make a scene

252
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,110
No, no... this...

253
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,340
Congratulations to both of you!

254
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,140
I thought he was the boyfriend

255
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,880
I was watching him the whole time

256
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
It turned out to be you, right?

257
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,350
Although he made some comments

258
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,390
He didn't say "you're gonna do it?"

259
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,820
Difficult

260
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,050
So, we reveal the truth

261
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,160
Thank you for your hard work

262
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,780
Thank you for your hard work

263
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,570
So close. What happened?

264
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,670
This is Wednesday Downtown

265
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,440
Eh, really?

266
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,140
Wednesday Downtown?

267
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,070
Just this?

268
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,780
What is this... what is it?

269
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,310
Is it a test of some theory?
-Yes

270
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,250
If you're a tsukkomi, you'll say "you're gonna do it?"

271
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,950
Ah, a test of whether you'll do it or not

272
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,950
Whether you'll do it straight away

273
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,320
No, no, this is too...

274
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,790
The word "you!?" was stuck in my throat

275
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,790
But I wasn't sure whether it was ok or not...

276
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,580
Eh~

277
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,270
I want to do it again...

278
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,150
I really wanna hit them with it without thinking

279
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,070
"You're gonna do it?" like that

280
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:12,370
The last target is

281
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,850
Viking's Kotouge

282
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,900
The key word is

283
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,090
You're gonna jump?

284
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:28,170
When bungee jumping, after the countdown

285
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,930
The staff will jump instead

286
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,760
You'd think it was an accident

287
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,200
Really would

288
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,800
Hello, I'm Viking's Kotouge

289
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,070
What a beautiful day!

290
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,070
Recording on a sunny day

291
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,960
As you can see, a fake program was used to take Kotouge to Gunma Prefecture

292
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,270
To ensure he doesn't realize, we shoot him wandering outside for 1 hour

293
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,800
He's doing it very seriously

294
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,020
Tasty

295
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,520
Next is the famous thing in Minakami-cho, the bungee jump

296
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,920
Eh~

297
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
No no...

298
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,510
I don't want to! It's awful!

299
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,890
When you are young, you are not afraid of this sort of thing

300
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,800
As I get older, I get more and more afraid

301
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,130
Starting to get scared now

302
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,500
Since I became an old man i've become afraid

303
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,620
A very noticeable emotional plunge

304
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,630
We won't actually make Kotouge jump

305
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,500
But we still lead him to the 42m high bungee jumping platform

306
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,020
Whoooo

307
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,420
I can't do this, I can't jump!

308
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,620
So scary, I can't do this

309
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,890
It's a no go

310
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,820
Bungee is a no go

311
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,160
I really can't do this

312
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,590
This is really impossible

313
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,980
As Kotouge is gripped by fear

314
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,080
The final useless preparations are made

315
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,040
Can you stand up?

316
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,040
Oh wow this is really impossible

317
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,990
Ah so scary, oh, wow

318
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,970
So scary!

319
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,920
Finally, it's time to bungee jump

320
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,520
That... although I can

321
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,090
But this is the last time

322
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,020
Last bungee

323
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,690
Will Kotogue say "you're gonna jump?"

324
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,600
So, let's get started

325
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,100
Countdown

326
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:21,520
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3

327
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,850
Whoa!

328
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,840
You'd react like that

329
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,090
Simply not the time to comment

330
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:45,460
His reaction is the same as if he jumped down himself

331
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,350
This is more like an accident

332
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,780
Jumped yourself

333
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,620
Jumped yourself

334
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,750
Eventually, he commented

335
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,000
However, it's not "you're gonna jump?"

336
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,700
Its too abnormal

337
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,860
Jumped yourself

338
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,390
So, we revealed the truth

339
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Thank you for your hard work

340
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,630
Thank you for your hard work

341
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,870
Wed?

342
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,940
Wed?
-Correct

343
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,340
Wed?

344
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,510
It was Wed all along...

345
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,410
If you're a tsukkomi, you'd immediately say "you're gonna jump?"

346
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,250
No way no way

347
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,780
Absolutely no way

348
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,290
No way

349
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,850
Looks so happy

350
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,040
No, no, no, no

351
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,690
No way I can say "you're gonna jump?"

352
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,330
The fear is way too dominant

353
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,600
If I was in a more normal mental state

354
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,700
Maybe i'd say it

355
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,270
On this occasion i'm just engulfed by fear

356
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,540
It's impossible to say it

357
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,470
Now I know I don't have to jump

358
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,780
I'm super happy!

359
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,910
My voice has gotten louder too

360
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,700
In summary
It's hard to say

361
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:19,940
Unfortunately only one person did it

362
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,470
What do you think, would you be able to say it?

363
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,260
At the bungee place, no way

364
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,250
You'd think someone has just died

365
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:35,310
Only extreme people like Jinnai and Fujimoto would say it

366
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:39,520
Normal people wont, just these two abnormal ones

367
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:47,720
But out of all of them Jinnai's worse the most boring

368
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,720
That... please do not say that directly

369
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,850
Who could say such a thing?

370
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,580
If it was me i'd surely say it

371
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,430
Looking at each of those I kept thinking i'd say it

372
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,070
I keep thinking, "I'd say it if I were you!"

373
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,600
That is, all five? All of them?

374
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,770
I was thinking "Again I would've said it!"

375
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,230
I want to see it

376
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,540
Let's welcome the next presenter

377
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,810
Knights

378
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,220
I'm so sorry

379
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:23,820
What's going on?

380
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,820
A towel was thrown at me by Kobori

381
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,210
That's enough!

382
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,620
We haven't even gotten over that yet

383
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,900
So impactful

384
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,440
But also thanks to the program team

385
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,260
The number of customers at the Toyokan has increased.
-Is it true?

386
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,090
Yes, more young people are going

387
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,860
That's great.
-Great

388
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,680
It's improved the scene

389
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,280
A little bit of self-hatred can make the audience laugh

390
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,240
Awesome.
-But their relationship hasn't changed for the better?

391
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,790
The relationship is still bad, but there are laughs

392
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,860
Kyomaru and Kyouhei, who are very close to each other, aren't getting any laughs

393
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,890
Don't make jokes like that

394
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,050
We thank them for their appearance

395
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,810
This time we bring a theory about "lecturing"
-I'm scared

396
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:14,170
Have teachers and seniors at school ever said this to you?

397
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,410
"If you don't want to work then get out"

398
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,330
In fact, even if someone tells you to get lost

399
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,970
There's no way you'll actually walk away, right?

400
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,250
It's true that you wouldn't leave

401
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,420
"Get out" actually means "don't go"

402
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,820
That's true

403
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,620
So this time we bring the following theory

404
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,580
Will anyone ever follow the "get out" statement included in a lecture?

405
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,490
Got it
-That's what you'd think, right?

406
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,380
"Get lost", "get out of here" etc

407
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,370
And "Do you know why I am angry?"

408
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,770
Obon loves to say that

409
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,710
When it comes to screwing people over
-You're really almost done

410
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,570
No mention of a disbandment at all, but just angry

411
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,050
Is it going to be replayed again?

412
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,930
We are not here to replay it

413
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,650
We've brought a new theory

414
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,910
Will anyone ever follow the "get out" statement included in a lecture?

415
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:16,400
This time, we asked four artists who are kind and not angry types

416
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,250
Competition who can use the shortest time to force back the whole target

417
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,850
Lecture Elimination Contest

418
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,350
The first challenger is

419
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,630
Nana Suzuki

420
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,430
She's not the angry type

421
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,590
Good morning
-Good morning

422
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,120
Good morning

423
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,100
The junior about to be lectured is

424
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,360
What to drink, what to drink

425
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,480
Nishino Miki

426
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,070
I have a simple question

427
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,900
Very puzzled
-What's wrong?

428
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,310
After doing a number one in the toilet, do you wipe from the front or back

429
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,960
What is she talking about?

430
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,850
From the back.
-Yes, from the back

431
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,010
I am also from the back

432
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,480
Will anyone do it from the front?

433
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,350
I've called about 10 people and asked them

434
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:14,590
Nine people from the back, one from the front

435
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,490
It's hard to imagine that this is a lunchtime girls' gossip

436
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,030
In the midst of a heated conversation

437
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,780
It's finally time for Nana Suzuki, who has never been angry with her juniors, to lecture

438
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,380
But I think you are quite powerful, you're often on TV

439
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,480
Working hard

440
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,880
But actually not

441
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,180
I also often search myself online
-Really?

442
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,920
I search a lot

443
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,960
The search results for Nishino Miki are all "super similar to Suzuki Nana"

444
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,090
"Super similar" or something like that

445
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,430
It's starting to get a little scary

446
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,340
This really makes me stressed out

447
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,170
Ah, stress?

448
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,340
Body movements too

449
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,680
I hope you won't talk like that again

450
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,650
No way... you mean me?

451
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,230
She asks the other to change her persona

452
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,020
This far-fetched excuse is used to start the lecture

453
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,630
I often gesture a lot when I speak

454
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:28,930
It's what i'm known for

455
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,900
So I hope that when you are on TV in the future

456
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,970
Don't make hand gestures

457
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,370
So scary

458
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,810
It's scary to be told that

459
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,260
It's painful, isn't it?

460
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,750
Don't...

461
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,860
Nishino is hesitant to let her claim this privilege which is not a privilege

462
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,460
Next time you're on TV, don't make hand gestures

463
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,490
And don't let people say you look like Suzuki Nana. Can you do that?

464
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,910
Well...

465
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,970
Is there an answer for this?

466
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,420
It is very difficult

467
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,970
But... I don't do it purposely

468
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,740
If you don't understand what I mean you can leave now

469
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:15,810
That... I can't leave

470
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,810
Scary enough

471
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:19,180
But you don't understand me at all!
-No, I understand everything

472
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,550
Sitting still is also a bit difficult to do

473
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,680
At this point, the first "get out" is sent out a little early

474
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,190
Is she proficient

475
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,760
Seems like she's used to it

476
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,320
But the junior Nishino will not go so easily

477
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,000
If you don't understand, get out!

478
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,070
Get out now

479
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,810
How can I change it?

480
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,440
Feels like she has a lot of anger

481
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,570
I will try...

482
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,740
Just wear handcuffs on TV, isn't that good?

483
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,680
Wearing handcuffs on TV...

484
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,510
That way you can't make gestures

485
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,280
Hand gestures are not possible

486
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,330
Amazing

487
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,920
But then I won't get screentime

488
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,100
It's true that it can't be broadcast

489
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,650
I really did not mean to imitate you

490
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,560
Just unconsciously

491
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,590
No hand gestures now either

492
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,060
Ah, sorry

493
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,160
No hand gestures allowed

494
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,000
Yes

495
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,160
Now go or get handcuffed

496
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,900
Go or get handcuffed?

497
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:14,790
At this point, the ultimate choice of "leaving" or "handcuffs" is presented

498
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,070
Not moving at all

499
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,850
Staring blankly!

500
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,370
What to do?
-No, no, no

501
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,440
Go or handcuffs

502
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,440
Next, a silent showdown

503
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,690
She lasted so long

504
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,620
It's been five minutes

505
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,850
Super scary

506
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,090
Okay, I'll go

507
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,200
Seriously, go

508
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,970
Really, go now
-Ok

509
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,210
Wait, really?

510
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,640
Are you okay?

511
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,920
It's scary, right?

512
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,240
Get out of here!
-That...

513
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,840
Get out of here!

514
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:53,840
Awful!

515
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,170
Scary as hell!

516
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,010
Way too scary

517
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,120
It's really too scary, Nana-chan...
-It's awful

518
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,250
Get the hell out of here!

519
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,120
Get out of here!

520
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,360
So, Suzuki Nana ended at 6 minutes and 24 seconds

521
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,960
Here we revealed the truth

522
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,900
Poor thing

523
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,170
Why's she escaping?

524
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,800
What's up?

525
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,810
We're on the same side

526
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,720
Nishino, who hadn't fully understood the situation, returned to Suzuki's side

527
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,300
What's going on?

528
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,350
Really scared me.
-Why?

529
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,690
I thought i'd been cursed

530
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,280
Possessed by an evil spirit

531
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,790
It's fake, not real

532
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,660
I thought that if I left, we would never see each other again

533
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,500
Goodbye forever

534
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,800
So happy. Thank you

535
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,430
Great!

536
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,570
I'm really scared to death

537
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,060
Still afraid

538
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,130
Real feelings

539
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,220
The next target is

540
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,000
Viking's Nishimura

541
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,040
Confident?

542
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,970
How can I say it? I am a person who

543
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:10,690
First of all, I don't lecture juniors

544
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,890
Never get angry either

545
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,830
By the way, have you ever been told to "get out"?

546
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,560
I have before

547
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,360
When was it?

548
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,930
A manager gave me his card

549
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:28,040
When I was given it I said "ok, i'll pay with this"

550
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,580
Then I put four or five rounds on the card

551
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,280
The next day, after he found out, I was told to get out

552
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Did you really leave?
-I left

553
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,380
The kind of man who will walk away on demand

554
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:47,140
Can he get others to flee or not?

555
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,290
A public performance

556
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,500
can get 50,000 or 60,000 at that time.
-Great

557
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,600
But that's about it. It's only on occasion

558
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,400
Before King of Conte I got 40,000 at most

559
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,170
Ah, i've taken over then

560
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,990
They tentatively have a casual conversation

561
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:13,280
One pork hot pot, please

562
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,990
Is it for two people?
-Yes

563
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,150
Ok then

564
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:23,440
After the clerk leaves, the lecture begins

565
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,830
What did you order?

566
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,730
Ordered hot pot

567
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,740
Hot pot?

568
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,100
Hot pot?

569
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,140
Hot pot?

570
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,730
Is this ok?

571
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,710
Yes

572
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,260
No way, why would you be angry about this?

573
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,540
Hot pot?

574
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,550
Yes...

575
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,340
Clearly heard it at the time

576
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,880
How many servings?

577
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,120
For two

578
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,120
Are you looking down on me?

579
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,210
Why?

580
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,830
Too weird

581
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,420
With the Hot pot order as the first issue

582
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,860
Nishimura devises a fascinating setting

583
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,140
A taste minefield

584
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,430
You can't get it right!

585
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,100
This...

586
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,540
You should understand!

587
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,010
You just don't get it
-I'm sorry

588
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,280
It sucks

589
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,580
Enough, you can go for today

590
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,980
I'm sorry

591
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,950
Here the "get out" is launched

592
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,410
It's impossible, right?

593
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,620
Sorry

594
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,420
All right, just get out

595
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,290
Did you order hot pot?
-Yes, I did

596
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:34,660
Then get out of here.
-I'm sorry

597
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,230
It's too uninspiring

598
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,520
You have to eat alone if he leaves

599
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,400
Sorry

600
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,970
I think this is more balanced

601
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,240
What the hell is hot pot, you!

602
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,940
Sukiyaki is more like it

603
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,580
Why order hot pot?

604
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:53,580
It's impossible to order hot pot normally

605
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,650
Hot pot...sorry
-Get out

606
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:00,660
I'm sorry, I was wrong

607
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,590
Please don't make me go

608
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:06,160
No, you're really off the mark

609
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,860
It's obviously you, right?

610
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,400
This is the Achilles heel of comedians

611
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,670
What kind of hot pot did you order?

612
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,040
It should be Sukiyaki!

613
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,290
The correct answer is neither hot pot nor sukiyaki

614
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:22,800
But the off-the-mark Nishimura is at least interesting as a comedian

615
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,450
Even so

616
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,250
What are the vegetables in sukiyaki and hot pot?

617
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,620
First, Sukiyaki

618
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,590
Chrysanthemum
-Mmmm

619
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,390
Cabbage
-Mmm

620
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:38,400
Carrot
-Mmm

621
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,260
Konjaku
-Konjaku is not a vegetable

622
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,070
You should really get out of here

623
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:48,510
Why can't you read out the vegetables in sukiyaki?

624
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,770
There are many more

625
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:50,570
Onion

626
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,280
Uh-huh. Onions are perfect.
-Yes

627
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,250
You should really get out of here.
-Sorry, sorry

628
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,510
Sincerely get out!

629
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:01,320
You can't even tell me the ingredients of sukiyaki, you're not even close to being good enough.
-I'm sorry

630
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,920
Sukiyaki has much higher status than shabu-shabu
-Yes

631
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,460
I'll remember

632
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,090
Why don't you just get out?

633
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,000
Seriously, really need to get out of here.
-Okay

634
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,500
If you don't understand this...
-I'll go

635
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:20,570
What can I do?
-Sorry, this guy won't leave

636
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,170
Please get him out of here
-Shall I make him go away?

637
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,880
Please get him out of here

638
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,580
Sorry, I'll leave now

639
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,310
Miss, I'm sorry. It's okay

640
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,520
Miss, please take him out

641
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,720
Get him out of here

642
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,290
I'll go by myself. It's fine

643
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,560
You should really get out of here.
-I'm sorry. I get it

644
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,930
Get the hell out of here!
-I'm so sorry

645
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,250
Using the rough trick of getting the staff's help

646
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,720
Nishimura achieves success after 12 minutes 38 seconds

647
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,810
Don't cause others trouble!

648
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,660
The next challenger is

649
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:00,800
Panther's Ogata

650
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,040
The target is

651
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,770
Ah, it's Takashi

652
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,150
Just the two of us?

653
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,140
Trendy Angel's Takashi

654
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,530
As the presenter you should have done it yourselves

655
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,950
But after watching the VTR just now

656
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,050
For authenticity, Obon Kobon would be better

657
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,730
Get out!

658
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,880
Get out of here!
It's happened!

659
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:29,640
Next is Panther's Ogata

660
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,740
But

661
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,350
I've never met an Ogata fan

662
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,410
That's not right, there are some

663
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:41,650
Ogata fans don't exist, right?
-They do

664
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:45,850
He mistakenly chose a junior who is used to messing around

665
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,670
Making it difficult to start the lecture

666
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:56,030
However, after an hour, finally

667
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:05,740
My child. You held her when you came to my house

668
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,250
Didn't you feel her up?

669
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,160
So disgusting!

670
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,390
When holding her

671
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,800
That's disgusting

672
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,490
I just held her normally

673
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,960
So you did!

674
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,110
A bad vibe

675
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,270
Due to struggling to find a point to lecture on

676
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:28,410
Ogata becomes angry for no reason

677
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,180
Impressive

678
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:33,940
Your persona is that type

679
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,810
I hope you can pay attention to how you make contact

680
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,390
Not listening at all

681
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,010
But everyone would do it in this way
-They wouldn't!

682
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,750
Okay, okay, get out

683
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,220
I'll leave later

684
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,220
It's not a matter of a when

685
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,560
I told you to go now.
-In a bit

686
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,300
What? Are you t underestimating me? Sitting their vaping

687
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,100
I am now really angry

688
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,430
Sorry

689
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,670
Saying sorry but still smoking?

690
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,210
No smoking

691
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,680
You get out of here, I'm really in a bad mood

692
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,870
But after that

693
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,450
No drinking

694
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,860
You are completely ignoring me

695
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,260
I am 41 years old, how old are you?
How old are you?  -33

696
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,160
33 years old

697
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,130
You're not taking me seriously

698
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,230
No drinking

699
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,570
I'm 8 years older than you

700
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,070
But I was born earlier in the month
-That has nothing to do with anything, okay!?

701
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:48,180
The idiotic conversation went on like this for more than 15 minutes

702
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,680
And Takashi eventually stands up out of boredom

703
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,100
Bored

704
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,850
Sorry

705
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,450
Sorry for what? I can't forgive you

706
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,660
Get out of here now!

707
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,930
The final challenger is

708
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,870
DJ KOO

709
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,500
Today you'll be lecturing

710
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,170
Do you usually get angry?

711
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,340
I'm not very loud...loud... lou-

712
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,580
You already know the content, right?

713
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,580
Curry? The case of the curry department?

714
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,280
Do it properly!

715
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:32,450
The lecture is given at the Avex-Management Academy

716
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:36,170
To Hama, a junior who starred with KOO

717
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:41,030
Many new projects will be held in 2019

718
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,170
Special events

719
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:50,440
Have you written down a few of your ideas?

720
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,410
Is it written on paper?

721
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,310
Idea list

722
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,510
I didn't write it down
-Why? What happened?

723
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait a little bit!

724
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,620
Wait a second

725
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,190
You...
-Yes

726
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,690
If you don't want to do it, don't do it

727
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,530
Don't do it

728
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,560
You can leave today

729
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,470
Sorry, you can go now

730
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,760
A sudden increase in horsepower smoothly leads to the request

731
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,360
A perfect transition

732
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,760
Suddenly so scary

733
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,060
However

734
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:27,480
For example, what do you think about the curry scene in the future

735
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,510
Scene?

736
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:34,450
The scene of curry. Tell me about it from your point of view

737
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,190
Curry scene?
-The curry scene

738
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,660
Similar to the "music scene" and "hip-hop scene"

739
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,730
It's already very popular

740
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:49,070
The curry department should make the atmosphere hotter
-Yeah

741
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,840
What are you talking about?

742
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,040
Where did the momentum go?

743
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,090
The unaccustomed lecturing suddenly cools down

744
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,110
I often go to Shimokitazawa Curry Music Festival

745
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,220
Shimokitazawa Curry Music Festival...

746
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,490
Very popular now

747
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,720
Taking notes

748
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,220
More stores than in Jimbocho

749
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,560
There are more than one hundred

750
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:16,130
This is what I want you to write about

751
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:21,620
He's too focused on this meeting of the curry department

752
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,170
What do you mean "this"?

753
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:26,650
Seems to have completely forgotten the "get out" thing

754
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,640
Even more so than

755
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,440
Prepare for the start of the show 3-2-1

756
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,390
What is this?

757
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:42,020
To the point of being completely unintelligible

758
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,970
So, we revealed the truth at this point

759
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,130
Didn't say "get out" at all

760
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,630
KOO

761
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,970
Did you forget to say "get out"?

762
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,810
Ah, I see

763
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:10,120
In conclusion, the winner of the lecture contest is Nana Suzuki

764
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,610
What do you think?

765
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,130
The Suzuki Nana part is too shocking

766
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,220
A little too scary

767
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,130
Quite impressive

768
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:22,090
This kind of person being angry

769
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,160
They really emit a different kind of terror

770
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,900
It's really shocking

771
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:33,280
Is that an act? I can't help but feel that she's actually like that

772
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,810
Scary indeed

773
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,540
To sum up, the lecture in the...

774
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,470
That's pretty impressive. All kinds of things happened

775
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:50,000
Very scary stuff

776
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I also hope that Obon Kobon will continue to work hard

777
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,030
Get out of here!

778
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,570
Sorry, I can't get out

779
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,470
It's all over for you. Just go. It's over

780
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:14,210
Sorry, I can't go

781
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,970
So scary

782
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,290
What a horrible exit

783
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,450
That's it. Thank you all

784
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:33,860
Now is everybody's theories

785
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,630
Tonight's presenter is

786
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,460
Kenji Tamura

787
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:50,620
As stars, you must have all received letters from our fans, right?

788
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:54,320
Are there any letters that are particularly impressive?

789
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,250
What have you received Naomi?

790
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:58,650
A letter written about dating me

791
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,940
That we're in a relationship

792
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,830
Although long-distant, he made a lot of effort

793
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,630
Very daring

794
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:08,420
He would call me and say he was sorry and all that

795
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,100
He's delusional, right?

796
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:14,310
He was carrying out this series of activities by delusions of grandeur

797
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,180
And also say "I really want to see you"

798
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,690
"But we can't see each other because of Yoshimoto's rules."

799
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,060
So scary

800
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,250
It was like that

801
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,820
Have you received any strange things in the mail along with fan letters?

802
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,490
I once received a seemingly ordinary letter

803
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:29,260
It says "I'd like to be by your side to support you, but I can't."

804
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,790
"That's why I'm giving it this you as my stand-in"

805
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,400
Then sent a clay doll over

806
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,830
The thing that guards the dead

807
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,960
That should be placed around the deceased

808
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,430
I thought I was still alive and well

809
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,340
So, today I bring a theory about fan letters

810
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:48,690
Please take a look

811
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:54,420
Comedians receive memorable and creepy fan letters

812
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:55,750
I see

813
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,310
We just talked about a lot of creepy things just now

814
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,600
Do you have any experiences of this? Being in the idol industry

815
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,180
Because the firm checks everything in advance

816
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:07,730
If it contains strange things...

817
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:09,020
It will be checked in advance.
-Yes

818
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,640
For example, if an address is written on it, they'll cut it out

819
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,230
Or use markers to black it out, etc

820
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,820
So I haven't experienced this sort of thing

821
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:21,980
Ok, so this time we asked people from all walks of life

822
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:25,740
And the only one with the least stringent inspection system was that of comedians

823
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,740
They just get random gifts

824
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,880
They're delivered in the same way

825
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,830
They send anything to us

826
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,950
I also received a letter that was so thick that it was strange

827
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:41,390
Comedians receive memorable and creepy fan letters

828
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:44,090
Creepy fan letter ①

829
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,970
Cookie

830
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,870
You're the creepiest, right?

831
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,670
What impressed me the most was

832
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:54,740
About 3~4 years after debuting

833
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,540
There was a girl who was so short it was hilarious

834
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,230
So rude

835
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,080
She was a brunette with hair like a doll

836
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,550
The appearance was really like a Japanese doll

837
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,880
But with normal clothes on

838
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,320
The girl appeared suddenly

839
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,820
She often came to see my show

840
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,250
She had folded a thousand paper cranes

841
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,790
She handed me a thousand paper cranes with a red wabi-sabi design

842
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,260
Then he said to me, "Please take it"

843
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,330
I then received a thousand paper cranes

844
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,170
When I got home, I unfolded them

845
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,600
Restored the paper to its original state

846
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,970
On the reverse side of the pattern, in small letters, it read

847
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:32,780
"I hope you will like me", written all over it

848
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:37,810
A fan letter in the form of a thousand paper cranes

849
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:42,450
You know how some people can write characters on a grain of rice? It was like that

850
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,650
Must've used a super fine pen

851
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:47,290
Creepy fan letter ②

852
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,620
Kamaitachi's Yamauchi

853
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,000
I received a postcard

854
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,070
I was told that "I have a fan letter for you"

855
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:00,540
On the front, it said "To Kenji Yamauchi"

856
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:04,010
Then on the back, "I've been watching your show on TV"

857
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,180
"I support you from the bottom of my heart and look forward to hearing from you if I can."

858
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,280
"I'll be looking forward to hearing from you," it read

859
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,350
But the name on the front

860
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:20,560
"Kenji Yamauchi" was written on a separate piece of paper

861
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,990
I was curious about the extra bit of paper

862
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,060
So I carefully pulled it off

863
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,170
Underneath, it said "To Oguri Shun"

864
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,570
I thought, "Why'd you give up and compromise by sending it elsewhere?"

865
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,570
"This person is too determined to give up"

866
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,600
A letter from a determined fan

867
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:43,380
You'd think she'd at least rewrite it for me

868
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:46,790
Creepy fan letter ③

869
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,440
Viking's Kotouge

870
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,490
Sent by a man?

871
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,620
Well, it was sent by a male fan

872
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:56,690
He would wait for us at the exit after each performance

873
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:00,130
The fan letter was written on about 7 sheets of letterheaded paper

874
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,900
"Kotouge's comedy is the source of my life and vitality"

875
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:09,270
The "Hearing your lines is like being caressed by lightning all over your body" kind of thing

876
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:10,810
Used language like a novel

877
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:15,280
Then with another 3 sheets of paper

878
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,410
"I can't believe I just wrote 7 sheets."

879
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,470
He wrote an apology letter

880
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,070
Which was also included and sent in

881
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:27,890
He came to every show for about 4~5 years

882
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,150
An emotional and apologetic fan letter

883
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,330
He works in an eel shop

884
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:37,330
How do you know that?

885
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:41,650
At the end of the letter, he wrote the address and phone number of an eel shop

886
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,210
And his own cell phone number, email address and LINE ID

887
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,540
He was desperately trying to convey his personal information to me

888
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,110
Then once, on a day off

889
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,320
I thought I'd go to this eel store

890
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:59,790
It took about three and a half hours to drive there

891
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,490
It was already late afternoon when I reached it

892
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,860
I went in and found that this guy was not in because he had gone to dinner

893
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,470
Then about a month later there was a show again

894
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:13,970
I got another letter

895
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:18,070
After reading it, I found there was a letter and something else

896
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,010
He put his work schedule in there

897
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:23,510
Why do I have to work around your schedule!?

898
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:28,050
Rest days other than the regular Monday holidays

899
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:30,090
Every time since then, the duty roster of that eel store has been put in the letter as a matter of course

900
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,010
Creepy fan letter ④

901
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,460
Hiroshi

902
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:37,130
A house schematic

903
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:40,000
A layout of 2LDK was placed inside

904
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:41,400
※LDK indicates the layout of the house "L" stands for living room "D" stands for dining room "K" stands for kitchen 2LDK means two rooms and one bathroom

905
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,500
A letter was in there, too, and it said

906
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,830
"I rented this house to live in with Hiroshi"

907
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,300
"I've already arranged a guarantor"

908
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,370
Their signature and seal was on it too

909
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,480
Then it said "All that's left is Hiroshi's signature and seal"

910
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,910
I haven't even met her

911
00:48:56,110 --> 00:49:00,880
A fan letter describing having taken the liberty of finding a home for the both of them

912
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:00,170
This is very similar to Naomi's

913
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,590
And it also said "Please pay the rent every month"

914
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,510
Creepy fan letter ⑤

915
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,440
Audrey's Kasuga

916
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:14,800
How can I put it? What I always see is

917
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:21,300
"I will visit you at a certain time on a certain day in a certain month, please wait for me at that time."

918
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,200
His address was leaked

919
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,440
I also get these fan letters that want to control my schedule

920
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:29,280
I also received a lot of fan mail directly at my home

921
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,750
Don't you get scared when this happens?

922
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,950
Usually'd be scared

923
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,040
But they're kind enough to warn me in advance

924
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,250
I see

925
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,860
But once there was no warning at all and I came home to find someone waiting for me

926
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,100
For Kasuga whose address was public

927
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,820
How long have you been living here?

928
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,930
Not only fan letters, but also gifts were also sent to his home

929
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,570
When I had a cold

930
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:55,600
I had a lot of things piled up in front of my house, condolences and so on

931
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,310
It made me feel like I was dying

932
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:00,310
I felt like "i'm not dead yet!"

933
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:03,580
Bouquet of flowers, drinks, and so on

934
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:07,020
In the middle of that was a refrigerated box

935
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,250
I thought "what is this?" and opened it

936
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:11,290
There was some porridge inside

937
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:16,230
A refrigerator full of porridge

938
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,340
That's awful

939
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,690
And

940
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,600
Another thing was placed in front of my house

941
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:26,000
Like a garbage bag, something big

942
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:29,770
I thought "it's another prank or something"

943
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:34,480
I grabbed the garbage bag and tried to remove it

944
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,580
Then a hand suddenly grabbed me from below

945
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,120
Inside the garbage bag...

946
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:42,840
There was a woman

947
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,890
A woman?

948
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:49,860
A surprise appearance from a garbage bag

949
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:53,730
I tried not to react too strongly

950
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:56,200
I said "can you get out of the way?"

951
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,040
The person said "ok, ok fine" etc

952
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,970
She probably thought i'd be a little more exaggerated

953
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,920
Creepy fan letter ⑥

954
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,150
Nonstyle's Inoue

955
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,350
There was a letter full of how much the person liked me

956
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,040
This dumb guy

957
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:19,590
Then she said, "The students in my class don't know what's good about Inoue."

958
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:24,660
"That's why I'm always talking about Inoue during break time or after school."

959
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:31,000
"I desperately explained to the entire class, including the teacher" something like that

960
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,470
Then I suddenly saw the next page which read

961
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:38,540
"After doing so, I was gradually bullied by everyone."

962
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:43,610
Fan letter expressing bullying

963
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:40,760
Poor thing

964
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:46,420
Creepy fan letter (7)

965
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,590
Higashibukuro

966
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:55,560
I had a scandal in the second half of 2013

967
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,990
Fans were almost reduced to 0

968
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,800
Basically just one person waiting for me at the exit during that time

969
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:02,900
She gave me a letter

970
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,800
But after reading it

971
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:07,260
"Even with a scandal like that, I have a way to redeem you."

972
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,870
Wrote something like

973
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:15,540
"Ask someone for guidance, and your past will be cleansed."

974
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:19,310
"The only way to purify all this is to enter this religion."

975
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:22,280
And then they were persistently trying to persuade me to join the church

976
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:25,650
What did she look like?

977
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,630
Really short and with a doll's haircut

978
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,630
Fan letter to strongly persuade others using mind tricks

979
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,600
Is it the same person as the previous one?

980
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,070
This picture is reused

981
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:37,600
Creepy fan letter ⑧

982
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:36,550
Really?

983
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,000
No way

984
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,900
Ungirls' Tanaka

985
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:45,740
I said something like I have 100 million in savings on a TV show

986
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:49,040
Got fan letters like "Can you lend me 2 million"

987
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:53,980
Fan letter with Tanaka's cash in mind

988
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,850
What were they going to do with the 2 million?

989
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,550
It seems like a lot has happened

990
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:03,760
"I have 2 million in debts"

991
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:08,830
"I cant live and pay the interest"

992
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,870
So I need to pay back 2 million first

993
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:15,340
I want to pay all the debts together

994
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,240
Ten it said, "I will belong to Tanaka"

995
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:20,580
Three letters have been sent from the same person

996
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:24,150
The third letter had the repayment plan written on it

997
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,780
40,000 per month

998
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,290
It'd take a little over 5 years to pay back the money

999
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,190
If they paid back 40,000 a month

1000
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,120
They also wanted an extra 10,000 for themselves

1001
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,260
Said it should be possible with your salary

1002
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,260
Said they wanted to go to various places to play

1003
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,760
Want to learn English conversation

1004
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,000
You should forget English conversation for the moment

1005
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,840
Shouldn't the extra 10,000 be returned to me as well?

1006
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,870
Should pay me back 50,000 a month

1007
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:55,880
Surely too naive

1008
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:57,780
Finally

1009
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,180
Creepy fan letter ⑨

1010
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,860
Egashira 2:50

1011
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,330
20 years ago in the first month I checked the mailbox in front of my house

1012
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:14,630
Inside was a New Year's card

1013
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,130
Then I looked at the reverse side

1014
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,870
It read "Happy New Year"

1015
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,870
It was written in pubic hair!

1016
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:25,840
New Year's greeting card with a pubic hair

1017
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:30,080
If it was a woman it'd be okay but it was a man so I feel super disgusted

1018
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:33,930
In summary
That's about the extent of what can be said on TV

1019
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,880
What is this?

1020
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,550
What do you mean it's okay if it was a woman?

1021
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:37,590
Why?

1022
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,610
But there are really ones that want to borrow money

1023
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,510
The private messages on the social media have a bunch of these

1024
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:45,150
Want to borrow money from you?

1025
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:45,970
Loads!

1026
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:48,180
You also get them?

1027
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:48,810
Yes

1028
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,110
Not really anymore

1029
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,210
But there used to be from time to time

1030
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,500
I did lend some

1031
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:55,430
It's a lie, right?

1032
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:59,380
Don't start!

1033
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,210
Because of the silence so you must be lying

1034
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,970
So obvious

1035
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:34,910
