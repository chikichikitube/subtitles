1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:10,820
Mom got taken away!

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,460
Day off

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,460

Translated by: Otviss

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,700
Hey, what the hell are we actually doing today?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,700
No no no...

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,330
He said it!

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,030
Because it's getting a little warmer now

10
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,030
Yeah

11
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,540
Oh..

12
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,540
We are going to go to

13
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,570
How many stations are there again?

14
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,570
all of the Osaka circle line stations in this series

15
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,340
Beyond 10 stations by now?

16
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,340
Shouldn't it be

17
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,340
So it's 10 stops now huh?

18
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,340
Yes

19
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,210
Most of the major routes

20
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,210
Yeah it links to

21
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,350
So, this time it's..

22
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,080
Nishikujo

23
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,080
This again..

24
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,490
I know about kujo though,

25
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,490
cause I used to live there

26
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,020
So it's next to that?

27
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,020
Yes, right next to it

28
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,820
I wonder how it is now though

29
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,800
Nishikujo is pretty much

30
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,800
in between Hanshin and JR so,

31
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,430
there are plenty of stuff under the elevated rail

32
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,300
I really do like areas under elevated rail

33
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,300
So let's enjoy ourselves

34
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,670
It's only 3 stops from Osaka station

35
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,670
so It's still within the central city area

36
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,140
And after US(Universal studios) also set up there

37
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,140
It has changed a lot

38
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,880
Oh really?

39
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,880
The entrance is right there so..

40
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,480
So how about we just go there?

41
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,150
Haha no no..

42
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,150
I wanna go!

43
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,150
US doesn't count as within the circle line so

44
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,050
Why is this show

45
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,050
so interested in like

46
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,390
all the freaking time?

47
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,390
taking us to remote areas

48
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,260
Hahaha!

49
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,260
Nishikujo is not a remote area though!

50
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,330
It's not a remote area..

51
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,330
We are never ever taken to places like

52
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,030
Universal studios or the Abeno Harukas

53
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,200
Do you want to go there?

54
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,200
I do!

55
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,840
Heck, if you say that, let's go then...

56
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,500
Jet coaster though right?

57
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,500
You wouldn't go on

58
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,540
Ah, the one at Universal studios?

59
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,540
Yes

60
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,080
What the hell is that?

61
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,080
What would you think about back drops?

62
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,980
A thing that goes backwards

63
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,980
Why the hell would you want us to do something like that

64
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,080
We debuted to go forward

65
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,080
not backwards

66
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,220
Yeah we've always been going forward!

67
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,990
Calm down you guys...

68
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,990
You're too vigorous!

69
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,360
So this time they

70
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,360
aren't gonna cut us off at

71
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,530
10.000 yen again right?

72
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,530
Actually, this time

73
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,330
Let's set that limit then

74
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,330
the prices are kind of cheap so

75
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,170
Shall we?

76
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,170
Yes, let's

77
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,240
10.000 Yen!

78
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,240
Limit at:

79
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,240
Matsumoto family budget

80
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,240
m -89 -43 l 38 -43 l 38 -43 l 38 28 l 38 28 l -89 28

81
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,400
Oh, and since there

82
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,400
Okay, lets go then!

83
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,640
Are so many

84
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,640
little shops lined up this time

85
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,070
We gotta be self-disciplined

86
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,070
and look for like...

87
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,880
Huh?

88
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,880
Shops with originality

89
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,810
Well there are

90
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,810
plenty of shops competing

91
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,750
What you on about?

92
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,750
to stand out

93
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,820
Moody geezers around...

94
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,820
There's gonna be lots of

95
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,950
Let's look for some good grub shall we not!?

96
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,950
Well, despite that

97
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,390
He's kind annoying now

98
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,390
This is,

99
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,060
Kind of pissing me off yeah

100
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,630
Thanks!

101
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,630
This is the map we prepared

102
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,000
This is the so called "Gourmet town"

103
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,000
under the elevated rail in Nishikujo

104
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,370
Exactly

105
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,370
Hmm, There's a tunnel alley it seems

106
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,770
Hmm..

107
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,770
You can't talk about Nishikujo,

108
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,440
without mentioning the keyword "Gourmet"

109
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,180
Everytime we do these things

110
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,180
Gourmet huh?

111
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,850
there's always a way to tell

112
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,510
of the places we go to

113
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,510
the local speciality

114
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,950
So if we use this "Gourmet" keyword

115
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,950
but this time it's not so evident.

116
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,650
Yeah

117
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,650
what exactly would that mean

118
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,750
What in the world is "Harami 9" right?

119
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,750
Wow...

120
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,460
It's definitely Harami(skirt steak) but

121
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,130
Skirt steak...

122
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,130
like what do they do with the

123
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,360
That's why, I want you to

124
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,360
look at this map and

125
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,800
Clam grab grilling...

126
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,800
solve the mystery

127
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,300
I want to try that!

128
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,300
It makes you wanna try it right?

129
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,040
Just in what way will

130
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,040
they prepare it for you?

131
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,740
The clams that you take...

132
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,740
Yeah but the clams,

133
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,110
This is seriously messed up but

134
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,110
When I hear "clam grab grilling"

135
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,910
I imagine they grill the clams

136
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,910
while you're still holding them in your hand

137
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,150
Hey, is that gonna happen?

138
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,150
You guys be careful alright?

139
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,320
Are they gonna grill them in my hand?

140
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,320
You sure are taking it literally

141
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,990
They are definitely not...

142
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,820
Let's go find out if

143
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,820
actually grill them in your hand

144
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,090
That's what it's all about today

145
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,660
If they grill it or not... what the?

146
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,270
Why are you staring at me for?

147
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,000
I kinda felt you bombed with that joke

148
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,670
Listen, Udon..

149
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,670
Udon no Hentai(Obsession)!

150
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,380
What is... Right?

151
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,240
I wonder what that means?

152
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,240
Udon no Hentai (Pervert)

153
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,580
Does that mean they are gonna

154
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,580
do rope bondage with the udon noodles?

155
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,420
Wow, that's harsh

156
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,090
It's no good if we don't stop filming

157
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,090
We definitely have to cut it there..

158
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,760
Hahaha..

159
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,760
Those would give a lot of strength for sure!

160
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,220
We're not..

161
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,220
Yeah? What is that..

162
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,460
You definitely do

163
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,460
You get curious

164
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,300
Here's one that's ridiculous

165
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,300
Which one?

166
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,360
"Great taste, Great entertainment? - A brothers bar"

167
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,630
Great entertainment...

168
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,630
That's just too exhausting

169
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,540
It's probably a

170
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,540
Store the Nakagawa brothers have been to

171
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,340
The Nakagawa brothers...

172
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,340
You got it

173
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,010
Those dudes

174
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,010
are in Yoshimoto you know

175
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,710
I wonder what that means.

176
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,380
I guess

177
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,380
we're going to find out right?

178
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,850
9:1 dream rice bowl

179
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,850
What the?

180
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,020
What is 9:1 right?

181
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,950
"Magic flour, Hachimi?"

182
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,950
Huh?

183
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,960
Not ichimi, not shichimi, but hachimi huh?

184
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,360
Firstly, which one are we starting with?

185
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,360
Hmm..

186
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,260
Ah, what about the clams?

187
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,260
We going there?

188
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,260
The ones you grab and get grilled?

189
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,260
Yeah the clams are kind of...

190
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,300
And get grilled? Yeah, we don't

191
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,300
know if they're gonna grill 'em like that yet though

192
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,200
I love clams

193
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,200
We don't know that

194
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,070
Ah, its probably like you get to

195
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,070
grab them yourselves right?

196
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,210
Yeah maybe, cause I'm imagining

197
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,210
they grill only the ones...

198
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,280
You manage to grab,

199
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,280
am I right?

200
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,080
Oh! So how bout we make a game

201
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,080
out of the one who

202
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,150
WOULDN'T THAT BE INTERESTING!?

203
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,150
manages to grab the most.

204
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,960
Come on, I was just saying!

205
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,960
I wanna see the face

206
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,130
I'm not failing!

207
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,130
of a failing comedian

208
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,370
I'm not messing around!

209
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,240
Alright, got it

210
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,900
Let's go!

211
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,080
We're going to Nishikujo!

212
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,480
We've arrived!

213
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,480
Well then, we're here in Nishikujo

214
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,290
Couldn't we pick a place

215
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,290
It's kind of amazing

216
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,350
with a bit more sun?

217
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,560
It's cold

218
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,490
It's shining in the completely wrong place

219
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,160
Look up there please

220
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,130
There's the elevated JR(Japanese railway)

221
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,070
And then Hanshin(Electric rail) as well

222
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,070
Oh! I see I see..

223
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,830
That's how it is yeah

224
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,900
Exactly

225
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,900
It's really convenient

226
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,240
Seems like a very nice and convenient station

227
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,240
You said it.

228
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,510
I see

229
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,510
Namba is in walking distance as well

230
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,910
It's kind of nice isn't it?

231
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,910
Nishikujo is freaking nice

232
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,250
I wonder why we

233
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,250
haven't been here before huh?

234
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,580
It's because of the circle line..

235
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,580
Well..

236
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,620
Hahaha..

237
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,320
We didn't know about any weird

238
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,320
planning like that. Since when?

239
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,230
I've said it so many times now

240
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,230
Yes but for how long has

241
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,830
Constantly!

242
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,830
has the camera been rolling though?

243
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,830
Huh!?

244
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,830
Yes, constantly!

245
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,100
I didn't know about that

246
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,100
They've always been on!?

247
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
The two camera men.

248
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
They were here weren't they?

249
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,000
They've been here all the time.

250
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,000
Wow you're right!

251
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,040
I'm a big fan of these guys now

252
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,040
They were here from the start

253
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,710
Hahaha!

254
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,710
Why would they film a fan?

255
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,280
Let's get going then!

256
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,280
to the clam grab grill!

257
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,050
Grabbing some clams...

258
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,050
I'm really hungry

259
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,990
It's here?

260
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,990
It's in the under rail passage

261
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,320
Kenji, I'm freaking hungry

262
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,320
The clam grab grilling

263
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,760
There's also the Udon transformation place

264
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,760
Yeah, if that name gave us so good vibes

265
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,960
from there, no?

266
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,960
maybe we should start

267
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,800
"Gold town"!

268
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,800
Wow, the entrance is really cool!

269
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,040
This is cool!

270
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,040
Woah!

271
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,250
Nishikujo parlor

272
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,250
This is good!

273
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,450
This is really... Oh wow, what's this?

274
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,250
If we find a good place

275
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,250
along the way let's go there

276
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,090
Sure thing

277
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,090
Why is..

278
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,830
Hm?

279
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,830
Is this really the right way?

280
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,200
Must be here. There's no other path

281
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,200
This isn't a dead end?

282
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,330
Wow...

283
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,270
Oh, we're out again!

284
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,270
What the hell's the matter with you

285
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,000
But...

286
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,000
Ugh..

287
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,970
But..

288
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,970
Clams, where ya at!?

289
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,580
No the.. It's...

290
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,580
This is all there is

291
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,850
This is all there is, ya know

292
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,850
You're right..

293
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,520
It's definitely on the outside

294
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,520
Maybe this way, huh?

295
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,390
This place is certainly...

296
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,960
Interesting

297
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,960
Yeah, it's nice

298
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,560
Sure is

299
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,560
Wow, they're already drinking

300
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,030
From lunch time

301
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,030
They are drinking like crazy

302
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,960
There are gramps who drink during

303
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,960
lunch time for sure

304
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,030
Kenji, I said I was hungry

305
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,440
Knight Scoop!

306
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,440
Look, It's the bicycle from

307
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,240
Ah.

308
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,340
Haha, you got it instantly.

309
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,340
The one at the back right?

310
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:01,210
Why is that always there by the way?

311
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,210
It's a part of the set

312
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,850
It's constantly there though

313
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,850
Yeah it is.. and uhm

314
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,850
a horse too

315
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,850
and a horse yeah

316
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,850
Oh, here's another one!

317
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,860
Perhaps it's here?

318
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,860
There are tons of 'em!

319
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,430
Look, Hormon!

320
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,230
"Yamato charcoal grilled hormon"

321
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,230
I guess that sounds good

322
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,100
However, the shop

323
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,100
Kenji mentioned...

324
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,130
ADD TEXT ( DONE)

325
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,170
Uh, There's a monster!

326
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,170
Huh? A monster?

327
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,740
Oh crap!

328
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,740
Wait, are we okay?

329
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,540
No no no I don't want too, it's scary!

330
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,540
Oh come on, we're fine

331
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,210
Flip it over it for me!

332
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,210
Flip it over,

333
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,780
Hahaha..

334
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,780
It's just a normal frog you guys

335
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,180
The frog is standing on two legs!

336
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,180
What the? This is so off-putting

337
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,350
Ah, look here!

338
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,350
It's cause there's a frog shop here

339
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,220
Ah, that's why

340
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,220
What the hell is that anyway, Frog shop

341
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,490
Didn't know there were shops like that

342
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,490
My gosh, this is so creepy

343
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,500
Huh? What?

344
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,500
Odds and ends shop

345
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,100
No that's not...

346
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,300
Huh?

347
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,310
Mommy!

348
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,510
Mom!

349
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,510
Mommy!

350
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,180
Hey, Mom!

351
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,180
Mommy!

352
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,120
He's being kidnapped!

353
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,120
Mom's being kidnapped!

354
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,420
Hey, Mommy!

355
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,420
This is bad, this is bad!

356
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,220
Here please..

357
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,220
Mom is being taken away

358
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,830
Mommy, stop! This is not good at all!

359
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,630
Ah!!

360
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,630
Huh!?

361
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,100
But, he's kidnapped..

362
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,100
Oh wow, Tamura Kenji! ♥

363
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,170
No no no, this is our mom!

364
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,170
They kidnapped my mommy!

365
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,410
They took my mom away...

366
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,750
It's locked!

367
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,750
What's this all about?

368
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,910
Eh!?

369
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,390
Oh no...

370
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,390
Tamura Kenji decided to join us, everyone!

371
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,660
Mom, what are you doing?

372
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,660
What the hell?

373
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,230
Finally, we took them here

374
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,230
Mommy....

375
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,830
Mommy, what's all this?

376
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,830
We brought them, everyone

377
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,730
What are you doing?

378
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,430
I don't know a bloody thing

379
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,430
What's going on here?

380
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,900
What's this all about?

381
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,900
Wow, I'm so happy!

382
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,410
It's karaoke!

383
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,410
There are snacks even..

384
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,510
Hm? Did you say something?

385
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:10,550
♬After so many times, so many times

386
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,150
Please, we apologize but...

387
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,590
I have no idea what's going on

388
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,590
This situation...

389
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,690
Wait, you mean mine?

390
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,920
She's really good

391
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,920
Who's song is this?

392
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,830
Sorry but, I just heard my

393
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,830
father comes here often.

394
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,930
Hahahahahaha!!

395
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,730
I apologize

396
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,730
Woah, this surprised me!

397
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,100
Huh?

398
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,100
Is this for real?

399
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,740
Thank you so much for coming. Thank you!

400
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,740
That really surprised me

401
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,180
Don't worry, I'm under your care,

402
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,180
I'll try to behave.

403
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,050
I'll behave

404
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,050

You're so cool ♥

407
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,090
I also just found out, This is my

408
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:48,690
Son's friend's grandmother.

409
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,260
The world really is small!

410
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,330
What is this place, I'm at loss for words.

411
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,730
"Karaoke snack" right?

412
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,730
"Karaoke snack"

413
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,930
Please sing a song!

414
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,470
Please sing once, one song only

415
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,470
Please..

416
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,500
Otherwise we're not getting outta here

417
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,500
That's messed up, It feels too weird

418
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,070
Just one song please!

419
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,070
We just started filming...

420
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,980
We'll start with one song..

421
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,980
We'll start with one? No this...

422
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:15,580
1 Song!

423
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:15,580

A representation of his dad!

427
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,150
He's gonna sing to represent his dad

428
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,050
To represent

429
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,050
my Dad?

430
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,850
I can't figure out who works here and who are customers...

431
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,450
The two over there are the owners

432
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,490
Wow I can't believe it..

433
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,430

434
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,200

438
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,670

Thanks everyone

442
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,370
We have to go now

443
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,970
Let's get going

444
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,970
Sorry for intruding

445
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,840
Thanks for having us.

446
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,840
This was truly remarkable,

447
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,470
Please take care of my dad

448
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,470
next time he's here

449
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,170
Thank you for coming!

450
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,170
Thank you.

451
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,740
Sorry for intruding like this..

452
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,740
Thank you very much

453
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,410
Thank you

454
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,410
That was just...

455
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,480
That was shocking

456
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,580
Absolutely amazing..

457
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,580
What in the world just happened

458
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,220
That was seriously scary

459
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,550
the moment I came through that curtain

460
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,550
My heart was racing from

461
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,720
Yeah that curtain was scary for sure

462
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,460
I guess kidnapping is a real thing

463
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,060
I guess that was some real customer service, huh

464
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,530
That really surprised me, I'm

465
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,530
disoriented once again

466
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,930
Did we walk too far?

467
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,930
Huh? I'm telling you is this way

468
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,510
Clam grab grilling...

469
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,510
Well you could say,

470
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,280
I was already grabbed and

471
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,280
ready for more

472
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,940
But ya didn't get grilled

473
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,980
But it was close, It felt like we

474
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,980
were all being grilled in there

475
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,480
Are we really going back here?

476
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,480
Yeah, I guess here..

477
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,090
Alright, going back then..

478
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,620
We haven't found a single shop yet

479
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,530
Ah, but this is kinda...

480
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,530
Look at the sign over there

481
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,100
"Number 18 OK Road"

482
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,100
Ah...

483
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,800
Number 18 OK?

484
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,800
Ya bet

485
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,670
Huh? Is this right?

486
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,340
This is not within reach at all.

487
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,310
I'm freaking hungry!

488
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,310
We haven't been to a single place,

489
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,970
Eh!?

490
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,970
IT'S HERE! LOOK!

491
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,340

492
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,340
You're right! It says it right there

493
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,380
One time for 200 yen! That's cheap!

494
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,050
Ah crap!

495
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,050
Let's do it!

496
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,450
So we can only do it once huh? Uhm so...

497
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,650
Hello there

498
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,650

Really? We finally found it

502
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,490
How about mom goes first..

503
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,490
Who's gonna go then?

504
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,930
My fingers are too short

505
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,130
Mine aren't such a big deal either

506
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,130
Yours are way too short

507
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,200
How about you?

508
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,200
You've got boring ass hands

509
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,400
My hands are big, yeah

510
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,400

511
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,200
Alright, alright...

512
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,200
If you could do it with both of your hands...

513
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,210
For 200 Yen!?

514
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,210
We can do it with both!?

515
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,040
This hospitality is over the top!

516
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,850
Eh, so how am I..

517
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,850

518
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,580
Not like that no,

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,580

520
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,780
Wow, it's packed full

521
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,820
Can we do it with one hand each?

522
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,820
That's completely fine

523
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,560
Hey, mommy

524
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,560
One hand each

525
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,220
One hand each

526
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,220
Yeah

527
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,590
Both of ya grab with the

528
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,590
strength of each hand and then you

529
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,700
push your hands together

530
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,700
so that you can take the ones in between too

531
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,230
Wow you really know

532
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,230
how to do this, huh?

533
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,730
Ah I gotcha!

534
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,730
So I do this so we can combine..

535
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,400
Okay and then...

536
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,400
We're gonna get some in between

537
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,810
cause we can only do it once right?

538
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,880
Let's go lets go!

539
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,880
This is gonna work out perfectly

540
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,740
Can ya do it?

541
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,740

Yes it is

544
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,780
It's not gonna work

545
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,780
No no, if you do it like that

546
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,950
Yes yes yes exactly! The ones in between too!

547

Exactly like that!

549
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,390
Faster faster! And then down in the bowl!

550
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,430

This is what we took!

553

We managed to grab quite a lot didn't we?

554
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,200
This what ya managed?

555
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,100
Very clever

556
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,830
Alright then!

557
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,830

00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,530
We did it.

560
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,170
And then you're gonna prepare it

561
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,170

Yeah, you're right

608
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,370

Even if we pay 780yen?

617
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,910
Yes, the price for competing..

618
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,820
Let's do it then

619
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,820
Let's go

620
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,320
Since me and Kenji

621
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,320
did the clams last time

622
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,950
Alright, I'll do my best

623
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,950
We'll let you do it this time

624
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,720
Hey, she's even

625
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,720
bringing you something

626
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,660
Hey it's Cee-lo!

627
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,660
Yeah

628
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,590
It feels like the

629
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,590
bad luck from last year

630
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,260
Is not quite gone

631
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,260
It's definitely still there

632
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,830
The dice is letting me start from one though

633
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,830
Wow...

634
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,570
So you're saying it won't show?

635
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,570
Yes it won't

636
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,440
If you were to be speculative right?

637
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,540
It definitely won't show, let's go

638
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,540
Okay here it comes

639
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,740
300 would be amazing

640
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,740
Alright!

641
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,480
5!

642
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,110
That's good!

643
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,520
If it was my turn then maybe...

644
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,520
Then for comparison

645
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,120
What the hell? That's no good!

646
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,290
If I'd done it

647
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,290
we would have had great success!

648
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,030
I'm glad you did it this time

649
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,600
That was risky

650
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,600
We were lucky

651
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,970
Really close

652
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,970
That was close for sure!

653
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,970
How embarassing～

654
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,970

662
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,710

663
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,710

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,070
didn't go to that Udon shop

692
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,310
I'm happy we have that ahead of us

693
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,310

Never ever in my life again

706
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,660
There's a possibility

707
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,660
We're gonna pick that one again

708
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,800
This is the entrance to the Number 18 OK so...

709

Scooping into the trash bowl

761
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,730
Mom put

762
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,730

763
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,030

00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,700

This juice is great...

775
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,390

This place is truly great

786
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,400
This place must be crushed in the evenings right?

787
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,770
Crushed?

788
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,070
Yeah, packed!

789
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,070
You mean packed right?

790
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,840
It's okay you didn't get it

791
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,840
Packed?

I can't imagine anything else

796
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,390
But during these hours

797
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,390

798
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,220

Oh this...

817
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,920

So tender..

00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,380

If you win we pay 2390 yen
