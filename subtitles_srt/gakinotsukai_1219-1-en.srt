Headmaster's drum touch & go

Turbulent 2nd half!!

32
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,920
And this week, it's time for the turbulent second half!

33
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,990
The headmaster's guidance isn't over

34
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,230
An emotional ending

37
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,170
So, what's coming next?
- Let's see...

38
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,140
It's time for a swimsuit fashion show

39
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,010
- Ohh, I like that

40
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,010
Take a look at this

41
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,580
You might like or dislike some of them

42
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,450
But I want you to think of the headmaster's tastes
and pick the right swimsuit for the fashion show

43
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,580
But I want you to think of the headmaster's tastes
and pick the right swimsuit for the fashion show

44
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,000
Get out from there and walk all the way here

45
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,000
- That's right

46
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:18,060
Choose a swimsuit from 8 available ones and wear it for the fashion
show. Pick one the headmaster doesn't like and you'll be punished!!

47
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:18,060
Headmaster's favorite swimsuit show

48
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:18,060
m 0 0 l -40 0 l -40 21 l 40 21 l 40 0 l 0 0

49
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,920
Keep in mind that it's about
how you appeal to the Headmaster

50
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,790
So make sure you don't pick
something he wouldn't like

51
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,060
Keep that in mind
- That's right

52
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,500
They're so quiet and don't seem so lively...

53
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,500
- Huh?

54
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,900
Maybe you gotta move some more?

55
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,900
- I'm getting angry...

56
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,200
- That's not true

57
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,670
Wanna move some more?
- We're good!

58
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,540
Is there something wrong? Anything?

59
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,540
Nope, we're completely fine!!

60
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,840
But if you gotta pick one?
- Huh

61
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,380
Well...

62
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,380
That thing in which we had to keep on moving...

63
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,380
Just a bit, alright?

64
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,150
But I don't like it

65
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,420
You--
- I'd say

66
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,520
I hate it, maybe...

67
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,520
You---

68
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,190
What can they possibly hate about all this, boss!?

69
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,370
They should be glad about enrolling in this cram
school, what is there to hate for them?

70
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,270
You don't hate it, right Endo?

71
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,270
Nope! I don't!!

72
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,700
What was that?

73
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,100
"Nope! I don't!!"

74
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,670
What's wrong with your mouth?

75
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,110
My mouth is full of sand, sir

76
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,110
- I'm fine

77
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,840
Go get changed

78
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,320
- Got it

79
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,180
Get ready, students!

80
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,180
- Got it!

81
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,180
The students are ready to get changed

82
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:19,790
The students are changing

83
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,440
Remember: pick something the headmaster won't like and you'll be punished!

84
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,430
Headmaster's favorite swimsuit show

85
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,260
Counting on ya!

86
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,610
Oh, I see... so he thinks you like these red stripes

87
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,010
Fujimon is lookin' fresh

88
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,350
So, what do you think? It wasn't that bad, right?

89
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,400
- Yeah, I guess

90
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,700
He looked so confident

91
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,790
Maybe you like flower patterns?

92
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,300
Ehh... what is--

93
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,430
Or maybe he went for the one-piece suit?

94
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,940
Nice

95
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,400
Next up

96
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,040
Let's see-

97
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:15,610
Do you like this... frilly thing? How do you call that?

98
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,760
I see...

99
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,320
This is quite... audacious, right?
- That's right

100
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,290
Normally he shouldn't wear that underneath it
- Right

101
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,360
It's really small, this one

102
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,860
It just barely covers him

103
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,460
Right?

104
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,540
I wonder what do you think of the color blue

105
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,830
Let's see

106
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,430
We have another one-piece here
- I see...

107
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,100
A butterfly-pattern

108
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,210
What do you think of it?
- I wonder how am I going to judge this show

109
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,920
Can the next one be your favorite one?
- This one's so tiny!

110
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,200
An animal print, huh...

111
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,520
I see, headmaster, I see

112
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,220
This is really something, don't you think?
- It's small

113
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,790
You gotta be careful wearing those, or you're out

114
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,790
- That's right

115
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,000
I see... maybe he thinks you like it
when top and bottom don't match

116
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,870
Could this be it?

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,410
Let's see--

118
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,140
So irritating

119
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,080
Come on

120
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,650
Alright, let's see what we got

121
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,280
I see...
- This one is pretty bold too

122
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,520
I see, I see...
- A star pattern...

123
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,820
Stars are nice, I guess

124
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,390
Flat-chested, but whatever

125
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,830
An irritating body...

126
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,830
-I see

127
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,560
Here's our last one

128
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,870
How about a chic swimsuit, boss?

129
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,430
This is horrible
- Why wearing it like that?

130
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,140
This guy is an idiot

131
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,480
He's really a moron

132
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,480
What's his problem?

133
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,480
Alright, beauties

134
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,980
We're done here

135
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,500
So, headmaster...
- Yes

136
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,420
What do you think of them?

137
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,790
Well...

138
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,820
Can I just say the one I don't like?

139
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,820
- Of course

140
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:12,030
Who will be chosen as the most hated swimsuit wearer!?

141
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,630
It's Tsukitei Hosei!

142
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,130
What a shame!

143
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,070
I like them when they match

144
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,540
If they don't I really don't...

145
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,540
Makes sense
- Yeah

146
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:28,610
I think it's not something acceptable in our society, today

147
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,610
- Yeah, it's old stuff

148
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,150
It didn't last long
- It really didn't

149
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,080
I'm terribly sorry!!

150
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,080
- Huh? What's wrong?

151
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,290
And you're out

152
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,490
Out, out, out

153
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,760
Forgive me, headmaster!
- 100% out

154
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,460
Ah, let's see...

155
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,460
What should we do with him?

156
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,170
When I blow the whistle, start moving as much as you can

157
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,980
- This is hell...

158
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:57,040
I'll blow it again when it'll be over

159
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,680
Don't make that face

160
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,580
That's not the spirit
- You should be grateful for this

161
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,510
How do you feel?

162
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,120
Do you want him to forgive you?

163
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,750
Principal...

164
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,520
I'm terribly sorry!
- Nope, you're out

165
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,490
Alright, let's start!

166
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,090
Get ready...
- Oh my

167
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,390
Don't ever stop! The no-stop club!

168
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,180
Show us a new you

169
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,040
We've already seen that

170
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,760
That's--

171
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,880
Something new, please

172
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,670
We've already seen that

173
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,840
There's not a single new move

174
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,410
Another pattern, please

175
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,300
I feel like I've seen this one too

176
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,680
He has no idea what to do

177
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,950
By the way, principal...
- Yes?

178
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,820
Who was the second worst one?

179
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,850
The second, huh...
- Yep

180
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,760
If I have to say it, I don't like one-piece swimsuit...
- I see

181
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,080
Oh, yeah? I felt like you didn't like 'em
- That's right

182
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,140
So it could have been Haranishi or Inomoto
- Yeah, I think so

183
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,540
But they're safe
- Barely, but yes

184
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:07,780
If Tsukitei wasn't there, one of them would have lost
- That's right, lucky for them

185
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,760
I just saw something new
- Tsukitei is...

186
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,440
He just found a new pattern!

187
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,310
What face is he making?!

188
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,680
That's a face I've never seen on him

189
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,540
He's almost broken

190
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,220
Don't you think there could be more to come?

191
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,560
Oh my

192
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,280
My stomach hurts

193
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,500
I'm dying
- He's stopping!

194
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,610
A new one!

195
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,120
Oh my...

196
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,280
Your moves are too small
- He can't anymore

197
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,950
Go over there, over that tent!

198
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,960
Move towards it, come on

199
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,990
Just like that, these are the moves I want

200
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,060
It's a punishment, we can't help him

201
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,760
He looks like a pervert, principal

202
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,390
He's descending into madness

203
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,930
That's a full fledged pervert

204
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,270
Now--

205
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,270
Come back here, full speed!!

206
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,640
He just became Egashira-san

207
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,470
Move some more!!

208
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,420
I'm laughing so much it hurts

209
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,120
Keep on moving

210
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,860
He's moving his feet

211
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,520
That's the best he can do

212
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,780
That's incredible
- It's his last move

213
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,790
Come on!
He became a beached sea turtle

214
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,950
He's a turtle

215
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,620
He won't stop, though

216
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,160
It's over

217
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,160
We're done

218
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,460
Nice, huh?
- That was risky

219
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,740
So, anything else?

220
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,000
Of course there's still more...

221
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,170
But what do you think

222
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,840
About seeing the backside of a comedian like this?

223
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,910
this backside is what we're getting

224
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:47,380
Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

225

Oh, I see

233
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,630
Can you see that floating island over there?

234
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,380
Yes

235
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,600
For now, I want you to swim towards it

236
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,670
And then I'll tell you what to do

237
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,970
Alright, go to that floating island, will ya?

238
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,970
Come on

239
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,210
Let's overcome this summer

240
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,210
It's not really close, but it's fine

241
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,780
Don't be a slowpoke!

242
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,780
Quick!

243
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,080
Got it!

244
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,050
The students reach the floating island

245
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,380
The students moves towards the island, without knowing why

246
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,860
Ok vice, explain the rules
- Alright

247
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,290
We'll play a song

248
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:45,100
Who-mi-fa-bang

249
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:45,100
You have to guess the title and the singer's name of the song
You have to say your answer directly into the microphone.

250
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:45,100
m 0 0 l -40 0 l -40 21 l 40 21 l 40 0 l 0 0

251
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:41,300
If you know the title, you have to come here and say it

252
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,100
Come here and say it

253
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,740
Music: start!

254
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,740
Music:

00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,040
Come here if you know it!

256
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,450
Quick!

257
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,090
Which one is it?

258
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,100
Come here, come here

259
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,730
I don't know it, what is it?

260
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:30,180
I'm drinking a liquor soaked in my inner pride...

261
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,160
What is this?

262
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,640
Huh?

263
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,270
The hell is this?

264
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,420
Come on, answer

265
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,110
I don't know
- Come on

266
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,040
What is it?

267
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,950
It's uh...

268
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,880
It's something by Itsuki Hiroshi

269
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:44,030
I wonder what's floating in my wife's eyes...

270
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,080
Something
- Itsuki Hiroshi?

271
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,550
You gotta say somethin'

272
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,750
You have to say its title too

273
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,750
The title, please
- It's--- uhhh...

274
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,760
It's "King" by Murata Hideo!

275
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,760
Wrong!!

276
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,290
Listen to the lyrics

277
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,290
What is it?

278
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,260
Which...

279
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,260
"My inner pride!"

280
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:51,000
At the end of this forgotten road...

281
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,460
By whom?

282
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,970
Uhh...

283
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,000
Mikami Hiroshi

284
00:10:51,370 --> 00:11:01,240
On my homeland, Akita, in the Oga peninsula...

285
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,640
Come on
- Wrong!

286
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Listen to the lyrics

287
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,940
Got it
- Say it

288
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:09,290
Fixed on my bed, with a drink before I sleep...

289
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,610
Kanto Heiya

290
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,610
Kanto Heiya, huh?

291
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,050
I see...

292
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,420
By whom?

293
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,990
Saburo Nishio

294
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,990
I see...

295
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,500
Maybe they don't know it?

296
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,940
Let's call it a day

297
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,090
It's over

298
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,530
We'll show you the answer

299
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,530
Who was it?

300
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,840
The answer was "Lonely Nostalgia Liquor", by Hitoshi Kuramoto

301
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,640
Who's that?

302
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:50,630
Hitoshi Kuramoto - Lonely Nostalgia Liquor

303
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,380
Never heard of him...

304
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,670
I'm sure you know him, if you listen to his songs

305
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,810
The lyrics didn't give any hint

306
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,810
What's that?

307
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,340
The title wasn't in the lyrics

308
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,480
Is him a real singer?

309
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,480
Really?    - Of course

310
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,210
Of course he is

311
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,050
He's a professional

312
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,250
Some of his popular songs are still around

313
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,900
So...     - Really?

314
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,420
Alright, maybe his name was too hard

315
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,420
Probably

316
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,860
But you should have guessed the title

317
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,860
Right

318
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,630
He's kind of famous

319
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,630
Right

320
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,990
"Kind of"?

321
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,320
Let's move on

322
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,090
Go back
- If that's the standard, we're done for

323
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,970
Who the hell was that?

324
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,440
Let's go!

325
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,640

326
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,600

327
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,980

00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,480
One, two! Din don dan don din don dan don

Din don dan don!

331
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,820
What is...?

332
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,520
Hot-blooded!!

333

334

Play the track!

336
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,260
Music:

337
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,600
It started again! It's the usa ☆ usa ☆ time

338
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,800
What the?

339
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,270
One, two! Din don dan don din don dan don

340
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,910
Din don dan don!

341
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,440
Any clue?

342
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,680
You can sing it if you want to

343
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,680
Listen to it

344
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:56,890
I hurry back home as soon as the bell rings...

345
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,320
It's modern

346
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,890
Just like that, ok Yama-chan?

347
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,230

348
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:07,740

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,230

350
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,930
This is a nice point, here

351
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,930

Nah...

358
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,480

Very girly
- Yes

365
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:30,330
I'm still a kid, and because of that I'm still hyped!

366
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,090
"That Guy I Saw Coming Back Home"

367
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,050
Still no answer, huh?

368
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,020
- Come on

369
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,390
"Smile Jr. HighSchool Student"

370
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,390
No way

371
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,960
And it's over!

372
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,800
Time to reveal the answer

373
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,260
Here it is

374
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,770
It's "Afterschool Usa-usa", by usa☆usa Girls Club

375
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,940
No way it's gonna say "afterschool usausa!"

376
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,400
What do they mean by "usa-usa"?

377
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:52,150
usa☆usa Girls Club - Afterschool usa☆usa

378
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,470
I don't know, you idiot!
- Usa? Like, in rabbit (usagi)?

379
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,170
It's not even a real word!

380
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,140
How could we get that?

381
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,210
But they said usa☆usa at the beginning

382
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,210
Did they?!

383
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,380
Yeah, they really said it     - They did

384
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,150
That's true

385
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,280
So, now...

386
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,820
Let's just play the track

387
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,150
Don't go swim around, just stay here

388
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,740
Play the next one

389
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,490
Music:

390
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,700
The principal is gonna sing!

391
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,400
- The principal?!
- Who is...?

392
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,370
I feel like I heard this

393
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,970
No way!

394
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:36,990
I never expected to meet you in such a place...

395
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,380
What's this?

396
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:42,400
You look so lonely...

397
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,930
What is this?

398
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,400
He's not singing at all!

399
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:47,400
Reiko, oh Reiko...

400
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,240
Reiko?!

401
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,640
He said "Reiko"

402
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,970
It's Reiko!!

403
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:55,240
Oh tear-stained Reiko...

404
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,970
- Reiko...

405
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,770
"Reiko At The Bar"

406
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,440
"Wait For Me, Reiko"

407
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,240
"Tear-Stained Reiko"

408
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,380
"Tear-Stained Reiko!"

409
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,750
So close!!

410
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,020
"Reiko With Tear-stained Eyes"

411
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,920
Almost there!

412
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:14,330
And now you're a couple with that guy...

413
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,860
I'm close

414
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,620
"Reiko's Stains"

415
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,130
We're getting close

416
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,130
Maybe?

417
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,600
We're done here

418
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,960
We're done
- Is it "Stains"?

419
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,130
We're done!

420
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,470
Stains?!

421
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,230
It's "Tear Stains" by Ryo Wakahara

422
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,270
- Damn, "Tear Stains"!
- That's right

423
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:30,680
Wakahara Ryo - Tear Stains

424
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,470
There was no "Reiko"

425
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,780
But he said "Reiko" so many times...

426
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,780
He even said that at the very end
- He said it

427
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,180
He focused too much on "Reiko"

428
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,980
We didn't need it

429
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,680
I think you should count "Reiko's Tear Stains" as ok

430
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,680
I agree

431
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,020
Let's go with our last one
- Alright, start the music

432
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,380
Music:

433
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,920
Maybe we'll get this one

434
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,420
Ah, feels like something I've heard before

435
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,140
I remember this...

436
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,380
What is this?

437
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,500
What is this?!

438
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,140
Recent?
- Seems old!

439
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,970
It's recent!

440
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,340
I think I saw through your lies...

441
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,510
It's not an idol, right?

442
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,710
Anything?

443
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,450
"Lies Lies Wow Wow"

444
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,480
And I understand it, 'cause I love you

445
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,020
What the hell was that?

446
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,300
"Wow Wow?"

447
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,950
Well, she said it.

448
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:14,860
A man can have two women at once...

449
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,960
Come on, guys

450
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,780
Just wait for it

451
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,360
Wait for that part and you'll get it
- You think so?

452
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:20,530
But that won't ever make you happy...

453
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,530
What can it be?

454
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:29,240
Aah, I wasn't that cute of a girl, but...

455
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,070
"He Got Me Cryin', Ha-ha"

456
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,540
Nice one

457
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,840
No way

458
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,710
"Two-timing Beep Beep"

459
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:34,240
But you're the only one I ever wanted...

460
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,710
Not even close

461
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,240
"Did We Break Up?"

462
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,280
Come again?!
- Huh?

463
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,510
"Did We Break Up?"

464
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,750
Correct!!

465
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,440
WHAT?!

466
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,150
It's "Did We Break Up?", by Kim Ranhi

467
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,090
Who's that...?

468
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,990
No way!

469
00:16:46,990 --> 00:17:06,110
Kim Ranhi - "Did We Break Up?"

470
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,060
How did you know that?

471
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,060
No way you got it

472
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,660
She didn't say that in the lyrics...

473
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,660
She didn't say it...    - Is that it?

474
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,720
How did you...?

475
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,570
I'm very surprised

476
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,930
Did you peek at that?

477
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,200
I heard the lyrics...

478
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,070
I thought, it seems like she's talking about a break-up...

479
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,070
That's incredible

480
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,020
- Sure you didn't peek at it?

481
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,110
I didn't, I swear

482
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,110
You sure?

483
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,740
So, let's see...

484
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,210
What should we do, principal?

485
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,210
- Well...

486
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,580
Yama-chan got it right just now

487
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,050
But I 100% saw him peeking at this cardboard

488
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,050
- What?

489
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,920
Really?!

490
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,920
That's what we said!
- Are you kidding me?

491
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:28,130
The proof

492
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,630
Here's the proof Hosei cheated

493
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,980
Get ready...

494
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,620
Punishment game for you!

495
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:38,210
Please, wait... he kept on flipping that thing so I could see it

496
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,780
- Punishment time!

497
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,180
I didn't want to see it, but I couldn't help it!

498
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,750
He kept on flipping that thing on my face!

499
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,820
Nope, you're out!

500
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,420
Now...

501
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,620
Can't blame him

502
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,390
Be brave, Hosei

503
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,690
What should I do now, what?

504
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,690
Just tell me!
- Principal?

505
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,430
Alright, so...
- Spare me, principal!

506
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,100
Ready for the usual?

507
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,230
Don't ever stop! The no-stop club!

508
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,220
I can't...

509
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,470
I saw that before

510
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,940
That's all you ever do!

511
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,810
He's holding a baby!

512
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,810
You're right!

513
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,760
It's his baby!

514
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,840
Come on, switch into something else!
- Congratulations!

515
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,080
Congratulations

516
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,280
He's born

517
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,490
Congratulations for your newborn!

518
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,450
It's what you get

519
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,620
Cheating is the thing our principal hates the most

520
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,620
Yeah, that's no good

521
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,790
Here comes
- Maybe he'll come up with something new

522
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,130
Oh!

523
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,430
I can see a change!

524
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,400
It's the Moustache-dance!

525
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,400
A new trend?

526
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,330
He's running out of stamina

527
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,900
Maybe it's less tiring

528
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,310
Don't you think he just entered eco-mode?

529
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,310
I do       - Sort of...

530
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,080
This is the most basic type

531
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,980
He's thinking about the next move

532
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,780
Look at him

533
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,780
His face!

534
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,160
It's Ei-chan?!

535
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,320
It's Eikichi Yazawa!

536
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,640
Ei-chan!

537
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,640
So cool, such a cool face

538
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,800
It's Ei-chan

539
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,230
And it's over

540
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,800
Here it comes again

541
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,840
It's the backside of a comedian again

542
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,840
He's completely exhausted

543
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,980
Hot-blooded!!

544
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,980
Hamada's Cram School!!

545
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:32,520
"Once more, that incredible love"
lyrics: Osamu Kitayama | music: Kazuhiko Kato

546
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:44,370
From that day in which we vowed to stake our lives

547
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:54,880
We build up so many wonderful memories

548
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:05,490
But now that I see those same flowers we called beautiful back then

549
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:16,500
I realize how our hearts don't resemble each other anymore

550
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:27,180
Once more, that incredible love

551
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,360
Louder!

552
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:37,990
Once more, that incredible love

553
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,990
Alright, a little break now

554
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:55,300
That song for the red dragonfly we sang to the wind

555
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:04,950
Nothing has changed since then

556
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:15,560
But the two of us who chased after the sunrise

557
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:25,930
Our hearts have grown so apart since then

558
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,100
Louder!

559
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:35,040
Once more, that incredible love

560
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,550
Last one

561
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:48,920
Once more, that incredible love

562
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:02,770
How about you enroll
in Hamada's Cram too?

564
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:23,260
"How to spend your summer break"

565
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:23,260
5-shot talk

566
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,760
So, it's summer now
- Right, we're in the middle of the summer break

567
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,170
How do you plan on spending it?

568
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,170
I see...

569
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,230
Let's see

570
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,400
Are you going somewhere with your families?

571
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,440
I'm not
- Really?

572
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,770
'Cause it's gonna be crowded wherever we'd go

573
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,110
I'm going

574
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,380
I'll go to the sea

575
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,080
Who cares?

576
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,980
That's pretty standard
- Just go, who cares!

577
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,550
I will
- If you'll have time

578
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,220
Of course, if I can

579
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,640
And I also wanna do that, you know

580
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,520
I wanna do that rocket thing
- Ah, I see

581
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,460
That one!
- Yeah

582
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,260
You put it on your feet and it flies

583
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,260
It uses water pressure to make you float

584
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,920
Ah, the jetpack thingy?
- That one

585
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,030
I'm not sure...

586
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:20,420
Flyboard

587
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:20,420
It uses the power of the water for a jet propulsion

588
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:20,420

589
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,140
And it sprays water, right?

590
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,140
That's right, it's very powerful

591
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,140
I never actually saw one of those

592
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,140
Me neither

593
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,710
Isn't there an ad for it?     - Yep

594
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,440
You wanna do it?    - I'm doing it in two days

595
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,110
Are they like boots?            - That's right

596
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,420
And from its side it sprays water, it makes you fly

597
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,520
I wanna show it to my family!

598
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,890
I wanna appeal to them

599
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,690
Flying like fwaaaaaaah!

600
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,660
That's it
- What's so funny about it?

601
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,600
It's really fun!
- Is it?

602
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,270
By the sea?
- Of course

603
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,620
You'll do it?

604
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,400
Definitely, yeah

605
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,400
No way

606
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,520
Are they going to film you?

607
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,740
Of course
- Perfect

608
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,210
We gotta see it, maybe we'll persuade Hamada into trying it himself

609
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,860
Please, do!

610
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,900
I wanna see him
- Please!

611
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,820
I really want to
- I want to see the principal fly

612
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,520
In Hamada's Cram School?
- Yeah

613
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,150
No way he'll do it

614
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,800
He doesn't even like to walk!

615
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,480
That's not true

616
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,730
I guess so
