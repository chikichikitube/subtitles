00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,510
What's wrong?

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,180
While eating, Matsumoto suddenly got food stuck in his throat.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,140
What's with you?

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,000
Get me some Evian Water

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,000
Huh?

10
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,250

11
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,610

13
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,980
Get me some Evian!

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,210
Go to where they get it from and get me some!

15
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,210
Batsu game!

16
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,210
Hama-chan! Go to France to get some Evian Water!!

17
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,210
Ma-chan is so mean!!

18
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,580
First, He needs to find out where Evian is from!

19
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,610
Hamada calls the Evian Company

20
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,080
Evian Water right?

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,850
Uhh....

22
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,620
So I want to go to where you guys get the water from...

23
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,080
Where exactly is it though...

24
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,450
We get it around Mont Blanc...

25
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,380
Mont Blanc!?

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,530
So you wanna get there on a plane.

27
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,050
Ah, Alright! I'll fly there.

28
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,190
You can also get there by boat.

29
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,050
Ah. Alright, I see...

30
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,290
So where is Mont Blanc exactly?

31
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,190
It's a far place from Tokyo

32
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,800
12 hours on a plane to France

33
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,380
The alps are here

34
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,950
Aiming for Mount Blanc!

35
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,380
Hamada's Trip has begun!

36
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,110
Narita International Airport

37
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,180
Hamada is brought forcibly by two managers

38
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,080
Let's go shall we?

39
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,180
You guys are going too?

40
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,380
Yes.

41
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,870
What the hell do you have on me?

42
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,150
It's because of the Batsu game.

43
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,880
What the hell do you mean "because"

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,080
You have to fill it up

45
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,630
There's still a little bit in here. This is fine right?

46
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,620
A Souvenir!?

47
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,620
Get us a souvenir!

48
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,660
Shut up!

49
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:00,700
Soon after, Hamada's plane takes off!

50
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,450
Hamada's plane to Paris leaves

51
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,600
What the hell is this?

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,440
Huh?

53
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,200
What seat are we in?

54
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,580
Economy.

55
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,000
Economy!?

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,280
Who the hell sat us here!?

57
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,280
It's a Batsu game, isn't it?

58
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,000
Suga

59
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,000
What is it?

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,350
They have Evian here!

61
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,550
Look! It's Evian!

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,730
I should just take this back with me

63
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,880
But it's a Batsu game...

64
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,650
I guess you're right.

65
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,280
Uwahhh!

66
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,380
4 Hours Since Departure

67
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,380
Matsumoto is still struggling

68
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,810
12 Hours since departure and Hamada has landed in France

69
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,980
So are we getting there by foot?

70
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,490
No, We still have another plane

71
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,480
EH!?

72
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,050
With the thought of getting on another plane, Hamada runs away!

73
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,250
However, With some information they find him at the transit room

74
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,880
Transit Room

75
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,760
I've filled it up. Time to go home.

76
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:17,610
Flying from France in Economy they make it to Geneva Switzerland

77
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,910
Arrived at Geneva airport

78
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,580
We're here...

79
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,280
We've finally made it huh?

80
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,150
What the hell are you carrying?

81
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,780
EH!?

82
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,760
We're going to the hotel?

83
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,720
No...

84
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,280
Where!?

85
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,100
Mont Blanc

86
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,280
Are you stupid...

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,450
And then 4 hours after...

88
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,680
Hamada once again being carried by the staff

89
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,950
We probably still can't see it!

90
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,810
Geneva (Switzerland)

91
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,810
Lake Geneva

92
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,580
Heading towards Evian, Hamada gets on a boat

93
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,410
Let's get going soon

94
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,280
Can he make it? Trusting the instructions he got on the phone they leave!

95
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,750
Suga!

96
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,580
Suga acting like a tourist

97
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,000
What the fuck are you doing! Who are you waving to!?

98
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,380
Are we even heading the right way?

99
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,880
Definitely!

100
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,080
I'm gonna ask the old man.

101
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,980
Hamada's French

102
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,980
Are we really headed towards Mont Blanc?

103
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,490
Thank you!

104
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,650
We don't understand each other!

105
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,180
He said you can't make it by boat.

106
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,480
Hamada's Translator

107
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,810
We can't get there with a boat!?

108
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,380
SUGA!!

109
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,810
He said we're not going to make it there!

110
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,810
No way!

111
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,350
We can't get there by boat!

112
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,350
No way!

113
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,080
Change of plans! They purchase a rental car!

114
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,000
We made it right?

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,410
This is the border.

116
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,350
Border?

117
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,950
The border of France and Switzerland

118
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,950
It's been 26 hours since he departed. They've arrived at the town of lovers, Chamonix!

119
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,050
Chamonix (France)

120
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,050
Matsumoto is still struggling

121
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,610
Hamada joyfully ignoring the Evian task

122
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,680
Basically, We gotta climb it now.

123
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,710
It's scary! Try looking at it!

124
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,080
What the hell are you doing?

125
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,850
Hamada being forced to wear Tyrol clothing by the staff

126
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,350
It's just so we can spot you out easy.

127
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,520
What the hell is this.

128
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,150
I came all the way here now I have to wear this?

129
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,110
Heading towards Evian! The cable car begins to move!

130
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,310
The rope cart begins to swing as it reaches its destination altitude at 2000m.

131
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,180
Scared Hamada

132
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,180
He's reached the midpoint!

133
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,500
However, Matsumoto is still struggling!

134
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,580
Will he be able to get the water in time?

135
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,080
Mont Blanc

136
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,110
Hamada continues to attack! Is Evian close at hand!?

137
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,310
Holy. We're over the clouds already...

138
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,510
Hamada riding a cable car to his destination 3842m in altitude.

139
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,750
Uwaah!

140
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,910
Hamada shaking from fear

141
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,690
There's definitely no water in a place like this

142
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,180
He finally reaches his destination at the top!

143
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:00,610
Due to the high altitude, The air gets thinner.

144
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:00,610
Temperature -10

145
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,710
Uwaaah!

146
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,690
There are people climbing down the mountain!

147
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,520
Let's get the water and get out of here!

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,500
Well, There's none... No water... I was told...

149
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,500
Huh!?

150
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,390
If we go a little north and head down there's a waterfall. That's where we can get it.

151
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,670
Dumbass!

152
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,440
If I just put this in and it melts that's fine right?

153
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,510
Ma-chan would probably be angry.

154
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,250
No. Well...

155
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,810
He's on the verge of death isn't he?

156
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,230
Right everyone?

157
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,710
Well it's a Batsume... Batsu game

158
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,710
BATSUME!?

159
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,250
From such a cold mountain to this hot place...

160
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,710
Climbing down from Mont Blanc in search of the Evian Falls.

161
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,650
By the way, It's about an hour away from here.

162
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,480
EH!?

163
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,480
Here.

164
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,210
Enough already. Huh?

165
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,380
What?

166
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,830
Well... We're gonna be waiting.

167
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,450
Why the hell are you laughing?

168
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,650
I will have to fill it with Evian water, right?

169
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,810
Please get it!

170
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,380
Alright, Let's all go together!

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,380
Eh?

172
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,270
Hurry up guys!

173
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,230
Oh! Oh! The waterfall!

174
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,460
So here we are...

175
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,000
The Evian Falls!

176
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,010
There's a lot of Evian!

177
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,750
What the hell is this?

178
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,750
This is good right!?

179
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,710
How do you expect me to get it!?

180
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,240
I'll die!

181
00:08:53,550 --> 00:09:00,080
Being so far away from Japan, Hamada finally gets it!

182
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,250
I've got it!

183
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,250
Finally, Hamada has gotten some natural Evian!

184
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,210
I've got it!

185
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:19,190
Congratulations Hamachan for successfully getting the water from the alps!

186
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,420
This is the Batsu game of your Youth!

187
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,950
Our dreams are fulfilled with the cool breeze of the Mont Blanc!

188
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,180
Hamada in good spirits has forgotten the pain he went through to get the bottle.

189
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,350
They reach the neighbouring city

190
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,450
Evian (France)

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Come on Suga... Let's go shopping.

192
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,780
Huh?

193
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,010
Evian...

194
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,850
Well, It's the city...

195
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,850
Eh?

196
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,810
Evian natural spring waters

197
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,310
They have the Evian water?

198
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,280
Yeah.

199
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,450
Over there?

200
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,990
Well we got it from the mountains...

201
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,540
I didn't say it before but the water from the alps is the water from the alps.

202
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:15,110
The water that flows from the alps to Evian is then labeled as Evian.

203
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,150
So if we just came here...

204
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,150
We would have got Evian.

205
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,710
Oi!

206
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,190
Where the hell are you looking!?

207
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,050
So what's this water!?

208
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,080
The water I got from before.

209
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,080
Waterfall Water.

210
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,850
WATERFALL WATER!?

211
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,480
If we just came here after getting off the plane we would have done it fast!

212
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,850
Well... It's a Batsu game...

213
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,080
DAMN YOU!

214
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,650
What are they doing?

215
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,250
A beautiful woman washing her dog with Evian

216
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,780
Washing her dog?

217
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:56,780
Seems so.

218
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,580
"Seems so"!?

219
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:05,080
Evian:

220
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:05,080
The snow and water from Mont Blanc flows down for over 15 years to the city called Evian.

221
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,360
Ahhh!

222
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,540
There's just getting it from here?

223
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,550
Yes they are.

224
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,920
Coincidentally, There are a lot of towns like this

225
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,920
So this is the same water as the Evian in Japan!?

226
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,450
Yes.

227
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,910
This was so painful.

228
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,520
It's just water...

229
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,680
Alright!

230
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,880
Got it!

231
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,380
32 Hours since the start

232
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,380
He's finally gotten the real Evian Water!

233
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,080
This is for real right!?

234
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,210
This is real Evian!

235
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:49,470
He's got the Evian water from the alps

236
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,450
This time, Congratulations!

237
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,000
Despite being an Idiot,

238
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,450
Our dreams have honestly been fulfilled!

239
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,250
35 hours since departure

240
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,250
Hamada and the crew get on the plane home.

241
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,810
50 hours since departure

242
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,810
Matsumoto is still struggling

243
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,250
Hamada makes it to the Downtown break room!

244
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,210
It's painful huh!?

245
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,050
Nah, I'm alright now.

246
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,050
EH!?

247
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,280
Whats your problem? You should be happy!

248
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,810
My throat is cleared up though.

249
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,010
Why do you look so tired!

250
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,650
Wait a minute...

251
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,920
Listen here...

252
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,250
12 hours.

253
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,010
In Economy.

254
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,450
Ah!

255
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,170
You flew in Economy?

256
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,310
Just drink it!

257
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,450
This is real?

258
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,580
It's just water...

259
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,250
God damn it!

260
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,250
It's just water! It's not a big deal!

261
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,720
What!?

262
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,130
