00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,450
Can you reach, without using your satnav,
the place you should go to?!

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,450
Can you reach a certain place
without using your satnav?

A public road race for a head-on battle!

00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,960
A public road race for a head-on battle!

8
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,960
They'll race without satnav and anything can happen!

00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,770
And, for the grand finale, we'll see unexpected drama!

10
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,300
A finale with unexpected drama?!

11
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,770
A finale with unexpected drama?!

This show was brought to you by Kedomas and Shion

We hope you'll enjoy it!

21
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:35,850
An exciting, uncalled for miraculous ending!

22
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:35,850
Last group is going to pay up for everything!

23
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:36,480
A group of satnav-deprived adults
are brought back to public roads...

24
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,830
A group of satnav-deprived adults
are brought back to public roads...

25
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,830
A group of satnav-deprived adults
is once again brought back to the road...

26
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,540
It's the no-satnav race!

27
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,430
We're doing it again, yes!

28
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,670
It's exhausting, you know?!

29
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,670
He's right

30
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,570
But last time it was such a close race, wasn't it fun?

31
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,710
That was by pure chance
- Exactly!

32
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,240
Last time's close race!

33
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,240
I mean, yeah, we weren't planning that

34
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,080
Such a miracle won't ever happen again!

35
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,080
Right
- That's our once in a lifetime

36
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,350
This is most likely gonna end quickly!

37
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,450
But it was really fun for us viewers!

38
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,250
Oh boy, oh boy...

39
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,250
I've watched the news instead!

40
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,220
No way!

41
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,920

Last episode ended with a miracle

47
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,670
Everyone race to their goal in Shinkoiwa,

48
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,160
Three teams competed for the race!

49
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,300
It was a race full of turn-around,
as they only relied on luck and guts!

50
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,480
And the winner from the previous race...

51
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,470
The first team who shone the most was...

52
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,160
You did it! Congratulations!

53
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:29,740
1st Place

54
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:29,740
Team Matsumoto

55
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:29,740
Team Matsumoto

56
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,900
It was Matsumoto's team, which made a big comeback

57
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,020
Really?!

58
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:36,580
"Pedestrian rule"  has been used 3 times
to achieve victory!

59
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:36,580
They won by using the "pedestrian rule",
by which they could ask pedestrians for directions!

60
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,320
Team Ohtake

61
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,320
Third Place

62
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,850
On the other hand Ohtake's team,
on the last place, had to pay for everyone's expenses

63
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,850
They had to pay for everyone's expenses by themselves...

64
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,360
We want you to enjoy this ride even more,

65
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,760
so we're bringing here some fantastic guests for you!

66
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,930
Here they are, please come here!

67
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,800
Hi!

Ruriko Kojima

71
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,600
Hi guys!
- There they are

72
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,870
They're the most classic men's choice, aren't they?

73
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,410
That's not true!

74
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,870
That's not true!

75
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,180
That's not it at all! Not true!

76
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,780
Let's all be friends here!

77
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,650
You forgot to do that chin move!

78
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,180
Come on!

79
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,220
The other day on FRIDAY!

80
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,220
That's not it, I...
- Where's the famous chin move?

81
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,960
You're the worst!

82
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,160
Is that all it takes?

83
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,480
For this round too, we have some female guests

84
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:31,630
- Born in Chiba
- usually moves around
by train

85
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:31,630
- Born in Ibaraki
- In-city driving:
zero experience

86
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:31,630
- Born in Tokyo
- Doesn't have a license

93
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,220
to thin down our men's foulness!

94
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,220
However, they're not familiar at all with driving around

95
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,870
You're an university student, right Kojima?

96
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,870
Yes!

97
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,670
Have you ever driven to a class?

98
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,380
Actually no, I don't really drive

99
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,780
I've never dared to drive around the city!

100
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,450
You won't fool me with that face,
it's the "I'll help you moving" face!

101
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,450
What?!

102
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,720
He's right, that's what those who help moving out always say

103
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,720
Straight out from the script

104
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,830
She's an expert on box-packing
- That could be, but not driving

105
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,160
None of them is a good pick for a team!

106
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,160
This isn't gonna be easy

107
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,170
Blue

108
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,140
Now it's time to make up teams

109
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,170
Orange

110
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,170
Black

111
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,170
3 Teams will join the race

112
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,580
We have three different colored cars for this race,

113
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,180
They'll draw a lottery to form three teams!

114
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,910
The girls will be the first to draw!

115
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,910
The girls will be the first to draw

116
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,510
Alright, let's start from our guests

117
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,460
Sure!

118
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,280
Orange!

119
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,380
So quick!
- Build up some suspense at least!

120
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,420
So quick!!

121
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,420
Why are you in such a hurry?

122
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,290
Take it slowly, come on!
- He's right

123
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,260
Feels like a race already
- Really

124
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,590
That's the kind of stuff Arita hates the most!

125
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,960
We're not dating, you know!

126
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,270
We're just friends

127
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,080
It lacked "TV appeal", so they'll draw again!

128
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,800
Rola's pull wasn't appealing for TV, so they'll do it again

129
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,700
It lacked "TV appeal", so they'll draw again!

130
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,020
Ready, and...

131
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,400
Ah! It's not the same!

132
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,670
Mine's orange!
- Mine's black!

133
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,860
We have prepared these for you guys

134
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,780
Team Uniforms

135
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,700
Have these jackets

136
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,510
This is so cool!

137
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,380
How many more races
are you planning to do from now on?!

138
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,520
Thanks!
- This is so cool!

139
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,290
Now it's time for the boys...

140
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,400
Now it's time for the boys to know their team

141
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,640
And as a result, here are the final teams

142
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:12,740

143
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:12,740

Team Mimura

147
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:12,740
Team Ohtake

148
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,700
Our previous race champions, Matsumoto and Otohara,
are on two different teams

149
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,740
On the other hand, Mimura and Miyasako,
who know their way around, are on the same team

150
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,410
Please, head to the car with your assigned color

151
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,970
Okay, bye-bye
- Bye-bye!

152
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,110
Alright, we're going!

153
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,150
It's time to get in the car!

154
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,710
They get in the car with the allies brought by fate

155
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:31,050
Back Seat

156
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:31,050

Front Seat

158
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:31,050
Time to choose each role:

159
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,600
Each team will choose the driver and wait for the start

160
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,220
And now, it's finally time!
- Alright, everything's set

161
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,390
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

162
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,000
Open up your dashboard, please

163
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,680
This one?

164
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,260
We opened it

165
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,620
Okay!

166
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,430
Is there something in it?
- Yes!

167
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,640
Inside the red envelope you can see
what's your goal you have to reach for today!

168
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,340
Alright then, please open them all!

169
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,560
Please, be somewhere I know...

What?!

177
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,320
Where is this?!
- Never heard of this place before!

178
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,750
Musashi Kosugi?!

179
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:06,220
Car positions:

180
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:06,220
Hotohara  Ohtake

181
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:06,220
Udo    Suzuki

182
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,020
Musashi Kosugi...

183
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,220
Musashi Kosugi?!

184
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,220
Musashi Kosugi...

185
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:16,730
Car positions:

186
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:16,730
Mimura

187
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:16,730
Miyasako  Rola

188
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,130
What?!
- Oh man...

189
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,660
Musashi Kosugi?

190
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,230
Do you know how to get there?

191
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,230
Musashi Kosugi...

192
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,460
It's around Meguro, isn't it?

193
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,460
I think so

194
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,730
I-I'm not that lost, you know...

195
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:30,250
King of Gyoza

196
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:30,250
Musashi Kosugi Shop

197
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:30,250
The goal they'll have to reach:

198
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,530
The goal they have to reach is King of Gyoza,
the shop in Musashi Kosugi

199
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:30,100
As a reward for the first two teams,
they can enjoy a gyoza buffet for free!

200
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:48,470
Akasaka TBS

201
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:48,470
Futako Tamagawa

202
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:48,470
Imperial Palace

203
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:48,470
Meguro

204
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:48,470
Musashi Kosugi

205
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:48,470
Shibuya

206
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:48,470
Towards Kanagawa

207
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,340
This is the shortest route to the goal

208
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:48,470
Shortest route

209
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,650
By heading to Kanagawa, you can reach it within 1 hour

210
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,140
Musashi Kosugi is in Kawasaki town,
beyond Tamagawa, in Kanagawa prefecture

211
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,470
Nakahara
Highway

212
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,470
The key to win this race is whether
or not you enter Nakahara Highway

213
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,220
Alright, it's time to start the no-SATNAV rally,
objective: King of Gyoza in Musashi Kosugi!

214
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,780
This "Musashi Kosugi" thing...

215
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,780
What?! It already started?!

216
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,340
Wait a moment, what should we do?!

217
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,350
Musashi Kosugi...

218
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,480
Our best, I guess?

219
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,850
Take care!
- Where should we go?

220
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,280
I'm going over there

221
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,050
The three teams dashed out at once!

222
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:14,560
The three teams dashed out at once!

223
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,640
We're going left!

224
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,860
Have a nice ride, and be careful!

225
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,560
See you later!

226
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,700
Musashi Kosugi is...?

227
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,860
I don't...
- I really don't know

228
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,330
Wait, I think I know!

229
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,730
It's around Suginami, isn't it?!

230
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,130
It could be! I think I've seen that name before

231
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,000
Like, in those railway maps around the stations!

232
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,170
Musashi Kosugi... what's the closest station to it?

233
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,520
- Musashi Kosugi...

234
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,280
Wasn't there, like, a huge shopping district?

235
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,010
Or maybe that's Musashi Koyama!

236
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,010
Right, that one does exist too

237
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,150
It's a shame, I actually know how to get to Musashi Koyama

238
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,150
Should be around Meguro

239
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,720
Want me to go towards Musashi Koyama?

240
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,320
Why, is Musashi Kosugi close to Musashi Koyama?

241
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,320
I don't know, what do you think?

242
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,560
Hey Rola, you know what we're talking about?

243
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,930
Nope, no clue!

244
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,050
Isn't it around Kichioji or such?

245
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,050
Now that you say it, it could be

246
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,400
I don't know jack about Kichioji and what's around it!

247
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,600
Not even anything about Jiyugaoka

248
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,510
Last time it was more around...
- Wait, Matsumoto...

249
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:09,580
Jiyugaoka and Kichioji aren't close at all!

250
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,580
That's...

251
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,180
That's how little I know my way around...

252
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,400
Is that all you can bring us?

253
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,450
You're bad news, Matsumoto!
- What should we do?!

254
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,750
This show really brings out the worst of me, huh?

255
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,090
I've never been to this Musashi Kosugi place!

256
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,390
Musashi Koyama is around Meguro, though

257
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,030
Eh?! Really? Musashi Kosugi...
- A different one?!

258
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,630
Is Musashi Koyama around Meguro?

259
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,070
That's right

260
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,070
Then... aren't they close?

261
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,900
What? That's such a risky move!

262
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,800
I mean, they could be...

263
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,970
Do you mean like sister cities or such?

264
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,970
That's exactly what I meant, yes

265
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,740
I mean, they both took on this "Musashi" thing

266
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,730
We should... We should just ask the locals

267
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,280
But aren't there, like, dozens of "Musashi"...?

268
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:59,290
Akasaka TBS

269
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:59,290
Meguro

270
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:59,290
Shibuya

271
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:59,290
Shortest route

272
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:59,290
Suginami
prefecture

273
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,280
Their biggest obstacle for this race
is the trick behind the place's name

274
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:59,290
Musashi Koganei

275
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:59,290
Musashi Kosugi

276
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:59,290
Musashi Koyama

277
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,500
There are tons of "Musashi" around Tokyo

278
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,760
Their goal, Musashi Kosugi, is in Kawasaki,
but Musashi Koganei is in Suginami

279
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,280
That's why they can use the important
"pedestrian rule"

280
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:00,630
Pedestrian

281
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:09,640
Pedestrian

282
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:01,800
Pedestrian

283
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:09,640
Pedestrian

284
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,980
Each team can ask up to three times
pedestrians for directions,

285
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:02,960
Pedestrian

286
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,640
Pedestrian

287
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:09,640
They can ask pedestrians up to 3 times
but can they actually use this wisely?!

288
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,300
But the most crucial factor is how and when
to ask them for directions

289
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:15,480
Goal

290
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:15,480
Suginami Direction

291
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:15,480
Team Ohtake

292
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:15,480
That's what they think...

293
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,480
Between them, Team Ohtake is headed
towards Suginami, where they think their goal lies...

294
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,010
Huh? But Musashi Kosugi...

295
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,520
Aren't you all sure...

296
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,420
It wasn't around Kawasaki or such?

297
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,160
Are you sure?

298
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,590
Nice move

299
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,620
Kawasaki?
- It's not even Tokyo...

300
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,680
It could be
- I mean, it could!

301
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,560
I'm pretty sure it's around there, don't you think so?

302
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,100
But if we go there and we're wrong, we're done for!

303
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,730
If we go to Kawasaki, there's no way we can go back to Suginami!

304
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,470
Guess you're right...   - We gotta make a decision

305
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,040
Suginami and Kawasaki are too far apart

306
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,040
What should we do?

307
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,170
Let's see...

308
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,010
Let's ask some pedestrian then!

309
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,640
Wanna go already for it?

310
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,640
Yeah, let's start off with a bang!

311
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,810
Are we already asking?

312
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,350
I see, it may be the wisest choice!

313
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,710
Yeah!
- I agree

314
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,710
Let's go for it!

315
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:58,350
Kawasaki

316
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:58,350
Suginami

317
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:58,350
Team Ohtake

318
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:58,350
The team is looking for a pedestrian to ask

319
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:58,350
Following Captain Ohtake's orders,
they chose to ask around if it's Suginami or Kawasaki

320
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,860
The blue car got away from Akasaka, the starting point

321
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:07,530
Akasaka TBS

322
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:07,530

Shibuya

325
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:07,530
Shortest route

326
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:07,530
Yotsuya

327
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:07,530
Team Matsumoto

328
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:07,530
is wandering around the shortest route

329
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,530
Team Matsumoto is just wandering around
somewhere on the north side of the route

330
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,130
What should we do? Real talk here...

331
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,130
- This isn't good at all...

332
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,370
If we go this way, we should reach Yotsuya, right?

333
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,920
You're right, we should

334
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,070
We can ask somebody near Yotsuya Station, right?

335
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,070
That's right!
- Yeah

336
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,550
Meanwhile, Team Mimura believes Kosugi
should be near Koyama, and so...

337
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:28,480

Musashi Kosugi

341
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:28,480
Musashi Koyama

342
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:28,480
Shibuya

343
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:28,480
Shortest route

Team Mimura

345
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:28,480
believes Musashi Kosugi is near Musashi Koyama, and so...

346
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,480
They're headed to Meguro, with no time to waste

347
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,820
So, we're driving knowing where we're headed?

348
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,520
Yeah, I know where we're going

349
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,520
Really?

350
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,560
Well, I live in Meguro, so...

351
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,490
That gives me hope!

352
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,490
I always drive this road to get back home

353
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,490
- Oh, is that so?

354
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,000
Arita

355
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,000
Unlike Arita's house, right?

356
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,000
Come on, don't say weird stuff!

357
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,770
We're just friends!

358
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,040
What have you done together?

359
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,140
We played "minna no golf" all the time!

360
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,140
"Minna no golf"?

361
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,810
But when I told him I had to go home,

362
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,340
He wanted to play more and forced me to stay more!

363
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,340
- I see... did he?

364
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:55,810
With his jaw out?

365
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,910
With his jaw out?

366
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,910
Of course

367
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,520
Say, Rola... do you like strong jaws?

368
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,450
Don't say it like that, it sounds mean!

369
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,360
I really like him as a person, he's fun to talk to

370
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,160
But those aren't feelings of love

371
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,160
Is that so?

372
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,900
And I think I'm being clear on that

373
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,100
If that's so, what kind of man do you like, Rola?

374
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,670
I like, you know, men who have a wild feeling to them

375
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,670
- Wild?

376
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,840
You mean, like Sugi-chan? What do you think of him?

377
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:29,410
Sugi-chan

378
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:29,410
Nope, Sugi-chan is just a tiny old dude

379
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,420
That's what you think of him?

380
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,410
Oh boy...

381
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,260
Team Matsumoto has arrived near Yotsuya Station

382
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:38,120

388
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:38,120
Has arrived near Yotsuya Station

389
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:38,120
Team Matsumoto

390
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,690
It's time for them to look for a passerby

391
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,360
Who should we ask?

392
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,160
Look at that couple, they're standing like
"if they ask us, we could help them a lot"

393
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,830
Ah! I see!

394
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,660
I mean, maybe they saw our previous episode...

395
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,620
Our first round! I see!
- You could be right!

396
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,730
Aahh! Wait!
- One moment!

397
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,700
Shit, now that we've called them we're done
- What should we do?

398
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,870
What should we do?
- You go, Kojima

399
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,770
We're counting on you, Kojima!

400
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,770
One of them, ok?

401
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,910
No SATNAV Rally

402
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,910
One team member can ask a passerby for directions,
but he/she isn't allowed to take any notes

404
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,880
Pick the guy!

405
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Ask the man!

406
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,910
The man? The man?

407
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,010
Sorry...

408
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,390
Sorry, can I ask you something?
Do you know how to reach Musashi Kosugi?

409
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:23,530
Pedestrian cards

410
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:23,530

IN USE

412
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,290
I think you should ride Toyoko line   - Toyoko line!

413
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:23,530
Toyoko line

414
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,920
Should be near Nansei   - Nansei!

415
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:23,530
Nansei

416
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,820
Isn't it near Shinjuku?

417
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,860
No, it's closer to south Shibuya   - I see...

418
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,530
Shibuya

419
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,530
Sorry! And thank you!

420
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,430
Thank you so much!

421
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,340
That guy is such an MVP

422
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,340
I asked him!

423
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,400
You did?!

424
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,240
Really?! You got it?!

425
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,240
We can definitely reach that place!

426
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,270
What? Where is it?
- Let's see

427
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,410
He told me that from where we are,
we should head towards Shibuya first thing

428
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,050
And in terms of general location, it's in Nansei

429
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,820
I have no idea where that is either!

430
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,850
Knowing it's "Nansei" doesn't help me at all!

431
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,620
Like, if it's like this, Yokohama is here...
- Where is Nansei?

432
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,920
We should first go to Shibuya---

433
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,130
Isn't it around Kawasaki?

434
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,960
He said it was along Toyoko line!

435
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,300
Tokoyo line? What's that?

436
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,160
That's where I wanted to go, Kawasaki

437
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,770
Yeah, we should point to Yokohama
- We could have done it, oh boy

438
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,240
Alright, let's head to Shibuya for now

439
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,170
Shibuya, you say...

440
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,940
But what should we do once we arrive?

441
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,440
If we move poorly, we'd end up in Komazawa avenue

442
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,440
We move towards Yokohama

443
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,950
Amano surely does know his way around Shibuya, huh?

444
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,950
Well yeah, I do

445
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,500
But I don't think it's the best thing to do

446
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,580
- We would have probably died if you weren't here

447
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,580
I'd rather go right into...

448
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,150
Hey! You can't do this! It's a violation!

449
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,020
Oh geez...

450
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,030
This isn't really something you should do

451
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,690
Amano!

452
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,260
Did I just sounded like him?

453
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,860
I mean, like Udo-chan, right?

454
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,270
That's how he always calls me

455
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:37,610
Team Matsumoto

456
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:37,610
They're headed towards Shibuya, for now

457
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:37,610
Team Matsumoto heads to Shibuya
after getting some precious info on its location

458
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,840
Meanwhile, Team Ohtake has arrived in Aoyama

459
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:45,580

00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:45,580
Team Ohtake

467
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,750
Now they plan to find the right passerby to ask

468
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,120
Let's ask someone in Aoyama!

469
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,390
No-SATNAV Rally

472
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,390
Who should we ask?    - Someone's coming

473
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,920
You should do it, Nana

474
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,560
Me? I'm going?
- Yeah, you're a girl, you should do it

475
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,860
I can do it, no problem!

476
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,860
Make sure to grasp some info
- Leave it to me

477
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,630
Ask that man who just stepped out the car dealer!

478
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,660
Let's do this

479
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,300
Should I just go?
- Go for it!

480
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,900
Excuse me...

481
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,300
We're filming a TV show, is it a problem for you?

482
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,870
Not at all

483
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,870
Can we film you?

484
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,770
Come on, please!

485
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,770
Alright, I'll ask him!

486
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,480
I'm doing it!
- Counting on ya!

487
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:33,990

488
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:33,990

489
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,420
So, we're heading to King of Gyoza in Musashi Kosugi...

Do you happen to know where Musashi Kosugi is?

492
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,500
We don't have a SATNAV, so we don't know where...

493
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,790
Musashi Kosugi? I have no clue

494
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,990
He doesn't know

495
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,990
I'm from Toshigi!

496
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,860
Where did he say?

497
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,360
You came from Tochigi?!

498
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,470
Actually, my workplace is in Thailand

499
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,460
- Thailand?!

500
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,640
- No way, I can't believe it!

501
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,140
Are you kidding me?

502
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,910
Did you ask someone who lives in Thailand?!

503
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,030
Thank you anyway
- Thanks

504
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,440
Oh boy, Nana...
- Get in

505
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,680
I didn't expect it at all!

506
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,280
What a surprise, huh?

507
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,950
You guys are so bad at choosing!

508
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,480
He said he's from Toshigi, huh?

509
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,620
And also Thailand!

510
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,790

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,790
A precious card has been wasted

512
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,790
Due to a stroke of bad luck, they wasted a precious card

513
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,760
We still have two more tries

514
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,400
I think that...

515
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,230
We should follow my "it's towards Kawasaki" theory

516
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,860
- Hotohara...

517
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,000
We should enter national highway 246

518
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,200
National highway 246, got it, let's go

519
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,200
- Yeah, let's go

520
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,510
We're too much inside the city, after all

521
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,510
I agree    - Right

522
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,480
Let's go a bit further and ask over there

523
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,480
- Alright

524
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,120
Team Ohtake lost its gamble,
and now they're headed to Kawasaki

00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:34,460
Team Mimura

536
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:34,460
Meanwhile, Team Mimura is headed to Musashi Koyama,
being that Miyasako is familiar with Meguro

537
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,960
Oh! That's Atré!

538
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,600
So this...    - We're in Meguro

539
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,470
That's Meguro Station

540
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,230
And now we're out Yamate Avenue

541
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,230
If I recall correctly, it's on the left after Yamate

542
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,230
I know this place

543
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,540
I think that's the right choice

544
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,060
Yeah, it should be towards Gotanda

545
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,510
What do you think about it, Rola?

546
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,010
Well, let's see... I don't really know!

547
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,110
What?!

548
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,180
Just kidding! I think we're good!

549
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,180
Can I exit from the right?

550
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,080
That's what drivers hate the most

551
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,950
When someone drives shaking around

552
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,720
Can the human-SATNAV Miyasako grant them the victory?

553
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:03,980
Current
location

554
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:08,460
Meguro

555
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:08,460
Musashi Koyama

556
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:08,460
Musashi Koyama

557
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:08,460
Shibuya

558
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:08,460
Shortest route

559
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,460
Enters Yamate-dori avenue

560
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,460
Team Mimura

561
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,650
Current
location

562
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,460
Current
location

563
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:13,930
Finally has arrived to Shibuya

564
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:13,930
Team Matsumoto

565
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,330
At that same time, Team Matsumoto has arrived to Shibuya

566
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,760
Shibuya, again...

567
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,100
Yeah but we were the slowest last time too, right?

568
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,340
But in the end we won!

569
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,010
Let's go over there, come on!

570
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,010
- Over there, got it

571
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:31,050
2 cards left for Team Matsumoto

572
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:31,050
USED

573
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,580
Matsumoto insists on using their second card,
so they're headed to that certain place...

574
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,310
This is Hikarie, isn't it?!

575
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,420
It's Hikarie! That's exactly it!

576
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
That's right, this place...

577
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,490
It's the most crowded spot in Shibuya...

578
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,490
- That's right

579
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,560
Shit, who should we ask, Matsumoto?

580
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,560
Ah! This guy!

581
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,130
Ah, but he's carrying a suitcase...

582
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,130
Matsumoto?

583
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,800
He's an AMANO employee

584
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,800
I mean, the AMANO corp.

585
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,500
But he's "AMANO" like me, isn't this fate? Let's ask him!

586
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,120
Oh, 'cause you're both Amano?

587
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,370
No-SATNAV Rally

588
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,370
One team member can ask a passerby for directions,
but he/she isn't allowed to take any notes

589
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,370
m 0 0 l -30 0 l -30 20 l 30 20 l 30 0 l 0 0

590
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,370
Let's ask the guys with the AMANO bag   - That guy?

591
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,440
Come on, just go
- Are you?

592
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,940
Can I?
- Yeah, just do it

593
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,880
We can't ask just one guy, we should ask more people

594
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,880
Counting on you!

595
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,520
Yes, him!
- Go ask him!

596
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,590
You're holding an AMANO bag, can I ask you something?

597
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,550
Please come closer

598
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,050
It's the name of my company

599
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,330
The AMANO corp.? That famous one?
- That's right

600
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,560
What is it about?

601
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,570
It focuses on time recorders

602
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,570
Time recorders? Those things?

603
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,570
I came here from Fukuoka, today

604
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,570
From Fukuoka?!

605
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,880
Huh? What's wrong?

606
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,340
What's going on?

607
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,940
Huh? What now?

608
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,380
He said he came from Fukuoka

609
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,380
- What? Really?

610
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,450
What's the problem?

611
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,250
He's out!

612
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,620
He said he came from Fukuoka, after all

613
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,680
Geez!

614
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,490
Do we have to ask him anyway, now that we've picked him?

615
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,970
Can we change?
- You can't, ask him

616
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:52,530
No-SATNAV Rally

617
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:52,530
Once you choose someone, you can't change

618
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:52,530
m 0 0 l -30 0 l -30 20 l 30 20 l 30 0 l 0 0

619
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,790
Well, let's ask him, he may know it
- We have to choose him?!

620
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,230
Alright, we wanted to ask you something
- Well, we have to ask him...

621
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:10,680
Pedestrian cards

622
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:10,680
Team Matsumoto

623
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:10,680
USED

624
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,040
I'm asking it anyway

625
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,740
Do you happen to know where's Musashi Kosugi?

626
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:10,680
IN USE

627
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,700
Nope

628
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,680
He doesn't know

629
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,120
Huh?! What now?
- Well, thanks!

630
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,040
We're screwed     - No good?

631
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,060
He doesn't know
- That sucks!

632
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:18,220
I told you that suitcase for trips was suspicious!

633
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,220
- You were right

634
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,620
Amano!

635
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,990
Holy crap!

636
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:32,270
USED

637
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:32,270
USED

638
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:32,270
A joker from Fukuoka

639
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:27,500
Amano felt this weird fate,
and now Team Matsumoto is in trouble

640
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,960
They only have a single pedestrian card left

641
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,470
After the tragedy, Team Ohtake heads to Shibuya as well

642
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,470
Akasaka TBS

643
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,470
Shibuya

644
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,470

Team Matsumoto

646
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,470
Team Ohtake

647
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,470
Really close to Shibuya

648
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,470
Team Ohtake

649
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,870
Who's going?

650
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,870
Who should go?

651
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,240
Who's going to ask?

652
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,210
Can you do it?

653
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,210
Yeah I can do it, no problem!

654
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,210
We're counting on you this time

655
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,610
So, where are we headed?

656
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,980
Musashi Kosugi!

657
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,980
That's right, you got that

658
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:55,120
USED

659
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:54,090
Can Nana's charm bring them a useful hint, this time?

660
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:55,120
Time to use their second card

661
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,460
They can't afford to make another mistake
like the Thailand-based pedestrian they just met

662
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,460
Thailand isn't an option anymore

663
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,130
How about one of those salarymen?

664
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:05,170
No SATNAV Rally

665
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:05,170
One team member can ask a passerby for directions,
but he/she isn't allowed to take any notes

667
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,130
- You're right

668
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,170
Should I ask him? Hey, wait a second!

669
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,740
Excuse me!

670
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,640
Sorry, do you have few minutes for us?

671
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,860
We're doing a TV show, I wanted to ask you something

672
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,440
Is it okay for you?
- Sure

673
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,380
So...

674
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,210
Do you happen to know Musashi Kosugi?

675
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,210
I do!

676
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,880
You really know Musashi Kosugi?!

677
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,880
- Yes, I do

678
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,320
He knows it!

679
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,180
That's where my company is

680
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,690
Is that where you company is?!

681
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,820
I'm so happy right now!

682
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,160
Nana seems happy

683
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,160
- Good, what's going on?

684
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,530
I wanted to ask you in which prefecture it is,
or which station we can find near it

685
00:18:32,360 --> 00:19:01,760
Pedestrian cards

686
00:18:32,360 --> 00:19:01,760

IN USE

689
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,530
It's in Nakahara, near Kawasaki city

690
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,180
Kawasaki city, right?
- Yes, Nakahara prefecture

691
00:18:41,800 --> 00:19:01,760
Kawasaki city, Nakahara prefecture

692
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,260
Wait a second, Kawasaki city...

693
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:54,060
The closest station is of course Musashi Kosugi,
you can reach it with the Toyoko line from Shibuya

694
00:18:53,950 --> 00:19:01,760
Toyoko line from Shibuya

695
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,980
Wait a second, too many informations!
- You can take it from here

696
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,080
Just head towards Yokohama

697
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,760
Yokohama, right? And it's in Nakahara...
- That's right

698
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,760
Direction: Yokohama

699
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,620
What bugs me...

700
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,590
Isn't how that guy is gonna explain anything

701
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,440
Yeah, if she gets back here...

702
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,930
I'm worried about Nana, can she remember anything at all?

703
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,930
That's the problem

704
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,970
Nakahara prefecture, Musashi Kosugi station

705
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,970
Correct

706
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,700
Is there something else I need you to ask?

707
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,540
Remember those two: Nakahara prefecture and the station

708
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,540
Ok, got it!

709
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,610
I really got it, thank you!

710
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,940
- Don't worry, go for it

711
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,940
You really saved us!

712
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,310
Thank you so much!

713
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,580
Nakahara prefecture! Nakahara, Nakahara!

714
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,450
A miracle happened, guys!

715
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,540
What is it?

716
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,520
It's in Nakahara prefecture!

717
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,520
- Get in, quick!

718
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,590
We hit the jackpot, guys!

719
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,590
Nakahara, you said?

720
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,420
So it's not inside Tokyo?

721
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,370
It's towards Yokohama, right?

722
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,960
It is, yeah

723
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,330
So Kawasaki should do it?

724
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,330
Yes, it's the same direction

725
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,530
That man was really the best we could find

726
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,230
Why is that?

727
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,630
I know you won't believe it

728
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:48,000
But he actually works in Musashi Kosugi!

729
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,000
Really?! You gotta be kidding me!

730
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,760
That's unbelievable!

731
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,970
For real...

732
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,640
Did he tell you in detail?
- Of course

733
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,980
We know there's a "Musashi Kosugi" station

734
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,980
- Alright, its station

735
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,610
That's all I got, but it should do it

736
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,380
No way, where do we have to go from here?

737
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,610
Huh?

738
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,610
What did he say?

739
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,280
He said we're fine as long as we head to Yokohama

740
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,580
No way, that's...

741
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,050
Yokohama is way too huge!

742
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,460
Did he tell you which avenue we should take?

743
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,490
Like, street names?

744
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,730
Or something near them?

745
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,630
But you didn't tell me to ask him that!

746
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,630
Like, which highway should we take...

747
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,870
But you didn't tell me!

748
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,870
We did, we did!

749
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,870
You did not!

750
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,270
Alright, let's just go
- Yeah, let's not waste time

751
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,470
As long as we go towards Kawasaki, we're good, right?

752
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,470
That's right!
- Alright, that's it

753
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,510
She's a genius, a genius!

754
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,510
I'm so glad I am!

755
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,450
She forgot to ask how to reach it

756
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:35,580
"Towards Ishikawa" - got some precious info

757
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:35,580
Team Ohtake

758
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:35,580
But now they know they should go
towards Ishikawa, instead of Suginami.

759
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,790
Meanwhile, Team Matsumoto left Shibuya

760
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,920
Current
location

761
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:45,390
Musashi Kosugi

762
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:45,390
Shibuya

763
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:45,390
Shortest route

764
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:45,390
Team Matsumoto

765
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:45,390
Took Meiji-doori and they're headed South

766
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:45,390
Current
location

767
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,440
And they're headed on South Meiji-doori

768
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,720
Now they're a bit closer to the shortest route

769
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,590
- What should we do?

770
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,590
I don't want to lose!

771
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,530
I don't want to lose, but I have no clue!

772
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,530
Me too!

773
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,600
Let's think again about what the first guy said

774
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,300
Yeah, he said...
- It's around Yokohama, right?

775
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:52,930
Info from the passerby

776
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:52,930
Team Matsumoto

777
00:20:52,930 --> 00:21:05,750
Info from the passerby

778
00:20:52,930 --> 00:21:05,750
Team Matsumoto

779
00:20:54,300 --> 00:21:00,510
He said Yokohama Direction, and to go
to Toyama line from Shibuya

780
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:05,750
Yokohama Direction

781
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:05,750
Shibuya

782
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,750
Toyama line

783
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,520
If we're gonna trust him, we should just
follow this road and we're in the right path

784
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,750
Is that true?    - Yes

785
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,620
Alright, let's go then, let's give it a shot

786
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,950
This is the same direction as Jiyugaoka, though

787
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:18,960
They chose to enter Komazawa avenue,
near the Toyoko line, which is close to the shortest route

788
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,020
Current
Location

789
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:19,960

Musashi Kosugi

791
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:19,960
Nakahara

792
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:19,960
Shibuya

793
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:19,960
Shortest route

794
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:19,960
Heading to Komazawa avenue, intersected with Toyoko line

795
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:19,960
Team Matsumoto

798
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,160
Team Ohtake leaves Shibuya too,
as if following Team Matsumoto

799
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,970
Current

800
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,970

Going south to Yamate-doori

806
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:29,970
Team Ohtake

807
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,270
Trusting their guts, they're about to enter Yamate-doori

808
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,160
So, now that we're here...

809
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,510
Are we going right?

810
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,910
Both Kawasaki and Yokohama
are on the right, if I'm not wrong

811
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,910
Yeah, that's right

812
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,510
But where are we supposed to turn?

813
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,580
In Nakahara ward?

814
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,580
Nakahara ward...

815
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,680
Hey, isn't "Nakahara Highway" a thing?

816
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,420
Nice move, again

817
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,470
I hear that a lot
- I know Nakahara Highway

818
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,420
Right? It's not an unfamiliar name
- I heard of it

819
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,920
Like, in the traffic news...
- I guess it's...

820
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,590
Probably it's a highway in Nakahara ward?

821
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,360
I think it's possible, they have the same name...

822
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,070
Nakahara Highway, you mean?

823
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,040
I think that's it
- Makes sense

824
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,740
Are we really sure?
- I think so

825
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,570
So we should just move to Nakahara Highway, right?

826
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,710
But it's not around here, is it?

827
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,120
Udo's intuition served a nice move!

828
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:18,720
Meguro

829
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:18,720
Musashi Kosugi

830
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:18,720
Musashi Koyama

00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:18,720
Shibuya

832
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:18,720
Shortest route

833
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:18,720
Got a hint from "Nakahara Ward", nice move!

834
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:18,720
Team Ohtake

835
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:18,320
He remembered "Nakahara Highway" from
"Nakahara Ward", it's the shortest route!

836
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:25,230
Arrived in Musashi Koyama

837
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:25,230
Team Mimura

838
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,230
Team Mimura has arrived in Musashi Koyama,
as they plan on using a pedestrian card

839
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,530
No one's around...

840
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,530
Shit, there's not a single soul in here!

841
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,360
Deserted.

842
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,360
Well, we should ask somebody anyway

843
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,000
Rola?
- Ah! There's someone there!

844
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,040
- I'm going, let me go
Go for it!

845
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,770
Remember, it's Musashi Kosugi!

846
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,770
Got it!

847
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,040
Excuse me, mister!

848
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,620
Can I ask you some directions?

849
00:22:42,410 --> 00:23:04,230
Pedestrian cards

850
00:22:42,410 --> 00:23:04,230
Team Mimura

851
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,080
Uhm, what was it...

852
00:22:44,980 --> 00:23:04,230
IN USE

853
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,580
Do you happen to know where's Musashi Kosugi?
- Well, it's not here

854
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,220
It's not where we're now, you know

855
00:22:49,750 --> 00:23:04,230
Mukashi Kosugi isn't here

856
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,020
Which way should we go by car?    - That way, I guess

857
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,070
Which road is it? Which number?

858
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,370
It's Naka...

859
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,200
I don't remember!

860
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,330
Ah? Really? Naka-something, right? Thanks!

861
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:04,230
"Naka... something" street

862
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,730
He said it's not around here at all!

863
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,730
Are you kidding me?!

864
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,170
He said we should head "Naka-something" from here

865
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,870
Eh? What?
- Naka...?

866
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,870
Naka-something!

867
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,370
Naka-something? What's that?

868
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,370
He said he didn't know and he left

869
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,880
Eh? W-Wait, gimme a sec...
- But he said...

870
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,080
He said it's not here, we're completely off

871
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,080
Completely off?

872
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,080
Completely off?

873
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,650
He said "this is Koyama, you know!"

874
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,520
So Koyama and Kosugi aren't close to each other?

875
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,520
Seems like it

876
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,760
Maybe it's Nakahara Highway?

877
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,390
- I was thinking the same

878
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,390
Yep, it could be

879
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,460
We made such a huge mistake!

880
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,460
Huge mistake!

881
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,460
- Oh crap, what now?

882
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,660
Team Mimura can't hide their panic after discovering

883
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:43,170
"Koyama" and Kosugi aren't close: panic

884
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:43,170
Team Mimura

885
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,170
That Musashi Koyama and Kosugi aren't close

886
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:50,180
Nakahara Highway draws near!
But they don't know it's the shortest route

887
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,620
They're actually the closest team to Nakahara Highway,

888
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,180
But the tension in their car is rising

889
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,080
Right now, the map inside my head is completely blank

890
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,620
I mean, I've never ever in my entire life

891
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,790
Moved from Koyama to Kosugi!

892
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,790
- Me neither

893
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:07,260
No SATNAV Rally

894
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:07,260
They decide to call another team
to calm down their uneasiness

895
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:07,260
While driving, you can call
another team with your mobile phone

896
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:07,260
m 0 0 l -30 0 l -30 20 l 30 20 l 30 0 l 0 0

897
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,940
Maybe if we go a bit further, we can...
- It's ringing

898
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:15,140
Who is it?

899
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,140
Black car

900
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,140
Black? Oh boy

901
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,480
Hello? Have you arrived?
- Not yet, but we're almost there!

902
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:27,450
Talking to another team to get more info

903
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,160
What about you, Rola?

904
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,860
Eh? We're lost!
- Are you lost?

905
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,450
That's right!
- Where did you get lost?

906
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,720
That's right!

907
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,760
I have no clue what Udo-chan is saying

908
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,960
- Wait a moment, Rola!

909
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,130
I'll let you talk to my friend here!

910
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,260
Hello? Is it Rola?

911
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,820
Ah! Nana-chan!

912
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,530
Say, say, how is it going over there?
- We're on the right path, right?

913
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,670
Where are you guys, right now?

914
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,670
- Right now?

915
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,700
Well, I don't really want to tell you

916
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,210
We're heading the right way, so we can't!

917
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,210
Look! It says "Nakahara Highway" over there!

918
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,660
No way! Come on, tell me

919
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,480
Look! It's "Nakahara Highway"!

920
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,440
- We haven't arrived yet, but...

921
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,920
We're headed to somewhere which
should be the right spot, so we can't tell ya

922
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,860
Aw, come on!

923
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:10,890
Overwhelmed by joy

924
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,120
Yep
- Let me speak to Udo again

925
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,890
Yep, gimme a sec
- Sure!

926
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,930
Team Ohtake

927
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,930
While on the phone, "Nakahara Highway" has been spotted!

928
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,930
They found Nakahara Highway during their call!

929
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,280
Be careful, ok?

930
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,860
It's not the right time to chitchat with Rola

931
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:24,310
So they hurry up and hang the phone
to reach the shortcut to their triumph!

932
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:24,600
Team Ohtake

933
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:24,600
They hung up in a hurry
to finally enter Nakahara Highway !!

934
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,800
Team Matsumoto moves to Komazawa avenue

935
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:34,610
Current
location

936
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:34,610
Futako Tamagawa

937
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:34,610
Meguro

938
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:34,610
Musashi Kosugi

939
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:34,610
Nakahara
Highway

940
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:34,610
Shortest route

941
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:34,610
Komazawa avenue: moving south

942
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:34,610
Team Matsumoto

943
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,900
Everything seems to go just fine, but then...

944
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,950
I feel like if we go pass Nikotama
something good might pop out, you know!

945
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,020
"Kaminoge"...?

946
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,430
Should we head to Nikotama?

947
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,320
Nikotama, you say?

948
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:50,200
Nikotama has something to it...
which, you know, makes me spark!

949
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,770
What's the meaning of this spark?

950
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,400
I don't really know myself, it's a gut feeling
- Should we do it?

951
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:02,740
Only 1 card left
The last one will be used in Futako Tamagawa!

952
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:02,740
Team Matsumoto

953
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,880
They're now headed to Futako Tamagawa

954
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,740
Will they use their last card efficiently?

955
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:13,090
They  haven't realized they're already on the shortest route

956
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:12,290
Team Mimura is currently on Nakahara Highway,
they're drawing closer to a fateful crossroad

957
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:13,090
Current
location

958
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:13,090
Futako Tamagawa

959
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:13,090
Musashi Kosugi

960
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:13,090
Musashi Koyama

961
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:13,090
Nakahara
Highway

962
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:13,090
Shortest route

963
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:13,090
Team Mimura

964
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,390
Omori?

965
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,220
This way leads to Omori

966
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:20,270
Omori Koenji on the right,
and Marukobashi if we go straight

967
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,330
Should we turn or...?
- Tsunashima? It's Kannana road, isn't it?

968
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,570
Raise your hand if you think
Kannana road is on the left!

969
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,570
I do

970
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,100
Me too

971
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,470
If that's it, me too!

972
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,870
"If that's it"? Are we going right?

973
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,940
Let's go that way
- It could be after Marukobashi

974
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,780
So you think it's ahead?
- Maybe we don't need to hit Kannana road

975
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,310
Should we just go left for now?

976
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,220
Alright, I'm turning left

977
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,850
It's Ohta ward over there

978
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,120
Musashi Kosugi is in Ohta ward, right?

979
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,920
I have this feeling that I've heard before
about Musashi Kosugi being in Ohta

980
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,360
It does sound good, doesn't it?

981
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,360
It does, it does!

982
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,460
Current

983
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:01,200

Musashi Kosugi

985
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:01,200
Musashi Koyama

986
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:01,200
Nakahara
Highway

987
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:01,200
Shortest route

988
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:01,200
Team Mimura

989
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:01,200
Turning left on Kannana: a regretful mistake

990
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,820
That's of course a mistake

991
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,940
Current
location

992
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,200
The top team gets off the shortest route,
and the race faces an unexpected turn of events!

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,200
Current
location

994
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,970
Once more, they head South from Komazawa avenue

995
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,970
Team Matsumoto

996
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:07,490
Meanwhile, Team Matsumoto picked Futako Tamagawa
as the place to use their next pedestrian card

997
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,810
We're in Futako, huh

998
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,810
We're basically inside Setagaya ward!

999
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,980
Where are we now?

1000
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,980
It's Komazawa Park

1001
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,980
I'm thinking, maybe...

1002
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:19,780
There's a big chance
we'll actually end up in some uncharted land

1003
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,780
That would suck...     - Can't deny it!

1004
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,960
I tell ya, I feel like I'm 70% sure about it!

1005
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,960
- No way!

1006
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,590
Now I'm not that confident anymore

1007
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,590
It could be, statistically
- Of course

1008
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,730
That's right, Team Matsumoto isn't on the right route

1009
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:34,170
Hurrying to Futako Tamagawa to get hints

1010
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,630
Current

1011
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:34,170

Musashi Kosugi

1014
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:34,170
Nakahara
Highway

1015
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:34,170
Shortest route

1016
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:34,170
Team Matsumoto

Current

1018
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,170
They haste their way to Futako Tamagawa to get a hint

1019
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:39,140
Meanwhile, Team Mimura left Nakahara Highway
and they're about to find out something...

1020
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:39,140
Team Mimura

1021
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:39,140
They left the shortest route and they're wandering around

1022
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,840
That's Musashi Nitta station!

1023
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,210
Oh! Is that...?

1024
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,640
We're close!

1025
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,480
- It's Musashi Nitta, though...

1026
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,440
We don't know if it's actually close,
I didn't know "Musashi Nitta" was even a thing!

1027
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,350
Musashi Nitta, huh...
- But it should be good!

1028
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,880
- I guess so
- It's still "Musashi"

1029
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,250
Maybe we should ask around here too

1030
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,600
Team Mimura just saw the sign for Musashi Nitta

1031
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,260
They just found Musashi Nitta and they're going nuts

1032
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,020
Captain Mimura himself decides to use their 2nd card

1033
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:05,270
Second card: it's time to use it

1034
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:05,270
USED

1035
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,270
Will he bring his team some precious info?

1036
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,700
Excuse me, can I ask you something?

1037
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:35,030
Pedestrian card

1038
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:35,030
Team Mimura

1039
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:35,030
USED

1040
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,440
Do you know where's Musashi Kosugi?

1041
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:35,030
IN USE

1042
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,140
Musashi Kosugi
is a bit over there!

1043
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,020
A bit over there?

1044
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,080
Yeah, I'd say... more than a bit

1045
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,080
More than a bit?

1046
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,100
How far away is it? 5 km or such?
- Yeah, that's about it

1047
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,520
So if I go straight down that road for 5 km...?

1048
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:35,030
- About 5 km from here

1049
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,120
As soon as you see Marukobashi, turn left

1050
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:35,030
-On the left of Marukobashi

1051
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,950
I think that's where Musashi Kosugi is

1052
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,280
I see, thanks so much!

1053
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,420
Sorry I can't help you that much! Just go ahead!

1054
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,420
Sure, thanks

1055
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,860
Alright!

1056
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,030
I did it!

1057
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,630
Really?
- That man told me

1058
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,100
If we go, like 5km straight from here...

1059
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,570
We arrive to Marukobashi at one point

1060
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,740
If we turn left as soon as we're there,

1061
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,810
We should be around Musashi Kosugi!

1062
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,340
Marukobashi? Was there such a thing?

1063
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,340
- Yes, definitely

1064
00:28:50,340 --> 00:29:00,820
King of Gyoza

1065
00:28:50,340 --> 00:29:00,820
Marukobashi

1066
00:28:50,340 --> 00:29:00,820
Musashi Kosugi

1067
00:28:50,340 --> 00:29:00,820
Shortest route

1068
00:28:50,510 --> 00:29:00,820
Going past this bridge
leads you to the goal!

1069
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,640
That's right, Marukobashi leads to the victory!

1070
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,440
Musashi Kosugi is right before you eyes
once you cross the bridge and pass Tamagawa!

1071
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,490
Marukobashi is their goal

1072
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,490
Team Mimura

1073
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,060
Thanks to Mimura's action,
the team draws closer to the victory!

1074
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,540
Meanwhile, Team Matsumoto is in Futako Tamagawa

1075
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:13,970

1076
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:13,970

00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:13,970
Shortest route

1080
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:13,970
Futako Tamagawa: arrived!

1081
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:13,970
Team Matsumoto

1082
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,970
They plan to use their last card!

1083
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,000
What should we do?

1084
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,000
We're in trouble, aren't we?

1085
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,220
We can't waste any time
- How about that guy?

1086
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,010
Mizonoguchi ahead and Komae on the right?

1087
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,400
- Mh? What's that?
- I feel like we're on the right way

1088
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,900
Do you recall these streets?
- I think so, can't remember

1089
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,990
Go ask someone, Matsumoto! Anyone's fine!

1090
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,560
- Alright, I'm going
- We're counting on you

1091
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,050
Matsumoto Hitoshi will set foot on Futako Tamagawa

1092
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:43,660
Matsumoto Hitoshi will set foot on Futako Tamagawa

1093
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,430
Matsumoto is about to set foot on Futako Tamagawa!

1094
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,960
For real?!

1095
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,730
Alright, I'm going

1096
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,730
- We're counting on you

1097
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:53,200
Last chance!

00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:53,200

USED

1100
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,570
Is this going to work?

1101
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:57,410
Excuse me, I have a question
for that one bespectacled dude

1102
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,180
Oh, sure, glad I can help

1103
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:28,970
Pedestrian card

1104
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:28,970

Do you... know where's Musashi Kosugi?

1108

IN USE

1109
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,700
Musashi Kosugi?

1110
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,040
You don't know, do you?
- Musashi Kosugi is straight ahead

1111
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,280
Really?!    - See?!

1112
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:28,970
Straight ahead

1113
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,040
Are you for real?

1114
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,160
See? I told you!
- I'm so happy!

1115
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,140
How far by car?

1116
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,700
It's really close by car     - Really?!

1117
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,060
How many kilometers?

1118
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,240
I'd say... about 5km      - Are you kidding me?!

1119
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:28,970
5km from here

1120
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,680
Thank you so much!

1121
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,940
We got really lucky, folks!    - Thanks!

1122
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,970
That's amazing! Thank you so much!

1123
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,040
Hope you'll spend a wonderful weekend!

1124
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,320
Really?! For real?!

1125
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,220
Is that true? Aren't you glad?

1126
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,950
You gotta be kidding me...

1127
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,950
We're only 5 km apart!

1128
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,950
I can't believe it, let's go!

1129
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,360
We're gonna be the first!

1130
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,090
I must be chosen by God!

1131
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,090
Can't believe it

1132
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,090
This is unbelievable

1133
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,090
Matsumoto, will you win again...?

1134
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,100
Isn't this something?

1135
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,100
It is
- Almost scary, I'd say

Nakahara

1140
00:30:51,100 --> 00:31:01,110
Shortest route

1141
00:30:51,100 --> 00:31:01,110
Team Matsumoto

1142
00:30:51,100 --> 00:31:01,110
The info they got isn't right!

1143
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,700
But actually, this info isn't correct at all

1144
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:01,110
If they don't turn left after the bridge,
they won't reach Musashi Kosugi

1145
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,250
Will they believe the info they got?

1146
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,180
They can't blame the pedestrian for it

1147
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,250
It's up to them whether to trust the info or not

1148
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:13,020
Meanwhile, something appears before Team Mimura

1149
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:13,250

Team Mimura

1156
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,820
Huh? Is that Tamagawa?

1157
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,720
T-Tamagawa? We haven't passed that
- I see...

1158
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,060
Do we have to get across the river?

1159
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,260
Do we have to?

1160
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,800
Of course we have to cross it!

1161
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,800
Yeah, that's right

1162
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,330
Maybe everyone's afraid to cross it...

1163
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,000
You mean like the previous episode?

1164
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,000
Exactly      - Oh boy...

1165
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,470
Ah! Marukobashi! That's it!

1166
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,980
Oh! You're right!
- It's Marukobashi!

1167
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,470
Let's cross it!
- Yeah!

1168
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:39,810
Crossing Marukobashi and
entering Kanagawa prefecture!

1169
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:39,810
Team Mimura

1170
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:39,810
Team Mimura went past Tamagawa from Marukobashi,
and they finally entered Kanagawa prefecture!

1171
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:45,150
And it's also in front of Team Ohtake in Nakahara highway!

1172
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:45,150
Current

1173
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:45,150

Team Ohtake

1179
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,350
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

1180
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,870
Looks like there's some sort of blockage

1181
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,890
Huh?

1182
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,730
So if we cross this bridge...

1183
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,730
- Mh? What? Ah, you mean if we cross it...

1184
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,060
We'll enter Kawasaki!

1185
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,060
- I think so, yeah

1186
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,300
So if we just cross it...

1187
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,800
Team Ohtake

1188
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,800
Without hesitation, they cross
Marukobashi and enter Kanagawa Prefecture!

1189
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,500
With no hesitation, they cross Marukobashi Bridge
and enter Kanagawa Prefecture

1190
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,800
And then...

1191
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,990
What should we do?

1192
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,910
Let's ask somebody!

1193
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,840
Right, we only have one card left

1194
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,610
Alright, let's stop here!

1195
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,610
H-How about here?

1196
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:16,620
Time for the long-awaited third card!

1197
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:16,620
USED

1198
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:16,620
USED

1199
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,620
They stop the car to promptly use their last card!

1200
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,620
How about you go, Udo?

1201
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,620
Me? Really?    - Yeah

1202
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,720
Oh boy...

1203
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,320
We're counting on you
- Counting on you!

1204
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,290
Alright

1205
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,760
Excuse me!

1206
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,360
Excuse me, good morning

1207
00:32:27,690 --> 00:33:03,960
Pedestrian card

1208
00:32:27,690 --> 00:33:03,960

1209
00:32:27,690 --> 00:33:03,960

1210
00:32:27,690 --> 00:33:03,960
USED

1211
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,720
We have to go to Musashi Kosugi's King of Gyoza...

1212
00:32:30,400 --> 00:33:03,960
IN USE

1213
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,760
Do you know how to get there?

1214
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,800
King of Gyoza, right? It's not really that easy, but...

1215
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,580
You have to turn right over there

1216
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,580
At the traffic lights?

1217
00:32:43,780 --> 00:33:03,960
Turn right at the traffic lights

1218
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,650
Yes, and then you end up near the station

1219
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,520
You mean Musashi Kosugi's station?!      - Yes

1220
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,250
Oh, he's pointing his finger

1221
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,120
He's being really accurate!

1222
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,620
That's great news!

1223
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,620
It's close!

1224
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,280
So, there's a gas station in here

1225
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,400
Turn left on that, and it's immediately on the right

1226
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,960
Turn left at the gas station

1227
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,620
Thank you! Thank you so much!

1228
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,960
Sorry for the trouble! Thanks so much!

1229
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,200
Hop in, Udo-chan!

1230
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,400
Seems like he told you every detail about it!

1231
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,180
This is incredible!

1232
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,470
That guy was spot on for this!

1233
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,470
What? What did he tell you, Udo-chan?

1234
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,710
We just have to follow this road

1235
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,710
We're on the right track, it's this street!

1236
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,880
Really?! We were right?

1237
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,110
So, as you can see

1238
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,380
At those traffic lights, we have to turn right...

1239
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,820
Huh? Which ones?

1240
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,820
The second ones, we have to turn right at those

1241
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,120
And after we entered that street, we go straight

1242
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,950
Burp

1243
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,090
I didn't mean to burp, sorry!

1244
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,690
Sorry, it's that...

1245
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:34,960
Right now?!

1246
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:41,330
It's because I spoke so much in just one breath!

1247
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,970
So, we have to turn right on that...

1248
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,740
Alright, for now let's just move over there, ok?

1249
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,740
Yeah!

1250
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,610
Yet another nice move from Udo!

1251
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:55,510
Team Ohtake

1252
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:55,510
Their last card was a huge success!
They haste their way to their goal!

1253
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,750
They got the info not only for Kosugi's station,
but for their goal, King of Gyoza, as well!

1254
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,210
Victory draws near

1255
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:00,850
Meanwhile, Team Mimura is ready to use their last card

1256
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,850
It's finally time to use it

1257
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,850
USED

1258
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,850
USED

1259
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:04,020
Should we ask?

1260
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,020
Yeah, let's do it!

1261
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,020
Yes

1262
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,760
Musashi Kosugi...

1263
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,330
Sure

1264
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,330
Wanna go, Rola?

1265
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:11,330
Who will be the fateful last pedestrian?

1266
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,430
Hi! Can I ask you something?

1267
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,430
Hi!

1268
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,000
Hey, it's Rola!    - Yep!

1269
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:31,280
Pedestrian card

1270
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:31,280
Team Mimura

1271
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:31,280
USED

1272
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:31,280
USED

1273
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,760
We're filming an episode of Lincoln

1274
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,680
And we're completely lost

1275
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:31,280
IN USE

1276
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,570
Do you know where's Musashi Kosugi?

1277
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,080
Just turn right at the 2nd traffic lights you see

1278
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,560
All we have to do is to turn there to reach it?

1279
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:31,280
Turn right at the 2nd traffic lights

1280
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,560
- That's right!

1281
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,460
Thanks a bunch!

1282
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,100
Yay!

1283
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,820
He said we have to turn right at the
2nd traffic lights and we're in Musashi Kosugi!

1284
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,820
Oh! That's amazing!     - Hop in, quick!

1285
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:47,330
Team Miyasako

1286
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:47,330
They follow a difficult road only a resident
would know, it's time to go!

1287
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,920
They got some really accurate info!

1288
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,720
Only a local would know the road
they're currently heading towards to

1289
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,860
And then...

1290
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,840
It says "Kosugi Building"!

1291
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,140
Isn't that "Kosugi" from "Musashi Kosugi"?
- Must be it!

1292
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:54,940
Aaaah!

1293
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,540
We did it!

1294
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,540
What?! Really?

1295
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,700
It says "Musashi Kosugi Station"!

1296
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:01,610
Musashi Kosugi Station has been found!

1297
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:01,610
Team Mimura

1298
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,720
Alright!

1299
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,610
All that's left now...   - It's King of Gyoza!

1300
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,120
We made it!

1301
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,850
We can't ask anymore, right?

1302
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,850
Yeah, we ran out of cards

1303
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,160
But I don't think it's that far away from the station

1304
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,160
- You're right

1305
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,030
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!

1306
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,030
I wonder where it is...

1307
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:20,770
Finally Musashi Kosugi appears!
Now they have to search for the shop

1308
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:20,770
Team Miyasako

1309
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,140
Musashi Kosugi Station has finally been spotted!

1310
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:20,060
Now they have to find King of Gyoza by themselves

1311
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,840
And, at the same time, it's before Ohtake Team's eyes too!

1312
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:25,840
Right before their eyes!

1313
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:25,840
Team Ohtake

1314
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,710
Isn't that a station?

1315
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,710
That's Musashi Kosugi Station isn't it?

1316
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,110
Ah! Oh my!

1317
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,110
It's Musashi Kosugi!

1318
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,110
Musashi Kosugi!

1319
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,110
Musashi Kosugi, that's it!

1320
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,840
Here it is!

1321
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,780
Musashi Kosugi Station: Spotted!

1322
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,780
Team Ohtake

1323
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,780
It's Musashi Kosugi Station!

1324
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,080
We have to turn left at ENEOS!

1325
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,500
Turn left!
- Really?!

1326
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,520
That's it! It's on the left!

1327
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,640
On the left of ENEOS?     - Yes!

1328
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,690
Alright!
- Looking good, guys!

1329
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,620
We actually made it!

1330
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:50,900
King of Gyoza
Musashi Kosugi

1331
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:50,900
Marukobashi

1332
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,900
Two teams in close game!

1333
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,130
Unbelievably enough, two teams spot it at the same time!

1334
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,230
But both teams ran out of pedestrian cards

1335
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:59,210
Pedestrian cards are
no longer in their hands...

1336
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:59,210
Team Mimura

1337
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:59,210
Team Ohtake

1338
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:59,210
They can only rely on their guts from this point on!

1339
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,940
I'm currently right before today's goal,
the King of Gyoza shop in Musashi Kosugi

1340
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:09,050
Which team is going to be the first one to show up?

1341
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:13,020
Once they cut the goal tape and get inside the shop

1342
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,260
Their triumphant success will be awarded with...

1343
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,260
Their triumphant success will be awarded with...

1344
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,260
Their triumphant success will be awarded with...

1345
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,760
There's a banquet waiting for them!

1346
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:18,060
An all-you-can-eat banquet to celebrate!

1347
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:18,060
An all-you-can-eat banquet to celebrate!

1348
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:18,060
An all-you-can-eat banquet to celebrate!

1349
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,540
It's been two hours since they left Akasaka

1350
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:26,290
The fierce battle is finally reaching its climax!

1351
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:36,610
Who's gonna show up before the others?!

1352
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,000
Ah! I see a car!

1353
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I can see a car!

1354
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:36,610
*FIRST TEAM

1355
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,110
Who's gonna be the first team to show up?

Heated Discussion! Right answers 'til the next morning!

1357
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,780
The eight of them are offered a topic,
they have to debate to choose the right answer

1358
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,980
They'll have a debate over a certain topic
until they can get to the correct answer

1359
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:50,860
Which correct answer will they reveal tonight?!

1360
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:50,860
Which correct answer will they reveal tonight?

1361
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,960
Let's move on, here's our next question

1362
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,430
Voice: Yuko Aoki (TBS Announcer)

1363
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,430
What's the character kids love the most
which starts with the syllabe "to"?

1364
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:01,100
Huh?!    - There are a lot, actually...

1365
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:32,730
What's the character kids love the most

which starts with the syllabe "to"?

1366
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:32,730
m -51 -24 l 59 -24 l 59 16 l -51 16

1367

Tori (a bird)?

1368
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,770
A bird?!

1369
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,440
We're talking about characters!

1370
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,200
That's just an animal

1371
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,710
The hell is wrong with you?

1372
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,240
It's a bird!

1373
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,610
It's a bird! You know, they say it

1374
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:15,050
A character?

1375
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:20,820
I wish there would be more syllabes...

1376
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,400
I'm not really sure

1377
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,340
What do you mean?

1378
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,660
I have no idea, really

1379
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,760
What's wrong?     - I made my decision

1380
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,860
I'm sure it's this one!

1381
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,060
Wanna go first?

1382
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,060
Sure, why not...

Tokoton Toshiko?

1402

And it's the most liked by kids??

1403
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,920
I think that's the number one pick for kids nowadays...

1404
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,920
That's the one barber shops have...

Tokoton Toshiko not even once in my life!

00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:21,610
Totoro

1425
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,270
It starts with "to" even if you add "Tonari no"!

1426
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,680
- You're right

1427
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,110
Well, the same goes for Tokoton Toshiko!

1428
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,110
It's fine as "Toshiko" alone too

1429
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,610
Of course it's not Tokoton Toshiko

1430
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,450
"Toshiko" alone isn't the right answer too!

1431
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,920
Toshiko...

1432
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,250
"Tonari no Toshiko" works fine too!

1433
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,620
You don't know if Toshiko is your neighbor, do you?!

1434
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,010
I mean, are you sure she's not your neighbor?

1435
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,010
- Shut the fuck up!

1436
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:35,630
Totoro, huh...
- I think we got it, what do you think?

1437
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,930
Toshiko~

1438
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,400
I mean, everybody knows him, right?

1439
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,930
Toshiko~

1440
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,740
Everyone is familiar with it, right?

1441
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:42,370
Toshiko~

1442
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,370
Toshiko~

1443
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,800
Toshiko~

1444
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,800
You seriously need to shut up

1445
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,800
Toshiko~

1446
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,110
He's lost it

1447
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:51,380
My Neighbor Toshiko~

1448
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,380
Isn't that the main theme from Totoro?

1449
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,740
Of course it is... Come on, next up

1450
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,810
Come on, Hotohara

1451
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,880
I went for Thomas

1452
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:08,330
Amano

1453
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:08,330
Hamada

1454
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:08,330
Heated discussion!
Right answers
'til the next morning!

1455
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:08,330
Hotohara

1456
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:08,330
Matsumoto

1457
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:08,330
Mimura

1458
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:08,330
Miyasako

1459
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:08,330
Ohtake

1460
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:08,330
Tokoton Toshiko

1461
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:08,330
Totoro

1462
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:08,330
Totoro

1463
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:08,330
Totoro

1464
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:08,330
Udo

1465
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,140
Oh! Me too!

1466
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,280
Thomas

1467
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:08,330
Thomas

1468
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:08,330
Thomas

1469
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:08,330
Thomas

1470
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,150
That one doesn't count

1471
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:08,330
Thomas

1472
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,160
But it's "The Tank Engine"...
- Yeah, that comes first

1473
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,330
Makes sense...

1474
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,040
We didn't get a correct answer, right?

1475
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,330
How about we go for Totoro?

1476
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,330
No way, no way, no way, wait a sec

1477
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,670
Are you gonna fight for your answer?

1478
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,470
Well, if that's it...

1479
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,340
How about the number of to's in it?

1480
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,510
Number of "tos"?

1481
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,510
You only have 2 "to"s in Totoro

1482
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,480
But Tokoton Toshiko, on the other hand...

1483
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,680
Has three tos in its name!

1484
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,020
Is this what you're going for?

1485
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,780
Are you that desperate?

1486
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,850
The number of "to"s?

1487
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,180
With "tonari to" it's a tie!

1488
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,520
Something's definitely wrong with him!

1489
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,820
Miyasako, please, beat me up for good!

1490
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,590
Alright, Totoro wins!

1491
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,860
Alright, I admit defeat

1492
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:46,140
And so, the character starting with "to" kids love the most...

1493
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:49,130
Correct answer: Totoro

1494
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:49,130
What's the character kids love the most which starts with the syllabe "to"?

1495
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,860
Is Totoro, that's the correct answer!

1496
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:49,470
No-SATNAV Race
Second round - Big battle!

1497
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:53,160
Big close contest for this 2nd round of No-SATNAV race!

1498
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,540
No-SATNAV Race
Second round - Big battle!

1499
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,540
No-SATNAV Race
Second round - Big battle!

1500
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,270
I'd say... about 5km

1501
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,910
Are you kidding me?!

1502
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:59,140
Aiming for their goal by relying on passerbies!

1503
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,240
Reach the goal by relying on pedestrians!

1504
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,140
Reach the goal by relying on pedestrians!

1505
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,900
Their goal is King of Gyoza in Musashi Kosugi

1506
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,920
It's been 2 hours since they started,
who will be the first team to show up?

1507
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,260
Ah! I see a car! I can see a car!

1508
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:18,660
First team arrived!

1509
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:18,660
Team Mimura

1510
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:18,230
The first car to show up is the black one,
the one belonging to Team Mimura!

1511
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,270
Let's see...

1512
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,730
There it is!

1513
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,420
Where is it?

1514
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,400
- It's right in front of us!

1515
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:28,340
The parking lot is full!
I can't get inside the parking area

1516
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,400
It's right there! Park over there!

1517
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:28,340
Just go there

1518
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,140
Come on! Quick!
- No, I can't...

1519
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,840
It's fine!
- I don't think it is

1520
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,110
Shit, no place to park here too!

1521
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,720
Full?
- But...

1522
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,720
It's full!

1523
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,520
Why is every parking lot full?

1524
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:42,850
Finally they spot King of Gyoza, their goal!

1525
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,850
Finally

1526
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,850
King of Gyoza

1527
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,850
was spotted!

1528
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:46,660
But every parking area around is full

1529
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,190
Every parking area around it is full...

1530
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:51,160
Around the same time, before Team Ohtake's eyes...

1531
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,770
Ah! I can see it!

1532
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,770
There it is! It's King of Gyoza!

1533
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,770
- There it is!

1534
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:59,960
I can see it! We just have to park the car now!

1535
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,960
- Come on, quick!

1536
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,010
I don't see a single parking spot

1537
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,010
No way!

1538
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:09,010
Two teams have found it around the same moment!

1539
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,860
Two teams just found King of Gyoza
around the same time!

1540
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,010
They stopped in two different parking spots

1541
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:14,350
Who will be
the first team to enter the shop?!

1542
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,640
Which team will be the first one to get in?

1543
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:13,050
Who will be
the first team to enter the shop?!

1544
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,060
We did it!
- Alright!

1545
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,060
No way! We made it!

1546
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,460
Let's cross it together!

1547
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,030
Good job!

1548
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,110
We did it!

1549
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,710
You're the first team to get here!

1550
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:36,140
First place:

1551
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:36,140
First place:

1552
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:36,140
First place:

1553
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:36,140
Team Ohtake

1554
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:36,140
Team Ohtake

1555
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:34,100
We're incredible!
- I'm so happy!

1556
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,140
We did it!
- We won!

1557
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,080
Being the first team to arrive, you can eat and drink
everything on the table, as much as you want

1558
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,460
You can also order more if you want to

1559
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,020
Please, enjoy your banquet!

1560
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,350
Thank you!

1561
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,320
Cheers!

1562
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,260
Yay, cheers!

1563
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,580
Delicious!

1564
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:58,560
Enjoying the taste of victory

1565
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,580
Team Ohtake enjoys the taste of victory

1566
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,470
And, a few moments later...

1567
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,820
Alright!

1568
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,220
Oh yeah!

1569
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,860
Good job!
- Oh shit! We're second!

1570
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,560
Second place goes to Team Mimura!    - We did it!

1571
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:13,010
Second place:

1572
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:13,010
Second place:

1573
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:13,010
Second place:

1574
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:13,010
Team Mimura

1575
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:13,010
Team Mimura

1576
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,900
We did it!

1577
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,210
yay!

1578
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:15,980
I really thought we were done for!

1579
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,720
Are you for real?

1580
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,720
But here you are!

1581
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,420
I got completely lost!

1582
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:22,380
Same for you guys, please enjoy your banquet!

1583
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,760
You can order as much as you want

1584
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,620
That's great, isn't it?

1585
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:33,600
Celebratory banquet for the 2nd team too

1586
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,420
Everything they order is on the last team

1587
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,060
Please enjoy the feast, Team Mimura!

1588
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,000
Meanwhile, the tailender Team Matsumoto...

1589
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,000
At the same time...

1590
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,940
Shit, this road just keeps on going!

1591
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,980
What?! That can't be good!

1592
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
This isn't good news

1593
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,240
Hey, isn't this Tomei Highway?

1594
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,240
We're heading to Tomei now

1595
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,980
Turn left and go back
- No way...

1596
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:52,020
We're gonna end up in Aichi!

1597
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,020
- We're doing really bad, aren't we?

1598
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,190
The hell is going on?!

1599
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,190
- Hey, Matsumoto!

1600
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,090
You gotta be kidding me...

1601
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,880
The team is getting further away from their goal

1602
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:03,090
Musashi Kosugi is now far, far away...

1603
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,100
And then, the sun sets

1604
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:10,100
The banquet is over

1605
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:10,100
The banquet is over

1606
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,360
By now, the banquet is already over

1607
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,820
Both teams ate as much as they could

1608
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:14,340
Both teams ate up to their fullest

1609
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:19,670
Tired of waiting, Hotohara decides to call Matsumoto

1610
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:20,110
2-times champion Hotohara hits up Matsumoto on the phone

1611
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:20,110
2-times champion Hotohara hits up Matsumoto on the phone

1612
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,380
I knew it would end like this

1613
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,750
Yeah, I wonder where did they end up to

1614
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,390
You've finished eating already?!

1615
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:31,560
Matsumoto is in an unexpected place! & paying up

1621
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,200
The party ends without Team Matsumoto showing up

1622
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,800
Both teams ate up to their fullest

1623
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,580
2-times champion Hotohara hits up Matsumoto on the phone

1624
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,900
And so, Hotohara decides to call Matsumoto

1625
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,050
Alright, I'll call Matsumoto
- I knew it would end like this

1626
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,410
Yeah, I wonder where did they end up to

1627
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,850
This isn't gonna be good news, is it?

1628
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:03,360
Yeah, definitely
- I'd hate it...

1629
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,690
Maybe someone already arrived?

1630
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,140
Which one is it?
- Orange car

1631
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,060
Orange car...
- Hello?

1632
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:11,260
Hello? Where are you now, Matsumoto?

1633
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,260
Well...

1634
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,330
I think we're almost there, I guess...

1635
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,900
Does he mean this shop? Or the area?
- We're...

1636
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,840
Huh? So you're close?

1637
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:23,440
Yeah, we're chatting about what we should order

1638
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,380
Virtually, we're already there!

1639
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:30,120
Please say something, Hoto-chan

1640
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,170
R-Right, Matsumoto...

1641
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,340
Yes?

1642
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,000
Actually...

1643
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,390
We're all already here at the shop

1644
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,790
Are you kidding me?

1645
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:42,330
Matsumoto, we already placed our orders

1646
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,690
You're kidding me, right?

1647
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,000
Not only that...ù

1648
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,000
He said both teams already arrived!

1649
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:53,140
The banquet has already started
- Really?!

1650
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,810
No way!

1651
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:56,640
Is this the ending part?!

1652
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,010
How many minutes ago did you get there?

1653
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:00,510
We arrived about 1 hour ago!

1654
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:02,180
One hour ago?!

1655
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,880
Isn't that the King of Gyoza?

1656
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,880
Huh?

1657
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,690
I think it's--- huh...

1658
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:11,160
We just saw a King of Gyoza right now

1659
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:13,750
Don't go away, please!

1660
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:15,460
Wait for us!

1661
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:17,640
I can see the shop! Isn't that it?

1662
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,640
This sucks!

1663
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,300
Is the shop like, under a railway?

1664
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,000
It's in Musashi Kosugi, duh

1665
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:24,270
Under a girder bridge, right?

1666
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,610
- Musashi...
- Yeah, it's under a girder bridge

1667
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:29,020
It says "Musashi Shinshiro"

1668
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,900
- "Musashi Shinshiro"...

1669
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,140
Ah, sorry, we're in Musashi Shinshiro

1670
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,980
Where the hell is that?! Never heard of it!

1671
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:36,980
Where are you going?!

1672
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,100
Wait a second, are you kidding me?
Wait for us, we're definitely getting there!

1673
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,320
Hey, you!

1674
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,190
Hoto-chan!

1675
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:46,460
30 minutes later

1676
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:46,460
And then, 30 minutes later...

1677
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:55,330
Now we'll reveal how much they'll have to pay

1678
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:55,330
Team Matsumoto (last) finally arrives!

This is just 2012 promo stuff I'm not gonna translate!

1685
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,480
No way...
- I can't believe it!

1686
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,980
This is a joke, right?

1687
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:10,280
The total is 61.335 yen

1688
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:10,900
This isn't even funny anymore
- How much did they eat?!
