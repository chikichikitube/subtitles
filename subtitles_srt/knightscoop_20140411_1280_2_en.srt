00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:08,620
Tonight's show is a compilation of clips falling under the theme "Knight Scoop reminds me of ...", and we can't possibly leave out this last category.

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,940
"Knight Scoop reminds me of 'Shock Footage'!"

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:18,220
The following 'Shock Footage' would be unthinkable on any show other than Knight Scoop, please take a look.

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,420
" ... comes from the 34 y/o Kitamura Takashi, a company employee living in Osaka."

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,140
"I haven't had a girlfriend in 34 years."

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:34,880
"I'm not very good-looking, so I was never popular and never had a girl confess her love to me."

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,680
"I've already given up on ever getting married."

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,580
"I've decided on spending my life alone."

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:50,960
"I have accepted my fate and come to terms with the truth that I will never have a girlfriend."

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:57,160
"But, I'd like to go on a date, even if it was just for one day. The gender doesn't matter."

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,780
"Detectives, won't you please go on a date with me?"

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,660
It seems he's already waiting over there.

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,780
Meeting the client

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,620
Kitamura? - Yes!

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,700
I'm Takeyama. - I'm Kitamura.

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,060
Good to see you.

17
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,120
We're with Tantei Knight Scoop.

18
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,120
Nice to meet you.

19
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,080
So you'd like to go on a date? - Yes!

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,080
And whether it's with a man or a woman, ... - It doesn't matter, that's right.

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,140
And I am ... - The girlfriend, yes.

22
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,440
Ah, I'm the girlfriend?

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:41,600
How come, in the hopes of getting a date, did you consult the Detectives instead of going marriage hunting?

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,020
Ah, I've tried that! It was no use!

25
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,580
I've always wanted to marry, but it's just not possible for me.

26
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:56,460
Ah, so you've come to think it's not possible? - Yes, so even if it's just one time, a single time, I want to go on a date.

27
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,200
So for this date, the gender doesn't matter to you ... - Not at all!

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,940
Not at all! - Not at all?

29
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,100
So even with me ... - Is completely fine!

30
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,520
I'll say it clearly, Takeyama, please, I want to go on a date with you!

31
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,180
You want to go on a date with me? I see.

32
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,580
What should we call each other? - Call me Ta-kun.

33
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,420
Heh? - Call me Ta-kun.

34
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,780
Then I'll be Take-chan? - Yes, Take-chan.

35
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,960
Then, shall we go on a date, Ta-kun? - Yes!

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,360
I'm looking forward to it, Take-chan! - So do I. What are we going to do?

37
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,580
Should we climb up there? - Yes, I'd like to go up and see the view.

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,580
Hanging gardens

39
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,200
I'm getting nervous. - Ah, when it goes up like that. - You too?

40
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,580
I'm not so good with heights.

41
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:55,420
More than friends,

42
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:55,420
Setting

43
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:55,420
but less than lovers.

44
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,560
Ah is that so? - That's why I'm a bit nervous.

45
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,280
Are you ok?

46
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,020
Yes, I'm ok.

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,320
Now that we've come up here, is there something you want to talk about?

48
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,900
Something like how our lives will progress from here on out.

49
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,360
While looking at this view?

50
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,480
Ta-kun, how would you like to live your life?

51
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,060
How I would like to live my life ... ? - What you're thinking of right now.

52
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,700
I do want to get married ...

53
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,860
Why did you say you couldn't do it?

54
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,800
My appearance ...

55
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,760
So your complex about your appearance is the main factor? - Yes.

56
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,200
My head, mostly ... - Your head?

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,840
Your hair? - Yes.

58
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,500
But there are plenty of people who are popular, even after becoming bald.

59
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,980
And your head has come a long way, at 34 years old.

60
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,200
Is there somewhere you want to go next?

61
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,180
Not really for me, but you asked for the date, so if there's somewhere you want to go?

62
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,160
Something I ... a photo booth to take pictures!

63
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,880
After you.

64
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,360
Which one should we take?

65
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,180
Ta-kun, you pick!

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Here! - It'll take 4?

67
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,300
H-how?

68
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,960
Won't we hold hands?

69
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,680
Won't we?

70
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,380
It's fine, how would you like it?

71
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,420
It's best if you don't go straight for it, but gradually work your way up. - Like this.

72
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,660
Like this ... or more like this ... ? - Nah, well, this won't do.

73
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,680
But if I just held onto here and walked behind ... - No no no no!

74
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,480
But if I ... - NO!

75
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,360
That was scary! You're scaring me if you say it like that!

76
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,340
All of a sudden you became really scary.

77
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,820
I'm getting hungry.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,940
How about Yakiniku? Even if it's still early. - That's fine.

79
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,280
One serving of sirloin ... and one serving of pork rib ...

80
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,620
Can you feed me?

81
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,940
What was it like, being fed for the first time?

82
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,260
It felt good. - It did?

83
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,960
Can I ask you something? - Yes.

84
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,600
You don't have any experiences like that with women?

85
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,900
No I don't.

86
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,700
I mean, I have kissed before.

87
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,400
Where was that?

88
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,120
Like, in Gunma.

89
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,980
In Gunma?

90
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,920
At a hostess club. - A hostess club?

91
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,560
So that was your first kiss then? - I didn't feel anything.

92
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,080
I didn't feel anything.

93
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,440
Because it wasn't with someone I loved.

94
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,080
It felt cold.

95
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,540
I'd like to actually go on a date with a woman.

96
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,160
So even if this was the date now ...

97
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,720
... I'm happy.

98
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,560
You're happy because you've been on a date with me today?

99
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,340
What should we do after our meal?

100
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,040
I'd like to spend a little more time together.

101
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,500
I'd like to have a kiss.

102
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,660
We haven't kissed today.

103
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,660
Me? - It doesn't matter!

104
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:07,000
Doesn't that matter the most? - It doesn't! It's just about going on a date with me, kissing me, ...

105
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,700
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:17,000
But if you do it with me it won't be sincere, and isn't that like your last time?

107
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:24,220
Also, people will recognize me. "Ah, it's that guy, Takeyama, he went overboard today!"

108
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,760
What about when we held hands?

109
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,360
When we held hands, you thought of it that way? - Of course.

110
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,140
You're being too fast!

111
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,140
Please.

112
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,540
It's ok if it's with you. - It's not!

113
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,580
It's not ok, anyway you look at it.

114
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,580
And we've already done a lot, it'll only cause trouble for this shop.

115
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,020
But at night, this would be a good place!

116
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,860
And don't just decide by yourself "We'll do it"! You're being presumptuous.

117
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,600
Let's do it! - No, not "let's do it"!

118
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,840
Hey!

119
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,700
That was too long!

120
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,580
Thank you. Thank you!

121
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,220
Is the date complete with this?

122
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,780
Yes.

123
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,220
What's become clear to me in that position, is that you've given up too soon!

124
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,860
You hardly have any confidence in yourself!

125
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,680
You've gotten way too worked up about yourself!

126
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:21,880
You have a good personalty and a nice face, you can definitely find love!

127
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,760
Take care!

128
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,580
Honestly, take care!

129
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,660
Go home! Honestly, go home, this shoot is over!
