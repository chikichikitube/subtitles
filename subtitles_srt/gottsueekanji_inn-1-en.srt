00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460

Translated and timed by Outlaws0020

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,100
It's right here. Come on in.
- Nice room.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,200
Looks so old.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,330
Take a seat.

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,050
Sorry for that, but take a seat.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,850
You must be exhausted.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,330
Take a seat.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,750
So where are you from?

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,100
Tokyo.

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,050
Tokyo must be filled with garbage and smoke.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,430
I guess it is...

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,540
Lots of cars and so on.

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,650
That's not what I mean. I'm talking about the people.

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,430
How they smell?

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,830
I'm talking about you two.

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,500
You're no good...

18
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,640
A troublesome couple like you.

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,120
But you know, you've got a cute wife.

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,400
Do you want a bath or something to eat?

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,700
I'm hungry.

22
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,280
Something to eat then.

23
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,100
Something to... eat?

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,470
Oh I see.

25
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,950
I don't really like you, so I won't make any dinner.

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,200
Not you, just... this woman.

27
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,350
I can make something for you, but not her.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,600
Old granny!

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,200
Then I'll make something.

30
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,800
Do you want a bath while waiting?

31
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,060
Cause you're so dirty.

32
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,000
So you want a bath before dinner, right?

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,700
Remember to shower yourself before entering the bath.

34
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,340
Shower?

35
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,350
Yea.. cause you're so dirty.

36
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,790
Let's get some tea.

37
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,480
There's nothing for you two, tho.

38
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,590
Such a troublesome couple.

39
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,900
I'll go make it, so just wait, okay?

40
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,880
Coming~
