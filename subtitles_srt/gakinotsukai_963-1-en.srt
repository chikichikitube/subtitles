Ho we have begun!

21
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,730
Ho?!

22
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,360
What is it?

23
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,380
You said it before,

24
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,220
There's a million little bugs all over you!

25
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,800
I scratched and scratched and they just won't stay off

26
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,500
And this time, Tanaka is helping me out!

27
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,770
Look at Tanaka's face

28
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,140
He's totally not into this

29
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,260
He's not into this!

30
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,780
I didn't want to do this

31
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,580
My senpai requested me

32
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,760
I don't get it though what is this?

33
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,490
This opening act right?

34
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,160
Yeah exactly

35
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,950
The opening is supposed to be like this

36
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,570
There's no need for a reason

37
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,570
"Do funny things!", that is what an opening is

38
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,510
This time as well, we have a fantastic group of participants

39
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,360
Yes we do!

40
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,050
So let's begin the in-to-dukshuns!

41
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,180
"In-to-dukshuns"

42
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,860
"In-to-dukshuns"?

43
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,000
A man of his generation, who created many trends

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,310
He sucks at speaking, and really sucks at being funny,

45
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,220
A bitterly smiling copywriter - Itoi Shigesato-san!!!

46
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,850
Wow, look at Itoi-san, once again,

47
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:37,150
Bass Fishing Experience - 14 years

48
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:37,150
Longest Fish Caught - 40 cm

49
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,850
What a cool t-shirt!

50
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,060
Very fashionable

51
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,720
What is this?

52
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,830
He's come 3rd place every time

53
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,750
Oh yeah that's true

54
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,750
I didn't wanna hear that!

55
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,970
That's pretty bad

56
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,500
It's amazing you came 3rd every time

57
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,820
I am aiming for 3rd place again, then

58
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,900
Not 1st place, but 3rd?

59
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,710
That's actually pretty difficult to achieve

60
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,370
The next competitor,

61
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,370
The revival of "UNICORN" is earning him lots of royalties

62
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,900
A 1 in 1 million musician,

63
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,900
The defending champion, Okuda Tamio-san!!!!

64
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,100
Bass Fishing Experience - 17 years

65
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,100
Longest Fish Caught - 34 cm

66
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,820
You're tied with Matsumoto for number of victories

67
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,370
Oh yeah, true, true

68
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,030
So you could end up winning, well so could Matsumoto

69
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,780
Do you think you can win this year?

70
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,090
I can, I can

71
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,980
If I perform normally, I can win

72
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,730
Go for it!

73
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,910
Ok, let's introduce the next competitor

74
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,890
Even though he is a fantastic actor with a lot of presence,

75
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,210
He is shit at catching bass

76
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,850
Forget about winning the competition,

77
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,180
Will he be able to catch anything today?

78
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,180
Asano Tadanobou-kun!!!

79
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,130
Bass Fishing Experience - 7 years

80
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,130
Longest Fish Caught - 29.5 cm

81
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,130
Asano is that bad at fishing?

82
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,820
He has participated in 4 competitions,

83
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,920
He came last 3 times

84
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,380
Oh yeah, you're right!

85
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,470
This is.....

86
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,000
Being last is ....

87
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,530
That's terrible!

88
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,480
That's not a good look for TV

89
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,040
Do your best this year!

90
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,430
We're counting on you!

91
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,100
Let's move on,

92
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,620
His last name is Hayami, but he is not Hayami Yu

93
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,400
He's no Hayami Kentaro neither

94
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,770
An actor with a perpetual erection,

95
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,990
Hayami Mokomichi!

96
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,090
Bass Fishing Experience - 4 years

97
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,090
Longest Fish Caught - 34 cm

98
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,830
"erection actor" he said

99
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,020
right?

100
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,090
What is an "erection actor"?

101
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,120
He is the miraculous runner up

102
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,000
Last year Mokomichi came close to winning

103
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:28,130
"Was 100g away from first place"

104
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,110
34 centimetres

105
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,760
Right?

106
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,780
You were pretty close

107
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,800
He matched Tamio

108
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,130
TN: Players win by catching the longest fish. A tie is broken by weighing the fish

109
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,020
Yes, they were the same length,

110
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,130
It came down to weight

111
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,200
Yes exactly

112
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,620
Do your best please!

113
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,220
Win this year!

114
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,420
Yes, I aim too

115
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,220
This was bound to happen,

116
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,400
He has a dream of winning the Gaki Bass Fishing competition!

117
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,130
Bass Fishing rookie, Ichihara Hayato-kun!!!!!

118
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,920

Longest Fish Caught - 30 cm

120
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,110
Hayato-kuuuun!!!!

121
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,980
Hayato was pretty bad last year, huh?

122
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,730
I came 8/9

123
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,530
Why did you do so shit?

124
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,890
"Why"?

125
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,890
Isn't it obvious?

126
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,840
I couldn't catch a big one

127
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,690
Exactly, he didn't catch a big one

128
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,930
Couldn't catch a big one-

129
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,360
So many insects!

130
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,580
Amazing quantity of bugs

131
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,090
Catch this many fish!

132
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,020
Yes, I will

133
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,930
Catch this many black bass

134
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,840
As delicate as a spiny lobster,

135
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,910
As noble as the Ise Shrine,

136
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,270
He is nothing else but manly!

137
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,290
Iseya Yusuke-kun!!!!

138
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:30,310
Bass Fishing Experience - NONE!

139
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,580
It's your first time?

140
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,110
You have any experience fishing?

141
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,240
Absolutely none

142
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,800
So this is like your first time?

143
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,400
There's a chance you could win on your first fishing trip

144
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,400
There's a chance you could win,

145
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,240
Do your best please!

146
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,770
I will!

147
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,690
This time, to assess your fishing abilities,

148
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,530
We have invited a prolific psycich

149
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,000
Come here please!

150
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,020
I think you all know this person,

151
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,020
Shimo-Ochiai's mother!

152
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,840
First off, Itoi-san's assessment

153
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,270
She's really staring at me

154
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,770
He will marry soon, his second wife will be much slimmer

155
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,770
TN: Thanks to /u/xmog123x for this translation from German!

156
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,400
He's a genius at taking credit for other people's work

157
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,140
Other people's work?

158
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,000
She's saying you do lame things

159
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
She's saying bad things about you all of a sudden

160
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,360
He will be very rich

161
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,780
Everyone you know,

162
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,000
thinks you're a pain in the ass

163
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,220
Ok, let's move on,

164
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,050
Mokomichi-kun's assessment

165
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,560
He is a good looking young man

166
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,330
Can this dark skinned man and Shozo step forward please?

167
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,560
She's calling on you

168
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,240
He also looks pretty good

169
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,960
You both look like Beat Takeshi from behind

170
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,370
If you both do a Beat Takeshi impression, your fishing will go well

171
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,400
Declare your enthusiasm for today as Takeshi-san

172
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,530
Me first?

173
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,620
"We're gonna fish today, Dankan you bastard"

174
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,620
"Time to fish, you bastard Dankan"

175
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,650
He likes nice cars

176
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,290
You too, please

177
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,380
"I'm gonna win today you bastard!"

178
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,710
"You bastard Dankan!"

179
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,710
That "Dankan!" got laughs

180
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,100
Next up, Ichihara-kun!!!

181
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,100
He is very white

182
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,310
High school graduate and cute boy, step forward please

183
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,310
I'm the cute one?

184
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,110
He is not so white

185
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,420
"What happened? This is serious!"

186
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,110
Your crotch is bright red, does it tingle?

187
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,240
What the hell are you saying?

188
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,640
He will have two kids

189
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,800
You,

190
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,800
You smell like mackerel from the balls down,

191
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,780
Or am I imagining things?

192
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,620
What the hell are you saying?!

193
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,840
Or am I imagining things?

194
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,560
Maybe he will return soon

195
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:49,290
TN: "Dekichatta Kekkon" means a marriage that happens because of a pregnancy.
Referring to Matsumoto's surprise wedding announcement.

196
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,890
If you two touch the cock of man who had a shotgun wedding,

197
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,110
You will have good luck today

198
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,090
I see!

199
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,090
You see?

200
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,090
This cock here had a shotgun wedding

201
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,110
Then, go ahead, get some good luck

202
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,560
Sorry for this

203
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,530
Here I go!

204
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,470
First time-

205
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,470
It's my first time meeting them

206
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,000
Use this good luck to fish!

207
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,780
Competition chairman,

208
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,240
Tanaka-san's opening declaration

209
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,490
Understood

210
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,690
He's the chairman?

211
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,000
Never seen him before

212
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,570
I shall deliver the opening declaration!

213
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,690
Once again, these shit participants,

214
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,270
These B-Grade comedians,

215
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,440
THESE B-GRADE actors,

216
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,620
On top of that!

217
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,490
This B-Grade musician

218
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,530
HUH?!

219
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,160
What is your occupation again?

220
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,730
I don't have one in particular...

221
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,330
I mean you have one

222
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,440
What the hell generation are you from?

223
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,600
Right? I don't get this copywriter

224
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,440
I don't either!

225
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,640
Tanaka-san,

226
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,970
go ahead, keep going

227
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,600
You!

228
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,930
Enough! Enough!

229
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,950
That's enough outta you!

230
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,580
Go fish, and come apologise to me after!

231
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,990
German translation by /u/xmog123x

232
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,990
Subbed by /u/senor_wristband

233
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,980
The fishing competition begins!

234
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,870
The man who catches the biggest fish wins!

235
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:39,360
On this boat: Hamada, Asano, and Iseya

236
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,150
If someone yells "I got one!" I'm gonna get startled

237
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,240
Gotta catch a fish quickly

238
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,240
Do you have a catchphrase for when you catch something?

239
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,220
Wouldn't that be embarassing?

240
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,800
Damn, everyone on this boat is good at fishing

241
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,490
On this boat; Matsumoto, Itoi, Okuda; Veteran Fishers

242
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,740
And here we have Endo, Hayami, Ichihara; Handsome Team

243
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,540
I'm gonna catch a big one

244
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,560
Of course, they all aim for the first catch

245
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,960
Not yet huh?

246
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,840
Got one!

247
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,780
Got one! Got one!

248
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,780
Really?

249
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,760
Endo suddenly catches one!

250
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,130
It's coming, it's coming

251
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,130
Coming, coming

252
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,730
Huge

253
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,420
HUGE! IT'S HUGE!

254
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,000
Is he for real, he's just saying that right?

255
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,780
YES! Come on!

256
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,840
It's huge!

257
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,290
YESS!!!!

258
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,840
Endo got one, and it seems pretty huge!

259
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,090
YES! It's a big one!

260
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,400
Really?

261
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,730
Seriously....

262
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,580
Huge! It's super huge!

263
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,290
It sure is huge

264
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,960
It's a big one, amazing

265
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,040
How big is it?

266
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,560
45 cm

267
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,240
Forty Five!

268
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,730
I caught it!

269
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,360
I got one! I got one!

270
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,290
Then Mokomichi gets a bite!

271
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,220
... or not

272
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,580
Ah shit!

273
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,800
Damn it I almost had one

274
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,820
Ichihara-kun, you can stop now

275
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,530
I won't lose to you

276
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,420
I think I've won

277
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,130
I won't lose

278
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,130
C'mon, be serious here

279
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,020
I'm still, I won't lose to you

280
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,330
Ok, Ok

281
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,070
40 minutes later, how is Hamada's boat doing?

282
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,710
Damn it....

283
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,910
That's enough of that spot right?

284
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,600
Right

285
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,330
Enough already?

286
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,000
You need to tell me, I've been waiting for a while

287
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,840
I can recast?

288
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,290
Yes!

289
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,380
Ok ok ok, I'll cast again

290
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,720
It's Ok if they catch instead right? Asano and Iseya

291
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,130
Maybe in order?

292
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,240
I don't mind at all if we catch in order

293
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,690
I can't go until Hamada-san goes

294
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,180
What are you saying?!

295
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,800
Meanwhile, a serious atmosphere surrounds the concentrating Itoi

296
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,420
Ok

297
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,420
Got one! Itoit hit!

298
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,940
Itoi-san got one

299
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,510
I got one huh?

300
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,640
Here it comes!

301
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,820
Itoi's first catch!

302
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,310
Thank you very much

303
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,890
He caught one very quietly

304
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,020
Quietly caught one?

305
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,110
I won't be last place now

306
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,090
I also wanna try that,

307
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,760
just like Itoi-san,

308
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,290
I want to try out that grown up reaction

309
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,200
That "Hmm"

310
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,310
Not making a loud sound, just "Hmm"

311
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,560
Next time I'll try doing that

312
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,910
Like that?

313
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,110
My reaction might be hard to understand however

314
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,330
Unless you catch something, you can't relax and talk normally huh?

315
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,400
Like Mokomichi and Ichihara-san

316
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,640
They aren't speaking at all huh?

317
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,580
I will not speak

318
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,000
Not until they catch something

319
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,930
Ichihara-kun in particular,

320
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,420
Hasn't said anything in half an hour

321
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,420
Not speaking at all huh?

322
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,330
Meanwhile, Hamada's boat doesn't seem to be catching anything

323
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,330
Are you getting any bites?

324
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,620
Bites? Mine is-

325
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,530
Huh? It's gone

326
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,510
It's gone yeah

327
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,600
Senpai get a hold of yourself!

328
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,000
Can you get that guy to stop laughing?

329
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,420
I've been hearing him laugh since the dressing rooms

330
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,600
I've never heard anyone else's laugh but his

331
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,430
He's laughing by himself isn't he? There's nobody else there

332
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,380
1 hour after the start,

333
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,420
Only Endo and Itoi have caught something so far

334
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,370
Tamio didn't catch anything?

335
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,820
In the previous competitions,

336
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,070
We've had a bunch of people not catch anything

337
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,490
Worst time was when Asano-san came,
nobody caught anything

338
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,070
It's your fault

339
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,130
This is Asano's fault

340
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,910
I have to overcome that today

341
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,180
Yeah

342
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,690
Still no fish caught on Hamada's boat;
Iseya changes his lure

343
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,900
I got a new, different lure put on mine

344
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,330
Really?

345
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,890
Ahh that looks easy to eat

346
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,380
Ah I got one!

347
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,380
Really?

348
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,380
Really?!

349
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,000
Asano gets a hit!

350
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,910
You got it. It's coming, it's coming!

351
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,380
It's coming!

352
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,380
It's coming?

353
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,420
Is it good?

354
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,490
You did it!

355
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,490
Why you?!

356
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,220
Asano finally catches one!

357
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,510
First guy on our boat

358
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,800
This puts more pressure on me

359
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,800
I'm so glad, I got one this year

360
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,780
This is bad

361
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,020
Yeah

362
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,690
They keep catching stuff

363
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,710
This is bad

364
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,730
Mokomichi shows his anxiety, and then!

365
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,200
I GOT IT I GOT IT

366
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,960
Ah it was just caught on something

367
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,890
EHH?

368
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,710
He was mistaken

369
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,560
That's the first thing you said in an hour

370
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,560
Heard your voice for the first time in a while

371
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,640
Meanwhile on the veteran team,
Matsumoto and Okuda have not caught anything

372
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,730
Their harmony is off

373
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,730
There's that weird performance again...

374
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:04,180
I can see what he's trying to do from this distance

375
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,960
I get it yeah

376
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,680
Are you all doing well?

377
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,930
Yes

378
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:18,120
We've prepared something to lift your spirits!

379
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,490
Yama-Chan QUIZ!!!!

380
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,510
TN: Impression of Kasuga from Audrey

381
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,510
Tooos!

382
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:32,760
We will ask one of your boatmates a question

383
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,760
The rest of you will guess their answer

384
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,490
First off, this boat

385
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,740
A question for Itoi-san

386
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,640
Itoi-san Personal Quiz!

387
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:53,820
What is Itoi-san's favourite wordplay right now?

388
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:01,110
Itoi-san will write the correct answer on here

389
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,690
You can't think of anything?

390
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,730
Ah he got one

391
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,090
He laughed at it right now

392
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,440
Yeah that might give it away

393
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,110
He laughed yeah

394
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,600
Ehh what could it be??

395
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,690
The right answer....

396
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,960
I don't know what the right answer should be

397
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,400
Actually you did a pretty good job here

398
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,800
Really?

399
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,910
So it's a good wordplay?

400
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,160
I laughed at it yeah

401
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,160
Really?

402
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,380
Ehh what could it be?

403
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,290
It is related to fishing

404
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,510
I see

405
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,090
We've practically given you the answer

406
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,090
It starts with "Tsureta Tsureta"

407
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,090
TN: Tsureta means fished

408
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,510
Yes, so guess the answer please

409
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,510
Seriously?

410
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,690
"Tsureta, Tsureta ..."

411
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,180
"Christmas Tree!"

412
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,690
Funny, that was funny

413
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,310
Ehh that was funny?!!

414
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,600
Yeah that was funny!

415
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,400
Really? It's that sort of pun right?

416
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,610
Yes, exactly Matsumoto-san

417
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,470
Eh? "Tsureta"-

418
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,120
I'll give you a big hint, Tamio-san you answer too please

419
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,120
"Tsureta Tsureta" and then somebody's name

420
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,130
A famous person

421
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,910
Another hint,

422
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,910
He is a retro celebrity

423
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,070
Tsure-Tamiya Jiro?

424
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,420
AHH! Incorrect, however,

425
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,090
You were close!

426
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,140
Really?

427
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,980
It's that sort of name!

428
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,140
Tsure-Tamba Tetsuro?

429
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,420
AHHHH

430
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,760
So close!

431
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,530
Last chance!

432
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,620
It's more punny

433
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,930
More punny?

434
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,780
Tsure-

435
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,240
Tsure-Tako Hachiro!

436
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,200
No more chances!

437
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,110
Unfortunate!

438
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,640
We got so close!

439
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,240
Itoi-san, the correct answer please!

440
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,020
Tsureta Tsureta - Tsuruta Koji

441
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,740
The correct answer was "Tsureta Tsureta - Tsuruta Koji!"

442
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,820
Yamasaki that's bullshit man, you

443
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,740
You saw that and said it was funny!

444
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,200
You can't tell us that is funny!

445
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,070
You made us panic over here!

446
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:09,620
Iseya-san Personal Quiz!

447
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:15,960
Name a male entertainer you'd like to spend the night with

448
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,960
You love those kinds of questions huh?

449
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,780
They're asking Iseya right, but,

450
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,780
you don't want it to seem like your actual opinion, right?

451
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
That's true

452
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,830
Right?

453
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,400
That's true right?

454
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,040
That is surprising!

455
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,040
That is surprising!

456
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,110
It's like "Oh wow really?"

457
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,960
Our reaction to the answer is a hint

458
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,730
But wouldn't you react like that at any name?

459
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,200
Like "Ahhh him"

460
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,420
Tackey

461
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,400
Unfortunately,

462
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,400
Incorrect!

463
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,930
Ok so Hamada-san likes Tackey

464
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,220
No hold on that's not what I meant!

465
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,330
Ok, Asano-san?

466
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,640
You made it hard for him to answer

467
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,110
You should be able to get it without a hint

468
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,380
Yes exactly

469
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,890
Is he Japanese?

470
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,670
He's Japanese

471
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,870
On top of that,

472
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,870
It's like "Would you really pick him today?"

473
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,710
Asano!

474
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,620
Incorrect

475
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,930
Asano-san-

476
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,730
But you're on the right track

477
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,960
You're getting warmer

478
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,800
He's on one of the boats over there!

479
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,000
Matsumoto-san

480
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,400
Incorrect!

481
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,470
Last chance, Hamada-san

482
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,870
Tamio!

483
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,490
Unfortunately!

484
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,130
Who is it?

485
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,760
The answer,

486
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,930
was Endo!

487
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,440
It was Endo

488
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,780
When we were introducing ourselves to each other,

489
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,820
Endo-san had the brightest smile

490
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,060
We were all smiling!

491
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,730
We were all smiling

492
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,730
We were all smiling

493
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,220
Okuda and Matsumoto want to catch something soon

494
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,230
They spotted something surprising!

495
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,420
Woahh that startled me!

496
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,670
If you see that all of a sudden it's startling right?

497
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,160
That's pretty funny

498
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,640
That's embarassing, I was more startled than I should've been

499
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,270
I was startled!

500
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,040
Yes, that's true

501
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:17,220
After the massive goose
Matsumoto concentrates on fishing again

502
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,550
He wants to switch his lure for better results,

503
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,160
But then he feels something!

504
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,130
Ah,  I got one

505
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,680
Did he finally catch one?!

506
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,680
Slowly spinning his reel, wanting to change his lure

507
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,110
but then

508
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,670
Ah, I got one!

509
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,200
He got a bite!

510
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,690
It's coming

511
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,980
A big one?

512
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,270
I think it's a big one

513
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,780
Could be a good one

514
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh shit!

515
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,290
Oh shit I got too excited

516
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,820
Not bad,

517
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,580
That's not too bad

518
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,490
That's a good one

519
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,250
Matsumoto catches one!

520
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,020
This can compete with Endo's

521
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,360
It has eggs

522
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,200
Seems heavy

523
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,980
Okuda is feeling the pressure, but then

524
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,360
Tamio-san?

525
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,370
Yes?

526
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,130
*Not Good?*

527
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,380
Only I haven't caught one

528
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,670
Right?

529
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,380
You could come in last this time

530
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,760
Are you guys okay over there?

531
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,180
We're fine,

532
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,240
You're experienced,
Your pride is on the line

533
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,930
Is that so?

534
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,580
Nothing caught since then huh?

535
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,070
Nothing at all

536
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,560
Honestly my first catch was a fluke

537
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,560
Something just tugged on my line all of a sudden

538
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,800
But, I got something again

539
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,290
No way

540
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,670
Really?

541
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,530
Another hit for Asano!

542
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,670
You got it!

543
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,440
Sorry about this

544
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,220
What the hell man?

545
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,930
You're catching them by not caring

546
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,200
Sorry for this

547
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,640
Asano's second fish!

548
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,580
Just keeps on catching them

549
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,560
This is pretty fun

550
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,250
Yeah you're right

551
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:04,980
That's what a fishing competition is about!
The people who caught something are having fun

552
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,190
But the ones who haven't feel the pressure building

553
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,820
And then the veteran Itoi,

554
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,710
Catches his second fish!

555
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,780
Really?

556
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,970
It's a small one

557
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,780
A small one

558
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,530
Then Matsumoto gets one!

559
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,870
and then Ichihara!

560
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,160
However,

561
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,290
Which line is it caught on?

562
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,180
Wow!

563
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,580
Woah what's this?

564
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,380
You both-

565
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,580
Ehh what?

566
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,890
It's caught on both lines

567
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,890
The same bass caught on both lures!

568
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,730
Seriously?

569
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,240
This can happen?

570
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,530
It's coming here

571
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,930
Amazing

572
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,780
What? what?

573
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,070
Who gets the fish?

574
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,560
Woah what the hell?

575
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,330
It got caught

576
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,820
Who gets it?

577
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,290
It's not big enough to fight over

578
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,470
Allow the young people to have it

579
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,980
The young people can have it

580
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,870
Matsumoto-san, thank you for this

581
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,870
Ichihara catches one thanks to Matsumoto's kindness

582
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,490
That's amazing

583
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,780
I wonder what happened

584
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,530
Then, Iseya feels a bite

585
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,710
Is it coming?

586
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,870
It's coming

587
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,470
I did it!

588
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,330
Lose it, Iseya lose it, I haven't caught one

589
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,620
Huge!

590
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,360
Huge!

591
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,710
Congratulations Iseya! The first bass you've ever caught!

592
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,070
Woah what's this?

593
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,290
I did it!

594
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,360
Why does it look like that?

595
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,470
It ate too much food

596
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,490
Ate too much?

597
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,640
Gross

598
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,220
It's so...

599
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,980
I did it though, I'm glad I caught something like this

600
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,270
Once you catch one you start speaking more

601
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,090
Last year's champion Okuda enters serious mode

602
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,780
Gotta catch one soon!

603
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,090
Me too

604
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,510
Am I gonna get one?

605
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,000
And then

606
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Okuda got lucky!

607
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,690
He got one!

608
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,000
I caught one

609
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,310
This is a small one

610
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,360
Tamio-san caught one

611
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,070
Eh, no way

612
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,930
No way......

613
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,580
This is kinda...

614
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,650
Okuda escapes last place!

615
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:36,330
Last place is between Hamada and Mokomichi!

616
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,330
Will they catch a black bass?!
