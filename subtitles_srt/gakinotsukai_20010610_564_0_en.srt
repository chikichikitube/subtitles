00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:06,440
June 10, 2001

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,810
Gaki No Tsukai Backstage

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,670
Is there something you want to ask him?

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,740
Golf. Whether he wants to play.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,710
Golf. Whether he wants to play.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,040
You're going to play?

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,710
Yeah.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,620
How are you?

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:21,690
Hello.

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,390
Oh, hello.

11
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,450
I'm fine.  Hold on a second.

12
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,490
I'm fine.  Hold on a second.

13
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,490
Everyone's fine?

14
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,460
We're doing fine, but I mean, we're just doing normally.

15
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,660
Well, well.

16
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,100
It's this again.

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,130
What is?

18
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,100
What do you mean "What is?"  Look at what you're wearing, it's obvious what it is.

19
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,430
Seriously? Wow, you saw right through me.

20
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,430
Seriously? Wow, you saw right through me.

21
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,470
We can tell.  It can be only be that, right?

22
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,470
We can tell.  It can be only be that, right?

23
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,470
What do you mean "You saw right through me," come on.

24
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,870
I thought you wouldn't be able to tell.

25
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,840
We can tell.

26
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,370
We can tell this much.

27
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,010
Seriously?

28
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,370
Yes.

29
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,610
What is this?  Why do you look so annoyed?

30
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,680
Because the same thing will happen.

31
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,940
Right?

32
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,610
What?

33
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,080
Because even if we work hard, in the end because that person doesn't work hard

34
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
Don't say such a thing.

35
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:50,710
Ow! Ow!  Ow! Ow!

36
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:50,850
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

37
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:50,980
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

38
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,980
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

39
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,750
No, you said too much there.

40
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,320
That wasn't saying too much.

41
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,250
Don't say the truth so loudly.

42
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,290
Don't say the truth so loudly.

43
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,190
I'm saying it because it's the truth.

44
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,560
Come on, as long as we can put him in a good mood, that's good enough.

45
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,790
No, the thing is, and I'm being honest here

46
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,930
No, the thing is, and I'm being honest here

47
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,200
No, the thing is, and I'm being honest here

48
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,270
If he gets in a good mood then that's fine, but he always gets angry when we're done.

49
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,200
If he gets in a good mood then that's fine, but he always gets angry when we're done.

50
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,370
That's true.  That bothers me, too.

51
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,370
That's true.  That bothers me, too.

52
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,640
Afterwards, right?

53
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,640
What is that, where he leaves right in the middle of things?

54
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,170
Right, right.

55
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,480
He goes into the dressing room and doesn't come out, right? Is he %$#@?

56
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,480
He goes into the dressing room and doesn't come out, right? Is he %$#@?

57
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,780
The dream that Matsumoto envisioned this time is!?

58
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,780
The dream that Matsumoto envisioned this time is

59
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,820
Baseball

60
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,820
Baseball.

61
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:39,830
Like the Japanese players in the Major League, make a beautiful hit against a super fast pitch!!

62
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,030
Like the Japanese players who crossed the ocean to play in the Major League,

63
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,830
make a beautiful hit against a super fast pitch.

64
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,100
The pitches are really fast in the Major League, right, Suga? How fast are they, in the Major League?

65
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,100
About 150 km/h.

66
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,070
Right, right.

67
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,010
He wants to hit a 150 km/h pitch.

68
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,180
He wants to hit a 150 km/h pitch.

69
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,180
No, come on.

70
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,040
That, since I played baseball,

71
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,010
That, since I played baseball,

72
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,680
I can tell you, honestly, that's impossible.

73
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,980
I can tell you, honestly, that's impossible.

74
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,550
But he says he wants to hit a 150.

75
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,820
This is impossible.

76
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,550
Oh my god!

77
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,920
Whoa, geez.

78
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,590
What was that, all of a sudden?

79
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,590
He wants to hit a 150.

80
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,760
I'm on board. I'll do it.  Yes.

81
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,990
Thank you.

82
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,990
I'm on board. I'll do it.  Yes.

83
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,690
I'll do it.

84
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,960
Yeah?

85
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,960
Yes, no problem.

86
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,500
Then yeah, well...

87
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,900
After seeing that?

88
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:13,930
What? What's your problem?

89
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,100
What? What's your problem?

90
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,100
Like, "Then yeah, well..."

91
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,770
No, I want to do it. Instead.

92
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,870
No, I want to do it. Instead.

93
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,870
Please don't do anything.

94
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,340
Ok,

95
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,150
*A kuroko is a traditional Japanese theatre stagehand.  Kurokos wear all black to signify to the theatre audience that they are supposed to be invisible and not part of the onstage action.

96
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,150
The four become kurokos* again to make Matsumoto's dream come true.

97
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,780
Can they create a miracle?

98
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:35,450
Hitting a 150 km/h pitch!!

99
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:35,450
Matsumoto Hitoshi

100
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,720
Matsumoto Hitoshi - Hitting a 150 km/h pitch.

101
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,390
In any case, let's see what the pitch looks like.

102
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,620
Yes.

103
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,530
We're the ones who are actually going to have to do this, anyway.

104
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,020
Yes.

105
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,260
Yes.

106
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,260
Yes.

107
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,130
That's true.

108
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,060
That's true, in the end.

109
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,700
Then, could you please?

110
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Please, thank you.

111
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,200
That is fast.

112
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Ok.

113
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Got it.

114
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,640
Oh, he's coming.

115
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,710
So slow. Right?

116
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,710
So slow. Right?

117
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,410
He shows less and less effort each time.

118
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,250
Well, he said he'd do it, so it should be fine.

119
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,020
Yes.

120
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,850
He intends to put in effort?

121
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,350
Hey, we're ready.

122
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,950
Hello.

123
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,950
Hello.

124
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,950
Hello.

125
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,950
See, he's wearing a uniform.

126
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,990
Yes, right.

127
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,890
That's right.

128
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,420
He's showing effort.

129
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
So you'll do it?

130
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,130
Yeah, no problem. We also checked the pitch.

131
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,160
Yeah, no problem. We also checked the pitch.

132
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,640
In the past, right? We've done a lot of different things.

133
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,540
In the past, right? We've done a lot of different things.

134
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,900
In the past, right? We've done a lot of different things.

135
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,600
Um, looking back, honestly,

136
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,670
Um, looking back, honestly,

137
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,040
They might have been a bit difficult, so I do feel sorry about that.

138
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,880
They might have been a bit difficult, so I do feel sorry about that.

139
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,880
I see.

140
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,150
But for this time around,

141
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,850
in terms of the difficulty,

142
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,850
I think this is an easy one.

143
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,420
So I want to do this in one shot.

144
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,160
I'd like

145
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,160
to do this with dignity.

146
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,790
Yes, yes.

147
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,830
The only thing you guys are capable of is to support me or so.

148
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,770
Don't be thinking about %$#@ all the time.

149
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,270
Then, let's give it a shot.

150
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,610
Then, let's give it a shot.

151
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,240
Yes.  Let's do it.

152
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,240
Let's go!

153
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,240
Ok.

154
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,240
Let's do it.

155
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,410
Yes.

156
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,780
If we can, in one shot.  If we can do it in one shot, you know?

157
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,980
Here we go.

158
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:16,290
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

159
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:16,420
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

160
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,450
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

161
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,520
Watch out.

162
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,520
He suddenly... whoa.

163
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,720
Why are you completely limp? What the hell!

164
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,660
Why are you completely limp? What the hell!

165
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,660
Didn't you just put on your batting shoes by yourself?

166
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Stop it.

167
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Tanaka.

168
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,170
Hold this, ok?

169
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,670
Ok, ok.

170
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,270
Ok.

171
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,270
Stand him up.

172
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,740
Yes.

173
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,140
Stand him up properly.

174
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,840
He won't stand at all.

175
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,440
Come on.

176
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,740
He's limp.

177
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,410
He's completely– geez, he's completely limp.

178
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,340
Argh, come on.

179
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,840
Argh, geez.

180
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,240
Hold on.

181
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,750
Whoa, whoa, come on.

182
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,750
Hey!

183
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,750
Stand him up.

184
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,210
He won't put anything into his muscles.

185
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,950
Stand up, at least, you know?

186
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,950
Here we go.

187
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,950
Ready and go.

188
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,560
Ready and go.

189
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,560
Ow.

190
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,190
Whoa, watch out. Are you ok?

191
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,930
Whoa, watch out. Are you ok?

192
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,930
Hamada.

193
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:55,930
There it is.

194
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,290
I don't understand this situation.

195
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,290
I don't understand this situation.

196
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,200
Here we go.

197
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,800
Let's just go with this.

198
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,590
We're ready.

199
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,590
Ok then.

200
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,080
Here it comes.

201
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,380
Let's hit this.

202
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
Let's hit it.

203
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,110
Ok. Here it is.

204
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,780
Let's hit a 150. Here it comes.

205
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,110
Ok. Here it is.

206
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,780
Let's hit a 150. Here it comes.

207
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,750
Once more.  Let's go once more.

208
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,750
Whoa, whoa.

209
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,750
Yes.

210
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,720
We're hitting a 150.

211
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,990
Ready and

212
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,990
Now!

213
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,890
Let's put him down.

214
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,620
Right, let's...

215
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,520
It's kind of tough like this.

216
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's go to the next one.

217
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,900
Don't cut his fingers.

218
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,900
Yes.

219
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,400
Make him hold it, in any case.

220
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,570
Here we go.

221
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,970
Ok, this is done.

222
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,970
Like this.  The angle is good.

223
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,910
His wrist got red.

224
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,910
You're right.

225
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,910
That can't be helped, though.

226
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,480
Ok.

227
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,480
Yes, that can't be helped.

228
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,220
Sit him on a swivel chair and hit with a long bat

229
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,650
It's secured, right?

230
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:53,650
Ok.

231
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,950
Here we go.

232
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,550
Like I said, I don't understand this situation.

233
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,960
Ok, here we go.

234
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,220
Ok.  Sit down, sit down.

235
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,530
Ok, this way, this way.

236
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,930
Argh, geez... geez.

237
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,600
Just pick him up all the way.

238
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,770
He's watching, he's watching.

239
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,200
He's watching this way. Hurry up.

240
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,640
Oh, yeah.

241
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,940
It's really heavy.

242
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,940
He's watching, right?

243
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,910
OK!

244
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,150
He's really staring.

245
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,050
Don't meet his eyes.

246
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,450
That's bad, right? Wow, he's really staring.

247
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,620
That's bad, right? Wow, he's really staring.

248
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,790
We're good.

249
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,790
Ok, ok.

250
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,790
Should we go ahead?  We're also...

251
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,840
I really think this will work.

252
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,890
You think so?

253
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,890
Let's get a hit.

254
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,890
The pitch, please.

255
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,060
Here it comes.

256
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,330
That was close.

257
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,330
That was close.

258
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,330
That was close. Let's go again?

259
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,330
Let's go again.

260
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,640
That was close.

261
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,640
It doesn't work.

262
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,670
That was close.

263
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,380
It doesn't work.  Doesn't work.

264
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,850
It's so long, you'd think it'd work, right? But in the first pitch...

265
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,350
It's so long, you'd think it'd work, right? But in the first pitch...

266
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,480
It was like a foul tip the first time.

267
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,080
It was like a foul tip, right?

268
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Yes?

269
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,790
Matsumoto gets angry and leaves

270
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,990
Can he walk with that?

271
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,960
Can he walk with that?

272
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,260
Why is he angry?

273
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,000
He was angry, right?

274
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,260
Yes, he is angry.

275
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,060
His face looked angry.

276
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He was glaring at you, right?

277
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,060
He glared at me.  Why?

278
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,400
Let's see him.

279
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,210
The group go to Matsumoto's dressing room to apologize

280
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,070
So he got angry again.

281
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,410
I know, right?

282
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,410
Come on, we don't know if he's angry until we see him.

283
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,310
Well, yes, that's true.

284
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,740
And you're already saying he's angry at us.  (??????????????_

285
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,310
Yes.

286
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,380
Excuse us.

287
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,190
...climbed, and ate one.

288
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,450
Yeah, this persimmon tastes good.

289
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,890
Yeah, this persimmon tastes good.

290
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,690
Matsumoto was telling a bedtime story to a child

291
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,920
Please pick one for me, too, Mr. Monkey.*

292
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,920
*Note: Matsumoto is reading The Crab and the Monkey, a Japanese folktale.

293
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,330
Who's kid is this?

294
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,990
I don't know.

295
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,290
He's playing a grandpa.

296
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,330
The monkey...

297
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,870
What?

298
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,870
Among the things we did, we almost succeeded with the second one we did, so...

299
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,310
Among the things we did, we almost succeeded with the second one we did, so...

300
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,540
Among the things we did, we almost succeeded with the second one we did, so...

301
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,580
Among the things we did, we almost succeeded with the second one we did, so..

302
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,220
What part of that can you call a success?

303
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,890
Well, it sort of

304
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,720
Well, it sort of

305
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,320
Well, it sort of

306
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,320
A foul tip.

307
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,320
Yes, of a 150 km/h pitch.

308
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,760
Let me tell you, I had that thing taken off and peeled off and taken off and peeled off. (?????????????????????????????))__

309
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,360
My hand stings.

310
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,600
And I was cut by the box cutter by you.

311
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,370
I'm sorry.

312
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,800
What do you think this is?

313
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,470
Huh?

314
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,350
Think over what you've been doing.

315
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:40,150
If I were to make an analogy of this,

316
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,280
..., seriously.

317
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,890
I want to hit a 150 km/h.

318
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,190
The next one will be all right.

319
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,130
I'm sorry.

320
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,600
You piss me off, especially.

321
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,600
Huh?

322
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,900
You.

323
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,200
Me?

324
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Being lazy and all.

325
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,710
I'll tell him.  Don't worry.

326
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,410
I'm sorry.

327
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,810
Let's go. We'll be waiting.

328
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
I'm sorry.

329
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,750
Let's go. We'll be waiting.

330
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,750
Good night.

331
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,750
I'm sorry.

332
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,750
Matsumoto's 2nd Attempt!!

333
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,750
Matsumoto renews his focus for his second attempt.

334
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,190
Let's do the next one.

335
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,590
We have that, right? A new one? The one without duct tape?

336
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,590
We're ready.  It doesn't hurt as much.

337
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:23,990
Oh. He's showing more effort.

338
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,990
Oh. He's showing a little effort.

339
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,300
He's running over here.

340
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,700
I heard from the staff. The box cutter was actually extended, it seems.

341
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,670
I heard from the staff. The box cutter was actually extended, it seems.  (?????????????????????)

342
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,370
The razor.

343
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,270
That's not true, right?

344
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,740
Really?

345
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,740
Of course not. Why in the world would I do that?

346
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,740
That's true.

347
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,480
I want to hit a 150 km/h pitch, all right?

348
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,380
I want to hit a 150 km/h pitch, all right?

349
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
Yes.

350
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,750
I don't want my hand cut with duct tape.

351
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,320
It's clear what I want done to me and what I want to do, it's clear, also what I don't want, it's clear, right?

352
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,120
It's clear what I want done to me and what I want to do, it's clear, also what I don't want, it's clear, right?

353
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,820
It's clear what I want done to me and what I want to do, it's clear, also what I don't want, it's clear, right?

354
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,520
It's clear what I want done to me and what I want to do, it's clear, also what I don't want, it's clear, right?

355
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,090
It's clear what I want done to me and what I want to do, it's clear, also what I don't want, it's clear, right?

356
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,090
It's clear what I want done to me and what I want to do, it's clear, also what I don't want, it's clear, right?

357
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,100
Yeah, that's true.

358
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,260
You get it?

359
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Yes.

360
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,230
All of you.

361
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,600
Yes. We'll give it our best.

362
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Yes. We'll give it our best.

363
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,600
We'll give it our best.

364
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,600
We'll give it our best.

365
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,600
Let's go.

366
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Yes, sir.

367
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,670
Let's go.

368
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,670
Ok.

369
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,400
Ok, please hold this.

370
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,940
This, it'll fly away, so...

371
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,110
Pop a huge balloon and hit the ball with the falling bat

372
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,780
Make sure, before it flies away.

373
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,180
Let's hit a 150.

374
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,740
He's watching Hamada.  Hurry.

375
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,110
Why am I standing here?  (??????????????????)

376
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,410
I'm going to tie these together.

377
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,480
So it's like this.

378
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,890
Ok.

379
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,890
Yes, it's standing up on its own.

380
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,890
It's good, it's good.

381
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,320
The pitch, please.

382
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,320
Please.

383
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,320
Please.

384
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,720
It's gonna work. It's gonna work.

385
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,520
It's gonna work. It's gonna work.

386
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,000
If this doesn't work, then this just isn't doable.

387
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,700
That should've worked, right?

388
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,430
It was definitely a good idea.

389
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,610
Let's go to the next one. Let's not pause at all and just go to the next one.

390
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,110
Let's go to the next one. Let's not pause at all and just go to the next one.

391
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,010
This one is good.

392
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,710
Yamazaki, no, no.

393
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,650
Yamazaki, you have to stand him up.

394
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,420
First, first we have to put him on top.

395
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,620
We have to put him in that.

396
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,250
We have to put him in that.

397
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,220
Here we go. Yes.

398
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,220
Here we go.

399
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:04,060
Put him in a shopping cart and hit with the power of a sling

400
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,620
Yamasaki, hold him.

401
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,360
The bat, the bat.

402
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,430
Is that fine? Just like that?

403
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,430
Is that fine? Just like that?

404
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,300
That's fine, that's fine.

405
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,600
That's fine, right?

406
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,340
This will work, I'm sure.

407
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,340
Yes.

408
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,670
The pitch, please.

409
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,670
Yes.

410
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,840
Go.

411
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,980
All right, go.

412
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
Ah, that was close.

413
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,380
Watch out, watch out.

414
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,120
Go.

415
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
All right, go.

416
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Ah, that was close.

417
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,690
Watch out, watch out.

418
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,430
Yamazaki.

419
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,430
Yamazaki.

420
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,770
Matsumoto gets angry and leaves again

421
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,200
Are you all right?

422
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,510
The timing was a little bit off. If we let go at the right timing, that would definitely hit, you know.

423
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,840
The group go to the dressing room to apologize again

424
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,240
The timing was a little bit off. If we let go at the right time, that would definitely hit, you know.

425
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,210
And then you said "Watch out" or whatever, making no sense, so he'll also just think, "Oh, I better watch out."

426
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,780
And then you said "Watch out" or whatever, making no sense, so he'll also just think, "Oh, I better watch out."

427
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,190
He'll think that.

428
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,620
Right? Realize that. Right?

429
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,890
Right? Realize that. Right?

430
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,490
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

431
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,990
Right? Realize that. Right?

432
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Anyway, let's apologize.

433
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,560
Excuse us.

434
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,070
Matsumoto was sorting chicks

435
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,740
Cocorico's timing was a little... right? Since the ball is fast, letting the cart go was late.

436
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,740
Yes, it was a little.

437
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,510
Cocorico's timing was a little... right? Since the ball is fast, they let go of the cart too late.

438
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:30,340
What the hell was all of that?

439
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,450
Who says something like that?  (?????????????????????????)

440
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,630
Huh?

441
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,200
No, I don't think it's anything like that.

442
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,270
That, sling or whatever, why would you think of using that?

443
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,540
That, sling or whatever, why would you think of using that?

444
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,140
"Mattsun, let's go to Yoshimoto* together," you said.

445
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,080
"Mattsun, let's go to Yoshimoto* together," you said.

446
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,080
*Note: Yoshimoto is the agency that represents Downtown.

447
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,910
Your duo partner you entered Yoshimoto with was put onto a shopping cart

448
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,980
Your duo partner you entered Yoshimoto with was put onto a shopping cart

449
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,220
And by the time you realized, he was being pulled by a sling

450
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,260
What were you feeling when you saw such a sight?

451
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,760
You're right.

452
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,930
And you. A person you've been following the whole time, watching him on TV

453
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,700
And you. A person you've been following the whole time, watching him on TV

454
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,470
You finally are able to work with him on TV. And before you know it

455
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,700
You finally are able to work with him on TV. And before you know it

456
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,340
Some junior that crawled out from a rock cuts his hand a bit.

457
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,000
Some junior that crawled out from a rock cuts his hand a bit.

458
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,940
He's being put in a sorry state.

459
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,350
Sorry, sorry.  We were wrong.

460
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,980
I'm sorry.

461
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,580
I'm sorry.

462
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,320
I'll tell them, too.

463
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,460
We'll be waiting for you.

464
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,460
Matsumoto's 3rd Attempt!!

465
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,460
Matsumoto, with an indomitable fighting spirit, goes for his third attempt.

466
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Hey.

467
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,630
Hello.

468
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,070
Let's look alive and do this.

469
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,500
Sorry about before.

470
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Sorry about before.

471
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,740
No, no. I'm fine.

472
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,940
Really, let's do this without getting any injuries.

473
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,340
Really, let's do this without getting any injuries.

474
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,340
OK.

475
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,980
Let's go.

476
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,950
Ok, let's do it.

477
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,950
Ok, let's go.

478
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,950
Ok, let's get ready.

479
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,390
Ok, ok.

480
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,890
Ok, let's go.

481
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,890
This way, this way.

482
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:16,890
Ok, ok.

483
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,460
Hey. Look. He's standing.

484
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,660
Yes.

485
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,530
Hey. Look. He's standing.

486
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,530
Hey. Look. He's standing.

487
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:23,830
Oh, whoa.

488
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,230
Oh, whoa.

489
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,760
He's not upset anymore.

490
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,430
When the professionals come in, he behaves.

491
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,600
When the professionals come in, he behaves.

492
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,900
He behaves when the professionals come in.

493
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,940
Just the bat's left.

494
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Yes.

495
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,270
All right.

496
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,440
This will definitely work, wouldn't you say?

497
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,240
This will work.

498
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,010
This is done.

499
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,650
Use a spinning machine and hit the ball with the centrifugal force

500
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,510
The bat's good.

501
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,320
Firmly, firmly.

502
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,320
Firmly, firmly.

503
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,820
Ok, get ready.

504
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,720
Ok.

505
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,280
Let's go.

506
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,250
Ok.

507
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,350
Here we go.

508
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,760
How many times should we turn him?

509
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,190
1...

510
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,460
15.

511
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,230
15.

512
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,060
2...

513
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,830
Ok, the last time.

514
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,330
Ok, ok.

515
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,030
Let's hit it.  Let's hit it.

516
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,030
Ok, let's go. Then,

517
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,200
Ok, let's go. Then,

518
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,470
Here we go.

519
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Let him go.  The pitch, please!

520
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,470
Please!

521
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,700
All right! Hit it, hit it!

522
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,070
You can hit it!

523
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,010
Another one.

524
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,010
Here it comes.

525
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,080
Let's go again.

526
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,620
We can go again. We can go again.

527
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,820
Now's the chance.

528
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,570
Matsumoto gets angry and leaves, yet again

529
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,930
Huh?

530
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,930
His body language makes him look really sad.

531
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,570
He's really down.

532
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,000
So it becomes like that when you increase it by five turns.

533
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,500
Since we could've kept it to ten turns, honestly.

534
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,480
The group goes to the dressing room to apologize, yet again

535
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,810
Excuse us.

536
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,140
Excuse us.

537
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,810
Excuse us.

538
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,090
Matsumoto was eavesdropping on the gasps that can be heard from the next room

539
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,590
This is the dressing room, right?

540
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,690
What do you want?

541
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,510
I thought I was going to die.

542
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,120
Just one last chance.

543
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,160
Seriously, we were probably thinking about the timing too much.

544
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,730
Seriously, we were probably thinking about the timing too much.

545
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,600
We should probably return to the basics again.

546
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,470
We should probably return to the basics again.

547
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,810
Let's give it our best.

548
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,810
We'll be waiting for you.

549
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:57,310
Matsumoto's 4th Attempt!!

550
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,310
Matsumoto puts his last hope into the fourth attempt.

551
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,980
Here we go. Ok.

552
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,280
Here we go. Ok.

553
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,390
Um

554
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,960
You're all thinking about this the wrong way.

555
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,260
You're all thinking about this the wrong way.

556
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,660
Ok.

557
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,290
The scale is getting larger and larger.

558
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,730
Yes.

559
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,030
Yes.

560
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,260
It's not about machines and things like that.

561
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,760
Yeah, we're going back to the basics.

562
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,270
Ok?

563
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,100
That's completely bullying.

564
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,100
That's completely bullying.

565
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,670
"Man, I am being bullied," was what I felt there.

566
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,340
"Man, I am being bullied," was what I felt there.

567
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,340
That's not what we meant.

568
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,010
Look. I'm a bit pale, right?

569
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,280
Look. I'm a bit pale, right?

570
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,180
Look. I'm a bit pale, right?

571
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,620
Honestly, you do.

572
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,420
I think you can see that through the camera, too. "Whoa, Macchan,"

573
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,020
I think you can see that through the camera, too. "Whoa, Macchan,"

574
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,190
"They got you good."

575
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,160
I don't want that anymore.

576
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,660
All right.

577
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,460
All right.

578
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,690
Back to basics.

579
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,990
Back to basics. Right. Endo?

580
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,130
Back to basics. Right. Endo?

581
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:50,400
Endo played baseball.

582
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,400
So let's leave it up to Endo.

583
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,400
No problem.

584
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Endo.

585
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,180
Endo will hit the ball as Matsumoto's arms

586
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,370
You got the bat? Ok, move up. Move up.

587
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,370
You got the bat? Ok, move up. Move up.

588
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:02,080
Ok, ok.  Ok.

589
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,580
It's all you, Endo.

590
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,280
Ok.

591
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,880
You got it?

592
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,880
All right.

593
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,650
Here it comes. Here it comes.

594
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,490
Now.

595
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,490
Here it is!

596
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,220
That was close.

597
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,090
Foul tip! It was a foul tip!

598
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,120
Foul tip!

599
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,120
Go again, go again.

600
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,330
Now.

601
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,360
Now.

602
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,630
No, too early, too early.  That's not going to work.

603
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,260
It's not working.

604
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,360
It's getting somewhere.

605
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,130
This is hard.

606
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,180
'Cause Endo can't see.

607
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,230
I can't see anything.

608
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,500
Let's go with the final tactic.

609
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,170
Yes, yes. Ok, I'll get it ready. Hold on.

610
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,300
Yes, yes. Ok, I'll get it ready. Hold on.

611
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,740
That was close, though, wasn't it?

612
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,710
That was close.

613
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,980
Endo, just stand up.

614
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,470
Ok, I'll stand up.  Here I go.

615
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,080
Ready and go.

616
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,040
Ready and go.

617
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,980
Ok, ok.

618
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,050
Whoa, whoa.  He's completely lying down.

619
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,980
Tanaka!

620
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,980
He's completely lying down.

621
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,420
Hey, we need a ladder.

622
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,930
Endo will hit while Matsumoto sits on his shoulders

623
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,960
This side's in?

624
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,360
Yes, it's in. Everything's good, now?

625
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,460
The zipper's done. How is it?

626
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,130
Yes, it's in. Everything's good, now?

627
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,130
The zipper's done. How is it?

628
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,230
He's really staring.

629
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,930
Endo, are you all right?

630
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,930
I'm all right.

631
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,470
All right.

632
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,870
Ok.

633
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,100
Go for it!

634
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,500
Endo!

635
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,070
?????????????????????????//

636
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,940
It's all you, Endo!

637
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,410
Ok. Ok, let's go.

638
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,410
It's all you.

639
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,980
Here it comes. Here it comes.

640
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,330
Hitting a 150 km/h pitch!!

641
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,330
Matsumoto Hitoshi

642
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,330
Success!!

643
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:32,440
After overcoming numerous hardships, Matsumoto finally obtains his great achievement of hitting a 150 km/h pitch.

644
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,270
A true congratulations to you.

645
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,810
There is no such thing as "impossible" for you.

646
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,480
Part 1 Part 2

647
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,780
Great, great.

648
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,480
Part 1 Part 2

649
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,280
Endo.

650
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,710
Thank you.

651
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,550
Endo, you did great.

652
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,710
Thank you.

653
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,990
Great job.

654
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,990
Great job.

655
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,990
I got the hit.

656
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,560
You...

657
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,590
The 150...

658
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,020
No, we hit the 150.

659
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,930
Yes, we hit it.

660
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:58,690
But, I mean, wasn't it a success?

661
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,460
But, I mean, wasn't it a success?

662
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,560
Yes, it was a great success.

663
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,430
It was a great success.

664
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,460
Right?

665
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,640
Extra Scene

666
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,640
Gaki No Tsukai

667
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,640
???????????????????????

668
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,110
In the studio after shooting

669
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,370
I hate that machine.

670
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,180
You want to try it (the spinning), right?

671
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,180
I don't want to try it.

672
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,650
Fine, Yamasaki, do it.

673
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,890
No, no, no.

674
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,890
(Staff): Ready it, please.

675
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,460
No, no.  Please don't do that.

676
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,460
It's extra. It's extra.

677
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,460
Your senior did it and you're...

678
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,260
After you're done, Heipo will do it.

679
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,260
After you're done, Heipo will do it.

680
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,830
Heipo

681
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,140
Attempts the Spinning!!

682
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,140
Yamasaki Hosei

683
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,140
I already feel sick at this point.

684
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,900
1...

685
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,580
Whoa, this is bad.

686
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,580
2...

687
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,280
Ready and ok.

688
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
Ready and ok.

689
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,620
Wow, it was going like this.

690
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,550
Wow.

691
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,430
The return spin is also scary.

692
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,330
The ball is coming.

693
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,900
He's not saying anything.

694
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,470
Yamazaki.

695
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,770
Why isn't he saying anything?

696
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,240
What? Nothing?

697
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,250
Attempts the Spinning!!

698
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,250
Heipo

699
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,680
More firmly.

700
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,180
Ah, wait.

701
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,950
Ah, wait.

702
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,880
No... I mean, you've seen this part.

703
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,850
No... I mean, you've seen this part.

704
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,550
No, my neck, argh.

705
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,550
No, my neck, argh.

706
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,560
What is it? What is it?

707
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,930
Hamada!

708
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,860
What is it? What is it?

709
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,730
It hasn't started yet. Watch out, watch out.

710
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,860
It hasn't started yet. Watch out, watch out.

711
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,900
What is it?

712
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,800
Stop it!

713
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,440
Hamada~

714
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,170
Watch out.

715
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,570
Watch out, watch out.

716
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,800
Don't let him hold the bat.

717
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,870
That's dangerous.

718
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,140
Endo, take the bat.

719
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,750
What's the matter?

720
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,410
I'm scared!

721
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,320
He said it very clearly.

722
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,220
Just, the bat...

723
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,450
Just, let's just once...

724
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,360
What's the matter?

725
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,090
You kinda look like a big fly.

726
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,790
