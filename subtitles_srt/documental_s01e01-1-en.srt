1
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,800
THIS PROGRAM IS THE RECORD
OF A "BATTLE" AMONGST COMEDIANS.

2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,760
IN ORDER TO PRESERVE QUALITY,
IT IS MOSTLY UNEDITED.

3
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,430
AS SUCH, VIEWERS MAY ENCOUNTER
EXPLICIT CONTENT.

4
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,030
-Hello, Mr. Matsumoto.
-Hello.

5
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,700
As the creator of this show,
could you tell us what Documental is?

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,000
Well...

7
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,000
HITOSHI MATSUMOTO

8
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,960
I had a few ideas for the title.

9
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,660
But long story short,
this is a documentary of sorts.

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,830
I wanted to focus on
the mental battle between comedians,

11
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,300
so it's a "Docu-mental."

12
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,460
From "documentary" and "mental"
I ended up with Documental.

13
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,000
DOCUMENTAL

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,500
What drove you to create this show
in the first place?

15
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,930
Well, how should I put it?

16
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,460
When you think about what I've done,

17
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,130
I've devoted my whole life to comedy,
ever since I was in elementary school.

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,030
This is the train wreck
at the end of the line.

19
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,860
THIS IS HOW FAR COMEDY HAS COME

20
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,460
We've all seen a variety of formats
for comedy.

21
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,400
Sketches, funny stories, funny quizzes,

22
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,930
duo acts, solo acts, stand-up...

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,600
There are probably more.

24
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,560
But the one format
that hasn't been done is

25
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,500
a "no-holds-barred" show.

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,100
A JOURNEY THROUGH UNCHARTED TERRITORY
"THE NO-HOLDS-BARRED SHOW"

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,700
The comedians can do whatever they want.

28
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,060
What also makes this unique is:

29
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,400
Comedians usually take turns at making an
audience laugh within a given time frame.

30
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,500
But on this show,

31
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,060
10 comedians are confined to one room.

32
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,260
They have to make the other nine laugh.

33
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,230
But they have to do it
without laughing themselves.

34
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,260
This might actually be the simplest way

35
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,460
and the best way to decide who truly is

36
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,900
the funniest person.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,530
THE RAWEST AND MOST DEFINITIVE BATTLE

38
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,700
THE MIGHTIEST

39
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,830
I must admit,
this is sort of an experiment.

40
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,960
A BIG EXPERIMENT

41
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,430
You scared me! Good morning.

42
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,860
THE CHOSEN WARRIORS

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,360
Mr. Oh.

44
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,430
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

45
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,430
-You have an invitation.
-I do?

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,860
This is for you.

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,200
-Here you go.
-Oh, thank you.

48
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,500
Good morning.

49
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,660
What is this?

50
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,800
What's going on?

51
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,060
Good morning.

52
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,630
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

53
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,400
Yes?

54
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,930
This is for you.

55
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,460
Does it say "Event"?

56
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,200
-It says "Invitation."
-"Invita-ton"?

57
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,500
Dear sirs,

58
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,430
Now the autumn breeze blows,
the summer heat is but a fond memory.

59
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,400
Have the seasons been treating you well?

60
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,200
I send you this invitation
with my best intentions.

61
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,730
I sincerely hope you will join me
with one million yen on your person.

62
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,630
I am hosting a Documental.

63
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,730
"With one million yen on your person"?

64
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,630
One million yen?

65
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,930
One million yen!

66
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,130
-I have to bring one million yen?
-That's right.

67
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,900
The winner will receive
a 10 million yen reward.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,100
To play or not, the choice is yours.

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,130
That's too expensive!

70
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,800
One million yen?

71
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,160
If I win, I'll get 10 million yen.
That would be nice.

72
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,060
But I don't really need it.

73
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,860
More importantly,
I don't want to pay one million.

74
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,530
If you don't win, you lose the entry fee?

75
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,700
That's right.

76
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,100
I'll have to think about it.

77
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,860
If you would like to participate,

78
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,300
I will inform you of the time and venue.

79
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,430
I look forward to hearing from you.

80
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,400
The mornings and evenings
are getting chillier.

81
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,900
Please keep yourself in good health.
Yours sincerely,

82
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,560
Hitoshi Matsumoto.

83
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,400
No thanks.

84
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,760
There's no way I could win it.

85
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,800
I'd never win. No way.

86
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,660
This is some grand plan devised
by the comic genius Mr. Matsumoto.

87
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,960
If I just showed up,
they'd tear me to shreds.

88
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,460
Hear that? The sirens are ringing already.

89
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,530
This is like some new kind of scam.
You never say no to Mr. Matsumoto, right?

90
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,560
There are 10 people,
and everyone brings one million.

91
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,700
That's right.

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,160
And the winner takes 10 million home...

93
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,360
I think I'll laugh right away.

94
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,860
I don't get it.

95
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,730
What's he trying to do?

96
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,100
One million yen?

97
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,900
Wait. What should I do?

98
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,160
This is really going to happen, right?

99
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,300
-It's not a prank?
-It's not.

100
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,600
Another thing is,

101
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,130
I do the TV show You Mustn't Laugh
at the end of each year.

102
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,060
It's become a highly entertaining show

103
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,330
for all ages.

104
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,760
That's great, but it can be limiting.

105
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,060
THE ULTIMATE FIGHT

106
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,160
I wanted to get rid of all the shackles.

107
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,330
AN EXISTENTIAL WORLD OF COMEDY

108
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,460
You know those moments
when you laugh the hardest?

109
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,260
It may be something trivial,
but it hits your funny bone.

110
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:23,230
I've been wanting to create something
based on that for several years.

111
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,730
THIS IS THE FRONTIER OF COMEDY

112
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,430
There are a tremendous number of
comedians in Japan now.

113
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,830
THEY ARE THE CHOSEN BEASTS

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,960
It's really like a jungle.

115
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,660
Some comedians do well in the water.

116
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,730
THEY'RE BEASTS IN THE JUNGLE

117
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,330
Some just hang around in trees.

118
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,100
You know what I mean?

119
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,800
Some of them live in swamps.

120
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,700
Some are fast runners...

121
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,230
This show puts a variety of beasts
all in one room.

122
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,200
THE STRONGEST IN THE WILD

123
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,130
So, which of them is the strongest?

124
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,700
I'm sure this won't get
high ratings on TV.

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,860
Unless you watch pretty carefully,

126
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,300
you won't grasp how funny it is.

127
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,360
You could say it's aimed towards
a very specific audience.

128
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:23,560
I wouldn't say it's a show for
older people, women, or kids.

129
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:28,200
But I think those who like it
will be glued to the screen.

130
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,100
So, I think it's not a bad idea
to narrow down our target audience.

131
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,860
After all, it's not easy
to watch videos on Amazon, right?

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,400
It's too hard for geezers, right?

133
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,460
Subscribing to Amazon is too complicated
for them, right?

134
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,560
Geezers can't do it.

135
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,800
Early elementary kids can't do it, either.

136
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,230
Those people can go elsewhere...

137
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,530
Yeah.

138
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,260
By the way,

139
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,260
I just said comedians were like
animals in the jungle,

140
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,030
and this show is on Amazon, right?

141
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,000
That was either a good joke,
a little confusing, or I got it all wrong.

142
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,560
I'm not sure.

143
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,760
THE COMEDIANS ARRIVE AT THE BATTLEFIELD

144
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,360
Am I the first one?

145
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,100
I'm the first?

146
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,300
Really?

147
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,600
So this is the place.

148
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,160
Where should I sit?

149
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,560
I'm Daisuke Miyagawa. Nice to meet you.

150
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,400
One million yen is a large amount.

151
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,660
I had to think about it at home,
but in the end,

152
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,700
it sounded like fun.

153
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,160
The only problem is,
I don't have any trademark jokes.

154
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,160
I don't have a killer technique.

155
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,700
I don't know how I'm going to fight.

156
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,830
He's an innately happy guy.

157
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,700
How can I put it?

158
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,830
He loves to be around people.

159
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,700
He's the type of guy who always has fun,
whatever he's doing.

160
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,160
HE ENJOYS WHATEVER'S
IN FRONT OF HIM

161
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,860
I think he'll stir things up a lot, but...

162
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,130
Unfortunately, he probably laughs the most
out of the whole group.

163
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,100
QUICK TO LAUGH

164
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,530
I'm scared of the guys who are weird.

165
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,430
I'm not worried about any joke
or gag that's been prepared.

166
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,930
But I'm scared I'll find something funny,
all by myself.

167
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,260
Especially when I'm not supposed to laugh.

168
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,460
I'm worried what will happen when
I start to find some trivial thing funny.

169
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,700
That is his weak point.

170
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,600
Do you think he can win?

171
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,030
In terms of making other people laugh,
I think he does have a chance.

172
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,560
It's interesting when you think about it.

173
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,460
If you were to categorize his abilities
and put them in a hexagonal chart,

174
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,630
he excels in one or two areas,
but, overall, it's not well-balanced.

175
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,700
I don't have a strategy to be honest.

176
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,230
I'll see what happens.

177
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,600
It depends on the participants.

178
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,730
I'll sit here.

179
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,260
Wait a minute.

180
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,760
Okay. I will sit here.

181
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,030
Who is it?

182
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,900
Excuse me.

183
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,430
It's Ohchi!

184
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

185
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,630
I'm Yosuke Ohchi, from the duo Dienoji.
I'm 44 years old.

186
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,860
I have a wife and two daughters.

187
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,300
Nice to meet you.

188
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,930
My wife handed me one million yen
this morning, and now I'm here.

189
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,630
ASKING HIS WIFE FOR THE CASH

190
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,630
Remember that one million yen I mentioned?

191
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,930
Yeah, I do...

192
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,900
Can I have it?

193
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,560
Seriously?

194
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,030
Where will I get that?

195
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,200
My daughter warned me,
"Don't waste our money."

196
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,160
It's Ohchi!

197
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,700
You're gonna sit there?

198
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,200
-Where should I sit?
-Over on the right.

199
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,100
If each of them had to do something
all by themselves,

200
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,530
it wouldn't be funny at all.

201
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,300
Apparently, he's an air guitar champion.

202
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,830
AIR GUITAR WORLD CHAMPION

203
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,230
There's no way he'd win a contest like
that if he was truly a funny comedian.

204
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,860
It's like showing the world
he's not funny.

205
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,930
But he is a go-getter.

206
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,330
It'll be fun to have one guy like him.

207
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,900
However, Ohchi may be
Daisuke's Achilles' heel.

208
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,860
-This is insane.
-It sure is!

209
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,100
-The day has come.
-This is insane.

210
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
-Know who's coming?
-I have no idea.

211
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,060
-Nobody's said anything.
-Nothing.

212
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,760
I can't believe Daisuke's here.

213
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,530
Someone's coming.

214
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,160
Yes?

215
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,330
Hello?

216
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,630
So it's you?

217
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,260
Someone else from Yoshimoto.

218
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,600
This guy's so annoying.

219
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,560
We're all from Yoshimoto.

220
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,600
Hello.

221
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,330
-Nice seeing you.
-Howdy.

222
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,760
I'm part of the Toro Salmon duo.
I'm Kubota. Nice to meet you.

223
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,700
This guy is...

224
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,630
He's a little...

225
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,930
scary.

226
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,930
He has a bit of a unique style of comedy.

227
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,900
Seaweed. Seaweed. Seaweed.

228
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,600
Is "Seaweed" a palindrome?
No, in reverse it's "Deewaes!"

229
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,400
I don't get it!

230
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,830
And he has what you might call...

231
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,500
a psychopathic streak.

232
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,900
The one million yen?

233
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,160
I paid the entry fee from my savings.

234
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,060
And I borrowed some.

235
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,100
And I participated in a clinical trial
at a university.

236
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,100
Before meds are sold at drug stores,

237
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,000
they're tested out on human subjects.

238
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,600
I made 200,000 yen.

239
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,400
I think rich people will laugh more
because they have fewer worries.

240
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,030
Poor people are defensive,
so they don't laugh much.

241
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,930
To earn one million at Yoshimoto means
I could earn double that elsewhere.

242
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,530
That's enough to retire on in North Korea.

243
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,260
I checked the rules,
and we can use living animals.

244
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,330
ANIMALS ARE PERMITTED

245
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,430
I asked them to bring me
three stray dogs...

246
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,500
It's Kubota...

247
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,260
They're all actually quite happy people.

248
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,060
Why are you wearing a tank top?

249
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,200
I heard we had to wear a collared shirt.

250
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,760
A collared shirt?
Did they prepare one for us?

251
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,760
No, you had to bring your own.

252
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,800
Why did he choose a tank top?

253
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,200
I don't know if I'm hot or cold.
I've thought about this show too much.

254
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,800
He looks like a rickshaw man.

255
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,460
So I stripped.

256
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,000
Kubota is...

257
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,430
He could be dangerous.

258
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,560
-We're all in danger.
-This is dangerous.

259
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
No way.

260
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,500
This is bad news.

261
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,260
This is really bad.

262
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,260
Fujimoto makes it a different story.

263
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,100
I'm Fujimoto from Fujiwara.

264
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,130
I will try my bestest!

265
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,730
I simply thought it sounded like fun.

266
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,530
That's all.

267
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,260
In his case,

268
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,560
for every single thing
anybody says or does,

269
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,260
he chips in as the straight man.

270
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,930
-I want your eyes to cave in!
-What the hell!

271
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,100
What kind of insult is that?
"Caved-in eyes"?

272
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,600
His presence could be a problem, too.

273
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,900
The thing is, he plays the straight man,
but he makes funny quips, too.

274
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,200
I think he may cause trouble
for the others.

275
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,060
I'll just deal with whatever unfolds.

276
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,630
That's my only plan.

277
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,630
Yeah.

278
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,630
If Ohchi does something silly,
and Fujimoto starts to play with that,

279
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,030
it will be tough for the others.

280
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,160
My wife said,

281
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,060
"You wanna be on the show, right?

282
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,100
Then go for it."

283
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,600
She was supportive.

284
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,400
And she's the breadwinner anyway.

285
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,300
In fact, it's like...

286
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,530
I can hear a little devil saying,

287
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,830
"It's okay to laugh and lose.
Your wife is rich!"

288
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,600
Right here.

289
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,700
-Is that all you brought?
-Yeah.

290
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,700
How much did you bring?

291
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,430
That's what I brought.

292
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,700
-What did he bring?
-A pouch.

293
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,230
RULE 1: YOU MAY BRING PROPS

294
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,830
-Is that all?
-Your bag is huge!

295
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,560
-You're gonna make us laugh that much?
-No, that's not why...

296
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,060
-What's inside that?
-Isn't that too small?

297
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,260
-What's in it?
-Well...

298
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,500
That's not a bag people take to work.

299
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,630
But, it's...

300
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,960
And this is what it's like
with only four people.

301
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,330
You're not scared of me.

302
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,130
-I didn't expect Daisuke to be here.
-Right?

303
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,330
-I didn't think so, either.
-I thought you were abroad.

304
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,800
I get that a lot.

305
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,260
-You should stay there.
-What does that mean?

306
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,930
Doing overseas reports and eating.
Those jobs suit you.

307
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,330
-What's your problem?
-Go overseas, or to the countryside.

308
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,560
-Look. It's him.
-Uh-oh.

309
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,530
The monster's here.

310
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,230
It's turning into a heavy-weight match.

311
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,600
A monster has arrived.

312
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,060
For real?

313
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,400
I'm Kukky, from Yaseibakudan.

314
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,060
The reason I became a comedian was

315
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,100
I wanted to steal money from
the general public.

316
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,730
I never thought someone would steal
from me.

317
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,700
I said,

318
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,660
"Dude, can you lend me a million yen?"

319
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,900
I borrowed the money from a place called
Yoshimoto Finance.

320
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,500
I signed a lot of papers.

321
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,630
They gave me the loan without any hassle.

322
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,960
It's a very nice company.

323
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,200
The payments get taken out of my salary.

324
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,700
A MILLION YEN LOAN FROM YOSHIMOTO

325
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,330
-I have to pay back 100,000 yen a month?
-Yes.

326
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:30,400
Well, he is even more of a psychopath.

327
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,160
YET ANOTHER PSYCHOPATH

328
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,360
He has a butterfly knife?

329
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,630
If he sets up some kind of trap,

330
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,300
they'll be in trouble indeed.

331
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,700
He's a war veteran!

332
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,600
-Is that a tent?
-Look at Fujimoto's small bag.

333
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,830
I brought 18 robot model kits.

334
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,400
That was a forced punchline.

335
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,600
I think he will do pretty well.

336
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,300
Every time he does something
that seems random,

337
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,760
you start to imagine
what led him to do it.

338
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,760
He can be incredibly funny.

339
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,630
I'll laugh.

340
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,830
I'm already laughing. See?

341
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,760
That's the type of guy I am.

342
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,060
I even laugh at my own jokes.

343
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,300
I'm in trouble.

344
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,600
I'm like canned laughter.
Call me "Can-ghter"

345
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,700
-He means trouble.
-For real? Damn it.

346
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,160
Just make him laugh first.

347
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,430
I'm in trouble.

348
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,200
-These guys crack me up.
-I have a bad feeling.

349
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,530
-I don't like this...
-It feels like we're backstage at Lumine.

350
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,860
Here's another one.

351
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,500
-We got another one.
-I'm done for.

352
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,330
That's the face you'd expect.

353
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,630
-It's him.
-Another dangerous one.

354
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,930
Hi. I am from Japan.

355
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,530
I'm from Trendy Angel.

356
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,000
I think my name is Saito.
Nice to meet you.

357
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,030
I'm this year's "Biggest Hit Comedian."

358
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,630
I've starred in 11 commercials this year.

359
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,930
But I only have 700,000 yen in my account.

360
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,660
I think Saito is the most well-balanced
out of this group.

361
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,560
In many respects.

362
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,560
-He always makes me laugh.
-Stay over there. Next to Ohchi.

363
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,560
-Don't come here.
-Don't say that--

364
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,730
-Oops!
-We haven't started yet.

365
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,700
There are many disadvantages for Saito.

366
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,900
The other nine will never laugh.

367
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,260
at his bald head.

368
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,930
HIS BALDNESS IS LAME

369
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,530
That's a key point.

370
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,530
Women and children might find it funny,
but being bald won't cut it here.

371
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,000
There's no way I'll lose.

372
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,930
-How big is his bag?
-Show us.

373
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,700
-This is it.
-Are you kidding?

374
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,930
-Is that all?
-Look at Fujimoto's.

375
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,830
That's too small.

376
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,500
-What's with that pouch?
-That's your weapon?

377
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,660
New shoes come in bags like that.

378
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,600
Everyone's really happy and smiling now.

379
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,300
The atmosphere's nice and relaxed, but...

380
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,130
For now, they can enjoy themselves,
but soon...

381
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,960
-That's just wrong.
-I was told to wear a collared shirt.

382
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,500
-Then you need a collar.
-Mine has one.

383
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,060
Here's another twisted one.

384
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,800
Too many weirdos.

385
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,130
He's twisted and knotted.

386
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,660
I'm Tenjikunezumi's Kawahara.

387
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,400
I'm looking forward to it.

388
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,230
I went home to think about this properly.

389
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,600
I tried to figure it out.

390
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,300
But even then, I couldn't really get it.

391
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,660
And now, I still don't get it.

392
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,930
He's got peculiarities.

393
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,760
I hope they're not my juniors.

394
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,460
If they're my seniors,

395
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,630
I can give them all I've got.

396
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,400
-We're done for.
-He never shows any emotion.

397
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,830
-Kawahara never laughs.
-You're right.

398
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,030
He's a tough opponent.

399
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,530
He's not the type to pull
a lot of punches.

400
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,160
I don't think he will be dismissed
in the first half.

401
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,960
I can't picture him splitting his sides

402
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:17,600
with laughter at something somebody does.

403
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,800
Every now and then you'll find
a comedian like that.

404
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,330
Like Itsuji Itao.

405
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,500
THE "ITSUJI ITAO TYPE"

406
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,830
I would like 10 million yen.

407
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,730
But more than that,
I want to leave my mark.

408
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,200
I want to leave a mark worth
one million yen.

409
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,960
You brought enough for a camp.

410
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,900
-All I brought was one big sausage.
-That bombed.

411
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,100
-That bombed as much as your 18 robots.
-No, mine's funnier than a sausage.

412
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,860
He's incredibly expressionless.

413
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:52,900
Good morning.

414
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,700
I'm Jiro Hachimitsu.

415
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,100
I'll try to take myself into
a state of emptiness.

416
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,200
As empty as possible.

417
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,800
-Good morning.
-I've never seen him laugh.

418
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,800
-He never laughs.
-He does, but...

419
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,200
Yeah, he's not really the type to laugh.

420
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,000
Simply put,
his comedic aptitude is very high.

421
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,600
MR. HIGHLY PROFICIENT

422
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,560
Don't talk about Thomas and Friends now.
There's a subway below us.

423
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,230
He's a straight man who makes funny quips,
but he's different from Fujimoto.

424
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,700
Whenever something happens,
he'll quietly mutter a witty remark.

425
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,730
That's what slowly creeps up on you.

426
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,660
He is a strong opponent.

427
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,600
I was honored.
I accepted the offer right away.

428
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,560
The biggest problem was,
I didn't have a million yen.

429
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,560
My motto is, "Money is not something
you keep overnight."

430
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:51,460
I have a lot of confidence,
but at the same time,

431
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,600
I laugh easily at the corniest jokes.

432
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,860
I'm in the middle?

433
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,400
Has anyone ever seen Jiro laugh out loud?

434
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,760
-No.
-Never.

435
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,560
All he does is smile.

436
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:06,260
Now that you mention it,
I've never seen him roll in laughter.

437
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,460
-I laugh at Mr. Bean.
-Mr. Bean?

438
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,300
-Only Mr. Bean?
-Stop trying to make us laugh.

439
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,200
This is an amazing group.

440
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,960
Is it a female contestant?

441
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,630
It's "Thony-An."

442
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,260
We're all from Yoshimoto.

443
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,060
Hello...

444
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,860
Hello. I'm Anthony from the Matenrou duo.

445
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,430
Right now, I'm full of dread.

446
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,800
And this guy...

447
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,030
I think his career is a lot shorter
than the others.

448
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,630
If he doesn't hold back
in front of his seniors,

449
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,400
he might do well...

450
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,360
But, Anthony?

451
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,030
I think he might hold back a little
out of respect for his seniors.

452
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,300
Last month I earned 220,000 yen.

453
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,560
I borrowed 500,000 yen
from my senior colleagues.

454
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,760
Thank you so much, BKB.

455
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,130
I don't want to regret lending you this.

456
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,030
Make me glad that I lent it to you.

457
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,630
-Certainly.
-Keep that in mind.

458
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
-I'm sure you have the money.
-I don't.

459
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,130
Stop acting poor.

460
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,630
Thank you for lending me the money.

461
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,660
I borrowed from my mom as well,
and I finally raised one million.

462
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,730
He's the only one not fully Japanese,
so it'll be interesting.

463
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,660
But when it comes to these guys,
it's like what I said about Saito.

464
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,400
They won't laugh at his usual jokes.
Not when he only looks a bit different.

465
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,930
When I first got to quit my part-time job
after becoming a comedian,

466
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,800
I was so happy.

467
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,560
I never want to have
a part-time job again.

468
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,760
But if I lose this,
I'll have to find a part-time job.

469
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,530
You look like a backpacker.

470
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,860
Where'd he come from?

471
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,760
-Stop making funny quips.
-Why? We haven't started yet.

472
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,400
He looks like a hitchhiker.

473
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,530
So there are nine.

474
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,030
We have nine participants now.

475
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,360
That means there's one more.

476
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,600
One more.

477
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,800
Who is the last participant?

478
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,660
I'm sure it's someone from Yoshimoto.

479
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,200
-No way.
-The worst participant!

480
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,830
-Oh, no!
-This is terrible!

481
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,900
I'm Jimmy Onishi.

482
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,530
I'm just going to try my best.

483
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,860
He is a monster.

484
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:50,160
The nine others are not going to like it.

485
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,000
Not with him here.

486
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,900
The consumer loan officer told me
I can't borrow a million yen.

487
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,930
Because my annual income is only
six million.

488
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:04,830
It really hit me how low
my standing is in society.

489
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,630
He laughs easily.

490
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,260
All it would take is one
really simple dirty joke.

491
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,860
He's that stupid.

492
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,600
Well, you see...

493
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,730
Dumb luck always plays a part in comedy.

494
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,730
I'm going to aim for dumb luck.

495
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,830
He's already won.

496
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,260
Look how grey his hair is.

497
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,060
-Stop saying things like that.
-Why?

498
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,330
Stop it.

499
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:33,430
This is really going to be something.

500
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,360
They are quite an elite troop.

501
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,760
THE ELITE TROOP

502
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,800
I think this will be great.

503
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,130
This is not good.

504
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,060
-With him here...
-Jimmy is too much.

505
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,360
It might be over before we use
any of our props.

506
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,530
Are you laughing because he's black?

507
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,460
That's wrong.

508
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,760
What's so funny?

509
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,430
He's here.

510
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,000
Good morning!

511
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,660
He looks very angry.

512
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,660
-He's scary.
-Why?

513
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,560
-He's angry.
-Why's he so mad?

514
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,930
Look at his muscles.

515
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,900
He's nice and pumped now.

516
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,860
He gets more buff every time I see him.

517
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,060
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

518
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,360
So, gentlemen...

519
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,630
Did you bring it?

520
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,930
-Have you brought what we promised?
-Yes.

521
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,200
-Of course we did.
-Then put it on the table, please.

522
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,100
This is truly your own money, right?

523
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,260
-You all raised it somehow?
-Yes.

524
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,800
One million yen.

525
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,260
I can't believe you're doing this to us.

526
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,060
This is crazy.

527
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,030
Spending money is easy,
but making it is...

528
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,330
Yes. You are right, but...

529
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,200
Damn, that's worn!

530
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,100
His is amazing.

531
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,200
Which country is this rubber band from?

532
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,730
Who looks at things like that?

533
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,730
Would you mind passing the money?

534
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,300
Our staff will confirm
it's all there later.

535
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,830
I am sure there are no mistakes.

536
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,800
Please start from there.

537
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,500
Okay.

538
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,730
-I just pass it around?
-Yes, please do.

539
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,900
-The cameras are rolling.
-You're not handing out homework.

540
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,430
-I've never done this before.
-What a nice chunk of money.

541
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,560
-I can't believe we are doing this.
-It looks beautiful.

542
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,530
That's how tall the pile gets.

543
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,100
-I've never seen 10 million yen before.
-It's huge.

544
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,430
-Yeah, now that you mention it.
-Wow!

545
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,700
Goodness!

546
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,860
-Wow!
-Awesome!

547
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,160
Is this for real?

548
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,530
Is something wrong?
He's trying to make you laugh already?

549
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,860
Cut it out.

550
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,400
DAISUKE & HANAKO
"TOGETHER FOR 35 YEARS"

551
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,430
It's not a joke. It's a good luck charm.

552
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:25,230
-It's more like a bad luck charm.
-It's their 35th wedding anniversary.

553
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,630
-It's a bad luck charm.
-No, it's not.

554
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,130
-Stop saying they're bad luck.
-That veteran duo isn't "bad luck."

555
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,230
Stop making pointless jokes.
They're irrelevant.

556
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,230
So, here is the money you brought.

557
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,460
There is nine million yen here.
I mean 10 million yen.

558
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,430
The 10 million yen is in this bag.

559
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,630
And now...

560
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,460
Allow me to explain the rules.

561
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,930
Rule 2:
There are 10 participants in this game.

562
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,760
You will spend the entire time together
confined in this room.

563
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:02,300
Rule 3: At the end, the person who hasn't
laughed will receive the reward.

564
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,360
10 million yen.

565
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,530
Rule 4: There is a time limit.

566
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,200
It is displayed up there.
You have six hours.

567
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:14,630
As soon as I call start,
it will begin counting down.

568
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,800
Before the six hours are up,

569
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,430
I would like to see one of you become
the champion.

570
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,430
Okay.

571
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,900
-You can do whatever you want.
-Okay!

572
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,030
You can do absolutely anything.

573
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,500
The funniest person wins.

574
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,660
Think about it. This is an amazing event.

575
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,160
We simply have to be funny.

576
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,300
-It's worth being a champion here.
-Yes, winning here will be like...

577
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,830
It could mean even more than
winning the M-1 Grand Prix.

578
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,460
-It's not a comedy sketch.
-We're fighting with our bare fists.

579
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,300
Things like, "The mechanism of laughter."

580
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,930
And, "What is laughter?"

581
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,100
"What is it that we find truly funny?"

582
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:02,060
I think this program will make us consider

583
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,100
concepts like that.

584
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:12,060
I still haven't found answers
to questions like that myself.

585
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,060
How did you get your one million yen,
Anthony?

586
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,530
I borrowed it from many people.

587
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,960
Anthony has a lot more work recently,
but a million yen is still a big amount.

588
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,360
I asked Akebono, the sumo wrestler,
for a loan.

589
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,930
He said, "No damn way."

590
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,000
Why did you ask him?

591
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,400
Akebono, right?

592
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,500
-But a million's nothing for Jimmy, right?
-That's not true!

593
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,430
I went to loan companies,
like Promise and Acom,

594
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:46,300
but they said, with my income,
they can't loan me one million.

595
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,000
Really?

596
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,760
-But your paintings are popular.
-You could sell one.

597
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,430
I'm on a break from painting.

598
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,700
What does he do?

599
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,430
At the moment,

600
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,630
he's more interested in sex than painting.

601
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,460
-My sex drive's winning at the moment.
-Your art is losing?

602
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,230
-And now...
-How old is he?

603
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,730
-Nowadays, I stop.
-Stop what?

604
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,230
When I'm about to cum.

605
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,930
When I'm about to cum, I stop.

606
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,460
What the hell is he talking about?

607
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,930
-Why do you stop?
-We're done for.

608
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,560
-Why not just cum?
-The time's too expensive to waste.

609
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,200
-What time?
-I pay for two whole hours.

610
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,060
-Are you talking about sex clubs?
-Yeah, at the sex club.

611
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,200
At the sex club?

612
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,030
He's doing it himself.

613
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,530
Jimmy's not the best storyteller.

614
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,630
He's difficult to understand,
but please make an effort.

615
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,460
So, at the loan company, they said,

616
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,600
"With your income,
we can't loan you one million yen."

617
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,300
-Really?
-Is that so.

618
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,430
He is my only senior colleague here.

619
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,000
Senior by a few months?

620
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,930
A few months... Two months.

621
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,760
What's funny about that?

622
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,730
So, gentlemen,

623
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,760
you have a kitchen there,
if you ever feel hungry.

624
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,800
We're not here to see you
battle with hunger.

625
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:04,260
There's alcohol and such
in the refrigerator,

626
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,800
if you would like to drink some.

627
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,860
The staff will not come in at all.
If something comes up, ring me.

628
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,800
RULE 5:
MATSUMOTO MAY CALL TO GIVE ORDERS, TOO

629
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,660
That's how things will go.

630
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,300
-You have six hours to find one winner.
-We won't need six hours.

631
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,100
You're right. You won't need six hours.

632
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,660
-No, we don't need six hours, do we?
-No, we don't.

633
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,030
Really, you can do whatever.

634
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,660
Truly, you can do anything.

635
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,300
Nothing is off limits for broadcast?

636
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,700
-There must be some limits.
-Apparently not.

637
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,130
You say we're free, but...

638
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,430
You have six hours!

639
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,860
-It may seem long, or the time may fly.
-I'm scared.

640
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,260
For the next six hours,
good luck to you all!

641
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,830
This is scary now.

642
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,960
-When do we start?
-Will they tell us?

643
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,530
I will let you know.

644
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,530
Smile and relax until then.

645
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,160
Jimmy, please wipe off
your eye mucus first.

646
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,700
Please wait a second.

647
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,160
Eye mucus first.

648
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,360
He is getting older.

649
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,400
-You're clear.
-He's at that age when you get eye mucus.

650
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,760
Even with all this, look at these two.

651
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,800
-Kawahara and Jiro haven't laughed at all.
-You're right.

652
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,700
-It's not fair.
-They don't talk either.

653
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,200
-They're tough.
-No, they're just missing something.

654
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,360
-They forgot how to feel.
-They're missing something inside.

655
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,760
So, are you guys ready?

656
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,260
Documental,

657
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,600
start!

658
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,630
Here we go. The game has begun.

659
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,200
May the best player win.

660
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,260
This is my first time meeting Jimmy.

661
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,360
-I'm Jiro Hachimitsu, from Tokyo Dynamite.
-I'm a great fan of your work.

662
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,460
Thank you.

663
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,460
-Do you have something to say?
-It's my first time as well.

664
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,200
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Kyojin, from All Hanshin.

665
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,500
-No, you're not.
-He's not.

666
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,960
Hey.

667
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,360
-Which of the duo are you?
-Kyojin.

668
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,330
Jimmy?

669
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,160
-You're Kyojin?
-Yes.

670
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,200
-You're not Hanshin?
-But you're short.

671
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,560
Jimmy is very close.

672
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,160
Kyojin is the tall one.

673
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:09,530
Jimmy...

674
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,860
Jimmy?

675
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,960
Excuse me. I'm going to stand.

676
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,760
Can I go outside?

677
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,230
Hold on.

678
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,100
This can't be right.

679
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,200
-Who's out?
-Don't joke like that from the very start.

680
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,330
-Is it you?
-No, I laughed after the buzzer.

681
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,930
RULE 6: LAUGHTER IS PERMITTED
WHILE PLAY IS SUSPENDED

682
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,430
-Who was it?
-Wait.

683
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,960
-Wait.
-Who laughed first?

684
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,560
Hachi, I can't believe you did that.

685
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,930
Pretty much everyone laughed.

686
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,330
So, this is really...

687
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,800
I will let this one go,
but almost everyone was laughing.

688
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,830
-You consider that laughing?
-This is going to be tough.

689
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,700
Almost everyone laughed.

690
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,430
-Where does a "laugh" start?
-You can't have your mouth open wide.

691
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,060
-Okay?
-Are you serious?

692
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,160
-You all laughed.
-Jimmy, that's too much.

693
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,030
-Am I the best so far?
-You were really good.

694
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,300
Hey, it's just the beginning.
Can't we slowly ease into it?

695
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,230
-No.
-We can't. We started.

696
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,130
Look. Only 18 seconds have passed.

697
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,660
-That was quick.
-Jimmy, that was way too quick.

698
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:16,100
I didn't want to stop this.
Can you stop the timer for me?

699
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,000
-I didn't want to stop.
-This is impossible.

700
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,260
But you were terrible.

701
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,200
Everyone was laughing.

702
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,860
Let's make it clear.
We have to keep a normal, natural face.

703
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,430
-That's right.
-Otherwise--

704
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:30,460
Then let's check what our normal
faces look like.

705
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:34,460
To be precise, Jiro was laughing a bit
when he introduced himself to Jimmy.

706
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,130
RULE 7:
SMILING WILL BE RULED AS A LAUGH

707
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,960
-He smiled.
-We can't even smile?

708
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,400
No, you can't.

709
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,530
Then we have to see everyone's
normal face first.

710
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,160
No, we don't.

711
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,760
There's no need to.
Why do you want to see it?

712
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,460
You won't get any more chances!

713
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,930
-We're not the judges.
-No more chances!

714
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,630
Fujimoto, stop coming in so fast.
You're relentless.

715
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,100
He's killing me.

716
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,760
-I'm serious.
-Wait a minute!

717
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,230
This is my normal face.

718
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,360
This is my normal face, okay?

719
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,430
Yes, that's your normal face.

720
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,530
Just keep that.

721
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,760
But Fujimoto's face is kind of smiling.

722
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,530
Put on a more neutral face.

723
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,630
-Like that.
-I have to stay like this?

724
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,900
-That will do.
-This is going to be tough.

725
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,230
So, you guys gave me no choice.

726
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,200
Everyone was all smiles.

727
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,330
I think we'll be done in about 18 minutes.

728
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,100
We'll finish really quick.

729
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,200
-We won't last that long.
-It's no fun at all.

730
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,960
Jimmy, that face is great.

731
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,230
-Like this?
-Yeah.

732
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,260
Keep that face.

733
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,130
Wait!

734
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,700
You're making us laugh!

735
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,100
I'm allowed to laugh.

736
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,660
Sorry.

737
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,560
-Don't attack us from the side.
-Sorry.

738
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,100
I'm done for!

739
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:50,130
We're about to start.
Let's put on neutral faces.

740
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,700
Let's keep a neutral face.

741
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,000
-Jimmy, you're smiling.
-I'm not.

742
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,230
Yes, you are.

743
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,530
Daisuke, stop that.

744
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,700
Stop saying that.

745
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,460
Play's still suspended, right?

746
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,260
This is my normal face.

747
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,860
-You're smiling.
-I'm not.

748
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,260
You are smiling.

749
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,630
You are smiling.

750
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,060
Yeah, he's smiling.

751
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,300
-You call this smiling?
-Yes. You are.

752
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,730
You are. Look at your nose.

753
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,130
-Your nose is laughing.
-I don't think so.

754
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,830
Here we go. Start!

755
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:20,030
It's because I blow my nose too much.

756
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,400
-Should we put our things in a locker?
-You're right.

757
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,560
He said he blows his nose too much?

758
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:32,230
-Where are the lockers?
-In the back.

759
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,700
THE ROOM COMES WITH A BATH,
SHOWER AND TOILET

760
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,030
Kawahara looks dangerous.

761
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,860
-I didn't know we could smoke here.
-You can have some of mine.

762
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,130
Put that envelope away.

763
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,730
-Oh, sorry.
-Give it to Fujimoto.

764
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,830
Give it to him.

765
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,960
Cut it out.

766
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,330
Oh, Fujimoto...

767
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,960
Where are the lockers?

768
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:01,200
Fujimoto has sort of been smirking.

769
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,760
-We have sushi, too.
-Look at this.

770
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,930
Oh, I can...

771
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,400
-He can make us sushi.
-Lucky us.

772
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,060
I'll make some later.

773
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,500
I don't want any of yours.

774
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,930
-I don't know about your sushi.
-But my parents own a sushi restaurant.

775
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,930
Put those envelopes away.

776
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,900
Why is he roaming around?

777
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,030
-Where did you get the envelopes?
-I bought them.

778
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:31,100
You stole the envelopes from
Daisuke & Hanako's dressing room?

779
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:35,160
You think I stole from them?
What would they have to steal?

780
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,660
-I'm sure there's something.
-They have nothing but great jokes.

781
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,960
What a square.

782
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,830
-Stop fighting.
-We're not here to fight.

783
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,060
Stop following me.

784
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,800
Let's take turns at smoking.

785
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,730
Jimmy's making a move already.

786
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,330
This set is amazing.

787
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,330
Fujimoto looks suspicious.

788
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,500
This is a nice kitchen.

789
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,100
It's amazing.

790
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,330
-We can go over here, right?
-Yeah.

791
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,260
-We can spread out.
-Anything goes.

792
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,730
Really?

793
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,760
You brought heaps.

794
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,400
-Is that wine?
-Yes.

795
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,260
-Drinking already?
-From the bottle?

796
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,760
-You're cool.
-I'm going to drink wine.

797
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,660
Just like Julie's song.

798
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,960
Do you want some nibbles?

799
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,960
Do you want something to nibble?

800
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,460
-No, thanks.
-Okay.

801
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,760
No nibbles or giggles?

802
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,460
-Stop it.
-He's like a bartender.

803
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,560
At a bar.

804
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,430
-It's hot in here.
-This is a nice frying pan.

805
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,060
Is the shower this way? Oh, it's here.

806
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,530
Wow.

807
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:54,900
They brought one in.

808
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,360
Stop roaming around, Anthony.

809
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,260
You're in my line of sight.

810
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,630
Right?

811
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,930
-We still have a long way to go.
-Yes.

812
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,530
-It hasn't even been 10 minutes.
-Really?

813
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,100
-We have six hours here.
-Those 10 minutes went by quickly for me.

814
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,030
I agree with you.

815
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,430
It's faster than I expected.

816
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:28,600
-10 minutes have passed already?
-Not yet. It's been six.

817
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,360
It's only been six minutes.

818
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,360
Ohchi?

819
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,130
-Are we allowed to smoke?
-You can smoke over there.

820
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,000
Well, wherever.

821
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,000
-Is that really alcohol?
-It is.

822
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,330
It's red wine.

823
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,930
-Red wine.
-Wow.

824
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,230
You'd rather be drunk?

825
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,060
No, I just like alcohol.

826
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,760
-Were you born in Spain?
-What?

827
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,300
This polo shirt is from Spain.

828
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,000
I have the exact same shirt.

829
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,660
But I bought mine in Okinawa.

830
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,700
-As a present on a holiday.
-I got mine at the mall.

831
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,330
I bought it on a family trip.

832
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,230
At the hotel.

833
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,330
The hotel's boutique.

834
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,800
We didn't ask about your shirt.

835
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,360
Do you have this shirt?

836
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,300
I saw a homeless guy wearing this.

837
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,430
The old guy had the very same one.

838
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,030
The polo shirt.

839
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,400
We all bought one.

840
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,100
So, my wife has one, too.

841
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,000
She has the dress version.

842
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
-She has the dress version.
-Who does?

843
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:55,060
-We all decided to buy the same one.
-Your wife, too?

844
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,330
Do you mean your giant wife?

845
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,160
It's not like she's Giant Shirota.

846
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,530
She's not Giant Shirota.

847
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,060
My "giant wife"?

848
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,630
She's not Giant Shirota!

849
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:21,900
This tastes great.

850
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:26,860
Ohchi is very close. And here's Jimmy.

851
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,600
They're mother and child.

852
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,330
Are you hungry?

853
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,660
Ohchi laughed.

854
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,600
Who is it?

855
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,930
Who laughed?

856
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,600
Who was it?

857
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,830
-Was it Jimmy?
-It's not me.

858
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,360
-Seriously, who was it?
-Not me.

859
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,930
-Who was it?
-Who?

860
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,300
-Phew!
-He's been laughing for a while.

861
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,200
-He was laughing a fair bit.
-Yes.

862
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,700
He'd actually been chuckling
for quite a while.

863
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,300
He was soft on you.

864
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,060
-What happened?
-He was laughing the whole time.

865
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:18,930
What was it?

866
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
-We can laugh now, right?
-It's okay now.

867
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,260
You laughed, right?

868
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:23,660
You were chuckling, right?

869
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,300
Because everyone was funny.

870
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,430
We haven't said anything funny yet.

871
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,660
It was nothing special.

872
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,960
You guys are wandering around too much.

873
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,460
-To muster up the courage.
-I want you to calm down.

874
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,860
It's too early for things like that.

875
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,760
He set me up.

876
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:41,930
It's too early to set us up.

877
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,500
-What are they?
-They're mother and child.

878
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,430
-Mother and child.
-Are you still going?

879
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,300
-So what if they're mother and child?
-She was hungry.

880
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:51,630
Enough, please.

881
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,060
Gentlemen...

882
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:57,200
We're going to watch a replay,
just to confirm that Ohchi laughed.

883
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,230
I think you know already,
but we'll play it here.

884
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,600
We have video evidence.

885
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,430
He was so quick.

886
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,800
Let's watch the replay.

887
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:15,130
Let's not hide our laughter with
cigarettes or drinks, okay?

888
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,500
He looks like Al Capone.

889
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,130
He's Al Capone.

890
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:23,360
He's Yoshimoto's Al Capone.

891
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,760
The cigarette tasted good.

892
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,230
You were laughing a lot before this, too.

893
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,130
Which means,

894
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,860
you get a yellow card.

895
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:34,700
You only get a yellow card for that?

896
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
-Look.
-He's laughing hard.

897
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,960
Well, I know, but...

898
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:43,960
We've really only just started.

899
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,230
-I'm safe. But if I get a red card?
-You're out.

900
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:50,930
If he laughs at something like that,
he'll be out in no time.

901
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,830
-You'd better start getting serious.
-Yes. Absolutely.

902
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,560
-I got it.
-It's one million yen.

903
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,900
I definitely won't laugh.

904
00:48:58,430 --> 00:48:59,400
Ouch!

905
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:00,930
What the hell was that?
