00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:10,790
Last week, they all tried to raise the ratings by showing their yet-unseen special skills

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:17,240
"TANAKA - BLOWPIPE WHILE RIDING A BALL"

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:01:23,540
(watch part 1 for subs @ shionnotsukai.wordpress.com)

7
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:31,880
"FUJIMOTO - BLAST WAVE PLASTIC BOTTLE KNOCK DOWN"

8
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,340
While Tanaka and Fujimoto had success...

9
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,350
"INOMOTO - FREE KICK WATER BOTTLE KNOCK DOWN"

10
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:57,400
"ENDO - 100% FULL SCORE SINGING AT KARAOKE"

"MIYASAKO - PERFECT NUNCHAKU"

12
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,200
The next 3 challengers fail their job

13
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,380

Will the remaining contestants be able to overcome this and raise the views?!

28
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,170
Here's our next special skill

29
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,130
That's the turning point

30
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,110
"Creamy facial-cleanser foam"

31
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,170
The hell is this?

32
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,670
What's that?
- So sudden...

33
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,980
Maybe our world view is different

34
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,850
Who's this?

35
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,810
Here

36
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,660
Hosshan?

37
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,660
I can make a creamy foam with soap for face, without instruments

38
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,200
It'll be creamier than you're thinking, for real

39
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,600
So creamy it could be used for CMs

40
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,590
I could even flip it and it wouldn't fall

41
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,030
- I see

42
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,590
That's right

43
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,060
But you don't make foam with it

44
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,660
Do you use it without foam?

45
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,240
And that explains your skin

46
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,240
- First you make foam...

47
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,780
And then you use it

48
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,680
That was brutal

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,680
Hosshan is aggressive today

50
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,250
But why?

51
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,930
You'll get how amazing it is once you'll see it

52
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,930
Go to the challenge room
- Ok

53
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,250
What's amazing about it?

54
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,050
I didn't get this

55
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,580
We're counting on you!

56
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,530
We're expecting a lot

57
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,570
I don't know how much this can be related to view-raising

58
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,200
Maybe our female audience will like it...

59
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:49,440
It's time for Hosshan's creamy soap foam, which mainly targets ladies

60
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,270
What will it be about?

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,740
Is that all you need?

62
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,630
Yeah, this is enough for something great

63
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,110
No idea how this will end

64
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,410
Here's Hosshan view-raising attempt!

65
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,340
We don't need this, don't we
- Yeah, we don't

66
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,780
VIEW-RAISING: START

67
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,220
It's not worth our time

68
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,690
He used a lot of it

69
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,030
He wet his hands,
took some cream...

70
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,760
What's this?

71
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,400
What is...?

72
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,600
What is he doing?

73
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,470
Why do we have to watch this?

74
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,140
Is this going to actually raise our views...?

75
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,150
Maybe when he's done...
- If he succeeds maybe they'll raise

76
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,310
He's making a lot of foam
- Is it working?

77
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,310
What is this person doing everyday?

78
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,810
Our views won't raise

79
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,510
His face is so focused

80
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,350
I mean, you don't need to be an expert for this

81
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,350
Here goes

82
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,350
Look!

83
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,220
Of course it does it

84
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,700
Isn't it obvious?

85
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,270
That's like a praying mantis egg

86
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,300
Normally it would fall

87
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,780
.

88
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,780
It was a success, why are you gaving me that?

89
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,300
- "Gaving"?

90
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,800
I wanted something which would have made me go "woah"

91
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,060
That's right

92
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,570
And a standing ovation
- Yeah...

93
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,620
Isn't it impressive? With only these tools...

94
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Not really...
- He's complaining a lot

95
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,430
This show has become "old dudes grunting around" by now

96
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,600
Old dudes complaint show

97
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,230
Our views won't raise like this

98
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,760
This week is bad
- Oh, he's back

99
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,430
He looks so pissed off

100
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,110
Look at his face!
- He's really angry

101
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,050
I did it properly, why does it have to be like this?

102
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,270
I mean, we should start discussing about this

103
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,340
You should know this

104
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,120
Your face is becoming just like a Wagen

105
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,990
Your face really looks like a Volkswagen right now

106
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,520
Absurdly enough, 5 between the 7 contestants failed their challenge

107
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:58,830
note: Hosei's footage has been cut away from the final edit of both episodes

108
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,830
Will they be able to fix this course of events?

109
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,160
Man, this isn't going well
- Let's go

110
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,440
It's an old story by now

111
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,640
Success is an old story

112
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,530
Here's our next special skill:

113
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,240
"Karate chop bre--

114
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,810
Bric-- brea--- br---"

115
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,310
You couldn't say a word of it!

116
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,080
I somehow felt like this wouldn't go well

117
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,360
I meant "brick break"

118
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,030
You haven't been speaking properly since a long time by now

119
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,940
You're losing your focus

120
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,690
Who's this?

121
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,920
That's me

122
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,860
Oh, Fujiwara?
- I figured it

123
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,670
And how many bricks..?

124
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,440
10 tiles

125
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,440
For real?
- Yeah

126
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,870
My partner couldn't make it, so I have to do this

127
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,400
Makes sense
- I see...

128
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,810
I'll change this atmasp--- atmosphere

129
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,810
- Huh?!

130
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,910
Those who haven't stuttered yet, please raise your hand

131
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,210
I haven't
- I haven't yet

132
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,490
You're such a liar! You stuttered like crazy

133
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,630
What's this?

134
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,960
It's like this because we keep on failing

135
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,800
Must be its bad influence
- Countin' on you, Fujiwara!

136
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,570
I'm changing this flow! Here I go!

137
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,830
Amazing!      - Go for it!
- Break em all!

138
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,430
In order to stop this horrible slope and raise the views...

139
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,670
Fujiwara faces his karate chop bricks break, with 10 tiles

140
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,950
If from now on every challenge goes well, our success rate will be over 50%

141
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,210
From now on failure won't be an option

142
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,950
Looks like he's ready, let's call him: Fujiwara!

143
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,510
Yes

144
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,890
That's a lot
- Impressive...

145
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,150
With a chop, right?

146
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,150
Let's go
- Go for it!

147
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,890
Here's Fujiwara view-raising attempt!

148
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,320
You can do it

149
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,100
Go for it
- Please do it

150
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,800
VIEW-RAISING: START

151
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,800
Please do it

152
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,840
Holy cow!

153
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,190
That's the good stuff

154
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,810
Wonderful

155
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,810
That's what I wanted to see

156
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,310
Great job!
- That was incredible

157
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,610
He made it look so easy

158
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,320
Really

159
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,100
He broke em so cleanly

160
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,920
Amazing

161
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,720
That was good
- So cool

162
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,640
It went well

163
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,240
Finally
- We're back at it

164
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,030
They'll definitely raise with this

165
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,530
We have to fix this
- Yes, we're done failing now

166
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,080
Let's keep this pace

167
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,580
Yes

168
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,880
Let's go then, here's our next special skill:

169
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,280
I beg you...

170
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,020
"Golf magazine scent guess"

171
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,020
- What the-?

172
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,420
Looks like we're back to crap...

173
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,250
Who's this?

174
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:37,950
It's me

175
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,170
What's this?

176
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,620
Well, you know...

177
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,330
I really like golf, so...

178
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,830
I read so many golf magazines that I can guess which one is it just by its scent

179
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,600
Isn't it weird that's the skill you developed instead of being good at golf?

180
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,190
I mean, it's about golf...
- Yeah but golf is hard

181
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,880
Then why are you reading those magazines?

182
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,880
- No, I mean...

183
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,950
Because I want to become good at it, I'm just an amateur

184
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,950
And yet you learned how they smell?

185
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,510
For real?

186
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,010
How many magazines?

187
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,710
Today I'll guess between 5...

188
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,310
5?
- Yeah

189
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,460
If he guesses it I'd be amazed

190
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,360
Yeah and only by smelling it

191
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,620
Hotohara, confident about his olfaction

192
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,000
Will try to guess the correct golf magazine

193
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,390
How much will he be able to raise the views?

194
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,670
He got a national certification for
"handling poisonous and deleterious substances"

195
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,170
And for that, you have to do a test

196
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,580
In which there are many elements like ammonia

197
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,750
And you have to guess a certain right element
between a large number of others, just by smelling it

198
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,180
That's incredible
- He got that

199
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,990
Looks like he's ready, Hoto-chan?

200
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,990
I'm ready

201
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,390
So, how are you gonna do it?

202
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,550
Let's see
- Yes

203
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,730
"GOLF DIGEST"
"PAR-GOLF"

204
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,490
As you can see there are 5 magazines

205
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,990
I'll now put on a blindfold

206
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,200
"GOLF TODAY"
"ALBA"
"GOLF STYLE"

207
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,220
And I'm going to guess it just by smelling it

208
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,530
Is someone going to pass them to you?

209
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,540
- Yes, Nakamura is in charge

210
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,500
Which is the one you like the most?

211
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,470
Woah, it's difficult...

212
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,110
Let's move on then

213
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,270
Here's Hoto-chan attempt to raise our views!

214
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,970
I want him to get them all

215
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,950
VIEW-RAISING: START

216
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,100
So, which will be the first one?

217
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,550
Ah, he's shuffling them

218
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,820
And now they're all mixed up

219
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
No way he'll get this
- I think so too

220
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,690
But maybe they actually smell different

221
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,720
I see

222
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,320
Alright

223
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,760
That much?

224
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,490
Like that?
- Is he for real?

225
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:36,860
I think...

226
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,970
Another page, please?

227
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,340
I think our views-per-minute are going down

228
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,070
I hope he'll get it right
- Yeah, that's it

229
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,840
I got this

230
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,070
Really? Can he make it?

231
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,470
May I?

232
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,410
Sure

233
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,220
It's "Par-golf"!

234
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,050
"GOLF DIGEST"

235
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,340
He got that wrong

236
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,050
WRONG ANSWER

237
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,720
The signboard fell down

238
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,450
It fell as soon as he answered

239
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,120
You got that wrong and as soon as that happened, the signboard behind us fell

240
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,760
Get back here Hotohara

241
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,200
Yes, here I come

242
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm hating this

243
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm coming back

244
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,960
Good reaction at least

245
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,870
Here I am

246
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,810
This place is becoming haunted

247
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,830
That was incredible
- It really was

248
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,450
"Par-golf" and it went "crack", then the buzzer

249
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,820
I think everyone already changed channel

250
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,510
And that's why this thing fell down

251
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,820
Here's our next special skill:

252
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,120
Please...
- Please be good

253
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,750
"Blindfolded folding chair sitting"

254
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,120
Huh? What's that about?

255
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,920
What's this?

256
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Sounds dangerous...
- Who's this?

257
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,720
That's me

258
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,580
Yes

259
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,060
What's this?

260
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,730
What is...?

261
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,660
I'll wear a blindfold and have the staff place a folding chair somewhere

262
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,910
It will make a sound as it's placed

263
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,250
And that's where I'll sit

264
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,470
It could be good if he actually does it

265
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,120
Is there any proof you can actually do that?

266
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,990
Mh?

267
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,550
Something that proves it---

268
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,020
Is there really someone who could answer that question?

269
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,620
He didn't hear me

270
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,750
But you never actually tried doing this, isn't that right?

271
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,020
Well, yeah

272
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,320
I'll show you that I can

273
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,930
It'd be amazing if you can

274
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,970
But really, wouldn't it be the best one yet?

275
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,970
An incredible skill which will surely raise the views, if done well

276
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,530
Haranishi is ready to face the blindfolded folding-chair sitting

277
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,040
He's ready by now, let's call him: Haranishi?

278
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,770
Yes

279
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,010
Show us the studio before you start

280
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,880
Yes
- I see
- Pretty big

281
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,950
There are tons of obstacles!
- Looks dangerous

282
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,470
Are you sure?

283
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,750
To be sure I don't know where it'll be...
- Yes?

284
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,950
This person here...
- Yes?

285
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,120
"This person"?
- But that's Nakamura

286
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,560
He doesn't know him much

287
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,720
I'll rely on sounds so please let me focus

288
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,950
He's right
- Alright, we got it

289
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,160
We'll be quiet

290
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,630
Here's Haranishi's view-raising attempt

291
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,530
Maybe he measured it

292
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,530
With a ruler or such

293
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,040
VIEW-RAISING: START

294
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,240
I hope he can make it

295
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,450
So fast!

296
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,920
What the hell!

297
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,800
What the hell, dude!

298
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,130
What was that?

299
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,140
You idiot!

300
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,380
His direction was spot on though

301
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,170
Of course you'd get the direction right

302
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,120
Everyone could get that right, at least

303
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,120
It was my first time, I couldn't know I'd hit the side

304
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,510
I should have put protectors on

305
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,310
He went so fast

306
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,190
For a moment I thought you could do it

307
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,690
It didn't seem like he was ready to sit down

308
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,320
He kept on moving forward

309
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
I wanna see it again

310
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,610
We can't raise our views at all...

311
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,580
Now it's all up to you two guys

312
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,580
- He's right, we're counting on you

313
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,480
Let's go then, here's our next special skill:

314
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,050
I wonder which is it?

315
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,910
"Stout arm rope climbing"

316
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,140
Is it one of you guys?

317
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,280
That would be me

318
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,440
Yeah, it's not me

319
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:26,130
Long story short, I'll climb up a rope by only using my arms

320
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,830
Like this?
- Oh, amazing

321
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,650
It's 6 meters

322
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,750
Ehh?!
- What?!

323
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,600
I see

324
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,070
6 meters is pretty high, isn't it

325
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,360
You have to do this, man

326
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,460
Give it your best!

327
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,610
After all he's being working out a lot, recently

328
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,210
- That's right, he is

329
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:46,610
- Yeah

330
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,350
I actually tried it once

331
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,420
It's fine until you're halfway through it

332
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,420
- That's when things get hard

333
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,090
I can do like 3 or 4 meters but

334
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:01,030
But after that my arms start hurting and if I let go of one, I can't get any higher

335
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,530
You just have to do it in one shot

336
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,050
It's over once you stop

337
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,490
Now I get this atmosphere

338
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:12,350
As failed attempts pile up, Matsumoto will face the 6 meters rope climbing

339
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,560
Will he succeed and raise the views per minute?

340
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,180
Looks like he's ready, so let's call him: Matsumoto-san?

341
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,180
It's pretty high

342
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,380
Is it? Please show us the studio

343
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,980
I see

344
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,040
So high!

345
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,110
Only with your arms?

346
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,710
Yes

347
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,390
Impressive

348
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,890
This will raise our views if it goes well

349
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,090
It's pretty high

350
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,890
As failed attempts piles up, Matsumoto will face the 6 meters rope climbing

351
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,790
Only with your arms?
- Yes

352
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,430
Impressive

353
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,970
This will raise our views if it goes well

354
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,570
Here's Matsumoto view-raising attempt

355
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,570
Will he be fine?

356
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,570
Start!

357
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,790
VIEW-RAISING: START

358
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,790
Amazing!

359
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,170
Incredible!
- Woah!

360
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,750
Keep on going!
- Incredible!

361
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,360
Incredible!!

362
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
It was a piece of cake for him!

363
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,200
Amazing!

364
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,130
Wonderful

365
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,130
He made it look so easy!

366
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,270
We did it!

367
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,470
Really impressive

368
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:37,690
Why everyone is cheering so much but no one stood up?

369
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,810
- 'Cause he was so calm about it!

370
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:40,910
I see, I see

371
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,410
Matsumoto-san

372
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,220
It was a success

373
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,220
Huh? Who are you, Rola?

374
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,320
Why that Rola pose?
- Why?

375
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,020
There's no need to do that, you know

376
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:53,830
Thanks!

377
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,830
Great job

378
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,910
That was good
- So good!

379
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,310
You think I'm ready to go to "SASUKE"?

380
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,310
note: japanese version of tv show "Ninja Warrior"

381
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,070
- No way

382
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,310
That's too much

383
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,650
That thing is in the final stage

384
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,890
Adult! Cool!

385
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,890
- You know there are three stages? That's just part of the last one

386
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,610
And here we are

387
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,950
Only Hamada is left

388
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,650
Yeah
- I don't know what he's going to do

389
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,420
Let's see then, here's our next special skill

390
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,020
"No-damage slap"

391
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,750
What's that?

392
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,860
It'll only make sound

393
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,500
I'll slap you and it won't hurt you at all

394
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,440
Of course it will make sound

395
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,070
But you'll be like "Huh? Did I get slapped?"

396
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,430
The aim is unclear...

397
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,130
It feels like a huge raincloud suddenly came through

398
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,200
It's totally fine

399
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
But who's gonna get slapped...?

400
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,400
Anyone's good

401
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Yeah but...
- No way, no way...

402
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,040
Don't worry, I'll be waiting

403
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,150
Huh? Waiting? You're going?

404
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,860
Yeah, in the challenge room, anyone's fine, so...

405
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,460
Alright then, come, Tanaka!

406
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,530
It won't hurt at all, it'll be fine!

407
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,170
By "it won't hurt" he means

408
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,540
That there won't be "sadness" or "anger" in it

409
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,540
- You have to try it to get it

410
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,630
Go find that out for us
- You have to do it

411
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,030
Are you kidding me?

412
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,270
There's the risk it may hurt

413
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,270
So it's a damage-slap?

414
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,670
I don't want that

415
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,510
But he said it's a no-damage slap

416
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,510
You'll be fine

417
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,790
I really don't know...
- I mean, he said that--

418
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,520
He's reacting as if he invited him to a public bath

419
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,910
I bet it'll hurt

420
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,860
Poor Tanaka

421
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,460
After the ball-riding success this was probably the best day of his life...

422
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,400
You're right, he really surprised us before

423
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,170
To be slapped after his best spotlight...

424
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,310
Hamada will show us his no-damage slap, which can't hurt

425
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,200
Will he keep the views high with this special skill?

426
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,970
Looks like he's ready, so let's call him

427
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,770
Hamada-san?

428
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,210
He's so scary

429
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,410
The way he's moving his neck...

430
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,410
I've been waiting here for so long, geez

431
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,630
He's pissed off...
- He looks angry, I think he'll hurt him

432
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,460
It looks like he's wearing a collar

433
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,090
Everyone would have been fine but I passed by him, so here's Tanaka

434
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,800
"Passed by"...?

435
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,840
He's so pale!

436
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,440
He's becoming a noble

437
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,040
You'll only hear a loud sound

438
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,510
But he won't be hurt

439
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,340
Alright, whenever you're ready

440
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,620
Ok, here's Hamada's attempt to raise our views!

441
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,360
VIEW-RAISING: START

442
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,730
You sure there's no damage?

443
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,330
He's becoming red

444
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,190
He left a mark

445
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,860
Tanaka?

446
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,800
Any damage?

447
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,270
No damage

448
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,610
You liar!!

449
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,510
We're not buying that, Tanaka

450
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,600
I swear it's true

451
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,450
Are you forcing him to say so?

452
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,050
No, I'm not

453
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,220
Come on, who's next?

454
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,220
- There's no need for that...

455
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,920
It won't hurt you a bit, right, Tanaka?

456
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,950
It didn't hurt at all

457
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,450
Choose the next one, Tanaka

458
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,150
What do you mean?

459
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,450
Does he have to say it?

460
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,580
You're doubting me, so I want you to believe it

461
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,090
Just ask Tanaka, he'll say it was just a sound

462
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,990
Was it really no-damage?

463
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,440
Yeah, it doesn't hurt

464
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,840
Your cheek became so red!

465
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,870
I can see three fingers there

466
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,700
Those are definitely fingers

467
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,570
Really?

468
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,700
But I swear, it wasn't painful at all

469
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,510
Are you doubting him?

470
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,310
We're not doubting him
- Not really...

471
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,340
Let's call it a day

472
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,820
What are we gonna do?

473
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:45,330
Who's coming here? Matsumoto? Miyasako? Which one of them?

474
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,230
- "Which one"?!

475
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,560
No way I'm going

476
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,700
No way I'm going

477
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,160
No way I'm going

478
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,020
You see...
- But it really is no-damage!

479
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,170
This year...

480
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:58,240
Is going to be the 30th anniversary of Downtown

481
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,030
I see, I see...

482
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,840
No way I'm getting a slap from my partner as a gift

483
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,780
AFTER THIS - HAMADA WILL SLAP MATSUMOTO!?

484
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,180
Who has been the worst one between us today?

485
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,150
Are we going with majority vote?

486
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,150
- We are

487
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,190
I hit that red bean, you know

488
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,320
I think there's more than one

489
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,290
How about we all choose one in order?
- Ok

490
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,150
Who should I choose?

491
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,700
There have been a lot...

492
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,700
So, who sucked the most between us?

493
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,020
The smell thingy

494
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,230
Well but, I only tried once and failed, so...

495
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,760
Miyasako's nunchaku

496
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,330
Yeah, that one...

497
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,330
I didn't like Miyasako's attitude too

498
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,470
I see

499
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,570
But I hit that red bean--

500
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,740
I think the nunchaku

501
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,640
3 points

502
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,510
Miyasako-san?

503
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,360
I hit that goddamn red bean

504
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:51,860
Foam

505
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,320
Oh, that one too
- I almost forgot that

506
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,120
Matsumoto-san?

507
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,890
Probably smell-guess

508
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:02,720
That one, huh...

509
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,930
I'm not surprised

510
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,930
Yamazaki?
- Foam

511
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,670
Poor guy

512
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,470
Endo?
- I'd say...

513
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,110
Smell

514
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,570
Tanaka?

515
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,010
I'm sorry, foam

516
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,010
Now they're all even

517
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,940
What an amazing fight
- They all scored three points

518
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,750
It's all up to License now

519
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,600
I'll vote...

520
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,700
Nunchaku

521
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,350
Now it's all up to you, Fujiwara

522
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,620
But I hit that red bean...

523
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,590
Nunchaku

524
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,590
Miyasako, who failed his perfect nunchaku,

525
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,060
Will be the one to face the no-damage slap!!

526
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,660
It's just sound

527
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,580
It'll be like "wham!", but there won't be any damage

528
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,780
But I hit that red bean...

529
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,780
There's no need to be worried
- Right

530
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,370
I hit that red bean

531
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:55,040
AZUKI - DIAMETER 7mm

532
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:52,670
The red bean

533
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,220
Can you hit it?

534
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,040
Well, I did

535
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,180
This feels so strange and hard to believe...

536
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,180
Miyasako has arrived

537
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,680
So you were chosen, huh?

538
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,230
Even though I hit that red bean

539
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,230
Again?
- He's still saying it

540
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,630
I'm ready anytime

541
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,090
But wait, Miyasako is focusing right now

542
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,190
Does he need to?

543
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,430
In a way he needs to focus

544
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,670
Red bean again?

545
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,680
But I hit that red bean

546
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,940
Here's Hamada's view-raising attempt: start!

547
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,440
He's laughing

548
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,480
I hit that...

549
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
It will be fine

550
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,310
VIEW-RAISING: START

551
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,080
It's just sound

552
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,840
The red bean...

553
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,080
Huh? What happened?

554
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,480
There wasn't much sound

555
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,130
That was an old lady beating a carpet

556
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,430
Miyasako-kun

557
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,330
Was it no-damage?

558
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,590
I hit that goddamn red bean...

559
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:54,610
(it means a lot!)
