1
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:33,450
This time we dont have tough opponents like Kukki

2
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,120
So we have some new players

3
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,020
But slowly, the numbers of Documental veterans

4
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,060
is increasing isnt it?

5
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,670
How do you want the ideal
evolution of Documental to be?

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,910
I definitely think variation
is very important

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,580
Like if it ended within
5 minutes

8
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,150
So if everyone laughed within just
5 minutes

9
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,790
If it just ended that fast

10
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,520
I think if something like that happened
that would be interesting

11
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,360
I have similar thoughts in my head

12
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:54,620
[Recap]

13
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,270
Here we go

14
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,200
-Is there a Magic Marker here? For the water...
-To write names?

15
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,580
-Its not that but wouldnt this work too?
- Yeah thats fine too

16
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,910
It would be good so we know who's bottle is which

17
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,280
We dont want to be
unhygienic

18
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,720
Why did you write Hayashi Maya?

19
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,790
You can write whatever

20
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,860
-As long as you know
-Yeah like I am the one who wrote Hayashi Maya

21
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,660
I see

22
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,870
Passion Yaura?

23
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Passion Yaura: A comedian

24
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,010
That guy?

25
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,610
This guy?

26
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,050
Choge Choge Passion

27
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,690
You have to look at him

28
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,350
He said Choge Choge Passion

29
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Choge Choge Passion

30
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,370
Dont look away

31
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,970
Takahashi and Junior cant hold it in eh

32
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,010
-Choge Choge Passion was..
-Let him write it

33
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,980
Hes really good

34
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,010
Kobayashi is really good

35
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,980
-You can tell who wrote what right?
-Yeah

36
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,590
-Wankoso Bataro? Who is that?
-Wankoso Bataro?

37
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,190
Its a funny name I came up with
for making people laugh

38
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,830
Wanko Sobataro?

39
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,000
-Isnt it Wankoso Bataro?
-Wankoso Bataro

40
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,030
Eh? Wan Kosobataro?

41
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,070
Wankosoba Taro, right?

42
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Wait a minute...
Its Wankosoba Taro

43
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,540
Its not Wankoso Bataro?

44
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,950
-Its Wankoso Bataro?
-Bataro?

45
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,920
-Yeah thats it
-Who is Wankoso Bataro?

46
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,890
Its just a funny name I came up with

47
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,930
-Wanko F. Bataro?
-No thats not it

48
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,330
Its Wanko Sobataro

49
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,930
Do you guys not have a name...

50
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,540
that you use for making people laugh?

51
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,210
Usually I use
"Makise Riho"

52
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,810
I see

53
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,880
That changes with time right?
Depending on the era

54
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,280
Should we do something?

55
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,320
Lets finish writing the names

56
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,820
I can write anything right?

57
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,790
Yeah
[inaudible]

58
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,160
The bad thing about
Jinnai is....

59
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,630
I mean what worries me about Jinnai is

60
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:58,700
he is an all-rounder but
his Oogiri is really not funny

61
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,410
A new Kamen Rider is still
made like Kamen rider, right?

62
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,410
It doesnt make any sense right?

63
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,060
Wankoso Bajiro

64
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,520
Oh little brother?

65
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,160
He had a brother?

66
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,960
Wankoso Bajiro?

67
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,870
Wan Kosobajiro

68
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,100
So its Wan Kosobajiro?

69
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,840
-Bajiro
-Wan Kosobataro?

70
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,410
Wankoso

71
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,440
Figure it out already!

72
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,120
How long are you gonna
take?

73
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,360
As long as you know what you wrote
anything is fine

74
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,590
Ichiro

75
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,040
Thats the full name?

76
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,240
Jimmy, Jimmy

77
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,310
-Didnt you say anything is fine
-Anything is fine but..

78
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,350
Then literally anything
should be ok right?

79
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,350
Just one..

80
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,650
This is the best one
I could come up with

81
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,020
Jimmy-san?

82
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,730
-Jimmy-san?
-Yes?

83
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,470
What made you laugh?

84
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,340
The ichiro bit got me

85
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,580
The ichiro bit almost got me too

86
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,220
I dont understand how that was
funny

87
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,480
I thought is he gonna say
eat an egg to fix that?

88
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:59,120
-Thats really a stretch
-Yeah but then he looked at me

89
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,530
Ichiro

90
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,970
Jimmy-san..

91
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,510
-Jimmy-san
-Yes

92
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,540
Junior and Takashi were almost laughing too

93
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,350
Yeah really, they were very
close

94
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,190
You almost laughed during the Passion
bit didnt you?

95
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,920
-Werent you laughing?
-No I wasnt laughing

96
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,060
Since the beginning, you have
been laughing

97
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,030
No, I havent

98
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,100
-Even while talking, you were laughing

99
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,970
but seriously, there was nothing
funny about ichiro

100
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,140
But It made him laugh

101
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,310
-That was really a stretch
-There is no penalty for that is there?

102
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,050
-Juionr-san werent you laughing too at that?
-You did, right?

103
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:10,460
-LIke that!
-Ah, you cant smile while talking either , right?

104
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,700
Thats not allowed either right?

105
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,070
Thats not acceptable either, eh?

106
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:26,240
-Looks like Jimmy-san is being left out
-No, thats not true

107
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,650
No, thats not true

108
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,480
Really

109
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,150
What did you write?

110
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,450
I should read it right?

111
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,020
Purin Hime(Pudding Princess)

112
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,460
-Whos that?
-Someone you know?

113
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,290
Its about when Zakusho

114
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,160
failed to lose his virginity

115
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,800
-You held hands till the morning right?
-You liked her?

116
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,500
The name sounds like
Goth Loli Fashion

117
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,970
She had a tasty lookin face

118
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,550
-She had a tasty lookin face
-And since he couldnt lose his virginity

119
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,950
I challenged him

120
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,620
to hit on girls

121
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,080
I told him to come with me

122
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,320
We picked up girls together

123
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:16,030
Then we sang some songs and said
"lets go to the Love Hotel"

124
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:21,930
"Tell me what to do" he said to the girl
and lost his virginity

125
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,070
Jimmy?

126
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:28,770
The girl he was with was called Bayashi

127
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,780
Lets go

128
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:37,350
and he said "Bayashi, what should we do?"

"Take it out" , she said.

129
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,560
So at that time when you
lost your virginity

130
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,330
and he asked "How did it go?"

131
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,170
Did you say that "something gummy
just came out of me?"

132
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,540
Wait it was me?

133
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,240
Was it me? Was it really me?

134
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,620
-Was it me?
-Werent you just laughing?

135
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,350
You were really laughing!

136
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,920
When your turned your head away
you were laughing

137
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,890
-Yeah thats how it looked
-Wait a minute, wait

138
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,700
Wait, he will tell us who was laughing

139
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,270
You really were laughing

140
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,170
The Judge will decide

141
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,040
What do you mean The Judge

142
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,170
-It cant be me can it?
-Its Junior!

143
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,540
That was quick!

144
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,050
-Junior-san got one earlier too
-That was fast

145
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,980
-I was laughing?
-Yeah, lets have a look

146
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,790
and he asked "How did it go?"

147
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,160
Did you say that "something gummy
just came out of me?"

148
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,530
No, I was holding it in

149
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,160
It wasnt full on laughing

150
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,800
Thats why I didnt give you red

151
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,300
This is not acceptable either

152
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,540
But seriously, you have to be
careful now

153
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,480
-It hasnt even been 30 minutes
-We want you here, Junior-san

154
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,820
Junior-san if you laugh once more,
you are done, son.

155
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,580
-You just have one chance left
-So early

156
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,620
Even though I do want to see
Junior as a zombie

157
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,430
Try not to laugh
for as long as you can

158
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,260
Wait, who placed the egg here

159
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,230
-Is that what you were..

160
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,330
Somethings gonna happen with that?

161
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,570
What are you gonna do if
you know the culprit?

162
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,970
-But when its there-
-Who would laugh at that?

163
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,780
It just makes me curious

164
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,120
Are you writing Jimmy-san?

165
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,530
Are you farsighted?

166
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,660
No, nearsighted

167
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,200
How old are you now?

168
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,240
54

169
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,910
Ah, your eyesight must be starting to get bad now

170
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,670
Kanou Hospital

171
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,710
-Kanou Hospital?
-You have been there?

172
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:22,650
-Oh the place where you work?
-No, I was hospitalized there

173
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:26,080
-Why were you hospitalized?
-Why?

174
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,790
Ah thats um..

175
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,990
I cant talk about the reason

176
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,520
Eh?

177
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,130
Was it something really bad?

178
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:40,030
-Its ok, Itsj ust a disease right?
-Its up to you

179
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,400
Yeah

180
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,130
What happened?

181
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:47,340
The diagnosis was that , I got electric shock

182
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,340
-You got shocked?
-Where?

183
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,740
In my head

184
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,150
How long ago was that?

185
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,880
When someone told me to go
to the hospital

186
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,750
Who told you that?

187
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,190
-The police
-The police?

188
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,690
Why?Did something happen?

189
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,000
-Nothing happened but
-Out of nowhere?

190
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,430
-You were just shocked?
-And they told you to go to the hospital?

191
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,700
It really hurt

192
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,170
You were hospitalised?

193
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,240
No, at first It was just

194
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,040
Regular treatment

195
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,450
I was hospitalised for 3 days, however

196
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,520
Wait, so were you or were
you not?

197
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:36,690
-At first I wasnt hospitalised, but later I was
-Later you were?

198
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,360
-At Kanou Hospital?
-Kanou Memorial Hospital

199
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,490
Memorial?

200
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,170
Where is it located?

201
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,770
Near Ichiro

202
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,070
Ichiro?

203
00:14:53,510 --> 00:15:00,810
Takahashi...

204
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,150
-The ichiro bit reminded you of it eh?
-Yeah, the ichiro bit

205
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,120
You really like Ichiro dont you?

206
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,990
He must really like it

207
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,090
Have you always liked it?

208
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,660
Lets stop with that

209
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,640
Everyones drinking now

210
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,010
They probably thought
"Lets stop this"

211
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:34,510
Theres alot of beef sausages in the
refrigerator

212
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,250
-Jimmy-san you should lay down here
-Thats alot of sausages

213
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,020
-Thats alot of sausages
-I saw this in a Korean show

214
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:49,490
Someone was able to fit about
30 sausages in their mouth

215
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,930
Lets see who can fit the most
in their mouth

216
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,070
-These orange things?
-Yeah these

217
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,070
Lets see who can fit the most
in their mouth

218
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,670
-One by one?
-Wouldnt that many make you gag?

219
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,310
One person was able to
fit 30 on the show

220
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,240
Which Korean show is that?

221
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,950
-Jimmy san you..
-You should do it

222
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,120
-That would be good
-Ok, Jimmy-san and I will do it

223
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,990
-Takashi and Jimmy-san right?
-Alright

224
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,960
Lets do 3 at a time

225
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,930
Oh thats how you have to do it?

226
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,900
-Yeah just like that
-Someone did 30?

227
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,570
-Theres no way thats possible
-I think my mouth is just small

228
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,540
-Wouldnt it be easier if someone helped you with it?
-Yeah please that would be better

229
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,270
-Helping each other...
-You can still fit more right?

230
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,140
-Yeah, do 3 at a time
-I think 3 at a time would be difficult

231
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,750
You can fit 3 more?
3 at a time

232
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,120
-Its gonna fall , hold it in
-I dont think this is possible

233
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,660
Theres only 6 in and it already
looks full

234
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,960
Go ahead Kobayashi-san

235
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,130
-His mouth is so small
-Its not gonna fit anymore

236
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,340
-Even 10 seems impossible
-Hes got 7 now

237
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:12,040
Jimmy-san still has plenty of
room in there

238
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,380
-You can only do 7 right?
-Or can you do 8?

239
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,580
You are 8 sausages man

240
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,850
-8
-8 here too

241
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,420
Jimmy-san 's mouth is really flexible

242
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,560
-He can only do 8 I think
-Its not gonna fit

243
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,560
-Thats too many already isnt it?
-Its not gonna fit

244
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:39,970
-Is he gonna be able to do 9?
-Jimmy-san's mouth opens really wide

245
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,080
Alright, hes gonna do 9

246
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,880
-It fit
-Ok

247
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,950
10

248
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,920
-10 sausages now
-It looks so easy for Jimmy-san

249
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,390
-Thats awesome
-Alright the 10th now

250
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,000
He looks like hes struggling

251
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,900
Waah

252
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,670
Oooh!

253
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,770
-This is an intense battle
-But 30?No way

254
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:17,640
-Jimmy can probably fit 50
-His mouth is so flexible

255
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,180
You are starting to drool, Jimmy-san

256
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,620
Oh , cant fit any more?

257
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,920
Lets do three people at once?
-Yeah, that would be good

258
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,160
You are gonna do it yourself?

259
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,850
Ah! That was really hard

260
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:08,660
-But didnt you laugh?
-No seriously I didnt laugh

261
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,400
-Tamura was...
-I didnt laugh, I was just surprised

262
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,370
Tamuken!

263
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:29,180
-Almost everyone was about to laugh but Tamuken
seemed like he did

264
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,050
No way!

265
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,330
Ok after looking at it
I did laugh, even that is unacceptable eh?

266
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,530
-Wasnt Takahashi laughing too?

267
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,300
-Takahashi laughed harder than me
-No , I was just surprised

268
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,940
-Cut him some slack , his mouth was full
-He was just surprised

269
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,140
Honestly, I was just surprised

270
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:05,580
He put so many in, so easily
and quickly, I was shocked

271
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,190
Now that I saw that
I gotta really hold it in now

272
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,060
Oh and if you get hungry ,
feel free to use the phone

273
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,530
to order pizza or sushi, heres the numbers

274
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,630
Ahh that spells danger

275
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,670
-This is gonna be tough
-I gotta be more self-conscious y'all

276
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,410
Only after watching myself
I realized I was laughing

277
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,210
Here we go

278
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,950
-Are you gonna do it Akiyama?
- You can do atleast 10 right?

279
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,990
-How many?
-What if you do 10 at once?

280
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,490
Instead of doing it one by one
Just put alot at once

281
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,030
You wanna do 13 at once?

282
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:54,300
-Lets do 10
-10?

283
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,840
So thats how he wants to do it

284
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,650
He had that under his shirt

285
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,050
Beautiful

286
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,220
Umemiya-san please open your mouth
a bit more

287
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:25,160
Wouldnt it be harder with the
tongue sticking out?

288
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,660
Its one of your favorites

289
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,030
Beef sausage

290
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,570
You like that, dont you?

291
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,810
-Ah really?
-You like beef sausages?

292
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,580
Where do you get your sausages from?

293
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,280
You like all kind of meat right?

294
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,850
Not all meat is the same
I prefer steak

295
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,090
This is really difficult

296
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,620
Jinnai-san you do it

297
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,360
Alright I will do one at a time

298
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,300
Thats a really small mouth

299
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,060
Not just on the picture

300
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,870
Ok hes got it

301
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,170
-How many should I do?
-5 or 6 should be fine

302
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:10,780
-I'll do 3

303
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,540
The meat smells good right?

304
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:19,580
-If it didnt smell good, I wouldnt eat it
-How much meat do you usually eat?

305
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,190
When I eat, I eat like
400-500 of them

306
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,290
-Wait , hold on
-Its only 4 so far

307
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,630
Should I keep going?

308
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,600
No more

309
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,300
Did he say..

310
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,870
-Umemiya san?
-Ah , I cant really fit more

311
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,440
How many were in ?

312
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,280
Ah only 4

313
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,980
-Ah it came out
- Cant see through that right?

314
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,290
I couldnt fit anymore

315
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,560
It was too much

316
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,490
I was starting to gag

317
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,160
-Oh we got something else
-What is it?

318
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:11,600
I have this um
Duck Eye Light game

319
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,540
If you take these and the eyes light up
then you made the correct choice

320
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,980
Among these 4, 2 don't light up.
choosing the ones that light up gets you the win

321
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,080
-When you hold them they light up?
-Hold and press the button

322
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,050
Let me show you

323
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,320
-Right choice!
-But isnt that the mouth?

324
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,190
-So Duck Mouth Light
-Yeah the mouth lights up

325
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,590
-And thats the correct choice?
-Yeah since these light up

326
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,030
-So who wants to give it a shot?
-You get 2 at a time?

327
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,170
-Yeah so you choose 2 at a time
-And you just chose the right ones?

328
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,900
Alright, please pay attention

329
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,910
-Does someone want to do this challenge?
-I'll do it

330
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,810
Is it really difficult?

331
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:55,410
Its difficult when you have to choose
the correct pairs

332
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,020
Then that was impressive
that you did it

333
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,330
What happened?

334
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,060
It..uh

335
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,760
It shocked me

336
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,030
Really?

337
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,570
I was suprised

338
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,200
Try doing it

339
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,740
I dont know..

340
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:26,410
-Did it really shock you?
-Maybe it was just me

341
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,450
Watch out behind you

342
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,480
-Watch out, its Golgo
-Whats he doing

343
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,920
-Whats he doing?
-Looks dangerous

344
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,290
-Hes aiming at Jimmy-san
-Why are you aiming at me?

345
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,660
Isnt it really hot?

346
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,760
You want to...

347
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,400
isnt it hot?

348
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,540
Its really hot

349
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,140
Its so hot
Whats this?

350
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,910
If both of the ducks that you choose,
light up, then you win

351
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,950
-You choose two? which ones
-Whichever your want

352
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,150
2 of them light up
and the other two dont

353
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:12,420
Hold them and press them
from both sides

354
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:17,130
-The metal part is fine?
-Yeah, if it lights up, then you win

355
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,130
-It hurts

356
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:26,540
It hurts, it hurts....

357
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,850
Eh?

358
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:42,750
-What happened?
-Huh?

359
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,860
Huh?

360
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,870
-They all light up, dont they?
-Thats weird

361
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,440
You were just pretending
you werent feeling it right?

362
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,070
They all lit up

363
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,140
Wait, why is this not shocking you?

364
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,450
-Whats happening?
-Shigeo, check it out

365
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,520
If you do just one,

366
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,850
Just drop it in

367
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:22,030
-I am scared
-Once you know it its scary

368
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,760
That really shocked me

369
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,630
Eh?how?

370
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,870
Thats unbelievable, how can

371
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,370
Are you not feeling it?

372
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,740
-Its fine
-If hes holding it like that, it must be fine

373
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,880
Yeah

374
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,510
I can do 4 at once too

375
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:44,110
Eh? No dont do that

376
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:48,320
-Thats really something, I dont get it
-Arent you just pulling a poker face?

377
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,490
-Are you actually feeling it?
-Yeah, I can feel the electricity flowing

378
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:55,490
That much at once gotta
be really powerful

379
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,130
It must be very painful

380
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,700
-You gotta do 2 at the same time?
-Yeah

381
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,600
-So you hold it and press it?
-Yeah

382
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,750
We did tell you, it does that

383
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,520
What happened?

384
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,690
Whats making that sound?

385
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,360
-Eh? what is that?
-What ? what?

386
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,630
-It sounds like something vibrating
--Something down there

387
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,600
-It happened because of the electricity?

388
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,010
Ah its a vibrator

389
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,650
Isnt that dangerous?

390
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:54,390
The electricity from this turned it on

391
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:59,420
-Thats crazy
-Turn it off, and do it again

392
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,300
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

393
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,530
Who is it?

394
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,730
Are you asking about me?

395
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,800

398
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,510
Hafu usually refers to half-japanese

399
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,580
-I am a Hafu
-Eh?

400
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,310

England and.....

404
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,290
Canada

405
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,220
What an uncommon mix!

406
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,460
Yeah but it happens
What is this?

407
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,730
It turned on, because of these

408
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,970
Try doing two

409
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,140
Yeah press it while holding it

410
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,470
-Like this?
-Yeah

411
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,040
-Both sides?
-Yeah

412
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,440
That hurts
I am sorry

413
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,610
-Eh? what? Blue eyes?
-Blue eyes?

414
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,580
Yeah, since I am a Hafu

415
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,380

416
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,620
Werent there any bluer
contacts?

417
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,960
-Eh? This is supposed to be funny?
-Who would laugh at this

418
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,600
Because you look like
a hafu?

419
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,000
-So you put the contacts?
-Whats your mix?

420
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,240
-England and Canada
-Didnt you say that earlier?

00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,210

422
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,280
Oh you are going back?

423
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,610
-That was it?
-What do you do?

424
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,750
My profession?

425
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,120
Um..

426
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,060
I live in Tokyo

427
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,120
and have a gift-shop

428
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,260

00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,040

432
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,510
-Thats all you sell?
-We sell Electric Chick, Chick Manjuu

433
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:02,250

00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,280
-How do you make that?
-Using chicks

435
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,420
-You use meat of the chicks?

436
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,990
I have to be leaving soon

437
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,690
What do you need to do?

438
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,160
Take the Bullet Train

439
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,330
The train

440
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,230
-Ill be leaving then
-Alrigh then

441
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,530
-Thank you
-Take care

442
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:27,270
-Hes got a strong heart
-The eyes were too dark

443
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,180
-Should we play cards?
-Yeah lets do it

444
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,650
Lets play cards

445
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:38,280
But what are we playing?

446
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,950
-How about Poker?
-With so many people?

447
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:48,360
-Then should we play Daifugo?
-Yeah thats fine

448
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,260
-You know how to play Daifugo, right?
-Yeah

449
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,500
It slides so easily

450
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,700
-Hes like a dealer
-Jimmy-san do you know Daifugo?

451
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,570
-Yeah I am familiar with that

452
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,980
Joker is the strongest and 3 is the weakest card
and if a pair comes out

453
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,810
You have to beat it with a higher pair

454
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:11,750
The objective is to get rid
of your cards?

455
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:15,390
-Yeah
-You gotta get rid of your cards

456
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,990
Eh?

457
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,530
-The 3 of-
-Which ones did you just put?

458
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:26,230
-Eh I got good cards

459
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,170
What just happened?

460
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:42,450
-Eh what?
-Why were you laughing?

461
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,620
-Was it something I said?

462
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,920
No, Junior-san wrote something on
these cups

463
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,990
Ichiro

464
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:58,160
-You really like that bit dont you?
-Wait what was it?

465
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,800
I couldnt tell what made you laugh

466
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,830
That.....Ichiro

467
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,540
Whats funny about that?!

468
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:11,680
From that earlier Ichiro bit, it was..

469
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,180
I thought oh not that again

470
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,880
Yellow!

471
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,020
Wait, I mean its supposed to
be orange

472
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,990
But I am still..

473
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,460
-You wanna check?
-But it really was funny

474
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,990
Alright, lets have a look then

475
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,730
-It really was funny
- If it turns out to be

476
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,440
the source of laughter

477
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:43,870
I mean names can be
really funny too

478
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,540
What is causing you to laugh?

479
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:52,180
Surely, there must be a reason

480
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:58,390
-Eh I got some good cards

481
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,660
Hes not even trying to hold it in

482
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,300
He was full on laughing

483
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,140
but there was a reason for laughing

484
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,710
Resisting laughing actually
becomes very

485
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:24,350
funny too, everyone

486
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,650
Who put it here right?

487
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,750
Kobayashi

488
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,290
He did?

489
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:37,430
But this sucks
I havent even done anything so far

490
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:40,830
This is no good

491
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:46,370
-You had a bad start this time, Jimmy.
-Seriously, dont tell me you set me up

492
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,210
Seriously, I didnt

493
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:07,420
-You forgot to take that one
-Yeah , I know

494
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,390
-Jimmy is in trouble
-Theres one there, look

495
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,360
-Uh oh, Jimmys gonna..

496
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,400
-Which is the stronger card? I have no idea
-What is this?

497
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:20,940
Jimmy-san can you look at the
egg ?

498
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,070
-Just once
-Alright I will

499
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,050
-Who put it there?
-Kobayashi did

500
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,410
What about Ichiro?

501
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,450
That..

502
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:37,150
I already looked at it once

503
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,690
I looked at it already

504
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,590
-Just one more time
-I looked at it already

505
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:44,590
-Just ONE more time?
-I already did

506
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,130
-Please just once more?
-I already did

507
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,430
Do it once more please

508
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:51,600
Ok, then just

509
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,570
-Just once more right?
-Isnt it just a normal egg?

510
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,470
-Its just a normal egg right?
-I know..

511
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,950
Wait a minute, wait wait

512
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,490
Hold on, I was just starting to get used to it

513
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:20,300
-You cant be serious
-Why did you even laugh?

514
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,630
You were laughing so easily

515
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:30,110
-You kept talking about the egg
-Whats funny about that? Its just an egg

516
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:35,510
-Theres nothing funny about this
-Its just an egg nothing more

517
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:39,950
The scale usually is lower where the weight is
I thought when is it gonna go down

518
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,180
Its not a scale

519
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:45,920
-This is just a candle holder
-Oh really? thats what it is?

520
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,290
Was that really it?

521
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:50,530
-You thought it was a scale?
-Yeah I thought it was strange that its not tilting

522
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:54,130
-I thought its so weird
-Why would the egg stay like that on a scale?

523
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,300
I thought it was just a really light egg

524
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,940
-Thats what made you laugh?
-Ah this cant be

525
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,920
Wait , wait  I didnt even...

526
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,820
You really laughed a lot

527
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,330
At the end, he laughed so easily

528
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:27,200
-Lets see it
-He couldnt stop laughing

529
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,770
-One more time
-I already did

530
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,240
-Just once more?

531
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,170
-Alright just once

532
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,140
I should just look at it right?

533
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,510
Isnt it just a normal egg?

534
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,580
-Why did you laugh?
-What was even funny?

535
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,160
-Why couldnt you hold it in?
-Its ok, we still have Zombie Time

536
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,330
-Yeah thats still
-During Zombie Time you can make them laugh

537
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,600
-Zombie is allowed to laugh too
-This Zombie is gonna be a tough one

538
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,500
Its gonna be a very tough Zombie

539
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,000
-You guys better prepare yourselves for the Zombie
-I didnt even get to do much

540
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,580
-Everyone crushed him together but
the crushed one will be back

541
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,310
What do you mean
the crushed one

542
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:19,020
You brought all that

543
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,050
Alright then
He will back as a Zombie

544
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,690
-Because of a white egg
-That was quick

545
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:30,930
I didnt get to do ANYTHING

546
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,860
Junior-san..

547
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:41,100
is really talented
Everyone was on the offensive and I got caught in that

548
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:46,080
and during that time
I couldnt endure it

549
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,250
and ended up losing

550
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:54,750
I am disappointed in myself
because I coudnt persevere

551
00:37:54,750 --> 00:38:00,020
Its a bit..
