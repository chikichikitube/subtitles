1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,040
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,950
Let's play nostalgic arcade games!

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,160
So, Matsumoto

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,960
Cocorico

5
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,960
Downtown

6
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,960
Endo Shozo

7
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,960
Hamada Masatoshi

8
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,960
Matsumoto Hitoshi

9
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,960
Tanaka Naoki

10
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,960
Tsukitei Hosei

11
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,810
Yes

12
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,960
We played with Famicom games before, remember?

13
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,960
That's right

14
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,790
But I must say, our target audience is becoming narrower and narrower

15
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,720
We're talking about really old games after all

16
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,720
It's really narrow by now

17
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,180
I mean, even Cocorico probably weren't born yet

18
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,900
Yeah, kind of

19
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,830
We have lots of them, let's go check 'em out

20
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,150
You used to play those, right Yama-chan?

21
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,150
I did, yeah

22
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,440
They're so different nowadays

23
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,770
Oh? We're starting from this?

24
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,770
That's so accurate

25
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,150
So nostalgic

26
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,550
It was really like this back then

27
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,710
That's amazing, check this out

28
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,120
Man, that's so good

29
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,830
This really brings me back

30
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,830
Really well done

31
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,370
So nostalgic!

32
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,940
I can't believe Gaki no Tsukai spent so much money on this

33
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,940
This is incredible

34
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,160
They had all these games?!

35
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,160
They changed their minds

36
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,960
You can tell

37
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,350
Let's take a look, shall we?

38
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,080
This one

39
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,120
Mini Drive (1959) - Operate the handle to reach the goal in a set amount of time

40
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,120
This one used to be in that department store when we were debuting

41
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,120
Yeah, on its second floor

42
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,460
This one was there

43
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,460
It's the same

44
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,420
Play it, please

45
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,890
We need cash for this

46
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,920
I don't understand the objective of this game

47
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,920
This game's...?

48
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,330
I mean, I get the whole thing, but I still don't know

49
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,000
What determines your success or failure

50
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,730
It's the score, it gets higher

51
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,920
Does it give you a prize or anything?

52
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,920
This plate here...

53
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,520
I just thought about it

54
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,900
But could it be that you have to go past these plates?

55
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,200
Probably

56
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,850
We didn't know that as kids

57
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,770
How could we?

58
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,890
Go for it, Hamada

59
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,500
How much is it?

60
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,500
100 yen

61
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,730
Kinda costly

62
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,440
I thought it was like 10 yen

63
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,150
It started so suddenly!

64
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,150
Woah!

65
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,280
So far so good

66
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,280
You gotta be kidding me!

67
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,360
What the hell is this?

68
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,460
Kind of half-assed, isn't it?

69
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,650
But he's going for it

70
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,320
He reached 100

71
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,840
Nice, nice

72
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,670
You're right, it goes "ding ding" as I step on plates

73
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,680
This isn't fun at all, someone take my place please

74
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,680
Hang on

75
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,590
He's really going for it

76
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,590
This is exhausting

77
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,900
No it's not

78
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,730
Nice

79
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,750
Almost there, 100 points left

80
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,450
You were so close to Sapporo...

81
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,450
Dude, what the--?

82
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,280
Isn't it strange it starts as soon as you put the 100 yen in?

83
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,800
Can't deny it was too sudden

84
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,030
So sudden and without sounds...

85
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,030
It's always like this

86
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:42,870
(song titles, in-episode description boxes etc.)

Rules:  they will compete in several nostalgic game-center games. The winner can request a nostalgic song to play.

94
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,110
Today, they're going to compete in several nostalgic arcade games

95
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:53,850
The winner of each round can request a nostalgic song to be played!

96
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,340
That

97
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,430
I used to play this, I wanna try it

98
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,430
Man, so nostalgic!!

99
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:08,460
Shinkansen Game II (1976) - Launch the inserted 10 yen inside the machine like a
pachinko slot: if you manage to get it inside the goal, you win. You have 3 chances.

100
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,090
Their first game is going to be "Shinkansen Game"

101
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,610
Flick the 10 yen inside the board and aim for the goal

102
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,470
If you enter the "goal" area, you win!

103
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,390
Tanaka will be our first challenger

104
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,180
This was really something

105
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,180
You make this start, right?

106
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,720
So cool you use your own 10 yen for this

107
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,880
If it falls here, I'm out

108
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,800
Come on man, don't take that much time

109
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,290
That's it

110
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,600
You gotta find the right timing

111
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,100
Ok, he made it

112
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,930
This part...!

113
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,890
You have to move on

114
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:30,880
I think I can do this

115
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,520
But if you charge it too much you'll hit that hole

116
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,120
Incredible

117
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,120
It went down Okayama!

118
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,280
This is the worst part

119
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,040
You just have to aim for that goal

120
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,040
You're so close

121
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,040
There's a "goal" between two "fails"

122
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,640
This is really...

123
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,590
It's really tricky

124
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,320
Amazing!

125
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,320
It went in

126
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,730
Something came out

127
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,730
The hell is this guy?!

128
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,260
He got it on his first round

129
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,300
Are you... some kind of God?

130
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,300
I never thought I could do it

131
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,640
Tanaka succeeded in one round

132
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,960
Next up is Matsumoto's turn

133
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,700
[cut] Yeah, it can happen

134
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,060
Gentle touches

135
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,820
Man, if you used 30 yen for this game as a kid, your parents would lethal inject you

136
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,230
At this point I--

137
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,390
I see, if it falls here, it goes there

138
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,070
I see, that's how he's doing it

139
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,680
Maybe you have to do it a little harder here

140
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,760
I expected this

141
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,760
You went too soft

142
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,220
Let me try again

143
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,880
You can try three times

144
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,180
It went through!

145
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,180
Can this happen?!

146
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,000
I see...

147
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,880
Nice one

148
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,780
I'm pressing harder here

149
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,480
Here we are

150
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,780
Here goes nothing

151
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,690
The hell, man

152
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,770
It barely moved

153
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,240
It jiggled

154
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,240
Just give me one sec

155
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,880
Alright!!

156
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,010
You can actually do this

157
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,010
Yeah, it is possible

158
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,200
They both completed it

159
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,960
Next up is Hamada

160
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,250
What the fuck! Are you kidding me?!

161
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,590
Hamada failed miserably

162
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,410
Now it's Endo's turn

163
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,210
What the...? How can I do this?

164
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,410
Endo quickly lost too

165
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,920
Last one is Hosei, who claims to be good at games

166
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,640
You know, it's 'cause I'm used to this

167
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
And we're done

168
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,770
Here's the memories song requested by our winner Tanaka

169
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,880
I wonder if you remember this

170
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,840
You know this?

171
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,840
Is it from when we were kids?

172
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,920
It is

173
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,920
This song is so good

174
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,190
Masato Shimon, right?

175
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,190
That's right!

176
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,560
Raideen, right?

177
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,560
Ah, Raideen...

178
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,670
I like this song

179
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,280
♪ The shining skies

180
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,010
♪ The sparkling oceans

181
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,990
You were told you looked like Raideen?

182
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,660
♪ There is no way

183
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,420
They used to call me Raideen

184
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,460
Because of your chin?

185
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,280
♪ I would let them fall into the hands of demons!

186
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,460
Yeah, it kind of sticks out

187
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,120
Was Raideen the one with the long thing here?

188
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,990

256
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,160
That surprised me

This...

258
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,560
He's totally the uncoolest one

I can't believe there's one of those guys here

265
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,100
They really didn't let me play much with these things

266
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,500
Let you play? What do you mean---

267
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,500
Let you play?

268
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,870
I remember there was this public bath house in my home town

269
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,130
It had one of those, but only older kids played it

270
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,650
They played in rounds?

271
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,650

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,860
He thought there were buttons here...

274
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,950
And he tried to press them like this

275
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,000
Tanaka is our third challenger

276
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,330
Tanaka looks like someone who knows how to do it

277
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,090
He sucks

278
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,400
Tanaka couldn't do it at all, he scored the lowest: 1250 points

279
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,210
No need to wait for his third ball, he's already out

280
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,120
Next up is Hosei, who says he has played a lot of pinball

281
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,320
Gotta watch out

282
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,320
Oh, nice

285
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,330

Hosei gets the highest score by far: 41460 points

289
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,840
Matsumoto has great confidence on his pinball skills: he'll challenge Hosei's score

290
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,520
You can tell he's used to that movement

291
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,000
He's a strong enemy

292
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,000
You can feel his boss aura

293
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,170
I didn't know Matsumoto was good at this

294
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,210
Look how nice his left-right control is

295
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,360
He's sort of panicking

296
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,470
He's a strong enemy now, that's his responsibility

297
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,820
That's why it's-- woah!

298
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,700
Man, what a stupid way to lose

299
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,280

No fucking way!!

302
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,840

303
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,840

He's doing it like this

382
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,250
