1
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,170
THIS PROGRAM WAS PRODUCED
UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF MEDICAL EXPERTS,

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,870
TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HEALTH
AND SAFETY OF THE STAFF AND CONTESTANTS.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,670
Gather round,

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,100
elite warriors!

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,500
THE YEAR 1986

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,570
Charge!

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,170
In 1986, a colossal battle broke loose.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,270
THE IMPENETRABLE CASTLE

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,670
A castle so impenetrable,

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,970
only 8 out of 127 battles
have ever seen its halls.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,570
8 WINS, 118 LOSSES, 1 DRAW
WIN RATE 6%

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,270
That dreadful castle has reemerged
in the Land of the Rising Sun.

13
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,470
JAPAN

14
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,770
RESURRECTION

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,870
THE YEAR 2023

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,000
Charge!

17
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,930
Takeshi's Castle is back.
Fortified with extravagance and fortitude,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,870
packed with new games,
it's the palace of your dreams!

19
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,070
WHO WILL EMERGE
AS THE BOLDEST WARRIOR?

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,700
NO TIME FOR FEAR

21
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,470
I'll bring justice upon you numbskulls!

22
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,570
Have a look and see for yourself.

23
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,070
TAKE NO PRISONERS

24
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,270
Victory is ours!

25
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,570
I'm gutted.

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,270
Tear it down

27
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,000
to take home...

28
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,000
ONE MILLION YEN

29
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,830
I will destroy you!

30
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,400
I made it!

31
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,630
Here we go!

32
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,000
Fall, fall till you can fall no further.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,670
Struggle as you may,
he has you in the palm of his hand.

34
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,370
DANCE...

35
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,830
The man of the hour
that you've all waited for...

36
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:40,070
IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND

37
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,030
ARMY VS TAKESHI

38
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,270
Takeshi's Castle.

39
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,900
TAKESHI'S CASTLE

40
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,870
The army has sent a force
of about 100 strong warriors

41
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,670
to bring down the second fortress
protected by Naomi Watanabe.

42
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,630
Even the toughest athletes
from the Sasuke race were no match.

43
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,700
One by one, they were thwarted in battle.

44
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,730
Furthermore, due to unreasonable rulings
by Kyoko Hamaguchi,

45
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,700
the battlefield plummeted
into complete chaos.

46
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,570
On top of that, General Tani
has been kidnapped,

47
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,900
and Captain Kimura is still
nowhere to be found.

48
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,770
The pressure continues
to bear down on the army.

49
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,130
Fifty-seven warriors remain
after the third stronghold.

50
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,670
The road ahead forks in two
with more battles to follow.

51
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,930
THE SECOND FORTRESS
NAOMI CASTLE

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,430
This looks like a sci-fi movie.

53
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,670
-It's extravagant.
-We don't cut corners at Takeshi's Castle.

54
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,900
-Of course, we have a reputation.
-That's right.

55
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,470
This next game is a fan favorite.

56
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,170
-It's the Strait of Gibraltar.
-The famous game.

57
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,030
-It's very well known?
-Indeed.

58
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,070
Let's get started with
the Strait of Gibraltar.

59
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,930
I finally escaped from that carbon thing.
What do you call those?

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's super resistant, you know?
Anyways, I got away.

61
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,030
-And I'm back on the battlefield.
-Why didn't they reshoot this?

62
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,530
FROM GENERAL TANI
HOW DARE YOU ABANDON YOUR DUTIES. EXPLAIN.

63
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,830
This sketch is terrible.

64
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,200
-You've got to be kidding.
-He's committed to the script.

65
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,300
Is he deranged?

66
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,800
THE STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR

67
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,130
A staple that is as popular as
the Dragon God Pond is finally here.

68
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,830
It's the Strait of Gibraltar.

69
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,370
MAKE IT OVER THE BRIDGE
TO WIN THE GAME

70
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,830
What will be different
in the new and improved version?

71
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,130
That looks cool. I want to play.

72
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,770
That's got to be fun.

73
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,930
What are you saying?
You would fall in a second.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,270
-But I want to try it.
-Me, too.

75
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,630
ARMY CAPTAIN
SUBARU KIMURA

76
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,530
Amazing job in making it this far, army.

77
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,770
Do you still have energy left?

78
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,930
Are you sure?
You, the stout one in the back.

79
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,070
-Are you pumped? Really?
-I am.

80
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,730
-Represent, Post Office Team.
-Uchiyama made it.

81
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,000
Your fighting roar trailed off
at the end there.

82
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,400
Make me believe it.

83
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,330
-Are you pumped?
-Yes, I am!

84
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,600
-There you go. Nice.
-I'm here for all the postal workers.

85
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,970
All right. The next challenge

86
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,630
that you'll be taking on is this,
the Strait of Gibraltar.

87
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,030
This looks fun. I'm so envious.

88
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,200
All right, then.
We'll start the game on my command.

89
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,330
Are you ready?

90
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,800
Charge!

91
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,270
Let's conquer this battle!

92
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,930
This is the Strait of Gibraltar.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,700
And we, Nasunakanishi, will be reporting.

94
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,800
-Also, this is me without glasses.
-No one asked for that.

95
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,670
Protect that ball.

96
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,230
STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR
DIFFICULTY RATING: 98%

97
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,430
The Strait of Gibraltar.

98
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,630
TAKESHI'S ARMY
EIKO KANO, COMIC

99
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,570
Not on my watch!
I'll make sure every last person falls.

100
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,500
-The ball is ready for launch.
-A word, please, Zakoshisyoh.

101
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,200
-You can count on me!
-Shut up!

102
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,300
-That bridge is quite high.
-In a flash.

103
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,730
Why? But why?

104
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,170
Postal workers of Japan, watch this!

105
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,670
-You got this.
-You got this!

106
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,270
FUTTSU POST OFFICE TEAM
SHUNSUKE KANEKO (40)

107
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,470
-They must be excited for this.
-So you have to hold the ball.

108
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,600
CARRY THE VOLLEYBALL
TO THE OTHER SIDE TO WIN

109
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,030
-He's bouncing on the bridge.
-So that's how they do it.

110
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,130
-That's a lot. They didn't do this before.
-This is new.

111
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,000
It's hard to resist that-- Wait a second!

112
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,770
Well done, good job.

113
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,700
-I feel bad. He didn't even get to try.
-It's too difficult.

114
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,800
Takeshi's army interferes
by bouncing the bridge.

115
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,700
The army will need a considerable amount
of an ability to balance.

116
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,000
-That was awful.
-Not fair.

117
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,270
This is the worst game.

118
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,530
When will I bring them down?
The moment is now.

119
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,600
-What was that?
-The gull.

120
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,130
FUTTSU POST OFFICE TEAM
KATSUHIRO WATANABE (42)

121
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,830
-I'll try my best.
-Doesn't he seem promising?

122
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,830
-Remember to jump carefully.
-Uchiyama is expressionless.

123
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,530
He must be nervous.

124
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,630
Oh no, resist the fall!

125
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,530
-It's too hard. Besides, the water--
-Makes it slippery.

126
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,700
-Why did he rush?
-I think he wanted to get to that rock.

127
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,270
-Because they interfere.
-I see.

128
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,170
Next up is Takao Uchiyama,
the postal worker who ended up

129
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,830
swallowing a lot of water in Block Block.

130
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,470
Why did we even bring you!

131
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,930
FUTTSU POST OFFICE TEAM
TAKAO UCHIYAMA (42)

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,230
-Uchiyama, you got this.
-He's up. Let's go.

133
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,530
You can do it, Uchiyama.

134
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,000
Uchiyama...

135
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,970
-Watch out. Take your time.
-I don't think he'll make it.

136
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,330
Steady, steady. Good job.

137
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,630
Uchiyama...

138
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,930
-Don't swallow any water. It's dangerous.
-I'm sure he will.

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,700
-Uchiyama... It was too late.
-What a frustrating fall.

140
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,200
Uchiyama lost his balance
while being hosed down,

141
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,600
and ends up falling face first
into the pond.

142
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,730
And unfortunately, swallowed
a ton of pond water again.

143
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,470
A lot of water came out of his mouth.

144
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,200
Our next challengers are...

145
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,270
YOYO &amp; SACO

146
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,830
-We've known each other for a long time.
-We're drinking buddies.

147
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,330
-Are you amped for the next round?
-Are you?

148
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,500
I'm willing to break a bone for it.

149
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,030
-Wow. And a little scary.
-Her dedication is intense.

150
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,100
Both from Osaka, YoYo and SaCo have been
drinking buddies for over 15 years.

151
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,500
Today, they're bringing that
Southern charm to Takeshi's Castle.

152
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,200
They're definitely gyarus.

153
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,300
Do you think they were drunk
when they applied?

154
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,470
"We should totes do it."

155
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,070
Keep your balance!

156
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,170
-They're going easy on shaking the bridge.
-That's nice.

157
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,930
TAKESHI'S ARMY INTERFERES
WITH BALLS AND WATER ATTACKS

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,400
-Use the momentum.
-She's doing well.

159
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,670
And here we have the golden ball.

160
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,730
If you make it with this ball
that gets thrown in randomly,

161
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,600
you'll go home with a grand.

162
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,870
-Is there only one of those?
-Oh no.

163
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,630
-She fell.
-They must've got to her.

164
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,930
I think I was able to display
my Osakan grit.

165
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,800
-You got this. Go, buddy act.
-Go.

166
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,330
-Stop it!
-She says exactly what she feels.

167
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,270
Make it past if you can!

168
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,800
The water pressure is pretty strong.

169
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,970
-I can't!
-Don't let it get to you.

170
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,770
-It must be scary to run.
-It's cold!

171
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,200
She said it's cold, don't you hear her?

172
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,070
Get through if you can.

173
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,630
-She's on the move.
-Good, go!

174
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,500
-Stay calm.
-That water is too much.

175
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,870
-They came for her legs.
-That water is frustrating.

176
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,300
-Take it easy, Kano.
-Right?

177
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,770
-This is too easy.
-Kano!

178
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,930
-Kano!
-This is all your fault!

179
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,400
She says it's all your fault.

180
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,970
-He really didn't like that.
-Kano...

181
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,670
Next up is Sengoku, a former star player

182
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,970
from Japan's national soccer team.

183
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,700
When it comes to defeating warriors,
no one is more efficient than this stud.

184
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,070
EX NADESHIKO LEAGUE PLAYER
RAIMU SENGOKU (25)

185
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,430
1, 10, 100, 1000%,
I'm Raimu Sengoku!

186
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,770
-She acts like a comedian.
-That's her tone?

187
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,330
-She's lots of fun.
-Everyone is excited, too.

188
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,130
-She got it.
-Okay, nice.

189
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,930
She's got strong legs.

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,400
-And amazing balance.
-Impressive.

191
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,570
You're so cool!

192
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,400
-I'm cool? Yeah, I know.
-She's dropped her center of balance.

193
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,200
Oh no, oh dear.

194
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,630
That's an intense attack.

195
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,830
-But she's resisting.
-Impressive.

196
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,130
It kind of looks like performance art.

197
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,700
-She's taking it.
-And screaming the whole way.

198
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,700
Oh no, they're aiming at her crotch.

199
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,030
It's directly towards her crotch.

200
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,900
-But she's doing great. She's resisting.
-Incredible!

201
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,600
They're trying to trap her.

202
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,130
She head butted the ball.

203
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,300
-Wow.
-Interesting.

204
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,330
-Keep your balance.
-She's invincible.

205
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,800
Oh no! She's holding on.

206
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,000
She's got great balance
and head butts like it's nothing.

207
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,230
Watch out, watch out!

208
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,770
-So close.
-What a great job.

209
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,470
-Push through!
-That was fantastic.

210
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,970
She lost balance leaning forward.

211
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,030
Hey, hey, hey...

212
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,900
I know we're enemies,
but I salute your performance.

213
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,830
Do you?

214
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,270
-She didn't budge.
-You hung in there.

215
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,900
-I did.
-Where did they get you, again?

216
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,770
Don't point. Stop that.

217
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,770
Sengoku faced the attacks
from Takeshi's army head on.

218
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,730
Because of her magnificent sportsmanship
and head-butting skills,

219
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,030
she was given the Fighting Spirit Award.

220
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,170
She deserves it.

221
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,300
Next up is a beloved idol
of the melon industry,

222
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,630
Melon Yamaguchi.

223
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,430
-I'm the best musk melon.
-You got this, Melon. Make us proud.

224
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,900
-I can't believe Melon Yamaguchi is here.
-Nice.

225
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,600
IDOL OF THE MELON INDUSTRY
MELON YAMAGUCHI, RIPE AGE

226
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,070
Shouldn't the idol of the melon industry
be a melon?

227
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,430
You're doing great.

228
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,500
-She got far pretty easily.
-She's good.

229
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,000
-She's fast.
-It looks easy for her.

230
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,870
That's right, get to the other side.

231
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,070
Whoa, she might make it.

232
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,500
-Wow.
-It's really wobbly.

233
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,000
-Oh dear.
-It's bouncing too much.

234
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,430
-This is tough.
-It's the cash prize ball.

235
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,670
Go for the cash prize.

236
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,670
-Maybe that's too much to ask.
-Too hard.

237
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,900
The golden ball is coming.

238
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,800
Get the golden ball.

239
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,200
-Whoa.
-Isn't her core strength amazing?

240
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,070
-It's great that she made it this far.
-Wow.

241
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,000
Keep going. Go!

242
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,670
-Wow, look at that.
-It's a face off.

243
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,070
What a sight.

244
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,800
-That was so close.
-But what a great job.

245
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,230
-She got so close.
-Well done.

246
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,800
Melon Yamaguchi is impressive.

247
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,470
-That was a close match.
-Right.

248
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,600
-How frustrating.
-Tenacity wins.

249
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,730
Well done, Zakoshisyoh.

250
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,670
Melon bravely blazed forward

251
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,470
and was one step away
from reaching the goal.

252
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:07,270
In the end, Zakoshisyoh merciless
interference plunged her into defeat.

253
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:14,370
The next challengers gear up after Melon
set the momentum for a lucky streak.

254
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,070
It's that guy. What was his name?

255
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,000
Jordan made a near win

256
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,430
with impressive athleticism
in Block Block.

257
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,470
Let's hope his surf boarding skills
give him the balance he needs to win.

258
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,470
I WILL CONQUER THIS NEXT ROUND!

JORDAN ORIEN (28)

260
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,670
Wow.

261
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,930
Everyone, get him!

262
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,630
This guy is resilient.

263
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,630
The attacks are merciless.

264
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,070
-It shows that he surfs.
-He can handle being sprayed.

265
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,230
This is a great advantage.

266
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,630
-You got this.
-It's too easy for him.

267
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,930
-The bouncing doesn't affect him.
-He's got this.

268
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,070
No problem.

269
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,570
-Keep going!
-Yeah, his upper body stays stable.

270
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,970
-Okay!
-I think he'll do it.

271
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,370
He might win.

272
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,800
Will he get the cash prize ball?

273
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,970
-He's not wobbly at all.
-Amazing.

274
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,770
Look how his head stays level.

275
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,800
You can do it!

276
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,130
-Wow!
-Amazing.

277
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,700
-What happens from here? Okay.
-Takeshi's guards won't fight back.

278
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,970
Wait a minute!

279
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,270
He did it!

280
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,300
-They're friends now.
-That was easy--

281
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,700
-Wow, look at that.
-Fantastic!

282
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,670
-Crap!
-Hurray!

283
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,900
-We did it!
-Wow.

284
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,470
Jordan made his way slowly
while keeping astonishingly good balance.

285
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:49,000
He finished with a friendly fall
onto Zakoshisyoh.

286
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,470
He is the celebratory first winner
of the Strait of Gibraltar.

287
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,200

-So energetic.

YAY!

291
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,930
That meant, "Yay"?

292
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,030

304
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,830
Then finally, these guys
were up for battle.

305
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,030
-Here comes Team Sasuke.
-These guys are tough.

306
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,930
The team that dominated Block Block
with superb athleticism,

307
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,300
the active competitors of Sasuke.

308
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,530
-They look like mercenaries for hire.
-True.

309
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,370
The first warrior to face
the Strait of Gibraltar is...

310
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,330
KITAGAWA ELECTRICS MANAGER
MASASHI HIOKI (41)

311
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,930
-Isn't this what we've been training for?
-Yeah!

312
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,700
-It's an easy task for us, right?
-Yes!

313
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,930
Hioki was the first to conquer Block Block
and began a winning streak for his team.

314
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,930
Can he win in this round
and spark a lucky streak again?

315
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,470
Good luck!

316
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,630
Please beware, you won't get past us.

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,400

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,070
You got this!

320
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,530
-Come and get it.
-You're doing good.

321
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,470
He's moving at a good pace.

322
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,230
He even looks cool when falling.

323
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,630
-What? Wasn't that too soon?
-Yeah.

324
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,770
Hioki could not resist the hosing attacks
from Takeshi's army,

325
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,170
and sadly fails this challenge.

326
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,770
Not only did he not change the tide
for the team,

327
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,870
he didn't even make it halfway.

328
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,630
How could anyone complete that?

329
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,400
That ended too soon.

330
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,670

332

With their first teammate failing
to create good momentum,

333
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,730
the Team Sasuke members
can't seem to find their flow.

334
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,470
Compared to their success in Block Block,
their track record is night and day.

335
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,430

TOMOHIRO KAWAGUCHI (40)

339
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,230
Shockingly, eight out of nine
Sasuke members failed.

340
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,570
-I feel great.
-I bet.

341
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,030
Morimoto, don't let us down.

342
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,030
Can the last warrior stop
this streak of bad luck?

343
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,170
It's Sasuke Jr.'s turn.

344
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,470
Yusuke Morimoto, two-time champion
of the Sasuke race.

345
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,070
-Come on, Sasuke Jr.
-Following his success in Block Block,

346
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,030
can he finish Takeshi's Castle
with gold stars?

347
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,870
-He did so well back then.
-I did it!

348
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,600
Bring home a win for us!

349
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,430
-Here I go!
-Go get em'.

350
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,570
-Let's go!
-You got this!

351
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,100
I, Shinya Sugiyama,
will be reporting in this round.

352
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,470
Yusuke Morimoto will now face
the Strait of Gibraltar,

353
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,800
with the pride of Sasuke and the hopes
of his team riding on his shoulders.

354
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,430
TWO-TIME SASUKE CHAMPION
YUSUKE MORIMOTO (30)

355
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,970
-I'll win no matter what.
-What a peppy personality.

356
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,030
-We're counting on you.
-Just try your best.

357
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,070
His teammates are trusting Yusuke
with their hopes and dreams.

358
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,870
He takes his first steps.
The bridge is a mere 60cm wide.

359
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,300
He receives the ball from Captain Kimura
and is off to a good start.

360
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,030
With his left leg forward, he shields
himself from streams of water,

361
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,430
-using his back.
-His legs are stable. He's tough.

362
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,700
-Volleyballs fly at his legs.
-He's taking hits.

363
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,400
You're right.
They almost got him in the head.

364
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,600
He seems unfazed,
but Zakoshisyoh is shaking the bridge.

365
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,770
He jumps to cause even more waves.

366
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,300
This is the most the bridge
has bounced all day.

367
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,700
Can Morimoto get over the stone?
Yes, he can.

368
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,370
But the shaking does not stop,
but Morimoto stays calm.

369
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,070
THE GOLDEN BALL IS SHOT AT RANDOM,
CATCH IT TO WIN A GRAND!

370
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,270
-I want him to win. Please win.
-And he catches the golden ball.

371
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,970
The ball and water attacks intensify.

372
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,500
The bridge is becoming wobblier
by the second.

373
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,030
-Wow, really?
-But Sasuke Jr. proceeds nonetheless.

374
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,930
In Sasuke, he's the last to play as well.

375
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,030
The last warrior left.

376
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,630
He charges over that last stone
with gusto.

377
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,700
-Fantastic! He made it!
-He beats the game!

378
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,270
-Go, Sasuke Jr.!
-Yusuke Morimoto,

379
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,870
has defeated the Strait of Gibraltar!

380
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:51,530
-Sasuke Jr. is fantastic.
-He was able to fulfill his team's wishes.

381
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,230
-Captain Kimura is also over the moon.
-Well done!

382
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,770
100,000 YEN CASH PRIZE GRANTED

383
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,330
This is what champions are made of.
He takes the cash prize.

384
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,230
Team Sasuke was on the brink
of an all-out fail.

385
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,970
But as if he were a rugby player,

386
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,330
Sasuke Jr. flew over two stones

387
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,530
and charged to the end
with the ball in hand.

388
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,330
-Our savior, Yusuke Morimoto, has arrived.
-That's beyond amazing.

389
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,470
Including the awardees,

390
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,770
three people completed
the Strait of Gibraltar.

391
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:26,370
Now, onto the next stronghold,
fearless army.

392
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:30,070
-Sasuke Jr. is out of this world.
-He's truly fantastic. So good.

393
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,430
He's so cool. He took home
the cash prize, too.

394
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,430
It was truly a perfect win.

395
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,730
Remember,
"1, 10, 100, 1000%, I'm Sengoku!"

396
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,170
-I never knew that's what she was like.
-Me either.

397
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,300
-She was funny.
-Well, I hear that,

398
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,000
-soccer tends to attract weird characters.
-Really?

399
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,070
-Oh, her talent agency is Shochiku Geino.
-Is it?

400
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,070
Shochiku is known for hiring characters.

401
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,000
-A wide variety of them.
-That's true.

402
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,530
Let's call our count.
Hey, Count.

403
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,500
Well, that was fun.

404
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,100
But you know,

405
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,770
Sengoku and also Melon Yamaguchi both,

406
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,930
-belong to Shochiku Geino.
-It that right?

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,570
They might put on a good show
if we put them in the Slip-and-Slide Quiz.

408
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,300
-In the consolation games. Okay.
-They might do better in that arena.

409
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,930
But you know what? What I thought was
really interesting is--

410
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,800
Thanks so much. Goodbye now.

411
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,100
-He's still speaking.
-That was just aimless mumbling.

412
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,570
I couldn't understand
where he was going with that.

413
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,930
The next game is
similar to a chicken game,

414
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,470
but you have to stop within a certain
distance of the finish line.

415
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,370
We call it
Bridge Over the Battlefield

416
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,670
This game relies
more on luck than techniques.

417
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,700
Let's see what innovations have been
made to the game.

418
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,930
First, let's have a look at the trial run.

419
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,730
TEST PLAYER
EIKO KANO, COMIC

420
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,630
-Okay.
-Hey, Kano is back.

421
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,970
Count on me.

422
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,530
This handsome guy
will get the job done in a jiff.

423
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,600
He's pumped.

424
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,200
STOP WHERE THE ARROWS ARE ON THE WALL
AND YOUR BOARD MATCH EXACTLY

425
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,200
You have to stop exactly on the dot.

426
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,770
You see there's a white arrow
on the board he's riding?

427
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,500
-That has to line up with the other one.
-This is a fail.

428
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,200
-The rules are that strict?
-And, you fall if you fail.

429
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,730
-Stopping over those rollers is tough.
-I see.

430
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,000
In the new and improved
Bridge Over the Battlefield,

431
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,500
the two arrows have to match up exactly
to win.

432
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,230
Also, you now fall from a higher height.
It's designed to be near impossible.

433
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,070
-I don't think anyone will make it.
-It's hard.

434
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,530
Well, all I can say is...

435
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,330
I haven't fallen for work like this
in a while and I'm a bit emotional.

436
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,030
This brings back memories.

437
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,730
-Comrades, thanks for gathering.
-What a great voice.

438
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,770
Are you ready to give it your all today?

439
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,670
Very good. Little girl in the front,

440
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,830
-are you feeling pumped?
-Yes.

441
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,430
Hold on, are you sure?

442
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,430
Prove to me that you're in it to win.

443
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,700
Okay, well done!
I want as much energy from everyone.

444
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,930
The next challenge you will take on
is Bridge Over the Battlefield.

445
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,370
-What's that?
-In this game, courage is a necessity.

446
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,400
-They have to face that obstacle?
-Gather all the bravery you have in you.

447
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,000
I believe in every single one of you.
Let's get started.

448
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,700
Charge!

449
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,630
TAKESHI'S ARMY
HOLLYWOOD ZAKOSHISYOH, COMIC

450
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,070
-It's me, Zako, again.
-He's back.

451
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,670
TAKESHI'S ARMY, PRO WRESTLERS
TOMOAKI HONMA &amp; TOGI MAKABE

452
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,770
-Oh, wow.
-If you think you can stop yourself,

453
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,170
I'll throw you right off the ledge.

454
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,600
Just like this.

455
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,630
Nice. They just showed
what they're gonna do.

456
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:05,070
BRIDGE OVER THE BATTLEFIELD
DIFFICULTY RATING: 142%

457
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,130
Charge!

458
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,800
I'll stop right on the dot.
Hammer-cammer!

459
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,600
He's super excited.

460
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,600
KAWASAKI CITY ELEMENTARY TEACHER
HIROSHI ONODA (35)

461
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,930
Nice start. Let's go team.

462
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,270
-That's a nice try.
-He hit his leg.

463
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,970
-Stop there.
-He's going too fast.

464
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,330
-The teacher fell.
-Hammer-cammer!

465
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,500
"Hammer-cammer."

466
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,500
-We got it.
-That's his favorite phrase.

467
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,200
ADVENTURE RACER
JUNKO TOKUMOTO (34)

468
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,170
-I'm having a beer after this.
-All right!

469
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,830
Great start.

470
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,370
-Here comes Zakoshisyoh.
-It got her leg.

471
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,530
-You're so close to a tasty beer.
-She might make it.

472
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,500
-Aw, no...
-Stopped too soon.

473
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,770
-That's terrifying.
-His voice is scary.

474
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,970
I guess that beer won't
taste so good after all.

475
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,370
How terrifying.

476
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,970
-No beer for you.
-You can barely understand from this far.

477
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:03,100
The length or the distance of the fall
aren't the only new features.

478
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:07,530
There's also Zakoshisyoh
who will interrupt your flow with a push.

479
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,330
Next warrior is the one who came up with
a flirty plan that worked like a charm,

480
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,500
Hamaguchi's favorite, Tsujimura CEO.

481
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:18,470
You put up a nice fight
during the daruma game.

482
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,700
Thanks, it was
because I had a good tactic.

483
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,170
As an entrepreneur,
my strategies are on another level.

484
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,030
-That's how I won. The only reason.
-That's the reason?

485
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,230
Charge!

486
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,600
I'm the best!

487
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,800
It's him from earlier.
Now that's too fast.

488
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,900
CONSULTING FIRM CEO
RYOTA TSUJIMURA (41)

489
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,600
That interference was awful.

490
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,130
Zakoshisyoh, that was absolutely unfair.

491
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,000
Zako did him wrong.

492
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,100
He had to aim ahead
but he couldn't even get there.

493
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,630
-There's no way to prevent that.
-That's simply unfair.

494
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,770
What happened back there with the red bar?

495
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,530
I was preparing myself to be pushed...

496
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,100
-Didn't I move backward?
-I've never seen anything like it.

497
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,270
-You were pushed back.
-I thought so.

498
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:14,300
Thanks to that,
I didn't make any distance.

499
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,300
It was a picture perfect back pedal.

IDOL GROUP KITTYCAT MEMBER
HANNA YOSHIDA (14)

501
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,800
Junior high student, Hanna,
takes a shot.

502
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,270
-She's doing good.
-I'll go easy on you.

503
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,670
-He went easy on her.
-That's nice.

504
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,770
-Can she make it?
-She might be too light.

505
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,370
It'd be scary to fall?

506
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,770
Will he go easy on her?

507
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,700
But I have to do it. There you go.

508
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,630
She flipped midair.

509
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,270
-She flipped a few times.
-Have you no mercy!

510
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,130
Damn it!

511
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
-He's terrifying.
-Like a monster.

512
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,370
He looks like a monster.

513
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,430
-A real life monster.
-Charge!

514
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,870
I'll give it my all!

515
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,670
Go, go, go!

All right!

518
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,870
This looks promising.

519
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,830
Nice. Looking good.

520
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,900
-She seriously might make it.
-She's got this.

521
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,700
-No way. Really?
-She didn't make it?

522
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,900
-Here they come already.
-Don't push her.

523
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,530
-Don't push her!
-You don't want to be pushed?

524
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,200
-She says I can't push her.
-That try was a fail?

525
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,870
-How strict.
-I say that was a win.

526
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,370
-She was this close.
-Just this much.

527
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,000
Fujitaka was a few centimeters away
from nailing it.

528
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:32,500
In the end, she fell gracefully
like the nimble cheerleader she is.

529
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,800
What a beautiful dive.

532
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,130

Team Spartan Racers, who were the quickest

535
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,530
to finish The Border Wall,
are up for battle next.

536
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,870
Can these warriors,
who are said to compete

537
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,870
in the toughest races in the world,
beat this game?

538
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,900
Three, two, one, Aroo!

539
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,430
Aroo! Aroo! Aroo!

540
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,830
Aroo! Go!

541
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,670
Can they really do that?

542
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,770
That's not fair!

543
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:30,130
The bar of doom is working overtime again.

544
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:35,000
Shioda was thrown off course
by Zako's fatal push.

Our toughest athletes continue
to give it their best shot,

547
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:48,070
but they have no defenses against this
game and its impossible new rules.

548
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,800
-No!
-Don't push her!

549
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,200
-Don't do it!
-That's right, don't do it!

550
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,130
Good job!

551
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,170
Will there be a warrior
who can make miracles happen?

-And we're down to our last warrior.
-This game is tough.

564
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,830
-Who applied to this competition?
-My husband.

565
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,770
My husband appeared in this show
over 30 years ago,

566
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,970
and he made it to the final stage.

567
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,830
34 years ago,

568
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,330
Date's husband sadly failed
in the go-cart round.

569
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,870
-Today, his kids are here to avenge him.
-Wow, that's great.

570
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,270
We'll get through this, no matter what!

571
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,170
What great kids.
They're in it for their dad.

572

DAI DATE (14)

575
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,570
-You got this!
-They're going easy on him.

576
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,630
-That actually helped.
-It might work in his favor.

577
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,670
Yes, nice! Hang in there.

578
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:30,470
-He put the brakes on.
-A little bit more! A bit more!

579
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,530
What? No.

580
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,930
A little bit more! A bit more!

581
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:42,530
-So close!
-He didn't make it.

582
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,530
-He lost a shoe.
-That was very close.

583
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,970
The younger brother, Dai,
started with a little too much momentum.

584
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,200
But Zako's doom rod
actually helped him out.

585
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,600
He slowed down to a good speed,
but couldn't reach the bullseye.

586
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,430
So close, yet so far.

587
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,930
Hope you're ready.

588
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,970
Better luck next time.

589
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,630
You were so close.

590
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,900
-Was I?
-Yeah.

591
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,330
-You were just a hair away.
-I see...

592
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,530
You slowed down just enough
when the bar hit you.

593
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,230
-I see...
-You make a great sad face.

594
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,530
Oh no...

595
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,900
Jou, the older brother, gives it a shot.
But sadly, also fails.

HERE TO AVENGE HIS FATHER
JOU DATE (18)

597
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:32,270
They were not able to clear
their father's name after 34 years.

598
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:35,830
-This game is so difficult.
-We all failed.

599
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,700
-We all failed.
-Oh no...

600
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,830
-No one won. That's it.
-Really?

601
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,630
-No warriors remain.
-Oh, no!

602
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,730
Really?

603
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,100
-No way.
-No one?

604
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,530
-Princess, we got them, didn't we?
-So, it happens.

605
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,930
We did, indeed.

606
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,730
We did, but...

607
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,430
-I did want to see someone win.
-Me, too.

608
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,630
-It would be a miracle.
-Right on the dot is near impossible.

609
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,630
And Zako could stop your momentum.

610
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,870
We're on the same team,
but I even thought that was too much.

611
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:11,930
By now you know the drill.
Coming up are our three consolation games.

612
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:16,330
This is the final life line for warriors
who didn't make the cut.

613
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,630
I'll return to the battle.

face this challenge at a time,

like warriors to me.

-Please tell us.

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,300
-This feels like a dream.
-Why don't you take a peek, too?

667
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,100
-What is this?
-I have a weird feeling about this.

668
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,600
-Please tell us. More?
-Look more deeply.

669
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,770
-That scared me.
-What is this?

670
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,000
Only at Takeshi's Castle.

671
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,200
-What is the point?
-What is this farce?

672
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,030
-Why did you scare us, Granny?
-I'm shocked.

673
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,830
What are you trying to accomplish?

674
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,700
"What are you trying to accomplish?"

675
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,830
Great question.

676
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,670
-Break free.
-Faraway Wall to Freedom.

677
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,170
-You hit me.
-Sorry.

678
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,130
We will be reporting on the ground.

679
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:45,430
FARAWAY WALL TO FREEDOM
DIFFICULTY RATING: 95%

680
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,100
I'll do everything in my power to win.
Watch me.

681
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,600
-Charge!
-Good luck!

682
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,870
FIND THE RIGHT PANEL TO MAKE IT
THROUGH THE WALLS

683
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,870
-So there's eight of them.
-And they're hard walls, too.

684
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,900
Stay calm.

685
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,300
7/8 WALLS LEFT

686
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,070
THEY CAN MOVE ON
EVEN IF THEY FALL INTO MUD OR POND

687
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,600
-There are a lot of obstacles.
-You fly into mud.

688
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,730
-Have they always been that solid?
-That takes a lot of energy.

689
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,500
-I remember this part.
-What a dirty trick.

690
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,070
-You got this.
-Keep going!

691
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,100
Only three walls out of those
eight panels are tear able.

692
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,400
-And they all have mud behind them.
-The probability is low.

693
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,430
-This is what life looks like, in a way.
-That's true.

694
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,630
-Good, good. Oh no!
-There's a net.

695
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,870
-That's a thing, too?
-Just when you thought you made it.

696
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,000
-So you have to backtrack.
-They do? Okay.

697
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,400
-You can't pass-- Who's that?
-Don't get caught.

698
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,900
TAKESHI'S ARMY WILL APPEAR RANDOMLY,
GET CAUGHT AND FAIL

699
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:45,400
-A lot of people actually hate Kurochan.
-They're coming. Oh no!

700
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,870
Kurochan will gobble you up.

701
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,070
I've got you.

702
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,400
FAILED

703
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,430
Mud everywhere.

704
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,570
This is so much fun.

705
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,070
Let's meet our next warrior.

706
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,500
Hailing from
the Female College Student Team,

707
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:12,200
Kato, who proved herself in
the battles at Ueda Castle, is back.

708
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,530
Will she make it to the final battle
this time?

709
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,970
I made it this far,
so I believe I can do it.

710
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,700
-Good luck!
-Charge!

711
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,330
Okay, put up a good fight.

712
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,700
Look, she's starting from the far end.

713
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:29,100
-She fell into the mud from the start.
-Look at her go.

714
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:31,900
You're doing well.

715
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,530
-Okay, well done.
-She's all muddy.

716
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,230
-That mud makes it harder to walk, too.
-You got this.

717
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,300
-That must be tiring.
-You got this.

718
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,770
Get to other side, keep going.

719
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,530
This will wear you out.

720
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,570
-She's almost out of energy.
-That seems tough.

721
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,770
-It's the net.
-Everyone gets caught there.

722
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,800
That net...

723
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,000
It's human nature
to want to keep straight.

724
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,800
They tend to avoid the furthest archways.

725
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,430
-Oh no, here they come.
-Oh dear, run, run.

726
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,000
-This is not good.
-No!

727
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,730
-She's getting away.
-Run, run.

728
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,170
Watari is after her.

729
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,770
-Here he comes!
-Yay! She did.

730
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,570
-Good job.
-Keep going! Oh no!

731
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,470
-She isn't moving.
-They keep coming.

732
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,000
-Run away.
-Can he cross the wall?

733
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,800
-Did she make it?
-Kato!

734
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,730
FAILED

735
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,400
-Was it a net?
-Look, her face is blue. Code blue!

736
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,500
Not only do you have to crawl through mud,

737
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,570
but you also have to ditch Takeshi's army.

738
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:38,430
The army struggles against
this horrid game.

739
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,870
It's like watching a nightmare
come to life.

740
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,530
-Kuro got me.
-That's right. Goodbye.

741
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,830
PARKOUR ASSOCIATION LEADER
JUN SATO (30)

742
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,970
Oops, I missed a spot.
Goodbye to this side, too.

743
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,330
PRO WRESTLER
HIROKI SAKAI (47)

744
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,730
Are you okay? I found a victim!

745
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,930
Are you okay? Brace yourself.

746
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,170
Are you okay? You okay?
Let me see your face.

747
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,730
Please open your eyes!

748
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,870
This is exhausting.

749
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,330
Very depleting.

750
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,800
But also so fun though.

751
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,170
FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENT TEAM
EVE HANIUDA (22)

752
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,170
What the heck.

753
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,270
I couldn't do this.

754
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,970
-Oh, it's a lady.
-That pool seems deep.

755
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,430
You're right. It's quite deep.

756
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:32,370
I've got you.
Let's bathe together.

757
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Here, this is how you end.

758
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,370
STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR WINNER
JORDAN ORIEN (28)

759
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:41,630
Jordan, who won in Strait of Gibraltar,
also gives it his best shot. But...

760
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,900
I'm going to get you. Come here.

761
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:47,470
Come on. Come here.

762
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,170
-Come here!
-Jordan, no...

763
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,530
-There, I've got you.
-That's too bad.

764
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,070
-He fell prey to Kurochan.
-Goodbye.

765
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,000
As everyone continues to struggle,
one person steps to the plate.

766
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,530
-If you land like this, you're done for.
-Right.

767
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,200
You'd be stuck like this.

768
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,430
It's Masashi Hioki from Team Sasuke.

769
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,200
-He failed in the Strait of Gibraltar.
-Hioki is back.

770
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:17,200
He couldn't save face with his family
in the consolation games.

771
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,700
But he returned to the battlefield
by receiving the Fighting Spirit Award.

772
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:30,270
-Okay, I see.
-Number 82, Masashi Hioki.

773
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,630
Thank you so much!

774
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:40,070
I'm so relieved... Why am I crying?

775
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:50,070
My family is cheering for me like they do
when I'm at Sasuke.

776
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:53,030
So I want to win and make them happy.

777
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:57,430
What a nice family.

778
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,500
But I won't be swept away
by emotions that easily.

779
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,470
It might be time to throw in the wrench.

780
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,770
Would you believe it?
An additional rule is being introduced.

781
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,830
The mysterious fortune teller
will drum up some fishy fortune.

782
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,530
Her bogus stories will confuse the army.

783
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,730
Will they be okay?

784
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,630
I'm seeing something. Here it is.

785
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,130
-Your lucky color is white.
-My lucky color?

786
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:31,370
Move towards the color white
with all your might.

787
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,670
Thank you!

788
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,130
-Charge!
-What does it mean?

789
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,530
-Is there a white wall?
-I'll do my best.

790
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,900
-There's a white curtain.
-I'll make my kids proud.

791
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,600
But if you choose white and it's a trap,
that's the worst.

792
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,700
-I would be pissed.
-Go, go. Get away!

793
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,270
-Choose the white one.
-That's not white.

794
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,730
-This isn't good.
-Are there white curtains?

795
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,270
-I got this.
-Oh no.

796
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:57,730
What? This isn't good.

797
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,130
Great. Okay.

798
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,230
6/8 WALLS LEFT

799
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,470
Some walls have white and others don't.

800
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,670
-Good job.
-Why is this pool so deep?

801
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,430
Isn't it too deep?

802
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,930
-That spot is scary. It's too deep.
-It drains your energy.

803
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,070
The pools are different depths.

804
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,200
Our staff is truly deranged.

805
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:22,330
Why is it that deep?

806
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,530
-This one is shallow.
-Super shallow.

807
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:28,070
Nice. No one is chasing after him.

808
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,370
-Here they come.
-The army is coming for him.

809
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,730
-They're on their way?
-Oh, no.

810
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,400
-Here they come.
-This part gets harder.

811
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,270
In a lucky turn of events,
Watari gets stuck in a pool.

812
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,330
Now is your chance.

813
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,330
Run, run, run!

814
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,900
-His legs--
-He seems tired.

815
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:52,730
Keep going. No, that one has a net.

816
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,900
-He's hitting all of them.
-They're all duds?

817
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,100
One wall remains.

818
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,000
Will he make it?
Just one more wall.

819
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,530
I will catch you!

820
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,070
Wait right there!

821
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,470
-He did it!
-He made it!

822
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,730
-Did he win? He made it?
-What's the verdict?

823
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,870
Wow. Awesome!

824
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,900
-Dummy, don't let him go!
-There's mud at the end, too?

825
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,900
-He did it!
-Great job!

826
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,430
-Hurrah!
-He's drenched. I'm kind of emotional.

827
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,270
-This game is tough.
-I'm touched.

828
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:30,070
-He must be exhausted.
-Did I make it?

829
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:33,370
Hioki did it.

830
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,570
-Dad proved himself.
-I did it!

831
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:38,070
-It makes me cry.
-The kids must be happy.

832
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,700
-Kurochan was closing in on him.
-He just barely made it.

833
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:46,600
-This is a miracle.
-That archway that he stumbled into...

834
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,170
-That was so close.
-happened to be the right one.

835
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,830
His endurance from competing in Sasuke
and his family's love,

836
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,070
has carried him to the finish line.

837
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,330
-I did it!
-Oh, they didn't know.

838
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,730
-They didn't see it.
-He's covered in mud.

839
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,370
-I couldn't let my family cry.
-I'm so happy.

840
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,570
-We're so happy.
-What a cool dad.

841
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,470
-I did my best. Let's have a last hurrah.
-Isn't this great?

842
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:17,500
Hurrah!

843
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:20,430
-How beautiful.
-Dad just gained brownie points.

844
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,770
The warrior to follow
Hioki's performance is...

845
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:29,100
Sasuke Jr. has completed
all of the challenges so far.

846
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:34,230
He's taken every measure in order
to achieve an all-out victory.

847
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:38,770
Since there are pools of mud and water,
my goals are to

848
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:42,630
not slow down there and use my energy
efficiently to last the whole race.

849
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,700
Also, I'm aiming to remain calm
when Takeshi's army chases me.

850
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,400
With the final battle on the horizon,

851
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,270
this round is just a stepping stone
for Sasuke Jr.

852
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:54,830
I see it.

853
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,970
-Your lucky number is...
-Oh, the Fortune Granny.

854
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,700
-three.
-Three?

855
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:05,670
-Is that a hint?
-Okay.

856
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,370
With two Sasuke championships
under his belt,

857
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:13,430
the final battle of Takeshi's Castle
awaits ahead of the challenge

858
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,700
that is the Faraway Wall to Freedom.

859
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:19,900
Sasuke competitor, Yusuke Morimoto,
30, will now shoot his shot.

860
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,530
The fortune teller said
my lucky number is three,

861
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,130
so I plan to attack from
the third archway on the left.

862
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,300
-Here I go.
-Will he make it?

863
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,630
He approaches the first archway
with speed.

864
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,900
-How powerful.
-Look at the height on that jump.

865
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:40,100
He landed on his back.
Every limb, covered in mud.

866
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,370
And he bursts through the center
of the panel.

867
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:46,030
-Wow, look at that.
-He doesn't need so much momentum.

868
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:49,900
The third archway from the left.
He passes the third wall.

869
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:52,730
Here we see that Takeshi's army
is after him.

870
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,070
He flies past the fourth wall

871
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,200
and into the fifth,
but it throws him back.

872
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:59,300
And another fake portal.
The next one is a win.

873
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:03,770
He charges at his first pick
and is pushed back.

874
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:07,330
He can't find the correct archway
and is chased down.

875
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,230
Yosuke Morimoto is disqualified.

876
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,500
FAILED

877
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,930
-Thanks for you hard work.
-Our shining star,

878
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,530
Yusuke Morimoto meets a shocking defeat.

879
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,570
His dream of an all-out victory
at Takeshi's Castle ends here.

880
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,900
They got Sasuke Jr.

881
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:24,600
Our last warrior is

882
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:27,970
an ex pro soccer player
and celebrity, Raimu Sengoku.

883
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:31,070
Will the strength that she cultivated
in soccer carry her to victory?

884
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:36,770
I'm sad to say
I haven't won any games so far.

885
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,000
But here I am.

886
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:41,530
If Takeshi's goons pop up in front of me,
I'm screwed.

887
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,670
But when attacked from the sides,
I can get away.

888
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:45,970
I'm a fast runner.

889
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,200
I can see it.

890
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:53,330
-Your lucky color is red.
-Red?

891
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,870
-Okay!
-Go for red.

892
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:56,570
Do you see red anywhere?

893
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:59,830
1, 10, 100, 1000%,
I'm Raimu Sengoku!

894
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,500
I'll believe in fate
and follow the color red.

895
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:05,870
-"1, 10, 100, 1000%, Raimu Sengoku!"
-Believe in red.

896
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:09,330
Wait, what?

897
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,100
Ouch. Really?

898
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:14,470
-Try a different door.
-But red... No way.

899
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:17,030
-What a trap.
-Ow.

900
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,730
Oh no, be careful.

901
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,700
-She said "Aw."
-Are you for real?

902
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,030
So she needs to avoid red.

903
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,100
-There, she got it. She's losing stamina.
-I feel sorry for her.

904
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,930
-You got this, Sengoku!
-You got this!

905
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,530
We're watching you, Sengoku!

906
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:34,570
What a sweet senpai.

907
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,030
-Well done.
-Good job, Sengoku.

908
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,830
-She's exhausted.
-I'm sure.

909
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,900
-The mud really slows you down.
-So true.

910
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,000
-Red!
-She's going for red.

911
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,870
-That wasn't it.
-Hey, it's a trap!

912
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:53,770
This is the worst.

913
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,100
Red is not the answer.

914
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:57,630
-It's true.
-Poor thing.

915
00:47:58,070 --> 00:47:59,930
Crap, the goons will be here soon.

916
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,730
-White.
-You're going to try white?

917
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,330
-What a relief.
-This pool is too deep.

918
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,700
-It's deep enough to drown.
-Show them what you're made of.

919
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:11,270
5/8 WALLS LEFT

920
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:20,730
You wouldn't think you'd need
a life jacket for a game like this.

921
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,670
-But it's that deep.
-It is.

922
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:26,200
-It's annoyingly deep.
-And she's swallowed lots of mud water.

923
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:29,100
Do you hear her hacking?

924
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,930
-Sengoku...
-Come on, you got this.

925
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,000
-She's making leeway.
-The goons will be here soon.

926
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:39,000
-They will.
-But she seems too tired to run.

927
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,200
She looks exhausted.

928
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:45,300
-It's the net.
-Go to the next one. You can see it.

929
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,600
-She must be at her limit.
-But she saw it.

930
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,330
Summon your grit.

931
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,670
Try the one next to it.

932
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,030
Nice!

933
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,670
-You got this.
-They'll be here soon.

934
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,400
Here they come.

935
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:01,600
Just two more walls.

936
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:04,100
-Come on, hurry.
-Hang in there!

937
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,270
-Quick, quickly.
-Oh no.

938
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:07,900
Turn around. Hurry, hurry.

939
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:11,730
-Oh no, not good.
-She didn't check this time.

940
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,370
That's good. Run, run.

941
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,770
Oh no, not that way.

942
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:17,730
-She found it.
-Go, go!

943
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,570
-Oh no...
-He missed. This is your chance.

944
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,870
-Here's your chance.
-You got this!

945
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,930
-She made it!
-She did it!

946
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,070
-That was close.
-She did it.

947
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:34,430
Hurrah!

948
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,400
That's the finish line!

949
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:42,330
She was thwarted by the fortune teller
and tested by deep pools of mud.

950
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,900
But nonetheless, Sengoku never gave up
and pushed through.

951
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,630
She used her remarkable speed
to out run Takeshi's army,

952
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,270
-with an impressive win.
-She's fast.

953
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:55,300
-Did I do it?
-She must be exhausted.

954
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:56,930
TWO WARRIORS REMAIN

955
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,600
-Is she okay?
-Oh, dear.

956
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:03,670
-She might be feeling sick.
-Did she swallow too much water?

957
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:04,900
That might be it.

958
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,100
Two warriors made it past
Faraway Wall to Freedom.

959
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:14,670
And now, the final battle awaits!

960
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,200
That was great. What did you think?

961
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:22,570
This might've been the most demanding
game among them all, endurance wise.

962
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,700
-True.
-I think we were too hard on Sengoku.

963
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:27,700
She got that false hint to follow red.

964
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:30,700
But she is one of only two finalists.

965
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:33,000
-How cool is that.
-I agree.

966
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:37,700
Well Princess, it is finally time
for the last battle.

967
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,370
YABUSAME
COMPETE FOR A CASH PRIZE OF A MILLION YEN

968
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,930
You'll protect the castle
with your very own hands.

969
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,370
-What, little ol' me?
-Of course.

970
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:49,100
The army has fought tooth and nail
to get here.

971
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:52,270
-Let's humble them in a big way.
-I understand.

972
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:54,930
-Let us demolish them.
-Sounds perfect.

973
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,530
Let's check in with the count. Count?

974
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:02,470
I hope you're ready to do your job.
Don't let them get a leg up on you now.

975
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:06,670
-Don't worry, we have the Princess.
-Yes, we're going out with a bang.

976
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,630
Good. Now, the most important thing
to remember is defenslings.

977
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,700
Sorry, did you say "defense?"

978
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,570
-That's what I said. Defense!
-Thank you.

979
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:18,970
-I didn't hear him correctly either.
-You didn't?

980
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:21,500
-Holding down the fort. Got it?
-I do.

981
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:24,930
Yeah, so... Try your best, okay?

982
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,800
I'm having a hard time, too,
but I'm trying my best.

983
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,530
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

984
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,700
-Defense. You got that?
-Defense? Of course, I'll protect us.

985
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,870
1, 10, 100, 1000%,
I'm Raimu Sengoku!

986
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,670
I'll carry your hope into the last round.

987
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,230
Thanks for your support.

988
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:50,900
Hioki, Team Sasuke is counting on you
to conquer Takeshi's Castle.

989
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,530
-Go make history!
-Here I go!

990
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,170
Let's go!

991
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:59,230
You got this. Hurrah!

992
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:03,300
Carrying the fervent support
from fallen comrades on their shoulders,

993
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:07,430
the remaining warriors make their way
to Naomi's Castle.

994
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,900
The Princess will now arrive
onto the battlefield!

995
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:24,770
LADY OF THE SECOND FORTRESS
NAOMI WATANABE

996
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,800
-Here she comes. Princess Naomi.
-Hi.

997
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:31,970
It's finally time for battle.

998
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:35,500
I'm so excited, I can barely wait.
Also, I must say, it's so freaking hot.

999
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:36,970
FILMED IN AUGUST

1000
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:39,300
-There's not much we can do.
-The arena is hot.

1001
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:42,600
Please take a look right ahead of you.

1002
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:46,170
-The warriors are waiting for us.
-There they are.

1003
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:49,500
Look how boastful the Captain seems.

1004
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:52,200
I am captain of the army,
Subaru Kimura!

1005
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,030
-In the flesh.
-He's so cool.

1006
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:58,970
How's it going? By the way, we plan on
crushing you to smithereens.

1007
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:04,570
Well, we brought
the sharpest warriors of the lot.

1008
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:07,100
Your sharpest warriors, huh?

1009
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:10,570
Just you wait, they'll reduce
this loathsome castle to dust!

1010
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,630
That's one rowdy captain.

1011
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,270
-Princess, please say something back.
-Okay.

1012
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:22,600
Listen up, twerps... I will destroy you!

1013
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:25,300
Not if we get to you first!

1014
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:30,070
-We've only heard from the captain so far.
-What do the others think?

1015
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:31,770
What about you, warriors?

1016
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:33,370
Show them what you've got.

1017
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:34,770
I'll destroy you!

1018
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,230
I will destroy you!

1019
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,730
-So loud. She can really project.
-They are pumped.

1020
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,900
All right then, shall we settle this?

1021
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,700
-Yes, let's.
-All right!

1022
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:53,100
The final battle of the night
is called Yabusame.

1023
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:58,570
Both parties will board their carriages,
but only the army's will be mobile.

1024
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:02,600
From there, they will aim at the target
on the other person's carriage.

1025
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,600
The army wins if they can get
a ball into the red basket.

1026
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:12,270
Takeshi's army wins
if their ball hits the blue banner.

1027
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:17,800
But if both succeed, it'll be deemed
a draw and neither wins.

1028
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,130
Let's now bring out
the artillery carriages.

1029
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:32,330
-Here it comes.
-Wow, this is amazing!

1030
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,700
Here it is.

1031
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,600
-How cool is that.
-This is what the castle is about.

1032
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:40,100
-It's arrived. Let's go see it. You first.
-Okay.

1033
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:42,930
The driver's seat is yours,
Princess Naomi.

1034
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,270
I won't let you down.

1035
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,930
You look great in that.

1036
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,770
-This is exhilarating. Oh, yes.
-Isn't it?

1037
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:56,430
Up first is former pro soccer player,
Raimu Sengoku.

1038
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,170
WON 1/3 GAMES,
RECEIVED FS AWARD TWICE

1039
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:00,800
With her athleticism
and winning personality,

1040
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:04,430
victory has been smiling down
on this lucky girl today.

1041
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,330
-Are you nervous?
-Yes.

1042
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:11,170
I might actually throw up.

1043
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:13,700
This is a lot.

1044
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:15,370
ONLY ONE WIN IS NEEDED
TO RECEIVE A MILLION YEN

1045
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:18,370
-Let's win this together. Go get 'em.
-Thank you, Hioki.

1046
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:19,900
-Here I go. Okay!
-You got this!

1047
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:25,570
Can she manage her nerves and succeed
in bringing down Naomi's Castle?

1048
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:29,400
-You'll want to face this way at the end.
-I see. Got it.

1049
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:33,730
The first round is a fierce battle
against Princess Naomi.

1050
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,300
Who will make it out alive?

1051
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:41,870
YABUSAME
DIFFICULTY RATING: 200%

1052
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:45,270
We will now begin
the first round of Yabusame.

1053
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,070
You got this! Fight!

1054
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:04,470
Go, go, go!

1055
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:06,600
Shoot, shoot!

1056
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:08,500
Go, go, go!

1057
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:11,070
Shoot, shoot!

1058
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,330
-Did it make it?
-I did it!

1059
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,730
Did you get her?

1060
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,170
THE ARMY FAILS

1061
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:34,770
THE WINNER
TAKESHI'S ARMY

1062
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:36,430
-Nailed it.
-You got it.

1063
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:40,030
Sengoku got a hit close to the target,

1064
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:44,230
but wasn't able to pierce the bullseye.

1065
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,700
It was a close battle.

1066
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,270
On the other hand, Princess Naomi was

1067
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:52,270
off in the beginning, but she was able
to course direct for a win.

1068
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,930
She shot down the army's target
on her sixth launch.

1069
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:00,770
-You lost. That was intense.
-Yes, I did.

1070
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:03,200
I was thinking that if I win,

1071
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,470
I might get booked
for more gigs in entertainment.

1072
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:09,500
-There was a lot riding on this for you.
-Right.

1073
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:12,730
-I'm frustrated. Right.
-You made it this far, but still.

1074
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,270
-Where's your talent agent?
-He left for another gig.

1075
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,570
-Captain. Captain!
-Yeah?

1076
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,230
So, what are we going to do?

1077
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:26,400
-Did you see what happened?
-I sure did.

1078
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:31,370
I saw it but... I could barely understand
what was happening.

1079
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:35,830
All right, Himura, you're up next.

1080
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,100
-May I? Then, excuse me, Princess.
-Make us proud.

1081
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:41,270
-Be careful out there.
-Yeah, I almost lost last time.

1082
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,900
Besides, your opponent is from Sasuke.

1083
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:46,830
You're right.
It's Sasuke versus Takeshi's Castle.

1084
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,070
-All right, let's go.
-Go get 'em.

1085
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:54,100
I never thought that my teammates
would disappear one by one,

1086
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,330
till I was the only one left.

1087
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,230
I've been able to make it this far
with the support of my family.

1088
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:05,400
All that's left is to focus everything
I've got onto that target.

1089
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,830
-I'm going to seize victory.
-Let's do it!

1090
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,230
WON 2/4 GAMES
RECEIVED FIGHTING SPIRIT AWARD ONCE

1091
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,500
Next up is Kitagawa Electric manager,
Masashi Hioki.

1092
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:16,800
Will he be able to avenge
his Sasuke comrades,

1093
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:20,670
and live up to his family's anticipation?

1094
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:23,730
Please give us a victory chant.

1095
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:27,200
Let's go. All aboard!

1096
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,000
Let's get this show on the road!

1097
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:34,500
The army is in high spirits.

1098
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:37,400
Meanwhile, how is Himura
from Takeshi's army?

1099
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:38,830
You think I'll be okay?

1100
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:41,070
You've got this. Take 'em down.

1101
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:43,870
-Show 'em what you've got.
-You'll do okay.

1102
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:46,370
-I'm feeling anxious.
-Please get it together.

1103
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:47,700
Don't you dare be nervous.

1104
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:51,330
Himura is feeling timid.
This is your chance!

1105
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:53,970
This will be the very last battle.

1106
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:59,870
Let us begin the second round
of Yabusame.

1107
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,600
Go, go, go.

1108
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,270
How's he doing?

1109
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,130
He did it.

1110
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:28,100
-How's he doing? He did it.
-He's close.

1111
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,130
Look, it's torn to shreds.

1112
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,600
THE ARMY FAILS

1113
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:37,670
-Seriously?
-For real?

1114
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:39,470
THE WINNER
TAKESHI'S ARMY

1115
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:42,670
-We won!
-Hurrah!

1116
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,400
Crap. None of them went in?

1117
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:53,000
Hioki hit the rim on the target
with multiples shots.

1118
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:56,830
But sadly could not hit the bullseye.

1119
00:59:57,230 --> 01:00:01,530
On the other hand, the timid Himura
got the target on the third try,

1120
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,730
and even hit it again
on the fourth and sixth.

1121
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,570
He brought the army to their knees.

1122
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,030
-That was close.
-It was.

1123
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:15,630
-Their ball made it this far.
-Why do you have that?

1124
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,970
-They hit your target?
-There's a ball here.

1125
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:19,270
Wow. You were about to lose.

1126
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:23,170
Surprisingly, in the midst
of the army's rapid fire attack,

1127
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:27,600
one ball bounced back and made its way
into the carriage.

1128
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:32,300
This shot doesn't count,
but Himura was close to losing again.

1129
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:37,070
-Well done.
-Great job. Nice.

1130
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:39,970
Can we call him Mr. Takeshi's Castle?

1131
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:41,630
What do you think?

1132
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:45,870
-What a pointed question.
-I think it's too soon.

1133
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:52,200
-Mr. Takeshi's Castle's Army Reserve.
-Army Reserve?

1134
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:54,500
-Well, Princess Naomi.
-I'm so happy.

1135
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:57,630
-What a wonderful victory.
-Well done.

1136
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,500
I felt nervous before the battle.

1137
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:02,430
But I kept my cool and hit their target.

1138
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,470
The army put up a good fight, didn't they?

1139
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:09,170
-They were skilled.
-They made me anxious a few times.

1140
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:11,500
-But we did it.
-We sure did.

1141
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,600
Well then, Takeshi's army
takes home the win!

1142
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,200
We did it!

1143
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,000
We won!

1144
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:24,930
-Fireworks!
-Wow!

1145
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,600
This is Takeshi's Castle!

1146
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:28,630
-This feels great.
-It sure does.

1147
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,030
What a pathetic lot.

1148
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,870
You let two warriors make it
inside the citadel?

1149
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:48,300
Naomi is a dried up hack.

1150
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,770
Pathetic... Absolutely pathetic.

1151
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:03,070
Coming up next episode,
a global array of warriors.

1152
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:07,930
The army of about 100 of the strongest
warriors will face impossible hurdles.

1153
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,570
And that popular game will return.

1154
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,700
They lost that many in one blow?

1155
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:22,170
-And this man is back in the ring.
-I got it this time.

1156
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:26,130
Will there be a warrior
who will survive long enough,

1157
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:30,430
to bring down fear upon Takeshi's army?

1158
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:43,030
THE ARMY BEHIND THE SCENES

1159
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:45,630
You gotta rush at the blue.

1160
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,500
THEY SHARED TACTICS WITH EACH OTHER

1161
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:51,200
Even if you make it,
you start falling immediately.

1162
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:53,630
Its fall is pretty long.

1163
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:56,300
You actually have time to aim the jump.

1164
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:59,770
Just jump into the mud
when you go to catch it.

1165
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:04,930
THEY WORKSHOPPED STRATEGIES
WITH ONE ANOTHER

1166
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:15,070
Ball is coming. Dodge.

1167
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,830
Looking good.

1168
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:29,100
THEY CAME BATTLE-READY
WITH CUSTOM-MADE MERCH

1169
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:54,830
Please don't stare at me so hard.

1170
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,670
I might drop the ball,
but I'd never drop a parcel of mail.

1171
01:03:57,730 --> 01:03:59,030
That's a gem of a comment.

1172
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:06,470
THEY SHARED THEIR EMOTIONS

1173
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,430
-Thank you.
-Well done.

1174
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,970
Let's get through this together!

1175
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:20,170
THEY COMFORTED EACH OTHER

1176
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,030
We will conquer!

1177
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,500
THE ARMY WILL NOT GIVE UP
ANY TIME SOON!

1178
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:32,970
That feels great.

1179
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:39,000
Why do I feel like
an elephant being bathed?
