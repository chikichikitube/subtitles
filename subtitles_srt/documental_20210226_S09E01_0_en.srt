00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,370
Huh? Hey!

549
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,900
Transportation costs!

550
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,570
I need to pay for transportation!

551
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,140
Are you a government official?

552
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,210
Don't get nervous!

553
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,950
Alright, this looks pretty neat

554
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,320
Of course, these are all bills

555
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,820
And here we go

556
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,050
Whoa!

557
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,160
That looks heavy

558
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,820
No way!
I wanna touch that!

559
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,490
It wouldn't be that tight
with old banknotes

560
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,290
Yeah, you're right.

561
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,330
And then!

562
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
What?!

563
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,130
Last time Kubota-kun won, but...

564
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,840
We didn't pay him the 10 million, right?

565
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,600
No way!

566
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,370
So this time...

567
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,140
It's carrying over!

568
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,310
No way!

569
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,010
This is amazing!

570
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,250
For real?!

571
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
I'm being serious

572
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,150
For real?! 20 million?!

573
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,320
There's no way!
You can buy a luxury car!

574
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,290
So who's going to stand laughing?

575
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,260
You're right!
This is heavy!

576
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,360
I'm really worried!

577
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,740
And we have also
changed the rules a little

578
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,470
It might be just for this time

579
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:33,370
This time we're doing just 4 hours

580
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,850
So you have to go all out

581
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,710
I don't think we'll be using

582
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,350
any more orange cards, really.

583
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,220
That's what I have in mind

584
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,550
No way!

585
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,550
And so...

586
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,820
We only have these two

587
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,120
For real?!

588
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,490
That's what I've decided

589
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,460
That's pretty strict!

590
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,000
You all look really scared

591
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,830
Well, you know... it's 20 million!

592
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,030
I've never seen so much money

593
00:28:59,030 --> 00:28:59,700
Right?

594
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,840
Junior's face really changed
when he saw the 20 million.

595
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,010
That's fine!

596
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,540
Junior-san changing
worries me!

597
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,450
I've never seen him
like that!

598
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,010
So this time

599
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,950
You'll be joining me monitoring

600
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,220
if you're out.

601
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,790
That's what I've thought

602
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,220
Ah, really?

603
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,490
That's what I have in mind.

604
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,820
Kubota, if you screw up this time as well

605
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,960
We're really making it a 30 million carry over!

606
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,630
How would I even screw up?

607
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,130
So make sure you keep that in mind

608
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,830
That's right.
Please do.

609
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,140
But what do I even have left without

610
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,400
dirty jokes and vulgarity?

611
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,770
Then don't show up!

612
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,740
Do your best!

613
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,810
Just don't get naked today!

614
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,310
There are different types of vulgar!

615
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,610
Well, that's true

616
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,010
I can do that, then!

617
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,780
But dirty jokes aren't forbidden.

618
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,180
-That's right.
-Yeah, you're right.

619
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,480
Just don't go overboard.

620
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,890
-I'm counting on you all.
-Alright!

621
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,120
Well then

622
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,520
We're starting!
Abareru-kun!

623
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,420
Please don't go!

624
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,420
One more!

625
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,730
Matsumoto-san!

626
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,560
-Just laugh!
-20 million!!

627
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,370
That's just, you know...

628
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,770
I don't like this!

629
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,440
I preferred losing 10 million!

630
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,540
The battle's making me nervous

631
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,310
This is totally different now

632
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,480
These changes kinda
make me nervous

633
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,380
I'm really nervous!

634
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,480
Well then

635
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,480
"Documental" will start!

636
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,090
It's started

637
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:33,390
Seiya... what's with
your sleeves?

638
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,100
-This?
-They look like nine-parts

639
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,730
They are

640
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,330
You're correct

641
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,700
Do you wear that normally?

642
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,410
Well, yeah.
I wanted one of these

643
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,910
Is that like an ethnic costume?

644
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,910
No...

645
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,320
It's just normal clothing

646
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,050
I've never seen you wear that
even though we're partners

647
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,120
Is that from Mongolia?

648
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,290
It looks kind of ethnic

649
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,430
Well, I didn't just buy it

650
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,060
because I went to Mongolia

651
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,230
Actually in Japan...

652
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,930
You bought it yourself?

653
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,430
My... mom got this for me.

654
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,200
She has great taste

655
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,700
So your mom bought it?

656
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,040
And you wear the stuff
your mom buys for you?

657
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,910
Well, yeah, I do.

658
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,380
Where did she buy it?

659
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,980
This?
Yeah

660
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,280
-In Mongolia.
-Mongolia?

661
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,280
Your mom is from Mongolia?

662
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,650
Is she Mongolian?

663
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,760
My mom is... Mongolian, and

664
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,860
Really?

665
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,690
And my dad is Bongolian

666
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,060
Combine the two

667
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,160
and I'm MongolBongol

668
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,560
-Get it so far?
-As if!

669
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,900
Alright

670
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,070
Alright!

671
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,200
You know...

672
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,770
Let's do it, man!

673
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,580
You're annoying!

674
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,140
He's so loud!

675
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,680
Let's do it then

676
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,180
A battle to the death!

677
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,850
Do you see any power?

678
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,420
One murder

679
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,850
-One murder?
-Yeah

680
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,090
One murder?

681
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,790
Soshina

682
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,290
Didn't you just smile?

683
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,660
What?!

684
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,660
I didn't.

685
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,690
You did!

686
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,460
-That's one point!
-I really didn't

687
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,000
He just smiled

688
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,060
It was pretty maniacal.

689
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,600
-Right...?
-I didn't smile, though.

690
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,670
Really?

691
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,830
Really Soshina?

692
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,470
I really didn't smile.

693
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,170
Can I brush my teeth?

694
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,510
Sure, sure. Do it!

695
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,570
Excuse me

696
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,610
Just for etiquette.
Yeah!

697
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,280
I got a new
electric toothbrush

698
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,950
It's fully electrical.

699
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,580
They're super compact
nowadays, huh?

700
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,380
It's really amazing.

701
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,450
Alright Osada

702
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,550
This is pretty great

703
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:45,060
With this, you don't have to
even move your hands

704
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,860
Who made it? Phillips?

705
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,460
The maker?

706
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,200
This is from Sunstar

707
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,070
Sunstar makes
stuff like that?

708
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,340
It says "Makita", though

709
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,070
Yeah, this is a Makita

710
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,870
I'm using it then

711
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
No way!

712
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,710
That's crazy!

713
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,180
He did it!

714
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,220
Isn't that dangerous?

715
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,980
Isn't it too strong?

716
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:11,920
Watch out!

717
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,820
It's pulling!

718
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,360
Does that even work?

719
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,760
It's hitting your uvula
with the toothbrush like

720
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,490
It really goes in deep

721
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,260
Is your palate okay?!

722
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,760
Your face is all screwed up

723
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Stop that, man!

724
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,200
You should lower the intensity

725
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,270
It's because it hits your uvula!

726
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,240
Old men shouldn't be
gagging early in the morning!

727
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,040
Why not lower the intensity?

728
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:38,250
Do it slowly.
Go easy

729
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,750
That's too quick

730
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,010
Too quick

731
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,080
That's insane, yeah

732
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,150
This is no game

733
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,550
That's industrial speed

734
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,760
It's pretty bad

735
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,320
It's stabbing you.
Are you alright?

736
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,860
No way, that's insane.

737
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,160
Can someone else do it?

738
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,430
Who's doing it?

739
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,560
I'll do it if we wash it

740
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,730
I have a new toothbrush actually

741
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:59,930
Let's do it

742
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I wanna try

743
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,670
You wanna try?

744
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,770
Why do you wanna do that?

745
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,640
Here's the power

746
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,710
Good luck today

747
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,810
Seiya, what's with you?

748
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
What's wrong?

749
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,350
What happened?

750
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,880
This guy just

751
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,590
said something that only
I could hear

752
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,720
I didn't, though.

753
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,060
I just warned him
not to pace around

754
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,690
Pacing around is not good

755
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,030
You guys, I'm not okay with this

756
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:32,030
Could you stop

757
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,540
Thinking that one of you will remain

758
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
And take the ten million?

759
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,570
-No way.
-We haven't done that!

760
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,240
-That's pretty bad!
-You're basically colluding!

761
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,140
Like with the Mongolian stuff earlier!

762
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,240
It seemed like it!

763
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,310
You're pretty rude

764
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,480
So what if it's true?

765
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,180
I couldn't change it

766
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,080
That's a shame

767
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,190
It didn't fit

768
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,620
I'm sorry

769
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,130
I want to apologize

770
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,890
So I made something to drink

771
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,460
Really? Thank you!

772
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,630
What's that?

773
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,900
That's scary!

774
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,570
So I wanted to get
some feedback from everyone!

775
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,940
That's pretty rough looking

776
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,040
That's scary!

777
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,140
No way!

778
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,270
Let me know
what you think!

779
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,340
Hey you...

780
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,410
This is pretty bad

781
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,880
Give it a try!

782
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,980
No way I'm drinking that!

783
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,280
Just give it a try!

784
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,380
No way!

785
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,980
It's great
for your health!

786
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,280
That's pretty scary

787
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,790
You brought it out!

788
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,490
What do you think it is?

789
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,460
That's piss, man.

790
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,660
It's not.

791
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,660
Is it really not?

792
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,360
It's not! That's definitely not!

793
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,400
I wouldn't make you drink that.
This is good.

794
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,300
-Then what is it?
-Let me know how it tastes.

795
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,870
Then you name someone, Bareru

796
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,740
You call him Bareru?
That's what you call Abareru-kun?

797
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,470
Bareru?

798
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,580
Should I name someone?

799
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,410
No way, man! Not me!

800
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,020
That's pretty wild!
What even is that?

801
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,320
-What's that?
-Is it homemade?

802
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,720
Is it homemade?

803
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:05,330
So whoever gets the circle, drinks

804
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,790
Alright. Just one?

805
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,860
One person?

806
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,800
Whoever gets the X drinks

807
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,970
That's the opposite now

808
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,900
It's reversed

809
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,840
You drink first
to show it's okay

810
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,070
-Alright.
-That's true

811
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,710
From the producer himself

812
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,180
Not by name then?

813
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,110
That's right.

814
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:26,910
The producer's face...

815
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,220
Show us it's safe to drink

816
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,350
Should-Shouldn't I just
tell you what it is?

817
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,160
Just drink it up.

818
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,260
Can you drink it?

819
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,000
You drink first

820
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,630
There's no way

821
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,900
That's pretty serious!

822
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,470
Osada just laughed, right?

823
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,440
Who was it? Osada?

824
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,910
He laughed!

825
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,480
Osada-san!

826
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,980
You definitely laughed!

827
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,180
Why?!

828
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,980
What happened?

829
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,980
What?

830
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,220
I did it.

831
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,690
You lowered your guard?

832
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,950
This isn't the time for that, man!

833
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,720
It's too early!

834
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,060
What happened?

835
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,730
Why, Osada?

836
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,700
That was Osada, right?

837
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,100
Yeah, it was me.

838
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,100
What? What?
Nothing funny happened!

839
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,530
Nothing happened!

840
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,100
Yeah, nothing happened.

841
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,810
But I guess it was the atmosphere

842
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,270
It's just

843
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,810
It was like pure magic!

844
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,810
I was just really freaked out!

845
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,180
You have to hold it in!

846
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,980
Yeah, you're-you're right. That's not good

847
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,620
What were you laughing at?

848
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,120
Well, I was just thinking
that he wouldn't drink it himself.

849
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,650
That's true

850
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,690
That's a pretty straightforward reason

851
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,930
Well, let's take a look anyway

852
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,900
He's got it, right?

853
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,930
You drink first

854
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,370
There's no way...

855
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,700
That's pretty serious!

856
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,110
What happened? Why?!

857
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,380
It doesn't make sense!

858
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,650
What happened?

859
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,780
He definitely laughed

860
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,380
I don't get it

861
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,950
What was funny?

862
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:14,290
Well, it wasn't a full laugh

863
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,560
It was just...

864
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,460
It came out

865
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,460
What a waste!

866
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,960
That's pretty bad!

867
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,360
It might be a straight out!

868
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,830
That was pretty bad!

869
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,900
He'd be out immediately
after four hours!

870
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:29,770
Straight red!

871
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,870
I'm sorry, everyone!
Please give me a break!

872
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,840
-Yellow!
-I'm sorry

873
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,740
Yellow, yellow!

874
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,880
But watch out

875
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,150
Yeah, let's do so

876
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,210
That happens sometimes

877
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,620
Yeah, it was out of habit

878
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,150
That was surprising

879
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,750
That was pretty close!

880
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,160
Osada, no second chances!

881
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,990
-Yeah!
-That's rough!

882
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,390
No one can pull that off again

883
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,830
Shut up, shut up

884
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,870
I actually got married!

885
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,740
Who was it?

886
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,870
Master Kiyoshi

887
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,940
Good morning!

888
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:11,140
Try a three-point-inversion in the morning!
