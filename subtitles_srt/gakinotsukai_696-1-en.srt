00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,620
"I Have Always Wanted to Try Making This" - Part 2

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,720
Absolutely Tasty - Pizza Round !

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,570
You just BARELY made it through the introduction

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,130
Where's the "@#$% Machine" when we need it ??

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,900
Downtown

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,900
Hitoshi Matsumoto

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,900
Masatoshi Hamada

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,090
If he keeps stuttering,

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,970
Cocorico

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,970
Naoki Tanaka

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,970
Shozo Endo

14
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,750
We might need to bring the "@#$% Machine" up

15
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,100
This is actually our second cooking series

16
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,330
Hosei Yamasaki

17
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,230
Yes, it is

18
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,460
Just like last time, we're each presenting two recipes

19
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:37,600
Objective
Present and critique each participant's two pizzas

20
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,430
How well do you think you know pizza ??

21
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,320
I'm very confident

22
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,190
Last time around,

23
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,560
the theme was "Rice," correct ??

24
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,710
Right, we used the rice cooker

25
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,490
I heard it was a hit

26
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,640
Some viewers told me that they routinely fix them after watching that episode

27
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,680
Get outta here

28
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,840
Exactly whose dish are you talking about ?

29
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,350
But there were good ones...

30
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,470
And who won ...

31
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,520
I'd say the "Edamame Rice with Beer"

32
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,800
Edamame Rice with Beer

33
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
That was the best

34
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,620
What about my Okonomiyaki Rice ??

35
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,800
Okonomiyaki Rice

36
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,000
Seriously, many people told me how good it was

37
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,490
after they cooked it themselves

38
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,530
They actually made it ?

39
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,020
Yes

40
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,390
Are you serious ?

41
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:02,930
Yes, I am

42
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,170
I'm serious about this

43
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,810
I heard it was good

44
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,760
I've noticed Tanaka lies every now and then

45
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,830
Trust me on this

46
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,850
Downtown Presents
Gaki No Tsukai Ya Arahende

47
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,000
Matsumoto Kiyoshi

48
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,000
Sponsor

49
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,110
Tanaka's Pizza

50
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,430
First up is Tanaka

51
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,330
What are his choice of toppings ?

52
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,360
Here are my first items

53
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,660
What are they ??

54
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,430
What's this ?

55
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:39,350
Cheese

56
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:39,350
Ingredients

57
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:39,350
Japanese Sake

58
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:39,350
Sake Lees

59
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:39,350
Shiokara

60
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,000
We have Sake, Sake Lees, and *Shiokara

61
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We have Sake, Sake Lees, and *Shiokara

62
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,810
We have Sake, Sake Lees, and *Shiokara

63
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,200
I don't know about this...

64
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,810
*Shiokara is salt-cured fish guts

65
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,360
It's amazing that you chose to combine these ingredients,

66
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,740
since each can be difficult to eat on its own

67
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,500
I'm positive this will be good

68
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,490
Pizza will go great with Sake...

69
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,000
Sake...and Sake Lees....Get outta here !

70
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sake...and Sake Lees....Get outta here !

71
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,280
Sake...and Sake Lees....Get outta here !

72
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,970
They're basically the same thing

73
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,420
You're serious about this

74
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,410
I'm not a big fan of Sake Lees

75
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,780
I'm not sure Sake Lees will be good cooked

76
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,610
since they're already good raw

77
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,930
I think you've got enough on there

78
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,640
You're not gonna cut it in pieces ?

79
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,040
A bold move

80
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,610
Spectacular

81
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,290
I see, they're already cut to fit the dough

82
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,080
I hope you're not just messing around today

83
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,490
Please, I'm really serious about my dish

84
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,330
Well, we're all serious about this project

85
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,550
That's a lot of Shiokara

86
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,930
Compare this to anchovy pizza

87
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,480
I hear you

88
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,410
it's a similar flavor

89
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,540
Well, well, that might be a stretch

90
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,950
Hey, I like anchovy pizza

91
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,180
It's good, isn't it ?

92
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,270
I like the saltiness

93
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,680
I don't like it

94
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,370
I don't think Hamada-san is sold on this

95
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,380
So, I got the idea from anchovy pizza ...

96
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,220
OK then

97
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,390
And your second recipe is ?

98
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,410
Here it is

99
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,460
What...??

100
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:50,330
Cheese

101
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:50,330
Ingredients

102
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:50,330
Strawberry

103
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:50,330
Yukimi Daifuku (Mochi Ice Cream)

104
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,070
Are they...??

105
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,960
I don't know what to say...

106
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,980
My intention is to make dessert pizza

107
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,880
This one already looks better than the last one

108
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,020
I agree

109
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,970
It looks good already

110
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,910
The key is to add strawberry with the mochi ice cream

111
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,110
Endo's Pizza

112
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,580
Next up is Endo

113
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,160
What are his ingredients ??

114
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,810
I decided to use "High-End" ingredients

115
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,860
I wanted to give these a try

116
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,960
Here they are

117
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,550
That's a one bold...

118
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,500
Blowfish

119
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,500
Cheese

120
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,500
Grated Daikon

121
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,500
Ingredients

122
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,500
Ponzu

123
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,000
"Blowfish Pizza"

124
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,920
I came up with this idea...

125
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,670
You're an idiot

126
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,540
May I...

127
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,650
May I say this is the ultimate luxury ?

128
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,400
I would agree

129
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,690
Pour the sauce like so

130
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,390
Pour a cup of Ponzu over blowfish sashimi

131
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,330
And you can't call it a pizza without this...

132
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,350
Cheese

133
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,330
I don't know about this

134
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,570
Pretty out of control

135
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,010
I want a restaurant owner to tell me they've tried this recipe

136
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,960
I somehow doubt anyone would try this

137
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,420
I don't think a family would try this

138
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,150
I mean, just think how much it would cost

139
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,730
His second pizza is "Frisk Mint Pizza"

140
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,000
Cheese

141
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,000
Frisk Mints

142
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,000
Ingredients

143
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,000
Pizza sauce

144
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,580
The secret is to add 150 mints

145
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,310
I'm guessing this could be

146
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,950
a hit among women

147
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,010
You're right

148
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,450
I don't know about that...

149
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,840
Women tend to like minty stuff

150
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,690
Yes, they really do

151
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,630
Yamasaki's Pizza

152
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,010
Here's Yamasaki's pizza

153
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,650
What are his preferred ingredients ??

154
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,870
Yama-chan, let's see what you got

155
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,790
Are we good ?

156
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,230
It's *Hiyashi Chuka

157
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:30,080
(Cucumber, Egg, Ham, and Tomato)

158
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:30,080
Cheese

159
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:30,080
Hiyashi Chuka (Cold Noodles)

160
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:30,080
Ingredients

161
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:21,230
*Hiyashi Chuka is a cold noodle dish

162
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,540
Why aren't you taking this seriously ?

163
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,330
Wait..

164
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,140
I told you we're all taking this very seriously

165
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,480
Please, I'm totally serious

166
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,910
I'm going to pour all of this on the dough

167
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,880
You're not holding back

168
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,080
With the broth ?

169
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,560
Yeah, everything

170
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,550
That's some creation

171
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,400
This adds color

172
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,880
How's this ?

173
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,010
You're trying to make it look exactly like Hiyashi Chuka

174
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:39,580
I see

175
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,660
But once you slice it into pieces...

176
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,060
Each will have a different topping

177
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,520
Then one person could get stuck with just eggs

178
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,820
You'll have to share each of your toppings

179
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,900
It's more fun that way, don't you think ?

180
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,750
I don't want the cucumber piece for sure

181
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,650
I'm really particular about the appearance of this dish

182
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,670
Here's my second pizza

183
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,440
I'm shooting for a dessert as well

184
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,770
Looks like you have a lot of stuff under there

185
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,490
You can't wait to see it, can you ?

186
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,860
What could it be ?

187
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,150
Here it it

188
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,410
What is this ?

189
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,830
Yes, cotton candy

190
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,300
Cheese

191
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,300
Cotton Candy

192
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,300
Ingredients

193
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,880
I wonder what will happen when it cooks ?

194
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,260
I see

195
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,860
Why not just put it on like this ?

196
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,360
How else would you do it ?

197
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,160
So...

198
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,280
this is more like dessert

199
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,500
Yes, it's sweet

200
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,540
But this is more...

201
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,090
But you still need the cheese

202
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,730
That should do it

203
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,890
That's a simple dish

204
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,860
Yes, it is

205
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,660
The cheese should melt around the cotton candy

206
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,250
Hamada's Pizza

207
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,030
Next up is Hamada

208
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,250
What's his specialty pizza ?

209
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,570
I'm using more common ingredients

210
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,970
Any family can do this

211
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,300
Unlike the blowfish over there

212
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,610
Here they are

213
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,390
I see, this is a very common dish but...

214
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:59,700
(Beef, Chinese Cabbage, Green Onion, Tofu, etc)

215
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:59,700
Cheese

216
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:59,700
Egg

217
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:59,700
Ingredients

218
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:59,700
Sukiyaki

219
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,770
What do you mean ??

220
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,710
Who wouldn't fix Sukiyaki from time to time at home ??

221
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,970
I hear you

222
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,710
Do you see ??

223
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,600
So you're using Sukiyaki ingredients

224
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,850
Not a bad choice...

225
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,330
So I'm just gonna go ahead and...

226
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,890
just as Yama-chan arranged his toppings

227
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,020
Arrange them by groups ?

228
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,290
Right, just like Sukiyaki

229
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,020
You're keeping the integrity of the dish

230
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,130
Right, keeping it true

231
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,320
Then someone may end up with a meat slice

232
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,370
I don't want the Konnyaku piece

233
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,450
I second that

234
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,820
Here's the soup

235
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,510
And here's some cheese

236
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,740
You just ruined it

237
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,530
But what makes the pizza complete is this item right here

238
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,580
Oh, I see

239
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,620
That's for later

240
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,660
Just like Sukiyaki,

241
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,490
You dip your pizza into the raw egg

242
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,270
I've got a bad feeling about this

243
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,610
I'm feeling this

244
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,830
So just use the egg as a dipping sauce

245
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:57,100
Cheese

246
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:57,100
Egg

247
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:57,100
Ingredients

248
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:57,100
Rice

249
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:57,100
Soy Sauce

250
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,120
Hamada's second idea is to use Rice with Beaten Eggs

251
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,530
This idea could end up being delicious

252
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,530
Could this be like Doria ??

253
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,740
Oh, I see where you're going with this

254
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,790
Just pour it on the dough like so

255
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,420
This actually looks good

256
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,410
This looks delicious

257
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,120
My stomach just growled

258
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,540
Matsumoto's Pizza

259
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,630
And Matsumoto is the last

260
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,520
I wonder what his plan is

261
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,300
OK, so it's my turn

262
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,720
I'm very confident about my presentation

263
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,240
Check this out

264
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,180
It's *Gohan Desuyo

265
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:40,000
*See www.shibatabread.com to find out what Gohan Desuyo is

266
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,520
Cheese

267
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,520
Gohan Desuyo

268
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,520
Ingredients

269
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,580
I'm positive this will work !!

270
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,860
I see

271
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,330
You can't go wrong with this !!

272
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,810
It's quite simple, too

273
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,750
So you just spread it on, right ?

274
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,860
You're correct

275
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,030
All kidding aside,

276
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,640
This could be good

277
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,920
It's like seafood after all

278
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,970
After spreading the Gohan Desuyo,

279
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,890
the cheese completes the pizza

280
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,220
This could come as a surprise but...

281
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,810
What ??

282
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,700
What the hell is this ??

283
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,780
What the hell...?

284
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,130
A pig ??

285
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:57,160
Cheese

286
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:57,160
Goya

287
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:57,160
Ingredients

288
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:57,160
Mirin

289
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:57,160
Skin of Pig's head

290
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:57,160
Soy Sauce

291
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,830
This is the skin of a Pig's head

292
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,590
Okinawa-style ??

293
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,870
Yes, I thought, "Why not go with an Okinawa theme?"

294
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,510
There's never been an Okinawa Pizza

295
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,140
I don't like this

296
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,220
I won't want to slice this pizza

297
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,770
That's amazing

298
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,890
The interior side looks good, too, right ?

299
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,630
Well, I supposed I can...

300
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,100
How about making this into a wall decoration ?

301
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,900
A wall fixture ??

302
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,020
Yeah, put this up on the wall

303
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,270
And put a long and short hand right here to make a clock

304
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,960
This would be the 15min mark here and...

305
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,100
We've got it already

306
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,520
It's like I'm about to shave its face or something

307
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,040
Yes, indeed

308
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,180
How are we gonna eat this ?

309
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,450
Well, the pig will be happy for sure

310
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,600
And I have yet another idea !

311
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,250
And this is a really special ingredient

312
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,180
that I wanted to use

313
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,850
May I present it to you ??

314
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,610
Well, I just used the Pig's head

315
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,880
And I wasn't quite sure if this one would work but...

316
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,020
Think of it as the Head vs. the Head

317
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,210
But here it is

318
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,160
Who would WANT to eat this pizza ??

319
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:24,740
Cheese

320
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:24,740
Ingredients

321
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:24,740
Tuna Head

322
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,460
What the hell is this ??

323
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,570
This will be awesome !!

324
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,630
I don't think so

325
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,140
How do you even slice this ?

326
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,400
How are we eating this ?

327
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,090
This will be delicious

328
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,530
Seriously, how are we cutting this ?

329
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,990
So, this is a tuna's head

330
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,990
I can clearly see that

331
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,230
I'm just gonna put it right on the dough

332
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,050
And bake it

333
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,680
Everyone presented their ideas, and now it's time to bake them

334
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,680
Who will come out on top ?!

335
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,560
I'm smelling something good

336
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:44,130
Yes, you're right

337
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,740
Rank each pizza on a scale of 1 to 10

338
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,100
There, I can smell it

339
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,020
I can smell something good

340
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,770
Tanaka's 1st : "Sake and Shiokara Pizza"

341
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,250
First up is Tanaka's "Sake and Shiokara Pizza"

342
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,770
How does it taste ?

343
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,090
Wow, that looks delicious

344
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:57,810
Here

345
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,870
It looks good !

346
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,800
See ?

347
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,240
Look

348
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,530
Well, well, well

349
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,010
You just might have done it

350
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,700
See this ?

351
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,720
Nobody would question this at a restaurant

352
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,140
I'd say this is perfect so far

353
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,010
Yes, it is

354
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,580
So these are all Sake Lees

355
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,460
Yea, Sake Lees

356
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,930
That burned piece looks good, too

357
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,150
Looks awesome !

358
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,940
Smells great

359
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,190
You've done well

360
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,050
Some viewers will try this for sure

361
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,350
I'm not a fan of the smell

362
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,460
Hamada-san, you're not into the Shiokara smell

363
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,550
This is....pretty good so far!!

364
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,320
This is....pretty good so far!!

365
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,950
Good, good

366
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,160
Isn't it ??

367
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,000
Itadakimasu

368
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,690
Delicious !

369
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm not into this

370
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,760
No, this is good, really !

371
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,720
This is delicious !

372
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,450
Everyone has different taste buds, right ?

373
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,940
I'm giving you a zero for this

374
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,520
I'm giving you a zero for this

375
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,810
Are you serious ?

376
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,310
I'm giving it...

377
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,650
Seven

378
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,630
Then, I'm giving it a...

379
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,050
That's a high score

380
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,220
I'd say five

381
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,110
This is pretty good but

382
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,990
the flavor can be overpowering

383
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,820
I agree
You can't eat a whole lot of this

384
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,510
The first bite is great but

385
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,940
it gets a bit tough after that

386
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,230
The flavor can be too much

387
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,350
Highly anticipated but receives a mere five points

388
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,240
Tanaka's 1st : "Sake and Shiokara Pizza"

389
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:35,230
Tanaka's 2nd : "Yukimi Daifuku Pizza"

390
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,690
Tanaka's next pizza is "Yukimi Mochi Ice Cream Pizza"

391
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,230
How does this fare ?

392
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,660
It sure smells good

393
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,810
The strawberry compliments it well

394
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,120
The mochi is still there

395
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,720
Check this out

396
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,570
All I can smell is the sweetness

397
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:56,000
Looks like something you can buy at Fujiya Cake Shop

398
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,570
This could be very good, don't you think ?

399
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,670
Women would love this for sure

400
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,640
Itadakimasu

401
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,880
Delicious !

402
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,160
See ?

403
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,270
This is great !

404
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
See ?

405
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,040
How can this be ?

406
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,280
Tasty, isn't it ?

407
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,260
Delicious

408
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,940
Delicious

409
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,270
This is very good

410
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,460
This is very tasty

411
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,080
Awesome !

412
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,250
This recipe is something anyone could do

413
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,510
You can make this at home

414
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,700
Kids would love it, too

415
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,910
Yeah, they'll love this

416
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,520
I agree

417
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,960
Girls would be really into this

418
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,930
Endo, there's a piece of cheese hanging from your chin

419
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,060
Yeah, there is !

420
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,810
This is so good, I didn't realize...

421
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,430
I want more of this

422
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,750
Upon rave reviews,

423
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,670
Tanaka's 2nd : "Yukimi Daifuku Pizza"

424
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,800
it received eight points

425
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,700
Endo's 1st : "Blowfish Pizza"

426
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,700
Gourmet toppings is the selling point of Endo's "Blowfish Pizza"

427
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,760
Not bad looking at all

428
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,150
Will you look at this ?

429
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,060
Looks like any other pizza

430
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,750
What do you think ?

431
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,640
What am I tasting ?

432
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,100
There's really no flavor

433
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,760
I can't pinpoint it

434
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,420
This is the worst way to serve blowfish

435
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,820
This isn't pretty

436
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,540
There's no kick to this

437
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,050
None at all

438
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,910
Then you should have just left the blowfish poison

439
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,750
Then you should have just left the blowfish poison

440
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,790
Despite the expensive ingredients, it only received three points

441
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,790
Endo's 1st : "Blowfish Pizza"

442
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,750
Next up is the unpredictable "Frisk Pizza"

443
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,770
Endo's 2nd : "Frisk Pizza"

444
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,770
What's that smell ?

445
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,050
This looks good

446
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,600
Yea, I can smell it

447
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,770
So far, it looks perfect

448
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,960
You've seen pizza like this before, right ?

449
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,610
I can still see some Frisk mints

450
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,480
Put your face closer to it

451
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,400
I just felt a minty breeze on my face

452
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,430
What the hell is that ?

453
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,980
It cools my face !

454
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,310
It almost feels cold

455
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,350
It chilled my face !

456
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,330
So the frisk mints can melt

457
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,010
Wow, it really does cool off my face

458
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,030
Very refreshing

459
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,000
This could cure your sinus issues...

460
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,990
Are we ready to do this ?

461
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,670
By the way, how would you score it ?

462
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,180
By the way, how would you score it ?

463
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,990
What ?

464
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,550
We couldn't even finish a bite

465
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,540
About how many points ?

466
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,150
This is outside the realm of points

467
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,420
This deserves a skull and cross bones !

468
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,820
Just as expected, mint doesn't go with Pizza

469
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,410
Endo's 2nd : "Frisk Pizza"

470
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,430
It received the cross-bones

471
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,420
Expectations are low, but how will Yamasaki's dish really taste ?

472
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,440
Yamasaki's 1st : "Hiyashi Chuka Pizza"

473
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,550
I guess anything is possible ??

474
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,200
Miracle ?

475
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Translation by Shibatabread

476
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,150
This must be a miracle !

477
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,320
See ?

478
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,300
Interesting

479
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,380
It didn't change at all

480
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,620
Looks fake

481
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,080
It's like a store display

482
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,010
It's interesting

483
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,980
It looks like a restaurant display item

484
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,900
Here's the egg section

485
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,300
You're messing it up

486
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,460
May I ?

487
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,310
Go ahead

488
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,180
So this is the ham piece

489
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,080
And this isn't bad at all

490
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,420
I have one thing to say, too

491
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,870
I got the egg piece and...

492
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,390
it's pretty good

493
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,250
May I say that my piece is

494
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,420
pretty good, too

495
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
I got the tomato piece

496
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,900
And it's perfect

497
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,880
See ??

498
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,840
This is really delicious

499
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,370
Not bad at all

500
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,040
The soba broth mixed well with the pizza

501
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,740
It's a great combination

502
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,910
What's my score then ?

503
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,200
Seven ?

504
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,500
Seven

505
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,380
Despite the bad first impression, it received a surprising seven points

506
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,380
Yamasaki's 1st : "Hiyashi Chuka Pizza"

507
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,530
Next up is his "Cotton Candy Pizza"

508
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,390
Yamasaki's 2nd : "Cotton Candy Pizza"

509
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,390
How did it turn out ?

510
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,420
Nothing is left !

511
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,420
It's gone !

512
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,680
Serious ?

513
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,510
See ?

514
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,620
See ?

515
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,880
You're right

516
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,010
It melted nicely

517
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,680
It does look tasty

518
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,080
Man, this is over the top sweet

519
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,610
This is some serious business

520
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,450
Really...

521
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,980
There are crunchy pieces of sugar, too

522
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,030
It's hard on my teeth

523
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,040
The crystallized sugar wasn't a hit, and it received two points

524
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,040
Yamasaki's 2nd : "Cotton Candy Pizza"

525
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,480
I'm shooting for a back-to-back victory with this

526
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,490
Don't forget your dipping bowl

527
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,630
I don't know how I feel about this...

528
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,980
Beat the egg to your liking

529
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,240
The way you usually like it

530
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,800
Hamada's "Sukiyaki Pizza" with egg dipping sauce

531
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,620
Hamada's 1st : "Sukiyaki Pizza"

532
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,620
How does it taste ?

533
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,980
First let me take a look

534
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:29,430
Can it be...?

535
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,220
This could be the surprise item

536
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,800
What the...?

537
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,980
I have to admit it looks awful

538
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,090
If I was served this at a restaurant,

539
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,160
I would demand to see the manager for sure

540
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,650
Look at that meat

541
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,200
I'll put some meat on all of your slices

542
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,460
I can definitely smell the Sukiyaki Nabe

543
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,830
It smells just like Sukiyaki Nabe

544
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,270
How should we eat this then ?

545
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,530
Well, it's really easy to eat

546
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,420
All you have to do is

547
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,590
eat it like any Sukiyaki Nabe

548
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,960
Like Sukiyaki ?

549
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,970
Dip the slice into the sauce like this

550
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,040
Make sure it's in there good

551
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,030
And get some egg on it

552
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,580
That's not how you eat pizza

553
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
You're just messing around

554
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,510
You're lying

555
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,150
Trust me, it's good

556
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,590
Don't be shy

557
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,950
See ?

558
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,090
Good

559
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,760
My team agrees that this is

560
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,380
Delicious

561
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,860
Delicious

562
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,430
Our review also is "very good"

563
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,320
Our review also is "very good"

564
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,230
That's your review ?

565
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,400
Yes

566
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,890
How could this be...?

567
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,430
I know, how can it be so good ?

568
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,010
Why is this good ?

569
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,960
The egg really compliments the pizza

570
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,510
The egg is a nice touch

571
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,360
I would say this is...

572
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,010
Delicious

573
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,740
You can make this at home

574
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,680
Right ?

575
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,770
It would be very easy to make

576
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,810
Hamada's 1st : "Sukiyaki Pizza"

577
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:16,810
With the help of raw egg, it receives nine points

578
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,860
Hamada confidently presents his second entry; "Egg Rice Pizza"

579
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,860
Hamada's 2nd : "Egg Rice Pizza"

580
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,270
Here it is !

581
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,670
Looks familiar

582
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,790
Like Doria ?

583
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,680
Yes, like Doria

584
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,170
It certainly resembles it

585
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,540
I see...

586
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,100
I have to say...

587
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,690
This is very similar to the "Blowfish Pizza"

588
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,550
They belong in the same food group

589
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,520
Hamada's 2nd : "Egg Rice Pizza"

590
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,520
Despite his confidence, Hamada receives only three points

591
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,570
Matsumoto's 1st : "Gohan Desuyo Pizza"

592
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,570
Next up is Matsumoto's promising "Gohan Desuyo Pizza"

593
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,860
You ready for this ?

594
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,960
Remember, there's not much to this...

595
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,460
I don't know what to make of your reaction

596
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,260
Please don't pay attention to its appearance

597
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,520
It looks pretty burned

598
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,890
It's charred

599
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,930
After the commercial
Matsumoto distributes his pizza !

600
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,040
I have high hopes for this one

601
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,230
How does Matsumoto's "Gohan Desuyo Pizza" fare ??

602
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,770
Delicious

603
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,730
Very tasty

604
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,420
Really good

605
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,190
Good

606
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,770
Delicious

607
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,630
The saltiness is perfect

608
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,400
This is incredibly good

609
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,400
It brings out the best of Gohan Desuyo

610
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,080
The best

611
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,310
I feel this deserves a perfect score since it could be sold in stores

612
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,360
A perfect 10 ?

613
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,790
I agree

614
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,310
Let me say the Sukiyaki was good but

615
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,220
think about how much it cost to make it

616
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,470
You're right about that

617
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,490
In this economy,

618
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,430
you don't have to spend much at all

619
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,120
It costs about 20 - 30 yen per piece

620
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,920
You might have done it

621
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,180
You can have this every day

622
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,420
And save money for your Mom's salon expense

623
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,340
Like money for the perm ?

624
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,030
Right, the p@#$%...

625
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,730
It received a unanimous 10 points

626
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,730
Matsumoto's 1st : "Gohan Desuyo Pizza"

627
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,760
Here's Matsumoto's Okinawa inspired entry, "Pig Face Pizza"

628
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,760
Matsumoto's 2nd : "Pig Face Pizza"

629
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,260
How does it look ?

630
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,010
It looks the same as before it went into the oven

631
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,290
Nothing has changed

632
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,720
Right, there isn't any "Before" and "After" image

633
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:01,990
There's none of that

634
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,690
And it's looking right at me

635
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,830
Yes, it is

636
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,010
It's aimed at him

637
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,330
He's looking at me...

638
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,830
Staring right at Hamada

639
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,570
Amazing elasticity

640
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,350
You can't slice it with that

641
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,060
You might need a different tool...

642
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,340
It like a Halloween mask

643
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,530
I bet you can't cut through that snout

644
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,220
You'll have to put some muscle into it

645
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,960
What do you think ?

646
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,370
How do you feel about this ?

647
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,410
Itadakimasu

648
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,260
I didn't realize how tough it would be

649
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,400
Man, that's tough

650
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,870
The texture is hard

651
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:44,840
Stop complaining and EAT IT !

652
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,010
Stop complaining and EAT IT !

653
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,510
Can I just say...

654
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,100
this deserves 7 or 8 points ??

655
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,170
I don't think so

656
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:05,970
No way !

657
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,980
Matsumoto's 2nd : "Pig Face Pizza"

658
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,980
The dish scored a double skull and cross bones

659
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,010
And here's Matsumoto's most prized ingredient on his "Tuna Head Pizza"

660
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,010
Matsumoto's 3rd : "Tuna Head Pizza"

661
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,220
This is the big finale !!

662
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,690
"Tuna Head Pizza" !!

663
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,900
Here we go

664
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,630
We had to bake this in a bigger oven

665
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,640
This will be difficult to appreciate

666
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,580
How come ?

667
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,030
Because I have already seen that gross looking tuna head

668
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,000
If "Pig Head" represented the Land

669
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,310
Then this one represents the Ocean

670
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,240
I haven't got a clue how it looks after being baked

671
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,660
Thank you very much

672
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,060
That's a huge box

673
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,830
It came straight out of his delivery bike

674
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,580
Thank you very much

675
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,640
See you later

676
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,400
Wow, I can already smell it !

677
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,770
That's a strong smell

678
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,250
I just caught a whiff

679
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,890
After the Commercial
We Reveal the Tuna Head Pizza !

680
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,800
I can smell it from here

681
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,760
That's a strong smell

682
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,100
That's overpowering

683
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,200
Here we go

684
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,400
It smells like seared fish

685
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,170
You can pull the top off ?

686
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,970
Pick it up

687
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,290
It's still the same

688
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,080
Thank you very much !
