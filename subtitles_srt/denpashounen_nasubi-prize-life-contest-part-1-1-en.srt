00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,760
And then the audition begins...

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,340
In today's audition, all you need is luck

38
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,740

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,030

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,930
A raffle box is brought in.

41
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,740

49
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,990
What is this lucky comedian's name?

50
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,910
Nasubi

51
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,460
However, he was still unaware
of the new project details ...

52
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,210
Let's go then?

53
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,580
Now?! Really?!

54
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,050
I feel like I used all of my good luck at once...

55
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,040
You used it all huh?

56
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,080
Ahahahaha♥

57
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:11,730
But for this new challenge, Nasubi did not realise that
Luck is the most important thing.

58
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,040
Aaahh!! So COLD!

59
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,910
Please get in

60
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,960
We're driving there?

61
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,420
Before departing, he wears an Eyemask and Headphones

62
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,730
The heavy snow continues to fall during the journey

63
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,950
The winning ticket that was drawn

64
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,390
Would forever change the destiny of this man.

65
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,770
The car stopped.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,920
Uwahh! It's cold! It's cold!

67
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,140
Where is Nasubi being taken to?

68
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,330
It seems we have arrived.

69
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,600
Take off the mask

70
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,320
What did Nasubi see?

71
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,800
A room

72
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,200
The contents inside this bland room are...

73
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:13,700
A small Table, a mountain of Postcards, a Pen,
a Phone, a Radio, a Cushion

74
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
In the kitchen is a Gas stove

75
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,570
A Toilet, Shower, Bath and Air con

76
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,090
And also many Magazines

77
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,730
Then...

78
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,720
Strip

79
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,090
W..wh...what ??

80
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,580
Get naked ♥

81
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,850

82
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,290
Really? Pants too?

83
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,160
Is this ok...?

84
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,310
No way...

85
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,660
Wait, this isn't what I think it is?

86
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,850
Confiscation of clothes

87
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,980
W-what's going on?

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,180
Underpants too

89
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,620

Cushion

91
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,330
What sort of plan is this?

92
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,970
You don't understand?

93
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,830
Magazines and Postcards, but I don't get it...

94
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,420
Something Prize contest related?

95
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,410
Firstly, what do you want the most?

96
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,270
I want my clothes!

97
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,770
I need to win them in a Prize contest?

98
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,720
No way♥

99
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,560
For what reason?

100
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,300
Can people live by winning only prize contests?

101
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,880
Then...

102
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,130
Camera

103
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,770

A Mic

106
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Nice ♥

107
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,370
No, no this is not good at all!

108
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,740
I still have questions I want to ask!

109
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,650

110
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,490

114
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,590
Wait!

115
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,840
Hold on!

116
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,400
This can't be for real

117
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,480
1 hour later...

118
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,120
He becomes accepting, and...

119
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,770
There is no shame or embarrassment

120
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,370
Two hours later

121
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,990
Anyway, I should write...

122
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,740
He is pumped up at last!

123
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,640
And then...

124
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,310
Apron. A naked apron, 5 prizes.

125
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,340
Naked (image) Apron!!

126
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,120
It's gonna be ok!

127
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,000
Morning.

128
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,740
Nasubi asleep

129
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,940
He has awoken!

130
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,620
Good morning.

131
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,190
It's the morning of the 6th day.

132
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,890
On the first day we left Nasubi with a notebook...

133
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,090
Nasubi's Prize contest diary!

134
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,970
"Denpa Shonen Prize life contest ..."

135
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,390
"This insane and unreasonable challenge has begun"

136
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,750
"I'm also naked..."

137
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,970
"I should make an effort to "enjoy" every day."

138
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,100
1 million yen, huh...

139
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,020
Let's aim for 1 million yen!

140
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,040
Let's listen to the radio

141
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,730
Power on!

142
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,820
Right at that moment!

143
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,890
Please write to us, saying "I want a guitar, a red guitar!"

144
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,940
A Present giveaway ♥

145
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,030
But...

146
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,350
He didn't notice...

147
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,880
After missing an opportunity, he focuses his time On writing postcards for competition entries.

148
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,060
Then...

149
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,440
Telephone call!

150
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,920
A winning prize call?

151
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,880
Hello, Nasubi speaking.

152
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,480
"Hello"

153
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,500
"Is this Nakagawa's telephone number?"

154
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,640
No it's not.

155
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,920
Wrong number phone call

156
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,520
"I'm sorry, I have wrong telephone number"

157
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,960
"I wonder how it feels to hear:"

158
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,420
"Hello, this is Nasubi"

159
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,060
Then...

160
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,460
Suddenly, he starts doing sit-ups.

161
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,070
Also stretching.

162
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,720

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,240
"I must decline it"

189
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,170
But...

190
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,230
"Your voice is very cute, we've talked alot huh"

191
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,230
haha, really?♥

192
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,650
"When I realized, we had talked for 30 minutes"

193
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,320
Then...

194
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,040
"If you like, I can come to your house and discuss it"

195
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:04,900
HUH?

196
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,770
Me, to your place? ♥

197
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,630
"I cannot meet with her in this situation..."

198
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,890
Uh... It seems a little difficult...

199
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,730
"You don't want me to see your home?"

200
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,650
Uh.. yeah, no its not like that but kind of, umm...

201
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,100
"OK, sorry to have bothered you, Good bye"

202
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,030
Thank you, Goodbye.

203
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,420
"That was a dangerous situation"

204
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,610
A few days later.

205
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,570
As usual, Nasubi is writing postcards

206
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,340
Knock!

207
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,310
Knock!

208
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,800
Someone came!

209
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,490
Special delivery?!

210
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,590
My body's stiff...

211
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,340
Ah, I need to sign?

212
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,760
Hey something came

213
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,360
Great!

214
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,480
It's here!!

215
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,130
"I did it! I won a prize contest! This is my first prize"

216
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,460
My first WIN !

217
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,320
"Just like Gold Medalist Kyoko Iwasaki"

218
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,290
"This is the happiest moment of my life!!"

219
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,250
Can you feel my stubble against you~?

220
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,620
What did he win?

221
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,190
"12 pots of Fiber Jelly by Kikkoman!!"

222
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,030
Let's eat!

223
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,580
Tastes good!

224
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,520
"These days when I hear something outside"

225
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,500
"Oh?! Is it a special delivery?"

226
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,400
At that time!

227
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,840
Knock!

228
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,750
Knock!

229
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,710
Special delivery?!

230
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,670
It's the Postman

231
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,310
POST MAN♥

232
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,320
"Yeah!!! I won something again"

233
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,600
You should put a nameplate outside

234
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,880
Ah, Ok I understand.

235
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,150
He was being advised to write his name on the mailbox.

236
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,480
What the heck, I thought I won something.

237
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,700
That old geezer Postman...

238
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,210
"Come on Postman!"

239
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,920
"You should say;
'Thank you for writing so many postcards every day'

240
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,220
A few days have passed.

241
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,530
Suddenly, a strange pose.

242
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,010
"I feel like trying to do a handstand"

243
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,940
"I dented the wall a little"

244
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,320
Today, Nasubi focuses on writing letters.

245
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,120
Then...

246
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,320
Knock

247
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,400
Knock

248
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,410
Did he win?

249
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,910
Hello, sorry to keep you waiting

250
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,600
Huh?

251
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,180
Here is the Ramen

252
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,630
W-w-whats this?

253
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,100
Stir fried Vegetables

254
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,860
The fee is 1700 yen please.

255
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,050
Err, I don't have any money...

256
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,900
Isn't this OOO, Mr.XXX ?

257
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,020
No... I didn't order it.

258
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,620
I'm sorry, I have the wrong address

259
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,160
He left the nice smell of fried vegetables and ramen...

260
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,500
But the delivery man is gone...

261
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,600
Sigh~

262
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,370
"Cruel"

263
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,050
"God has given me a fate too cruel !!"

264
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,340
Furthermore ...

265
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,640
Telephone call!

266
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,730
Is this time a winners notification !?

267
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,120
Hello?

268
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,290
It was a silent prank call.

269
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,210
"Is my life cursed?"

270
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,720
Let's eat Fiber Jelly!

271
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,170
To lift his mood, he eats one of the last remaining Jelly.

272
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,880
Another telephone call!

273
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,210
Hello?

274
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,560
"Thank you for entering into the prize draw for
Tochigi Koshikari (Rice variety)"

275
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,340
"We have selected you as a winner!"

276
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,700
Really?

277
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,930
"Yes ♥"

Thank you

291
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,440
Is it Rice?!

292
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,120
It's Rice ♥

293
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:54,480
Nasubi, carrying the rice, initiates the winning dance.

294
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,060
5kg of Rice GET!

295
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,300
I did it

296
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,140
Ah...

297
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,670
He noticed something...

298
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,420
"I don't have a pot."

299
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,370
Then...

300
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,520
*Crunch Crunch*

301
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,740
He eats the raw Rice.

302
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,120
But

303
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,810
I can't eat this...

304
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,950
What will you do Nasubi?

305
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,850
I have a valuable item I can put it in...

306
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,600
Put it in?

307
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,340
This is!

308
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,100
"I can put rice in the empty Fiber Jelly package"

309
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,930
"I'll put hot water in and see what happens"

310
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,150
"Let it soak overnight and hope for something good."

311
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,650
Please, even if it's only Rice gruel,
help make this into something!

312
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,800
The next morning

313
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,060
But did Nasubi's experiment succeed?

314
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,660
"It's terrible."

315
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,090
I'm sorry but..

316
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:24,120
I think this is a bit of a failure.

317
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,100
Experiment failed

318
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,140
The next day

319
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,380
Nasubi suddenly thinks aloud...

320
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,280
What if I warm up the sides?

321
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,960
I wonder if this is a good idea?

322
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,820
Gas stove

323
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:47,540
"I placed it near the gas stove to warm the water"

324
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:52,030
"What effect will this heat have on the experiment?"

325
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,890
Nasubi attempts this critical experiment.

326
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,770
Then 3 hours later...

327
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:05,800
But you know what, I'm pretty doubtful about this...

328
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,130
And the result is!?

329
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,820
Hold on...

330
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,570
What's this?

331
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,820
Fiber Jelly straw

332
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,700
It looks like watery cooked rice?

333
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,690
Have a look

334
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,520
Experiment Success !!

335
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,980
It's good!!

336
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,870
"God has given a helping hand and saved me once again!"

337
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,520
Yes!

338
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,830
YES!!

339
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,800
And then!

340
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,550

341
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,580

Thank you for delivering

344
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,970

An illustrated quiz contest.

350
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,270

However...

361
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,800
He seem to be confused

362
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,550
About this...

363
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,980
It's canned food...

364
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,140
Meat sauce

365
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,860
"I don't have can opener."

366
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,910
These are the prizes from Feburary.

367
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,050
To reach the 1 million Yen goal he needs
another 985,140円

368
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,780
Nasubi in March

369
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,320
This is the list of entries made in March.

A total of 6,541 entries.

371
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,260
This is my once a day luxury.

372
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,230
Nasubi enjoys his watery rice dinner.

373
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,010
He soon finishes his dinner.

374
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,430

414
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,100
Dinner time

415
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,590
Tastes delicious.

416
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,590
Riding bicycle while eating dinner...

417
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,420
I'm so happy right now ♥

418
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,280
Nasbi enjoys eating the watery rice from the Jelly container.

419
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,880
Then...

420
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,130
He compares the Jelly and the Sake containers.

421
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:42,480
Using the pen, Nasubi begins work on the Sake can.

422
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,330
I've made a clean opening on the top...

423
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,020
And then...

424
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:53,180
I did it! You need to try these ideas out, look!

425
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,470

428
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,820

431
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,990
Spaghetti set unopened.

432
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,990
Until now, he has been unable to conquer the spaghetti.

433
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:32,330
"Who else on Earth can use a single can
at such a high level technique..."

434
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,390
"Is it only me I wonder?"

435
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,300
As always he is writing entries diligently.

436
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,930
But recently Nasubi has a small desire...

437
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,220
"I want something with the rice!!"

438
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,800

Nasubi instantly has several side dishes

467
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,940
He is busy writing postcards again

468
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,980

480
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,630
Nasubi started the challenge naked.

481
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,140
But there are very few prize contest for male underwear

482
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,330
Only ones for used model panties

483
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,850
So he tries to get any underwear regardless.

484
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,760
The naked life is finally over

485
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,340
The time has come for Nasubi to join civilized humanity!

486
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,850
But!

487
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,860
This is a bit harsh...

488
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,140
They're too small for him...

489
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,530
Back to being nude...

490
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,530
Then Nasubi...

491
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,860

497
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,550
"That you can see each individual grain of rice."

498
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,530
There is some sad news to share.

499
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,790

00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
Body wash

752
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,280
In a clean room, there must be a clean Nasubi !

753
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,920
This is the proper etiquette ♥

754
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,600
Ok let's get clean

755
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,300
Nasubi's shower time

756
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,240

757
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,120

765
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,100
Nasubi misses a great chance

766
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,180
Shower complete

767
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,780
"Nothing happened today"

768
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,520
Next day

769
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:18,160

770
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,450

Perfectly ripe Tomatoes ♥

774
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,380
Prize life contest has vegetables!

775
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,420
Immediately eaten...

776
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,600
So gwoood~ ♥♥

777
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,920
Nasubi is deeply moved by the taste of Tomato

778
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,940
But after this he wins
something even more moving!

779
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,260
Knock

780
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,260

Nasubi's deeply moving item is?!

783
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,400
A remote control!

784
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,920
A remote control!

785
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,000
A remote control in the box means....

786
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,920
What is it!?

787
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,980
A TV ♥

788
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,460
"A 14 inch color TV by Victor!"

789
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:14,210
"A 20th century scientific Angel called 'TV'
has descended on the primitive man Nasubi!"

790
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:19,880
Please allow me to breath life
into this TV when I switch it on!

791
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,410
Let's fire it up!

792
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,900
Here we go

793
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,800
Huh?

794
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,580
I can't get channel 1 here?

795
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,780
Education channel?

796
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,260
Nihon TV? Huh?

797
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,960
TBS?

798
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,280
Fuji? TV Ashahi? TV Tokyo??

799
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:03,140
"Why does this round and cute box
show nothing but a sandstorm..."

800
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,700
Nothing left to do but read the manual...

801
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,610
Ah~~~~~~~~

802
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,240
Nasubi has realized something.

803
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,860
"There is no antenna in the room"

804
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:23,280
Nasubi is very shocked and depressed.

805
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:30,400
But those feelings will soon dissapear
when he wins something wonderful after this!

806
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:31,980
Knock

807
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:31,980

00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,740
That item is?!

810
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:42,160
My life has greatly leveled up thanks to this ♥

811
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,200
What is it!?

812
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:49,060
A toothbrush and toothpaste set ♥

813
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,640
Of course, a winning dance!

814
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:01,760
I will brush my teeth for the first time in 3 months

815
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:13,760
"I will settle this 3 month grudge
by brushing with all my might!!"

816
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,300
It started to bleed hahaha ♥

817
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,840
These are the winnings for April

818
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:30,000
The remaining goal is 834,700 Yen

819
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,480
Nasubi in May

820
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,780
These are the entries for May.

A total of 7,369 entries

822
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,180
In the morning Nasubi is writing entries

823
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,780
Then...

824
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:03,900
Knock

825
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:03,900
Knock

826
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,360
He won today!?

827
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:07,050
However...

828
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,660
After this, a first time situation
since the Prize life contest started!!

829
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,760
Sorry to bother you

830
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,760
A man wearing a white coat enters!

831
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,020
I'm just here to check your health

832
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,920
He is a doctor.

833
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:30,200
It's been 3 months since the start so the staff
have called for a Doctor to check Nasubi's health.

834
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:36,920
Thank you and sorry to have troubled you to come here to this filthy room...

835
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,540
It seems to be a difficult life...

836
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:45,360
"Unexpectedly, a doctor came in
and took my blood pressure..."

837
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:51,660
"He checked out my body and took a sample of blood and urine for the finale."

838
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,840
Ok, we're finished.

839
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,800
Health check up complete

840
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,480
You're always naked?

841
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,020
I'll report the results back to you later

842
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,220
Thank you very much, it's appreciated.

843
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,400
A few days later the report arrived...

844
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:13,780
Absolutely no problems at all,
Nasubi is in good health.

845
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,920
The next day

846
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,960
After seeing the Doctor,
Nasubi continues to write postcards

847
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:21,860
Knock

848
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:21,860
Knock

849
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,700
Sniff

850
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,700
Sniff

851
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,090
It's a leathery smell

852
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,560
Leather smell?

853
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,440
It's very black...

854
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,770
Black?

855
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,120
Shoes! ♥

856
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,760
This week also has a winning dance

857
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:44,840
"Shining black, shining brightly black
I won black leather shoes!!"

858
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:49,980
I must try wearing them!

859
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,990
But suddenly a sad memory is recalled

860
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,840
It was 2 months ago...

861
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,320
Panties ♥♥♥

862
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,840
After winning the used model panties
he was to leave the naked life behind him...

863
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,960
This is harsh...

864
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:08,450
They where too small to wear...

865
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,840
Nasubi returned to the naked life.

866
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,840
Will he be okay this time?

867
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:18,880
Please let them fit!

868
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:25,000
Nasubi will become a civilized man with shoes right now!

869
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,210
They fit!

870
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,290
I have a shoe on!

871
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,210
We have come this far, let me try the left foot too!

872
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:43,330
They fit!

873
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,320
I'm wearing shoes!

874
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,020
Nasubi is wearing leather shoes!

875
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,920
A historical moment!

876
00:52:55,890 --> 00:53:02,130
Wearing black leather shoes
Song by Nasubi

877
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:08,340
"I remember the 'Pantie incident'
and worried it could reoccur..."

878
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:13,300
"But these are 30cm size and I'm 29cm,
So they are a perfect shoe fit!"

879
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,840
Then!

880
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:18,560
Knock

881
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:18,560
Knock

882
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,520
Portable Barbecue set! ♥

883
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,370
Give me the meat!

884
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:29,200
"From Mountain or Sea,
Anything I win now can be easily cooked!"

885
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,450
The next day

886
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,140
No winnings today.

887
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:40,360
But Nasubi has a new concern...

888
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,600
"I have noticed a bad thing."

889
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:49,340
"My source of life, Rice,
Has finally reached the bottom of the bag..."

890
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,960
In the beginning, he won 5kg on the 20th day.

891
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,940
Without being able to win rice,
He could not continue the prize life challenge.

892
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:07,020
"I've reached an absolute critical moment that Could lead to the worst situation possible."

893
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,180
Dear lord, please don't abandon me now.

894
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,380
I'm begging you!!

895
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,380
The next day

896
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:17,740
Knock

897
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:17,740
Knock

898
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,510
A prize!

899
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,400
Nasubi is laughing, is it Rice?!

900
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:25,280
Globe ♥

901
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:32,380
♪ The country I want to visit is~ ♪

902
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,620
Here♥

903
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,480
Right in the middle of the Atlantic ocean

904
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:45,400
On this day, the inevitable fate has caught up to Nasubi.

905
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,560
Rice bag

906
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,380
"Honorable Rice, are you really going to abandon me?"

907
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,260
Only one portion left...

908
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,030
Today is the last I guess...

909
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,030
"I want to believe it's not true!!"

910
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:06,650
"I want to believe it's not true!!"

911
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,570
"Please, I'm begging! Tell me its not true!!"

912
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,600
Today is really the last...

913
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,310
This is the last of the Rice.

914
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,150
The last...

915
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:23,200
"From the day I received this Rice
I had prepared for a time like this!"

916
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,450
"But the time to part has come so quickly, so easily..."

917
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:31,870
"I don't want this ending, I don't want it at all!"

918
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:36,810
One hour later, the rice is cooked.

919
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,520
This is really the last serving ...

920
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:45,430
Nasubi's once per day enjoyable Rice dinner...

921
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,650
Is a simple pleasure that has now disappeared

922
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,970
It's farewell, but I have to eat it.

923
00:55:54,750 --> 00:56:00,750
Any time there was a Rice prize contest, Nasubi would send numerous entries.

924
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,850
"I wish a Prize life contest miracle would occur!!"

925
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,320
However...

926
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,160
"I have been parted from the Rice for 3 days now..."

927
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,960
I'm hungry.

928
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,400
At that time!

929
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,570
Knock

930
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,570
Knock

931
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,560
Has a miracle occurred!?

932
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:26,610
But...

933
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,270
A free trial English language lesson ticket

934
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,970
A miracle did not occur...

00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:37,110
I don't know what to do with it~ ♪

936
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:38,930
Either way, it's a winning dance.

937
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,520
A free trial English language lesson ticket is ...

938
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:46,650
No good compared to something I can eat right now.

939
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,090
Food...

940
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:53,100
Food is what I want!

941
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:57,070
"Something I can eat,
I want to win anything I can eat !!"

942
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:01,960
The next day

943

Knock

944
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:04,090

Is this time a miracle!?

946
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,870
Hey, hey something came!

947
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:18,910
"In yesterday's diary, It's true that I wrote;
'Anything I can eat...' but..."

948
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:23,580
"Things dont always go as expected
In the prize life contest huh..."

949
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:29,230
It seems I have done it,
You could say I've done it...

950
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:33,180
It's Dog food.

951
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:35,660
Another non miracle.

952
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:37,110
But...

953
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:38,290
It looks good

954
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,040
He wants to eat it!

955
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,620
Then...

956
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,460
However

957
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:50,360
"It's bad..."

958
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:54,960
The next day

959
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:58,140
He wins again today!

960
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,750
But...

961
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:04,490
Please, give me a break!

962
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,120
It's Dog food.

963
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:10,180
Are you trying to turn me into a dog?

964
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,860
I'm not a dog !!!

965
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:18,260
Let's try it out, like a snack

966
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,680
And...?

967
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:27,720
Nice!

968
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,580
A miracle occurred!

969
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,800
And also...

970
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:33,160
There's this many bags!

971
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,910
I'll hold onto this!

972
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:37,830
Woof, Woof, Awoooo~

973
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,850
Today Nasubi is again immersed in writing entries

974
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:42,900
When...

975
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,160
I'm hungry...

976
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,940
I'll have to eat dog food and try my best today!

977
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,900
"Recently, meals have only been dog food and water..."

978
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,380
"I have a pretty authentic dog style diet here..."

979
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:05,160
"I must take extra care so my secrets don't get out."

980
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:09,620
The next day

981
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:19,210
I did it!

982
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:21,280
What happened?!

983
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,840
We have Natto again ♥

984
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,360
It's the second Natto win !

985
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,640
This weeks winning dance

986
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:37,570
It's Nasubi's favorite food... Natto!

987
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,350
But

988
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:43,360
Nasubi has a realisation

989
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:45,880
I don't have any rice...

990
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:52,180
"Without rice it's impossible to make Natto-rice."

991
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,140
I want to eat Natto-rice !!!!!!!!!!!!

992
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,230
Lets eat!

993
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,960
He eats it as it is.

994
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:05,860
Its great ♥

995
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:10,100
This is the taste of human food!

996
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:12,740
Then...

997
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,960
Empty Natto container

998
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:18,420
"I finished them all today."

999
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,070
The next day

1000
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,190
Dog food

1001
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,110
He once again returns to dog food.

1002
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,310
What is it?!

1003
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:35,670
Fruit flavored Jelly ♥

1004
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,270
Look how many there is!

1005
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:44,690
"This win really suits the time of late spring into summer!!"

1006
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,940
He tries it straight away.

1007
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,320
It smells great!

1008
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,500
And then...

1009
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,680
Empty Jelly container

1010
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:01,770
I finished them all ♥

1011
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:03,690
I appreciate the food

1012
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:06,120
He ate them all in a day.

1013
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:08,800
But you know...

1014
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,140
In the end, Jelly is just a dessert

1015
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,250
I'm Japanese, so what I really want is rice.

1016
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,810
Even though I sent alot of entries...

1017
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:20,520
I'm still waiting on a reply for the rice

1018
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:21,750
At that time!

1019
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:24,980
Is it Rice?!

1020
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,450
It's a cosmetic set ♥

1021
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:36,840
"I saw that the entry deadline was approaching for this
Pricey item so my mind said go for it, Cosmetic set."

1022
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:40,630
Nasubi shows an interest in one of the items inside.

1023
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,310
This is...

1024
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:45,710
That is?

1025
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:48,340
Hey this is fun! ♥

1026
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,860
A face pack.

1027
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:54,550
I'll go from handsome to an even more handsome man ♥

1028
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,320
After 10 minuets, the treatment is complete

1029
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,740
Look, it's nice timing

1030
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,200
Dog food

1031
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,760
Nasubi is eating his staple dog food today again

1032
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,810
I've got used to it ♥

1033
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:16,270
Let's have some water...

1034
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:25,600
"I have become completely immersed in this dog food way of living
Naturally, there is the desire to scream out loud."

1035
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,180
What has arrived?

1036
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:33,690
Water purification system ♥

1037
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,540
Will it just fit on?

1038
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:37,520
He attempts to attach it.

1039
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,880
Five minutes later

1040
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,980
Fail.

1041
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,790
Another 5 minuets later

1042
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,860
This time it's on correctly!

1043
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:01,150
The water is coming out nicely!

1044
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:04,950
Let's give it a try

1045
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:05,770
Orange Sake can

1046
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,070
Shall we drink?

1047
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,080
It's GREAT!

1048
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:24,800
But...

1049
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:30,550
I wish I could cook rice with this purified water you know...

1050
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:38,240
My thoughts are only focused on rice....

1051
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:39,730
That's the feelings I have

1052
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:43,100
"I long for a life of human foods..."

1053
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,670
The next day

1054
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:49,710
He won again today!

1055
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,270
Is it the desired rice?!

1056
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,130
It's a mug cup ♥

1057
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,670
Shall we... drink some water? ♥

1058
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:03,580
Oh? what a lovely sound of the water filling the cup!

1059
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,770
Let's drink!

1060
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,110
As expected, it's different!

1061
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,390
However...

1062
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:25,810
With this wonderful water I want to cook some rice,  mug cup!

1063
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,570
My thoughts are only focused on rice....

1064
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,470
At that time!

1065
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,470
It's heavy ♥

1066
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,800
Is it rice this time?!

1067
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,920
It's diet health tea ♥

1068
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:44,740
This is Nasubi's song; Diet & Me

1069
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:48,690
♪ Nasubi, Nasubi, he dont need no diet ♪

1070
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,930
♪ Because he's already sufficiently... ♪

1071
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,490
♪Thin enough as it is you know! ♪

1072
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,310
Are you saying its okay for me to become even thinner?!

1073
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,690
Cheers! ♥

1074
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,880
As expected, he drinks.

1075
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,440
Then...

1076
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:10,580
Tea can be this delicious huh?

1077
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,040
Then...

1078
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:15,140
Diet Tea

1079
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:15,140
Dog food

1080
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:19,640
"I'll use the tea to make up for
The lack of nutrition in the dog food"

1081
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:23,110
"It's probably an ideal menu balance"

1082
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,230
A few days later

1083
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,190
Another standard meal day

1084
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:32,110
With wonderful water in one hand, let's eat!

1085
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:36,550
Today he is not drinking tea, but purified water.

1086
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:41,750
"Thanks to the power of the mug cup, the water tastes even better!"

1087
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:45,660
"If only I could cook some rice with this wonderful water..."

1088
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:47,870
At that time!

1089
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:52,620
Is it finally rice?

1090
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,990
It feels nice and heavy ♥

1091
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:57,240
A high probability of rice!

1092
01:05:57,950 --> 01:06:00,630
It's a knife, fork and spoon set ♥

1093
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:06,300
Of course, there is another winning dance today.

1094
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:10,240
There's so many!

1095
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,120
Yes!

1096
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:16,180
Let's eat!

1097
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:17,940
Dinner continues.

1098
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:22,150
This is like a first class hotel dinner feeling

1099
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,320
To begin, he eats the dog food with a knife and fork

1100
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:32,140
Trying to pierce with the fork is a little...

1101
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:37,480
Impossible.

1102
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,360
Using a spoon should be easy

1103
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:45,710
We can get a good amount with the spoon,
Ah, I knew it. The spoon is great!

1104
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,310
Spoon

1105
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,380
Spoon

1106
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:57,060
"Using a spoon is completely different from a dog, and because of this human self awareness, my prize life contest is resurrected."

1107
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,040
Eating with the spoon is easy!

1108
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:02,640
But at that moment Nasubi thinks...

1109
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:08,360
As I lift my spoon up, I don't want dog food on it...

1110
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:12,580
I wish it was rice.

1111
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:15,150
Rice...

1112
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:18,720
With all my heart, with all my strength, with this spoon!

1113
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:21,600
I want to eat rice like this!

1114
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:30,590
But right now I have no rice.

1115
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:36,310
Right then, Nasubi's prize God reached out to him.

1116
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:42,470
What could be inside with all this weight...

1117
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:46,190
No way...

1118
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,340
No way!

1119
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:54,820
Is this for real?

1120
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,500
Finally...

1121
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:12,420
God has gifted me the power to live

1122
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,990

01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:03,660
Rice time!

1164
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:07,280
I made the Fiber Jelly container into a measuring cup

1165
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,180

Ever since winning the water purification system,
Nasubi has dreamed about cooking rice with that water.

1171
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,640
That wish has been granted

1172
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,860
Let's fire it up.

1173
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:39,860

1174
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:42,990
One hour later.

1175
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,640
The rice is perfectly cooked ♥

1176
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:54,340

1177
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:58,010

1185
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:40,280

01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,110
The next day

1201
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:48,800
Another win!

1202
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,630
I didn't think this sort of thing would come!

1203
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,110
What is it this time?!

1204
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,150
Assorted Ice cream ♥

1205
01:14:56,730 --> 01:14:58,220

"24 Ice cream cups."

1207
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:06,630
Let's eat ♥

1208
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,590
Here, Nasubi notices a severe problem.

1209
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:16,830
"I don't have a freezer..."

1210
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,870
So...

1211
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:23,950

1213
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,340
The next day

1214
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,520
What is it this time?

1215
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,200
A kettle !

1216
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,540
"Easy press Kettle by Kyusu"

1217
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:38,870
Today Nasubi is enjoying his cooked rice.

1218
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:44,260
Tastes good, I'm grateful

1219
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:47,900
But after this, a win that he will appreciate even more!

1220
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,350
That precious gift is...?

1221
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:58,150
"I have won a prize that carries the smell and charm of the sea!!"

1222
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,380
It's Seaweed ♥

1223
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:03,430
The familiar winning dance

1224
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,000
It's a Nasubi seaweed sandwich... Kinda...

1225
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,280
Let's eat!

1226
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,280
It's great!

1227
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,470
Nasubi has a flash of inspiration!

1228
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:34,110
"Seaweed + Rice = Onigiri"

1229
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:37,120
First, toast the seaweed a little.

1230
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,500
The next step is...

1231
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,780
Shape.

1232
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,590
However, he toasted the seaweed a little too much

1233
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:51,300
It's completely encompassed

1234
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,780
This is nice!

1235
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,140
Let's eat the Onigiri!

1236
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:06,830
"The finest Onigiri of my life"

1237
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:11,710
But on this day, the item Nasubi will be most greatful for in his life will arrive.

1238
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,000
What the heck is this?

1239
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:22,500
It seems like this item wont have much affect on my life

1240
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:24,290
Then

1241
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:26,390
Its a poster...?

1242
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:28,450
Nasubi is a little dissapointed.

1243
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,520
What kind of poster?

1244
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:34,470
"This is a gift from God"

1245
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:37,080
It's a poster of Hirosue Ryoko ♥

1246
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:45,150
"I love Hirosue Ryoko"

1247
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:45,070
Nasubi always wrote his affection for Hirosue Ryoko in his diary as a big fan he would always enter contests for her prizes

1248
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:45,070
"I adore Hirosue Ryoko"

1249
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:45,110
"Hirosue Ryoko is extraordinary"

1250
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:51,060
Nasubi and Miss Hirosue co-starring together!

1251
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:53,110
It's a dream appearance ♥

1252
01:17:53,610 --> 01:18:00,070
How wonderful of you to come to this mans deplorably filthy prize life contest.

1253
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:04,800
It was never my intention to meet you in these circumstances...

1254
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:07,260
I feel terrible for it, I'm sorry.

1255
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,000
Thank you

1256
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,120
Then, Nasubi...

1257
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,830
I must stick it up

1258
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:18,590
Something to pin it with...

1259
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:21,150
There is nothing to pin it with in this room.

1260
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:27,390
Another flash of inspiration!

1261
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:30,270
Rice! I can use Rice!

1262
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,720
How does it look?

1263
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,520
Affixed with rice.

1264
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:38,750
What a special moment, I'm so happy!

1265
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,950
The next day

1266
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:45,480
Nasubi is stood staring at the poster all day long

1267
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:47,270
Then...

1268
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:53,030
I'm going to note all these thoughts in my diary!

1269
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:57,790
"Miss Hirosue Ryoko,
I, Nasubi love you very deeply!!"

1270
01:18:57,990 --> 01:19:02,640
"Now we are living our lives out together..."

1271
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:05,040
How about it Miss Hirosue ♥

1272
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:07,610
The prize is?

1273
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:10,550
Guronsan Plus ♥

1274
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:12,420
Energy drink.

1275
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:16,110
The winning dance

1276
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:21,950
Maximum efficency is here!

1277
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,420
Then, he drinks.

1278
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:32,040
"I guzzled them down two at once!"

1279
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:34,620
Then

1280
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:41,420
After this, Nasubi...

1281
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,890
Hirosue san ♥

1282
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,440
Hirosue arousal!

1283
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,390
Hirosue crisis!

1284
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:56,310
The next day

1285
01:19:57,230 --> 01:20:00,780
He enjoys his once a day luxury dinner time.

1286
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,900
But at that time...

1287
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,980
After this bad omen Nasubi finds himself in a pinch!

1288
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:13,750
That evening at midnight

1289
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,880
Denpa Shonen's Producer enters his room.

1290
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,450
Long time no see

1291
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,500
It's been a while

1292
01:20:56,910 --> 01:20:58,790
At that time Nasubi thought...

1293
01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:00,430
Is it over?

1294
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:02,940
I made a million Yen?

1295
01:21:03,970 --> 01:21:04,940
No.

1296
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,270
SHOCK !

1297
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:07,870
Here

1298
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,030
W-why are you giving me this?

1299
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:13,370
Eye mask

1300
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:15,630
Then

1301
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,090
I can't understand this at all

1302
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,190
Headphones
(loud music)

1303
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:23,880
The producer takes Nasubi outside wrapped in a blanket

1304
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,100
Black leather shoes he won

1305
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:33,420
Ahh~~ outside fresh air!

1306
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:37,310
Its been about 5 months since I've breathed in fresh air

1307
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:38,840
It's nice ♥

1308
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:39,910
Then

1309
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:41,750
Car?

1310
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:44,160
Yay! we're moving! We're moving!

1311
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,810
Road trip

1312
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,930
Being in a car after 5 months!

1313
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,590
However...

1314
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,920
Two hours passed.

1315
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:55,810
I wonder where we are going?

1316
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:58,090
Five hours have passed.

1317
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:00,960
We are going to far, really.

1318
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:04,710
Here, Nasubi says something unexpected...

1319
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:10,060
That reminds me, the African continent still remains, right?

1320
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,800
African continent?

1321
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:14,680
That's bad for a single person.

1322
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:19,840
It's a bad situation for a person to hitch hike across Africa alone you know

1323
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:25,720
As he has been isolated in this show, Nasubi doesn't know about Panyao and is becoming anxious.

1324
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:25,720
TLnote; Panyao is another pair on a separate
Denpa Shounen show that was running at the same time,
where they hitchhike across Africa to Europe
including Takashi Itou from the opening auditions

1325
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:29,440
As it is, my mind has become clouded with anxiety...

1326
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:30,470
Let's sleep.

1327
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,340
But with all this noise I can't sleep even if I want to...

1328
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:36,320
Asleep.

1329
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,670
They have arrived.

1330
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:43,580
The place Nasubi was taken to was...

1331
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:45,850
It's okay to take it off now

1332
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:09,330
"The room atmosphere is pretty much the same, no matter where I look it's the familiar feeling that I got used to for 5 months."

1333
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:15,880
Everything here is the same, so that means...

1334
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:18,770
We just moved house?

1335
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:20,500
Correct

1336
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:24,270
Last month the news media found out Nasubi's address.

1337
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,280
For the principal of fairness to the Denpa Shounen Prize life contest

1338
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,360
The decision to move house was made.

1339
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:35,130
But Nasubi did not know this was being broadcast to TV so the Producer says...

1340
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,970
For renewed luck ♥

1341
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,860
It's for my own benefit then?

1342
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:41,630
Thats right!

1343
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:44,850
"Far too honorable for me."

1344
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:46,300
See ya

1345
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:50,180
Well, it seems like nothing is missing

1346
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,930
Ah, I don't need the cushion...

1347
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,060
Kitchen check.

1348
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:05,800
Everything's here

1349
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,700
Not a single thing changed huh ♥

1350
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:12,430
But after this Nasubi is in a serious pinch!!

1351
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:16,650
Nasubi is looking at everything he has won so far...

1352
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:19,490
Whats wrong!?

1353
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:22,370
This is bad

1354
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,350
There's no rice.

1355
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,440
NASUBI PINCH!

1356
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:38,540
I had some rice, right?

1357
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:40,180
Eh? Am I dreaming?

1358
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,370
A ghost?

1359
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:43,520
At that time!

1360
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,700
The producer appears

1361
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:50,490
Sorry, sorry

1362
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:53,040
I left it in the truck

1363
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:56,810
I was so panicked, give me a break!

1364
01:24:57,150 --> 01:25:01,350
It's okay to forget other things, but you cannot forget the rice !!

1365
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:03,420
No, the truck....

1366
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:05,650
It's not the truck's fault!!!

1367
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:07,490
NASUBI RAGE !!!

1368
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:09,510
Don't scare me like that.

1369
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:11,780
A few days later

1370
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:15,450
In the new room of Nasubi's prize life contest

1371
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:18,290
He continues his diary with renewed determination.

1372
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:23,520
"I have moved to a new home to bring my life better luck"

1373
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:27,310
"My hopes and dreams will depend on the promise of this new land!!"

1374
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:30,700
Nasubi is hyped!

1375
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:32,340
Then...

1376
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:41,380
"The power of the new house is emitting!!
The power of the new room is exploding!!"

1377
01:25:46,130 --> 01:25:48,140
The first new house prize is....?

1378
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,160
Put this there...

1379
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:53,930
Something thin and narrow?

1380
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:57,740
The box mountain is piling up

1381
01:25:59,510 --> 01:26:01,270
Just what the heck is it?

1382
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:09,860
There's quite a few of them, huh.

1383
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:11,610
"Kokuyo" (Office store)

1384
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:18,380
Ah! Did I win the Kokuyo chair and desk set?

1385
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:21,240
Oh! This is nice!

1386
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:26,700
Look at this wonderful, stylish chair I won ♥

1387
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:29,930
Look at this I feel great!

1388
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:32,730
You know...

1389
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:34,980
It's like I'm a CEO now ♥

1390
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:36,910
Two hours later

1391
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:39,760
It's finished!

1392
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,060
Desk assembly complete!

1393
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:44,120
Then...

1394
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:46,730
Mr. Table...

1395
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,030
Thanks for everything up until now.

1396
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:51,080
He says farewell to the small table

1397
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:55,020
"My first win in the new room ~ !

1398
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:57,940
"Kokuyo personal desk & chair!"

1399
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:00,160
Then, Nasubi...

1400
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:04,340
Good evening, I'm Nasubi

1401
01:27:04,530 --> 01:27:06,300
Today's top news story is

1402
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:06,840
He became a news caster.

1403
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:11,090
Err.. About the Yen, it's in trouble and not improving

1404
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:13,710
What the heck am I saying...

1405
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:18,080
I didn't expect the move to increase my luck like this

1406
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:21,060
It's gone up like this!

1407
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:23,310
The move was a big success!

1408
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:26,250
The next day

1409
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:30,520
The new desk has massively increased efficiency

1410
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:34,590
Today, God will smile upon him again.

1411
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:38,750
Another delivery, another delivery!

1412
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:43,600
Uwahh! A precision instrument?!

1413
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,070
"The endless luck of the new house is exploding with power!!"

1414
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:51,130
Primitive man... Has modern technology!

1415
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,350
Automatic translator!

1416
01:27:58,890 --> 01:28:01,780
This is amazing! What did you say!

1417
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:06,880
I will arrive around 8 o'clock, please keep my room reserved.

1418
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:09,410
This is the Japanese

1419
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:13,760
Let's give this a go into English then, here we go!

1420
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:21,940
Let's try French

1421
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:28,780
This is amazing!

1422
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:31,390
Moving was a great success!!

1423
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:32,810
New room Banzai!!

1424
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:36,230
However, Nasubi still one worry...

1425
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:40,080
I can't touch the buttons as my nails are in the way.

1426
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:42,550
My nails have become this long.

1427
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:45,220
Five and a half months of growth!

1428
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:48,160
I need to cut them.

1429
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:53,860
After this the luck of God delivers a wonderful item!

1430
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,940
That wonderful item is...?

1431
01:28:58,140 --> 01:29:01,790
Manicure nail polish ♥

1432
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:06,270
Pretty amazing.

1433
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,080
These are the prizes for June.

1434
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:18,220
550,440 Yen remains until the 1 million Yen goal.

1435
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:24,660

Seaweed

01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:03,970
Desk and chair

1443
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:13,930
He didn't dance for the Translator and
Nail polish as the desk was in the way.

1444
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:18,190
Special Movie

1445
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:24,390
This was never broadcast on TV,
But Nasubi has an original gag.

1446
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:26,260
That gag is...

1447
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,510
Nasubi ! Nasubi !

1448
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:31,760
Nasubi ! Nasubi !

1449
01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:31,680
Nasubi did this almost every day.

1450
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:41,150
Nasubi ! Nasubi !

1451
01:30:44,330 --> 01:30:48,980
It's funny to watch in fast forward also.

1452
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:11,610
For some reason he didn't do it between days 80 ~ 112.

1453
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:59,500
Nasubi's prize life contest will continue...
