Ko-chan.

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,620
You're all packed.

16
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,330
Oh. Thank you.

17
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,640
Crap, it's this late already?!

00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,640
Crap!

Here, here.

20
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,810
This business trip
is for five days, right?

21
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:57,270
Yeah.

22
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,840
I'll make you your favorite
fried shrimp when you get back.

23
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,600
Yeah.

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,470
Take care of yourself.

25
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,380
See you.

26
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,790
Have a nice trip.

27
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,080

Hello.

30
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,360
What time are you coming home today?

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
What?

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,450
Huh?

33
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,140
Isn't this Kohei-san's—

34
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,130
What are you doing?!

35
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,550
I thought it was a call
from your office.

36
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,580
Who was that—

37
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,720
Crap, the bullet train!

38
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,390
I'm off!

39
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,290
Hey, Ko-chan!

40
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,050
Sorry about that.

41
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,400
My office coworker picked
up my phone by mistake.

42
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,450
Yeah.

43
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,600
I see. How did that go?

44
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,640
It's not too hot?

45
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,760
It's fine.

46
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,480
Um...

47
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,420
I'm so sorry. Pardon me.

Please leave your name and message.

Hello, Ko-chan?

55
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,320
Why aren't you home yet?

56
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,100
You could've at least called
to tell me you'd be late.

57
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,390
See you.

58
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,150

Where are you?

61
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,820
Aoi, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,050
Did something happen at work?

63
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,530
Can you come home?

64
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,550
I'm not coming back.

65
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,440
Let's split up.

66
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,520
Huh?!

67
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,900
I'm really sorry.

68
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,170
Hold on a second!

69
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,820
Is it that woman?

70
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,760
Just forget about me!

71
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,770
Wait a second!

72
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,210
Kohei

73
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,050
I'm not coming back.

74
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,380
Let's split up.

75
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,480
Kohei-san.

76
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,800
You forgot this.

77
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,320
Oh, my bad. You saved me.

78
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,340
Thank you.

79
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,710
Say, Kohei-san.

80
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,690
What?

81
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,030
Oh, nothing.

82
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,800
Have a nice day.

83
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,630
You, too.

84
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,470
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,210
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,170
Aoi-san?

87
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,580
Huh?

88
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,690
What's the matter?

89
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,030
You're not quite yourself today.

90
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,130
Hakmada's Assistant
Nonomura Kanae

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,850
Did something happen?

92
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,670
Actually...

93
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,610
Hakamada Law Office

94
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,610
Kanae-chan is late today.

95
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,360
She's probably having
her hair done nicely.

96
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:14,380

First a cut, then dyeing.

99
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,130
Oh, and maybe a perm,

100
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,030
and a hair-pack, too.

101

Office landlord
Toyama Yoshie

102
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,980
All that?

103
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,550
Makes me tired just hearing about it.

104
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,800
It's spring, the time for
a change in your image.

105
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:21,860
Bound to draw attention
Best of spring hair

106
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,130
The one who really needs
an image change is this guy.

107
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,520
You can say that again.

108
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,410
He said he's growing out his
sideburns or something.

109
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,990
Really?

110
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,660
Sorry I'm late!

111
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,420
Please.

112
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,170
Huh?

113
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,300
I thought you went to beauty salon.

114
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,270
I did. Sensei?

115
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,810
But nothing's changed.

116
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,140
She actually looks worse.

117
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,020
Sensei, I brought a client with me.

118
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,210
Attorney
Hakamada Yukio

119
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,410
I understand now.

120
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,220
Your husband cheated on you,

121
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,260
then decided to separate from you.

122
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,450
So, Aoi-san, what do you plan on doing?

123
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,230
I... just want to know the truth.

124
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,230
What more truth do you need?

125
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,690
He has another woman
and wants to separate.

126
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,990
End of story.

127
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,020
Yoshie-san.

128
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,440
It's spring after all.
People change in spring.

129
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,440
But, we lived together
for two whole years.

130
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,670
Then he calls me
to say goodbye?

131
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,880
I don't understand it.

132
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,680
Do you still feel attached to him?

133
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,470
"Attached," huh?

134
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,050
I just want a proper explanation.

135
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,790
Because if he's dumping
me for that woman,

136
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,190
then, I'll...

137
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,730
Divorce him, and sue
him for compensation?

138
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,060
Yes.

139
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,500
But...

140
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,100
But?

141
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,530
But to divorce...

142
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,070
we'd have to be officially married.

143
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,420
What?

144
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,050
But, you're husband and wife, right?

145
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,070
You've been married for two years...

146
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,690
but not legally married?

147
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,180
You're out of touch.

148
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,170
It's something called
"common-law marriage."

149
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,700
Common-law marriage.

150
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,290
Simply put, it's not an officially
documented marriage.

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,740
But... why?

152
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,340
Well...

153
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,370
There's a lot of that nowadays.

154
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,520
Husband and wife can be
independent of each other,

155
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,200
there are no in-laws
they have to endure.

156
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,980
It's quite casual.

157
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,800
A casual marriage...

158
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,090
the end of the world is near.

159
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,660
But if they're not in
an official registry,

160
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,550
can she still sue for compensation?

161
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,820
Forget it.

162
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,440
What a disappointment.

163
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,050
That's too bad.

164
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,630
No, that's not the case.

165
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,300
Then...

166
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,840
Even without legal registration...

167
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,500
you can still receive compensation.

"Two wives" in a heroic battle!

170
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,990
Ordinarily, common-law marriages have
aspects in common with legal marriages.

171
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,280
In other words, they have the
obligation of mutual cooperation,

172
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,960
Obligation of mutual cooperation

173
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,960
Obligation of mutual fidelity

174
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,610
and the obligation of mutual fidelity.

175
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,960
If we can prove that you two were
living together in common-law marriage,

176
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,270
then it's possible to sue for compensation,
just as if you were legally married.

177
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,280
I see...

178
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,020
But, how can she prove that it
was a common-law marriage?

179
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,010
There are two aspects.

180
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:46,420
Aspects proving common-law marriage

181
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,040
Number one.

182
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,090
The couple is eventually
planning to register the marriage.

183
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:46,420
The couple is eventually planning to register the marriage.

184
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,050
Number two.

185
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,110
They are living together
as husband and wife.

186
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:46,420
They are living together as husband and wife.

187
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,420
Then, yes.

188
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,150
We both planned on getting
legally married,

189
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,800
and we lived together
as husband and wife.

190
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,390
So, we need proof of those things.

191
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,010
Proof?

192
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,880
The most effective proof would be documents
with both your names on them.

193
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,400
For example,
a certificate of residence,

194
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,730
with one of your names
listed as "head of household."

195
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,470
That is, one of you listed as head of household,

196
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,470
Head of Household: Hirano Kohei
Name: Hirano Kohei
Relationship: Self

197
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,700
Head of Household: Hirano Kohei
Name: Nishijima Aoi
Relationship: Wife (unregistered)

198
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,010
and the other listed as
"unregistered wife or husband."

199
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:07,140
Relationship: Wife (unregistered)

200
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,470
We have separate
certificates of residence.

201
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,080
Then how about an
apartment rental agreement?

202
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,440
Apartment Rental Agreement

203
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,840
Is the rental agreement
in both your names?

204
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:19,220
Renter name(s): Hirano Kohei
Nishijima Aoi

205
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,480
No.

206
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,020
He moved into the apartment
where I was already living.

207
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,450
I see...

208
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,490
Then, is there anyone who can prove
that you two were husband and wife?

209
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,780
For example, your respective parents,

210
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,990
or friends, or people at work?

211
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,100
I never introduced him to my parents...

212
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,210
I've never met his friends, either.

213
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,610
My husband is always
away on business trips.

214
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,510
There's no proof, then.

215
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,610
You've got no proof whatsoever, then.

216
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,120
Thank you for waiting.

217
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,270
I'm Umemoto, freelance investigator.

218
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,330
Freelance Investigator
Umemoto Kurumi

219
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,310
We weren't waiting, particularly.

220
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,100
Oh?

221
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,130
Didn't I hear you say there's no proof?

222
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,900
I said that.

223
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,630
If you need solid proof,

224
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,270
see Iron Spy Woman: Marilyn,
season 10 episode 9.

225
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,270
Iron Spy Woman
Marilyn

226
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,220
You were careless.

227
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,850
Because the proof is
always in one's memories.

228
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,480
Reflect, and there
you'll find the proof.

229
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,750
Bang!

230
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,900
What?

231
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,440
Where? Where?

232
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,750
It's in my memories?

233
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,820
That's right.

234
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,890
You lived together for
two whole years, right?

235
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,900
Follow your memories, and you'll
definitely find something.

236
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,610
Come to think of it...

237
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,500
Would a photo in a wedding dress
count as proof?

238
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,600
Was there a wedding ceremony?

239
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,100
No, we didn't have a ceremony,

240
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,770
but we wanted a keepsake photo.

241
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,900
That would work as proof.

242
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,930
Also, there's a written pledge.

243
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:50,940
A written pledge?

244
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,610
Yes.

245
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,050
We wrote down three articles we
pledged to keep as husband and wife.

246
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,050
Three articles for husband and wife
1. Living expenses are half and half.
2. No interfering in each other's work.
3. Never forget love and respect.

247
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,550
We could use that, too.

248
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,580
There's more, isn't there?

249
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,020
In your sweet memories as a couple.

250
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,560
There's a calendar with
both our schedules on it.

251
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,250
That's good.

252
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,800
I also have his-and-hers tea cups.

253
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,120
Okay.

254
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,550
You found them.

255
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,390
In your "sweet memories"!

256
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,700
Anyway, you have to gather
as much evidence as you can.

257
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,900
Yes.

258
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,810
And Umemoto-san,

259
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,730
please investigate the
husband's adultery.

260
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,950
Roger.

261
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,120
Aoi-san.

262
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,370
Hakamada-sensei will help,
I assure you.

263
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,480
Yes.

264
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,430
Come in.

265
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,810
Pardon me.

266
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,760
Done moving yet?

267
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,520
Yes, thank you for your help.

268
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,720
We're having your inaugural ceremony
on a Monday, two weeks from now.

269
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,060
Yes. sir.

270
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,770
Company President
Fujioka Shigeru

271
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,370
You, the young newbie,

272
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,010
were recommended
before all your seniors.

273
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,410
So, get ready for some turbulence.

274
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,260
As we've discussed before,

275
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,080
don't get yourself into any hot water,

276
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,860
No mistakes or any kind of trouble
you need to be rescued from.

277
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,450
I am fully aware of that.

278
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,310
I have risen to my position
thanks to you, President.

279
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,760
Thank you very much.

280
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,580
By the way, Tomomi called me.

281
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,430
She's worried you might cheat on her.

282
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,530
She has nothing to worry about.

283
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,170
I can trust you?

284
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,670
Of course.

285
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,780
Huh?

286
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,810
It's gone.

287
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,090
It's gone.

288
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,770
Why?

289
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,330
The teacups, too.

290
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,740
Gone.

291
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,870
Ko-chan...

292
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,590
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

293
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,180
Please check the number and try again.

294
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,310
I'm sorry.

295
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,410
No.

296
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,630
Please.

297
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,580
All of his things were gone

298
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,050
when I got home from work last night.

299
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,330
All of his things?

300
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,860
What about the evidence?

301
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,890
Do you have any stored
data on your computer?

302
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,560
Oh.

303
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,010
Documents

304
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,010
Finances

305
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,010
Hairstyles (1)

306
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,010
Hairstyles (2)

307
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,010
Photos

308
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,010
Videos

309
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,240
This folder is empty.

310
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,240
How could this happen?

311
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,230
It seems he took more than
just his own belongings.

312
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,620
What do you mean?

313
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,400
Just looking at this room alone,

314
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,460
there's no indication
a husband lived here.

315
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,840
In other words,

316
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,190
Kohei-san erased every
trace of himself from here.

317
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,210
This can't be happening.

318
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,080
Perhaps Kohei-san is
knowledgable about the law.

319
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,850
What?

320
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,190
He took a mitigating course of action,
in order to avoid getting sued by Aoi-san.

321
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,280
That would be my guess.

322
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,490
Ko-chan would do that?

323
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,900
Why?

324
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,280
What now, Sensei?

325
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,730
We can't prove the common-law marriage.

326
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,770
This is going to be difficult.

327
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,920
Umemoto-san?

328
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,490
Things are getting complicated.

329
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,000
Complicated?

330
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,140
Look at this.

331
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,450
I knew it.

332
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,920
So, she's his illicit partner?

333
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,060
No. She's not.

334
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,820
Who is, then?

335
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,650
This woman's name is Hirano Tomomi-san.

336
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,820
She is Hirano Kohei-san's legal spouse.

337
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,960
What?!

338
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,790
Huh?

339
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,200
Which means,

340
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,850
Hirano Kohei-san's illicit partner...

341
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,470
is you, Aoi-san.

342
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,680
Me?

343
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm the illicit partner?

344
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,070
Wait a second. What does that mean?

345
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,550
Investigation Report

346
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,790
Kohei-san works at Fuji House Tech,

347
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,370
at the main office in Nagoya.

348
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,020
Employee Profile

Name: Hirano Kohei
Division: Fuji House Tech Nagoya, Main Office

349
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,790
For half of the month,

350
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,170
he would come to
Tokyo on business trips.

351
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,030
"He would come to Tokyo"?

352
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,800
You mean he'd go from Tokyo, right?

353
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,530
No, that's not what I said.

354
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,660
It's the opposite.

355
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,370
On one of these trips to Tokyo,

356
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,500
he met you, Aoi-san,

357
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,990
and entered a common-law
marriage with you.

358
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,630
It started two years ago, right?

359
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,880
Yes.

360
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,780
Subsequently, he met
Tomomi-san in Nagoya,

361
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,460
and got legally married to her.

362
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,770
Name: Tomomi | Wife | Married March 4, 2013

363
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,290
And that was one year ago.

364
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,880
Wife | Married March 4, 2013

365
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,870
But, Aoi-san is his wife...

366
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,620
Is this bigamy?

367
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,540
In addition,

368
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,490
Tomomi-san is the daughter
of the company president.

369
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,710
The president's daughter?

370
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,420
Maybe the marriage paid off.

371
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,380
In two weeks,

372
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,110
he's getting promoted to an executive
position at Fuji House Tech's Tokyo Branch.

373
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,830
I understand.

374
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,270
For the sake of his promotion,

375
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,000
he had to eradicate his double life.

376
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,400
That's why asked you for a separation.

377
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,440
That's how it is.

378
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,110
Good job. You're smart.

379
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,180
Anyway, I have to go now.

380
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,760
This is no longer an issue
of simple adultery.

381
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,810
Are you all right, Aoi-san?

382
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:19,390
I've been fooled, all this time.

383
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,280
And I believed him.

384
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,010
I can't forgive him.

385
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,210
This is too horrible!

386
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,390
Everyone.

387
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,830
We got a new client.

388
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,140
Her husband is cheating on her,
and she wants to sue him for compensation.

389
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,730
She even has photos taken by a private
detective agency to present as evidence.

390
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,760
You scored.

391
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,640
Two jobs back to back.

392
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,720
I think I can expect rent
payment this month.

393
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,730
Where is the client?

394
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,800
Oh. Whoops.

395
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,870
Please come in!

396
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,220
This way.

397
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,740
Please come in.

398
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,380
Kohei's wife
Hirano Tomomi

399
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,580
She looks familiar.

400
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,760
You.

401
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,510
Are you Nishijima Aoi?

402
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,790
I am, so what?

403
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,210
What was that for?

404
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,620
Take your hands off my husband!

405
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,470
That's my line!

406
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,790
I'm his wife!

407
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,870
I'm his wife!

408
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,610
How could you be his wife?

409
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,360
You can't be his wife!

410
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,270
This is getting good!

411
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,900
Sensei, you have to stop them!

412
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,370
Please calm down, both of you.

413
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,180
Shut up!

414
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,400
Listen, Ko-chan is...

415
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,220
"Ko-chan"?

416
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,670
Who are you to call him "Ko-chan"?

417
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,740
You're a liar!

418
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,840
You bitch!

419
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,140
Insane hag!

420
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,780
Home wrecker!

421
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,380
Please stop it, both of you!

422
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,360
You're both victims here!

423
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,990
Victims?

424
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,970
Don't lump me in with this woman.

425
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:27,000
This woman is my Kohei-san's mistress!

426
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,500
I can prove it!

427
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,370
See, now you know.

428
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,300
This woman is a liar.

429
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,650
You've got it wrong.

430
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:44,550
Aoi-san has been Kohei-san's
common-law wife for two years.

431
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,640
Two years?

432
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,690
Common-law wife?

433
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,120
Kohei-san kept it secret from you,

434
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,590
and married you just the same.

435
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,930
That's a lie.

436
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,330
A lie!

437
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,280
Aoi-san. Tomomi-san.

438
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,270
Show me your left hands.

439
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,600
Left hand?

440
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,400
The same ring?

441
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,100
Aoi-san.

442
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,610
When did Kohei-san give you that ring?

443
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,790
In March, last year.

444
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,220
It wasn't our anniversary or anything.

445
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,550
He just suddenly gave it to me.

446
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,070
What? In March...

447
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,490
That was the same time he
married you, Tomomi-san.

448
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,570
This means Kohei-san

449
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:31,820
gave two identical rings to both
of you around the same time.

450
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:36,210
That way he wouldn't have to keep
switching his own matching wedding band,

451
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,950
whether he was in Tokyo or Nagoya.

452
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,750
You two understand now, right?

453
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,970
He was fooling you both.

454
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,410
You are both his victims.

455
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,010
You're wrong. You're wrong!

456
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,830
That ring is just a coincidence.

457
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,880
My surname is Hirano.

458
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,300
I'm in the public registry as his wife.

459
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,620
But how could you prove
that you're his wife?!

460
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,300
Well...

461
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,190
You see?

462
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,530
I am suing this woman for compensation.

463
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,040
Sensei.

464
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,330
Please be my legal representative.

465
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,330
Unfortunately, I cannot do that.

466
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,250
What?

467
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,600
I am Aoi-san's legal representative.

468
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,130
And you want to sue Aoi-san,
if I took you on as a client,

469
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,180
it would be a conflict of interest.

470
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,950
Also, Aoi-san did not know that
Kohei-san was married to you.

471
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,850
So you cannot sue her for compensation.

472
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,460
I can't?

473
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,690
But, Tomomi-san,

474
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,790
if it is Kohei-san you are
suing for compensation,

475
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,470
I can take you on as my client.

476
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,240
Sue Kohei-san?

477
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,220
Yes.

478
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,220
Tomomi-san.

479
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,560
Care to team up with Aoi-san?

480
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,440
What?

481
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,850
What?

482
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,630
You will cooperate with each other,

483
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,250
and be a team.

484
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,850
What?

485
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,840
What are you talking about?

486
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,360
You saw what happened.

487
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,990
That's right. They'll never be a team.

488
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,190
Are you stupid?

489
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,190
Why would I sue Kohei-san?

490
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,460
Forget it.

491
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,800
I don't need a lawyer like you.

492
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,560
I'll talk to my father,

493
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,260
and I'll sue her for compensation.

494
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,240
Sensei.

495
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,180
I know it was an impossible suggestion.

496
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,240
But to prove that
Kohei-san had two wives...

497
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,530
that would have been the best way.

498
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,950
What was I thinking?

499
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,250
I thought we didn't need
to make it official.

500
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,330
When we first started living together,
I once asked Ko-chan,

501
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,540
"What do we do next?"

502
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,740
Then Ko-chan said...

503
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,120
Marriage Registration

504
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,120
I don't want to be legally
bound by a piece of paper.

505
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,650
Who cares about formality? What matters
is how we feel about each other.

506
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,390
I want to live with you forever, Aoi.

507
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,620
What about you, Aoi?

508
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,430
Me, too.

509
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,270
You see? We're already husband and wife.

510
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,270
Husband and wife?

511
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:41,880
I think of you as my wife.

512
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,580
I would've never imagined
something like this could happen.

513
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,100
We were happy together.

514
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,280
I believed what mattered

515
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,500
was how we felt about each
other, like Ko-chan said.

516
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,460
But, now that I'm in this mess...

517
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:24,350
I don't have a single thing
to prove I am his wife.

518
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,970
I'm so frustrated...

519
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,270
that I have to suffer like this
because of a lousy piece of paper.

520
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,940
Aoi-san...

521
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,500
Kohei-san.

522
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,740
Were you married to this woman?

523
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,540
Of course not.

524
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:55,370
I met this woman
at an attorney's office.

525
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,060
What?

526
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,950
Please, tell me the truth.

527
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,500
I'm sorry.

528
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,330
I have slept with her,

529
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,770
just once, before I married you...

530
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,030
I was drunk when it happened.

531
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,010
But it was only once!

532
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,900
She's being following me ever since.

533
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,900
But she was wearing the
same ring I'm wearing.

534
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,300
She must've seen mine, and bought it.

535
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,700
What's this, then?

536
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:30,540
I went there to ask her
not to follow me any more.

537
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,020
I had to protect my life with you.

538
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,400
So, she was a stalker?

539
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,810
That's right!

540
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,340
She's a stalker!

541
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,220
We'd better report her
to the police, then.

542
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,540
Huh?

543
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,190
Um... let's not do that.

544
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,670
As you know, Tomomi,

545
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:53,470
I just got promoted, and this
is a crucial time for me.

546
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,890
If this this gets out of hand,

547
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,940
it would be distressing
to your father, as well.

548
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,660
How can you not believe me?

549
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,950
Tomomi.

550
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,690
I've only got one thing to say.

551
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,090
The most precious thing
to me in the world...

552
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,910
is you, Tomomi.

553
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,900
I want to live with you forever.

554
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,880
Don't you feel the same way, Tomomi?

555
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,640
Kohei-san.

556
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,810
I can believe you, right?

557
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,930
Of course you can.

558
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,310
Well...

559
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,370
That was a convincing performance.

560
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,350
So that's how you fool those women.

561
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,000
How rude.

562
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,100
Who are you?

563
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,960
My apologies for the late introduction.

564
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,970
I am Nishijima Aoi-san's legal
representative, Hakamada.

565
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,550
So you're the one that
fed Tomomi those stories.

566
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,900
You are a terrible person.

567
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,830
To think you'd selfishly call off your
common-law marriage with Aoi-san,

568
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,860
all because of a promotion.

569
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,280
Common-law marriage?

570
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,740
Is there any evidence of that?

571
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,670
There isn't.

572
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,370
You destroyed the evidence,
as you well know.

573
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,320
This is ridiculous.

574
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,610
There will be consequences
to what you have done.

575
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,150
But I didn't do anything.

576
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:41,110
Soon, you will be officially slapped
with a compensation lawsuit.

577
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,000
Like I said, I didn't do anything!

578
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,360
Common-law marriages are certainly
precarious, aren't they?

579
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,420
Yes. I'm thoroughly convinced
they are, thanks to this case.

580
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,530
That's my line!

581
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,530
What?!

582
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,530
Take your hands
off my husband!

583
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:03,900
But in this episode,
the two women team up, right?

584
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,900
Editor at Tokiwa Publishing
Tabata Misato

585
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,360
That's right.

586
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,370
Can something like that happen?

587
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,980
Well, you see...

588
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,800
There is no other way.

589
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,970
Cafe waitress
Mizutani Sara

590
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,920
I'm the wife. Nice to meet you.

591
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,130
I'm also the wife. Nice to meet you.

592
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,680
Oh no, we can't join hands.

593
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,080
Our hands...

594
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,460
please lend me your hand.

595
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,850
You'd better not see this.

596
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,200
Help!

597
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,680
Somebody stop us!

598
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:37,260
Hakamada Law Office

599
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,740
Sensei.

600
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,710
I still think it's impossible
for them to team up.

601
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:52,050
How do you plan to convince Tomomi-san?

602
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,380
I don't know.

603
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,790
All I know is...

604
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,840
I want to help them both.

605
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,770
Kanae-san.

606
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,390
I want to see Aoi-san's
apartment once more.

607
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,790
Huh?

608
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,220
What are you looking for?

609
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,360
I don't know.

610
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,310
What?

611
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,260
Is it possible to perfectly extinguish

612
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,600
every trace of living
together for two years?

613
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,750
What is this?

614
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,210
Oh... that's Haccho miso paste.

615
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,740
I see.

616
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,850
Sensei.

617
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,280
Wait just a second...

618
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,270
That's my underwear drawer.

619
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,660
Oh. I understand.

620
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,270
Sorry...

621
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,990
May I use your bathroom?

622
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,800
Please do.

623
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,560
He's an unusual man.

624
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,530
Oh. Isn't he?

625
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,270
I feel better now.

626
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,960
Sensei, did you find a clue?

627
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,740
I found several.

628
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,900
What?

629
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,890
What do you want from me?

630
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:28,230
Are you still trying to team
me up with her?

631
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,800
Yes.

632
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,910
I know I'm overstepping my bounds,

633
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,760
but you and she are both victims.

634
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,840
I believe Kohei-san.

635
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,340
I see.

636
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,340
In that case...

637
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,480
let me confirm one last thing.

638
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,070
Confirm?

639
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,670
Concerning the photo you had the
private detective agency take.

640
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:00,410
That photo was dated March 6, correct?

641
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,510
It was. So what?

642
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:09,400
That was day that any trace of Kohei-san
vanished from Aoi-san's apartment.

643
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,970
What?

644
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:15,770
So you're saying Kohei-san
hid the evidence?

645
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,980
The final decision is up to you.

646
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,010
Think about it calmly.

647
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,920
By the way,

648
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,820
I will be presenting your husband with
a compensation lawsuit tomorrow.

649
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,730
It will be at your husband's
office, at 2:00PM.

650
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,060
Oh, there's one more thing.

651
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,460
The toilet paper you use at home.

652
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:50,510
Is it ultra soft,
two-ply "Happiness"?

653
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,710
It is... so?

654
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,300
Aoi-san. Are you okay?

655
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,890
Yes.

656
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:22,530
This is your first time seeing
Kohei-san since then, right?

657
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,610
Yes.

658
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,070
Shall we go?

659
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,780
Where's Tomomi-san?

660
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,420
I firmly believe she will show up.

661
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:47,290
Tomomi-san's not here.
I was afraid of that.

662
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,780
Have fun while you still can.

663
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,980
Well, I'm glad for him.

664
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,710
We'll see how it goes.

665
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,390
I'm counting on you, starting today.

666
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,420
Yes.

667
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,340
Hirano-san.

668
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,250
There are people here to see you.

669
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,450
To see me?

670
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,490
Sorry to interrupt while you're busy.

671
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,990
I have urgent matters

672
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,660
to discuss with you, Hirano-san.

673
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,450
You shouldn't show up
at work, it's indecent.

674
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,990
"Indecent"?

675
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,670
You're in no position
to use that word.

676
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,010
What are you talking about?

677
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:35,130
Anyway, you'd better leave.

678
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,390
What's going on here?

679
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,130
Nothing, sir.

680
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,550
Come in here.

681
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,150
Take a seat.

682
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,880
What the hell's going on here?

683
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,090
Oh well, this is... um...

684
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,200
I'm glad you're here.

685
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,810
This discussion concerns
your daughter as well, Fujioka-san.

686
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:11,240
Tomomi? What would be—

687
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,240
Nothing, really.

688
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,540
President, there really is nothing.

689
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,350
Let's hear what you've got to say.

690
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,760
Hirano-san is a bigamist,

691
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,410
one of them by common-law marriage.

692
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,110
Bigamist?

693
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,260
I don't understand. Please explain.

694
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:37,020
He entered into a common-law marriage
with Nishijima Aoi-san.

695
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,630
He kept it secret,

696
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:42,930
and married your
daughter, Tomomi-san.

697
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,020
What?

698
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,140
President. This is an outrageous lie.

699
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,780
He took advantage of his
frequent business trips.

700
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,290
One half of the month he spent
with Aoi-san in Tokyo.

701
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,150
And the other half of the month he spent
with Tomomi-san in Nagoya.

702
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,930
He was living a double life.

703
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,990
You have no proof of this
trumped-up nonsense!

704
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,630
I found proof.

705
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,640
What?

706
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,830
This.

707
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,060
What the hell is that?

708
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,950
It's ultra-soft, two-ply "Happiness."

709
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,440
Sorry to ask,

710
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,240
but do you have some kind
of issue with your rear?

711
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,490
What the hell are you talking about?

712
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,560
I used it, too.

713
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,840
It's so soft, it could be addicting.

714
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,480
It costs 800 yen for just four rolls.

715
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,820
It's super-high-quality toilet paper.

716
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,970
It's a two-ply, scented.

717
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:36,760
It's soft like genuine cotton.

718
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,100
This is ridiculous.

719
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,250
What can you prove with that thing?

720
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,230
You can buy that thing anywhere.

721
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:46,080
He doesn't use anything else.

722
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,810
The problem here is this.

723
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:53,670
You have specified this brand
to Aoi-san, to buy nothing else.

724
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:57,140
And you've made the same specification
to Tomomi-san, haven't you?

725
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,690
That's exactly correct.

726
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,280
We use the same toilet paper at home.

727
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,000
Tomomi.

728
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,890
Tomomi-san.

729
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,460
Kohei-san.

730
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,130
You don't use any other
brand, remember?

731
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:20,060
You seem to be quite
picky with your things.

732
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,280
For toothpaste, you use...

733
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,930
the one with salt granules.

734
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,400
For socks...

735
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,290
Five-toed ones.

736
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,630
For insect repellant...

737
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,480
Forest Aroma.

738
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,510
Pickled plums?

739
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,400
Dipped in honey.

740
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,010
Miso paste?

741
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,370
Haccho miso!

742
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:39,770
This kind of familiarity can't be
gleaned from a one-night stand.

743
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,830
It would be impossible to know unless

744
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,220
you've lived together for a long time.

745
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,500
That does prove

746
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,020
that you have been in marriage
relationships with both of them.

747
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,640
They prove nothing...

748
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,850
There was plenty of other evidence.

749
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:59,080
But you destroyed it all, didn't you?

750
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,120
I did no such thing.

751
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,970
Aoi-san.

752
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,740
What day were Kohei-san's things
taken from your apartment?

753
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,850
March 6th.

754
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,530
So that's what you were
doing in this picture!

755
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,560
Aoi-san.

756
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,160
I'm sorry for the terrible
things I said the other day.

757
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,410
I am, too.

758
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,210
Hirano Kohei-san.

759
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,560
You have wrought serious psychological
anguish on Nishijima Aoi-san.

760
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,180
Hence, you will be sued for five
million yen in compensation.

761
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,180
Compensation Fee Lawsuit

762
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,400
Five mill—

763
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,290
Kohei-san.

764
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,290
I am divorcing you.

765
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,720
Wait a minute—

766
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,550
Hakamada-sensei.

767
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,800
How much can I sue him
for compensation?

768
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,300
For illicit activities,
psychological anguish...

769
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,960
in total, approximately four million yen.

770
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,770
I'll leave it to you.

771
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,350
In that case,

772
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,510
Tomomi-san and Aoi-san's
compensation fees

773
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,060
will total nine million yen.

774
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,060
I don't have that kind of money!

775
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,560
You can use your severance pay.

776
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,380
Huh?

777
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,230
As of today, you are fired.

778
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,090
Huh...

779
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,060
This can't be happening.

780
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:37,250
I will have Tomomi-san's documents
written and mailed out soon.

781
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:41,510
Contact my office with
your new mailing address.

782
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,410
Ko-chan, thanks for the two years.

783
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,510
Aoi.

784
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,420
Goodbye.

785
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,000
Wow.

786
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,700
So the husband lost everything.

787
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,050
And what happened to the two wives?

788
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,900
They've formed a friendship
out of mutual commiseration.

789
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,710
Tomomi-san is one of Aoi-san's
beauty salon clients, now.

790
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,000
So, everything worked out
the way Sensei planned?

791
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,170
That's how it went.

792
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,840
I feel better now.

793
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,810
Hey, that's...

794
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,470
I used it once, now I'm addicted.

795
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,690
You should all try it.

796
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,710
But that's a high quality brand.
It's 800 yen for just four rolls.

797
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,730
Expensive!

798
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,220
Hey, Sensei.

799
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,830
You haven't paid your rent,
and you're spending money on this?

800
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,720
You owe me back wages, too!

801
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,140
But this is really amazing!

802
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,260
Are you saying we're less
important than toilet paper?

803
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,440
No...

804
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,510
Just try it once.
You'll see what I mean.

805
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,670
It's addictive.

806
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:02,000
Ultra soft, two-ply "Happiness."

807
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,520
It gets flushed down
the toilet just the same.

808
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,090
That's true, but...

809
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:21,470
Next episode

810
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,460
Her mother-in-law is awful.

811
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,230
Come on, get on with it.

812
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,900
It's filthy here.

813
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:21,470
Suing the mother-in-law for compensation!

814
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,130
It's a pig sty.

815
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,040
I've endured her this long,

816
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,470
After relentless bullying, the wife takes action!

817
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,470
but I've reached my limit.

818
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,310
We can sue the mother-in-law
for compensation, too.

819
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:27,640
This drama is a work of fiction.
