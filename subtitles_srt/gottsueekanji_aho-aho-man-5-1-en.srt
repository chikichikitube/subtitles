tons and is twice as long as the Aho Aho Rope)

44
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,290
That's still too short!

45
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,620
Why is your tongue sticking out?

46
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,850

They are laughing at you

52
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,700
Yuko are you ok?

53
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,240
I can't breath!

54
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,180
The oxygen will run out soon in this hole

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,260
Just 1 minute left!

56
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,530
Hurry up and do something!

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,460
We won't let you do it!

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,800
What do you think you are doing?

00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,760
Give it more power!

65
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,180

66
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,770
The fuse blew
