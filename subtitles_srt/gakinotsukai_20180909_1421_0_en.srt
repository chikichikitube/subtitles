1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,420
Matsumoto Hitoshi's 55th birthday

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,420
September the 8th

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,850
Come on, drink up

4
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,220
Oh, thank you!

5
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,520
Matsumoto ever said to us

6
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,520
let's talk about all the kind things

7
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,520
Man, it's unbelievably hot today

8
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,520
I'd like to make some compliments

9
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,630
Endo Shozo

10
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,630
Hamada Masatoshi

11
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,630
Matsumoto Hitoshi

12
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,630
Tanaka Naoki

13
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,630
Tsukitei Hosei

14
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:11,960
About what?

15
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,630
About Yoshimoto-zaka

16
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,430
That's the birth of a new idol!

17
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:23,470
It's a group composed of selected Yoshimoto comedians,

18
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:23,470
Yoshimoto-zaka 46

19
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:23,470
produced by Yasushi Akimoto (Nogizaka46 & Keyakizaka46)

20
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,970
I wonder how will it go for they from now on

21
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,270
They're idols

22
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,470
Yeah, newborn idols

23
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,540
Chihara Junior

24
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,540
Kimura Yuichi

25
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,540
[everyone] Good evening

26
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,680
So that's how it looks like, huh

27
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,550
Good evening

28
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,910
How come you knew about this place?

29
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,850
You know, 'cause it's famous

30
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,350
Oh, is that so? Thank you. A place for two?

31
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:40,820
Yes

32
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,350
Master, did someone ever sat in here?

33
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,120
This thing is really...

34
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,390
It does... get in your way

35
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,460
Can I move it away?

36
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,290
Of course you can, do as you please

37
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,160
Someone must have placed this here (before)

38
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,160
He's already acting rude

39
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,600
It's stuck on his mind

40
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,400
Only 10 years ago he would have gone berserk about it

41
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,870
Just because of that?!

42
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,870
Now he has calmed down

43
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,810
I just asked if I could move it

44
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,680
One time he got mad just by looking at a rental k-car

45
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,180
For real?

46
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,220
"Why would I go to a car-rental if they have k-cars?!"

47
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,890
And his face was bright red

48
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:15,790
That's for couples

49
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,160
One time he got really made at some guy who was

50
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,590
Buying a Pocari Sweat at 22:00

51
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,490
Why is that?

52
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,290
He was like "the fuck are you buyin' that at this hour?!"

53
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,530
What the hell, why?!

54
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,860
It was saturday

55
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,270
It felt like that "saturday's just starting" thing

56
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,470
Well, you had your reasons

57
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, it's a matter of timing

58
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,370
It must be a long time since you two know each other

59
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,210
Right?     - Yeah, it's been a long time

60
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,710
Me too, it's been almost 30 years

61
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,020
Since I got to know and work with Downtown

62
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,520
And I surely received lots of kind words from them

63
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
Is that so?

64
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,690
Yeah, really...

65
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,790
From who?

66
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,160
Well, since today's your birthday...

67
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,460
Oh, thank you so much, really

68
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:05,200
September 8th - Matsumoto Hitoshi is 55 y.o.

69
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,530
It's kinda embarrassing but I'm now 55

70
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,200
55 years, man...

71
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,840
So in this timespan...

72
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,340
Today Matsumoto's young colleagues, whom he knows for a long time,

73
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,340
will talk about all the kind words he ever said to them to this day

74
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,340
He said lots of kind stuff to you, right?

75
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,340
Yeah, he told me so many nice things

76
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,010
You remember the first Gaki DVD?

77
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,110
How many years has passed since? Like 10 years...?

78
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,680
You mean our first one?

79
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,450
Yeah the very first one

80
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,980
Which featured the batsu game

81
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,790
From that batsu game, lots of DVDs were made

82
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,390
15 of them, I think

83
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,990
And around the eight volume...

84
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,230
The "Yamazaki vs Moriman"

85
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,230
DVD too    - Yeah, yeah

86
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,330
Was released

87
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,330
Once per year, around June

88
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,700
I got paid for its sales income

89
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,640
And that sum was the same for more than once

90
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,780
Even around when we were
doing the "Moriman Showdown"

91
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,280
I got paid the same amount

92
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,980
And I thought "ohh, that's nice",
then I got a call from Matsumoto

93
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,550
And he told me by phone

94
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,560
"Yamazaki, how's the income
for the Moriman Showdown?"

95
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,190
I was like "Huh? The DVD? Same as always"

96
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,460
And he "What? The same as always?"

97
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,400
"You mean for the Moriman Showdown?" - "Yes, that"

98
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,430
"And it's the same? - "Yes it is"

99
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,570
He said "Oh, I see",

100
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,970
And our call ended

101
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,370
Then, one day

102
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,340
I was doing some stuff
and looked at my bankbook

103
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,150
And I noticed that the same sum I was
been payed through all those years

104
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,650
Has been payed once more the next day

105
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,880
I mean, for the DVD, by Yoshimoto

106
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,720
I thought "What?" and on our next
Gaki session I asked Matsumoto

107
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,630
"You know, I got the same amount payed again"

108
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,430
And when I was about to say
"Could it be a mistake?"

109
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,500
He said "That... you know"

110
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,130
"This is not money meant for us"

111
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,140
"So you have to take it instead"
- that's what he said

112
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,500
And so...

113
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,710
What's that story about?     - Huh?

114
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,710
What do you mean?

115
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,110
I have no idea...

116
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,180
What do you mean?

117
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,280
What do I mean?!

118
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,380
I mean, what I'm saying is that

119
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,090
About the Moriman Showdown DVD, Matsumoto...

120
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,790
You got payed more than usual?

121
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,890
Was it doubled?

122
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,620
It was

123
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,990
You didn't say that

124
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,400
That's the unclear part

125
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,660
I said it

126
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,130
I said the same sum got payed twice

127
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,170
Oh? twice... just say it before!

128
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,370
It was doubled

129
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,370
Now we got it 'cause you said it

130
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,040
Yes, right

131
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,070
It's always like that

132
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,880
He always makes mistakes

133
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,880
when saying good stuff about me

134
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,880
It was an important part too

135
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,080
That was the core

136
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,020
It's always like this, today too

137
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,820
Now I get it

138
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,790
What are you doin' on Ochiken?

139
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,690
note: short nickname for "rakugo kenkyuu kai" - rakugo research club. (ochi = raku)

140
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,790
Don't call it "Ochiken"!!

141
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,850
He did it again

142
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,060
I hate that nickname!

143
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,790
He always fucks up each good talk about me he's doing

144
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,260
Did I make mistakes? I was careless

145
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,760
Now it makes sense

146
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,460
Sorry

147
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,960
So, it was doubled?     - Yeah, same sum twice

148
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,970
I got the same sum payed twice

149
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,600
And that's because Matsumoto-san
made it possible, right?

150
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,640
But say it, man...      - I got what you mean

151
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,940
You got it, right?     - Sorta

152
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,940
I mean, he was not the type of person to get it himself

153
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,210
He didn't try to understand it      - That's right

154
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,020
Did it really happen?

155
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,380
It's real     - I see

156
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,390
And that's because Matsumoto told you so

157
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,050
Yeah, he told me that

158
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,060
Yes, I did say that

159
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,820
See?

160
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,660
I said that wasn't money me and Hamada deserved

161
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,560
It was the fruit of Yamazaki's hard work alone

162
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
And so we didn't need that payment anymore

163
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,400
No matter how many DVDs we sold

164
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,230
I told that to manager Okamoto

165
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,500
And he said "got it", and so did our agency

166
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,540
But I thought "will he notice it?"

167
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,310
And so I got them to deposit the sum on his account

168
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,380
To confirm that I asked him that     - I see

169
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,110
On the phone, about the income

170
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,780
And he was like "nothing changed"

171
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,320
And thought "that's not good"      - I see

172
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,390
If that would have happened

173
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:54,590
I'd be like "Well, I'll get Hamada fired from this company"

174
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,290
Hamada?

175
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,760
Why me?

176
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,900
You'd place all the blame on him

177
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,230
Why it has to be me?

178
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,530
That's cause his sense of justice is half-assed

179
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,000
When that happened

180
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,540
I thought "man, he's such"

181
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,500
"An honest person"

182
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,740
And I'm not saying it as an excuse

183
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,610
An honest person?

184
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,140
I thought you'd say more

185
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,510
What's that?

186
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,880
An honest person?

187
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,520
His praising skills always suck when it comes to me

188
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,950
I mean----

189
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,890
Wouldn't you think he was honest on that?

190
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,120
Yeah but, "honest"?

191
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,330
I'd say "he's so kind" or something

192
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,990
Yeah, that would have been good

193
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,360
You had to

194
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,030
I mean like, "sincere"

195
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,130
Say "sincere" then!

196
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,970
He was "sincere"     - Yeah, not "honest"

197
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,340
Oh come on! It's the same thing!

198
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,140
Is that the mood this episode's going to have?

199
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,940
It's not our fault he was the first

200
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,510
I mean, the staff already handed me this handkerchief

201
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,910
It's good you're all set up

202
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,510
There's no right timing to use it right now

203
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,950
I just want to wipe off this weird sweat

204
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,350
Well, at least you're sweating

211
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,860
Don't go away, please!

212
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,870
I don't like this    - Don't go

213
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,770
If we're talking about knowing each other...     - Yes?

214
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,970
Me too since I've joined Gaki no Tsukai...

215
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,470
It's been 22 years to this day

216
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,210
You all took care of me

217
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,580
And there were countless times

218
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,020
In which I've received kind words from him

219
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,250
I don't really remember---

220
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,790
I mean, I don't recall

221
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,490
Saying all these kind words

222
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,230
I think you     - You just don't remember saying them

223
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,260
Exactly      - But those who heard them do

224
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,860
For me there was something you said I can't forget

225
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,300
We always have this Gaki No Tsukai
new year's party episode every year

226
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,770
And one time, after it

227
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,310
There were Matsumoto, Housei
and Fujiwara from License

228
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,140
Together with me and the writer Takasu

229
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,810
note: he's talking about Takasu Mitsuyoshi

230
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,150
And we all decided to go have a drink

231
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,650
For how many years have we...?

232
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,120
I think it's like 6 years we're doing this

233
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,860
And so, we were all talking while drinking alcohol

234
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,920
It was about 2 years ago

235
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,260
And as we were normally drinking

236
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,800
Everyone started to talk a bit
about their job-related worries

237
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,900
And we all wanted to talk
to Matsumoto about them

238
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,340
And so we discussed freely
about them, that was the mood

239
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,610
And at that time

240
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,710
I was trying to came in contact with ZIP

241
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,950
note: a japanese morning news/entertainment show

242
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,650
And looking for movies to play in

243
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:45,620
I was kinda trying to find something else besides
comedy, like my animals picture book promotion

244
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,830
I just happen to be in a situation in which
I wanted to have more comedy-unrelated jobs

245
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,630
But I was thinking "am I cut for this?"

246
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,430
I mean, I thought that too about Gaki

247
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,470
I'm always wondering
if I'm actually cut for this

248
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,970
And so, in this period in which
I was shrouded in such worries

249
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,610
Thinking about stuff like
"can I do this job properly?" and such

250
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,880
I asked Matsumoto for some advice

251
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,680
And he told me
"Don't think too much about it, Tanaka"

252
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,750
"Because, Tanaka, I think that..."

253
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:19,820
"The best thing about you is that you always
do the jobs you have to do with utmost effort"

254
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,830
"And you're always doing jobs fit for yourself"

255
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,360
"You're always aware of things,
just like the size of your body"

256
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,570
"You can choose by yourself the clothes
you wear, and you do the same with jobs"

257
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,770
"So don't sweat it about genres or such"

258
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,370
"Wouldn't it be good just to do the jobs you think are best for you?"

259
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,470
That's what he said to me

260
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,410
And it lead me to choose the job I'm doing now

261
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,410
note: Tanaka is currently the host of ZIP

262
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,080
Yes...

263
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,080
I don't remember that...

264
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,320
That's why it's good he could say that now

265
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,150
Yeah, I said the same before

266
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,160
Right, you said it too

267
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,260
Didn't this story start from Endo's bad mouthing?

268
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,230
Did it begin with my bad mouth?

269
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,000
This really good story?

270
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:12,200
Was it when I said the clothes

271
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:12,200
you were wearing didn't fit you?

272
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,650
Well, Endo's case is different

273
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,020
But Tanaka was going through a lot

274
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,590
So I told him to do what he likes to

275
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,790
D-did you remem---

276
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,620
It's not that I clearly remember it
or I forgot about it...

277
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,290
It's just weak

278
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,930
Well, that's how it is inside you

279
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,330
It's surely way stronger inside Tanaka

280
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,240
Man, he just told you about his feelings!

281
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,740
Yeah, I was like "aww, man!"

282
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,540
I mean, there's been a lot of stuff

283
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,140
I think that's a good thing

284
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,480
He lead you, right?
- Yes, it was thanks to him

285
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,710
It's not like I despise it---

286
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,080
It's like some teaching from Buddha, right?

287
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,850
Right

288
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,490
It's a way to show how thankful you are

289
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,560
That's what I thought, it gave me strenght

290
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,300
I think it was like... 20 years ago

291
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,260
I've been doing lots of stuff in Osaka

292
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,230
And when they ended, I came to Tokyo

293
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,240
But there was hardly any work in Tokyo for me

294
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:27,010
The kind words Matsumoto said to Junior on their first show together

295
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,210
I think it was like... 20 years ago

296
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,220
I've been doing lots of stuff in Osaka

297
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:39,360
Junior when he was younger

298
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,120
And when they ended, I came to Tokyo

299
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,720
But there was hardly any work in Tokyo for me

300
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,560
And I was like "what do I do now?"

301
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,530
At that time

302
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,600
There was this show, "warai no jikan" (time for laugh)

303
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Which Matsumoto was doing on Asahi TV

304
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,830
With Imada, right?     - Yes

305
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,470
So, at the time

306
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,270
On their first episode

307
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,970
They had gathered like 20 Yoshimoto comedians

308
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,440
And the plan was just to have them talk freely

309
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,680
That was the first time I ever worked with Matsumoto

310
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:12,790
So, when I was in Oosaka I always
relied on Itao who took care of me

311
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:19,260
So when it was my turn to talk,
I talked about an episode I had with him

312
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,430
While I still was very nervous

313
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,130
There was this one time we went to the Koushien

314
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,130
note: a baseball tournament

315
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,240
And they fired some jet balloons
from the 7th inning's bottom

316
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,040
So, they fired it from there

317
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,740
And the same goes from the other innings

318
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,010
Then I have no idea how, but when
they fired it from the ninth inning

319
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,720
Even though there were like 55 thousand people

320
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,220
That ballon, with a one in a 55 thousands chance

321
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,720
Landed straight on his head

322
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,960
And while I was like "Woah!" he didn't move an inch

323
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,730
He still had the balloon on his head

324
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,270
At one time the plastic tip fell and hit his forehead

325
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,170
And without even moving

326
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,870
He just swiped it off

327
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,670
When I said this story to them

328
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,440
The audience laughed at it

329
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:15,620
So, we all had a closing party after it and
we all went there to have a drink or such

330
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,320
And around when it was about to end,
Matsumoto went to me and told me

331
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:28,690
"I think that your story about Itao was the funniest today"

332
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,760
And then he got back home

333
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,900
Those words really had a huge impact on me

334
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,800
And thinking about them I thought that maybe

335
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,670
I could have a chance in Tokyo

336
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,140
I see

337
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,870
Looking back at it I think that those words

338
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,380
Are still echoing inside my head

339
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,450
Do you remember that?

340
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,280
I don't...

341
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,420
Either way, they're here

342
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,050
That's right

343
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,420
They're still here

344
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,890
They had an impact     - Yeah

345
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,220
See? It's good they're talking about it

346
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,430
You may not remember,
but they still have them here

347
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,860
It's just... they're faint

348
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,730
It was a good story, yes?

349
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,200
Yeah, it was

350
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,700
Shouzo, do you...?

351
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,670
Yes, I...

352
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,070
You know, I've remarried 3 years ago     - Yes

353
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,880
And I had to make lots of arrangements for it

354
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,250
And between them, the most important to me

355
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,420
Was about the daughter I had from Chiaki, my ex-wife

356
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,820
Which was a mid-schooler by
the time I was getting remarried

357
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,420
So it was a pretty emotional time for me

358
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,820
I've been thinking about how to told my daughter

359
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,230
I mean, should I told her beforehand or after it?

360
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,730
I didn't want her to be involved and felt
like talking to her about it wasn't good

361
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,300
And while I was thinking that much about
the right timing to tell my daughter about it

362
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,410
Some journalist out there

363
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:52,240
Was pretty quick to slam my remarrying news on paper

364
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,080
My current wife is now pregnant

365
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,480
And I know that from my daughter point of view

366
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,850
It's something like "daddy married another woman
plus there's a chance I'll have a brother or a sister"

367
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:08,120
And I know that if I was her age, I'd panic over this

368
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,930
And so when I saw that news on the Sanspo newspaper

369
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,230
I thought "Woah, this is the worst..."

370
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,630
So I talked about it with Matsumoto,

371
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:23,740
And I was like "what should I do about it?"
and felt flustered about it

372
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,310
And at that time Matsumoto was like

373
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:31,410
"There, there...", he tried to cheer me up

374
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,680
And I just keep saying "man, I'm so
pissed off about it, what should I do?"

375
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,990
The next day on the show Matsumoto
was taking part in, "Wide na Show"

376
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:46,760
I was really feeling down and trying
my best to let my rage fade away

377
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,730
I also have the DVD from back then

378
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,900
Can I put this on?

379
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,940
He got that too?     - Yes

380
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,670
You know, Endo from Cocorico
is going to get married again

381
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,750
And he has already a kid and he's been
thinking about the right timing to say it

382
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,250
I'm talking about the daughter
he had with Chiaki

383
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,090
And she knows there could be a chance
she could get a brother or sister in law

384
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,760
Endo is thinking a lot about this, that's
why he's feeling down about it

385
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,530
Because even though he wanted to tell
her by his own timing

386
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:22,830
But the Sanspo newspaper wrote it first

387
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:28,540
And his daughter was shocked by it
I mean, something like that...

388
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,170
It's not something you want for your kid

389
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,910
I'd like to know from these jerks what's
the point of writing that stuff

390
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,610
'Cause it really pissed me off

391
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,780
When I watched this

392
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,390
I felt really relieved, it's as if

393
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:51,920
Matsumoto put on words everything
I had in mind right in front of the public

394
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,630
And I thought "man, he really saved me"

395
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,430
And when the year ended, on the New Year's party

396
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,300
I thought I had to say thanks to him directly

397
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:07,170
So I went and I said "Thank you so much for
saying that, you really helped me to calm down"

398
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,310
And then Matsumoto at that point

399
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:15,650
Inside this whole "let's not talk about it" atmosphere,
looked at my face for few seconds and said

400
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,650
"Sure."

401
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,260
That's what you kindly told me

402
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,430
"Kindly" told you?     - Yes

403
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,500
Yes well, you already...

404
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:41,010
Said everything on that show, so your
"Sure, it's okay" was enough for me

405
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,910
Really, that's it

406
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,110
Well, just so you know...

407
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,520
Kimura has been crying for a while by now       - What?!

408
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,420
That's impressive

409
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,420
I mean, his sensitivity

410
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,020
Come on, man!

411
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,830
It's going on for a while by now     - For real?

412
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,830
I mean, he's really impressive, he's crying for a while now

413
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:13,740
I think he's worth receiving Kiyohiko Ozaki prize record

414
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:13,740
note: a japanese singer

415
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,570
Who decided that?!

416
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,510
Sorry for that

417
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,740
I really

418
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,210
Do feel you guys

419
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:31,920
Kimura will tell us about his memories with Matsumoto

420
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,260
His eyes are swollen by now

421
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,060
I've been like this since our briefing session before

422
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,500
Well, it is emotional

423
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
It's like when I watched Project X

424
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,340
note: documentary about Japan's greatest achievements

425
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,040
It must be since he met us

426
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,710
It's just like Project X

427
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,710
I mean, its ending

428
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,710
That's history

429
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,080
At first...

430
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,320
Back when I was a director in Umeda-Kagetsu and

431
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:05,090
note: aka Nanba Grand Kagetsu, a Yoshimoto-brand teather

432
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,420
My job was to raise and lower the curtains,

433
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,020
Downtown were doing their signature abduction skit

434
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:13,230
I remembered there was hardly any
applause at first, and when I was leaving

435
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,670
There was this thunder of applause inside
the teather because how funny it was

436
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,640
Like this, every day was filled with emotion for me

437
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,540
One time they decided to have this quiz-skit

438
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,680
It lasted for about ten days

439
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,680
What I felt about it

440
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,350
On the opening day

441
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:39,050
There was a problem with the intro, it should have
been about one asking what's the height of Mt. Fuji

442
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,820
And the other had to come up
with an answer and scold him

443
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,660
And then they did other stuff, but

444
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:53,670
But they kept on doing it for then days, always answering
a new question with answers from previous days

445
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,400
And as I kept on watching it

446
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,910
And I was having goosebumps

447
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,640
I happen to notice the mekuri
with "Downtown" written on it

448
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:07,910
note: a paper signboard displaying comedians name / manzai duo names on stage

449
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,280
So I took it off and went to the guy who wrote it

450
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,690
And told him "go make a new one, you can't
have them be on stage with such filthy mekuri"

451
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,050
So I had him make a new one

452
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,220
That was the first time I ever thought

453
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,900
I had to do my best myself too

454
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,200
The atmosphere...

455
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,430
And clothes too... everything was really cool there

456
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,940
So...

457
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,040
I brought some notes, may I...?

458
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,540
Sure

459
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,080
You wrote a friggin' lot

460
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,650
Gimme a sec

461
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,850
It's one of the things which echoed the most in me

462
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,590
As you know in the 90s Gottsu Ee Kanji ended

463
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,530
But we also had a special episode
around the beginning of 2000

464
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:01,170
So, after we finished airing it,
we all decided to go to the pub

465
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,630
You know, to wrap things up

466
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,600
I was there too, a bit late

467
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,610
There were also Matsumoto
Imada, Takasu and YOU

468
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,880
Even Higashino... he came later

469
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,040
Also Junior was there

470
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,350
So I saw them and said "good morning"

471
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,350
"It's 9"

472
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,720
"What? Are you 29 y.o.?"

473
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,860
"Nope, it's just 21:00"

474
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,660
And I was like "whaaaat!"

475
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,000
"What the heck"

476
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,070
So, as we kept chatting and drinking

477
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:41,640
Matsumoto went and to each one of us...

478
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,710
I think he was a bit drunk

479
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,780
While pointing his finger at us,
he started saying really nice stuff

480
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:54,480
"YOU, you're this this and this,
and so this", like that

481
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,790
"And Higashino, you're this"

482
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,250
"Imada, you..." etc.

483
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,160
And it was my turn

484
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,960
He said "Kimu..."

485
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,360
"You know, this guy lives on a

486
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,360
170'000 yen monthly rent house"

487
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,360
note: roughly 150$ / 130€

488
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,570
"But if we have to base it on his merit..."

489
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,610
"There's no way he'll have to live in such a cheap place"

490
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,570
"Kimura, I'm sure that one day..."

491
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:25,650
"You'll live in a 1'000'000 yen monthly rented mansion"

492
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:25,650
note: roughly 8900$ / 7700€

493
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,820
...That's what he said to me

494
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,650
I'm so thankful

495
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,730
Also, back then your mobile
phone was a two-touch dial...

496
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:51,840
Kimura will talk about another memory with Matsumoto

497
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,940
So, Matsumoto,you had a two-touch dial phone

498
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,940
Two-touch dial?

499
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,950
Those old ones in which
by pressing the number buttons

500
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,050
You'd call an assigned number

501
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,050
It was some time ago

502
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,890
I was assigned as your number 2

503
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,020
I thought "woah, only number 2... that's quick"

504
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,560
What---       - I was happy about it

505
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,890
"Number 2"      - What are you--

506
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,130
Well, it was a 1 digit code, so I could easily call him

507
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,200
And quickly      - I got it

508
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,070
Calling you was quick cause you were registered early

509
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,380
You said "You're Kimu, so you're going NImu"

510
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,380
note: "NI" means "TWO"

511
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,980
Why did you say that?

512
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,450
I don't think I ever said that

513
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:39,820
Translation & Subtitles by Shion

514
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,750
I have no idea what's this "Nimu" thing

515
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,950
"Kimu" is fine

516
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,120
We were in Korea...

517
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:46,530
www.shionnotsukai.wordpress.com

518
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,920
And I was eating crabs

519
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,060
I accidentally got some shell
stuck between my teeth, and then

520
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:53,200
www.facebook.com/shionnotsukai

521
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,060
You looked right at me with a face which seemed

522
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,570
Really concerned about me

523

The hell is he talkin' about

525
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,810
