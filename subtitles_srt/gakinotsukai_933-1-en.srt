00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,480
All of a sudden?

7
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,800
No warnings at all

00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,800

Q1. What is Fujiwara's hobby?

10
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,400
I don't need to know

11
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,640
Matsumoto-san, you do know a lot about him, right?   - Well...

12
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,450
We've been... like, 2 years? I mean, we've been hanging out a lot

13
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,640
But we've never actually talked about that...

Baba Keisuke

17
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,680
He doesn't just play a role in the direction of Gaki no Tsukai's New Year Specials

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,560
He's also our Fujiwara, the one who made us burst in laughter on several famous skits until now

19
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,560
But this time

20
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,920
We'll approach his true nature

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,120
Drawing near Fujiwara Hiroshi's True Nature !!

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,720
Of a man working hard for Yoshimoto

23
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,840
I don't usually wonder about things I don't want to know

24
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,080
That's the point   - Yeah but...

25
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,680
We're doing way too much

I have no idea so I think this makes sense

33
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,920
You went with "music"?

34
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,400
"Music"

35
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,160
I think he's a predictable man
- So, music should work?   - Makes sense

36
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:12,230
BEING FUJIWARA IN A DIFFERENT PLACE, HE CAN'T LISTEN TO THEM

37
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,240
What is your hobby?

38
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,400

00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,820
I don't really want to know about him

49
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,360
I know, right?

50
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,280

Q2. What is Fujiwara's special skill?

54
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,320
I have no idea about this one either

55
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,720
It's gotta be that

56
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,080
I remember this, he even made a skit about it

57
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,080
Ohhh, I see...

58
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,020
You're right...   - Wait, what?

59
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,720
He has done this

60
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,280
But he did this one too

61
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Yeah, that one too    - Yes

62
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,800
It has to be one of the two    - I think so too

63
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,490

I've heard about this

66
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,800
Yeah it's surprisingly true

67
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,600
It seems like he's pretty good at butterfly

Yeah that's true

72
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,750
But you know, he

73
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,750

He did that on the show too, right?   - You're right

80
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,960
Here's the answer

81
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,080
That was a good hint   - It's either one of them
- Right?

82
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,700
What is your special skill?

83
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,480
Yes uhm... well....

Told so

87
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,000
It was that one after all

88
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,640
Makes sense

89
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,720
If Fujiwara is asked "please do your favorite gag"

90
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,320
What would that be?

91
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,400
I really can't think of anything except for this one

92
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:44,690
Q7. If he's asked to perform his favorite
gag, which gag will he perform?

93
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,240
I don't know

94
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,680
I'm not sure if it's a gag to him

95
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,200
Right, that one

96
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,030
It could be

97
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,120
I think he got it

99
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,840
That one, he did that too

100
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,360
It's this

101
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,650
"1,2,3
NABEATSU"

102
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,650
"OYOYO"

103
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,650
HARD GAY

104
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,040
Yeah

105
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,640
It's his only one    - "Gather around my boobs!"

106
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,480
Will he do it?

107
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,690
"GATHER

"KOMANECHI"

109
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,800
I don't know if he considers it to be a gag

110
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,000
Please perform your favorite gag

111
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
Eh? Wait-

112
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,320
Maybe he doesn't remember

113
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,840
He looks so happy though

114
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,840
"I'm itchy~"

115
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,600
"I'm itchy~"

116
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,760
That wasn't funny at all

117
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:06,890
A. "I'm itchy～"

118
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,320
What was that?

119
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,380
He had this embarrassed grin

120
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,800
That was disgusting

121
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,920
Yeah it was disgusting

122
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,840
What would Fujiwara bring with him on a desert island?

123
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:41,910
Q14. What would he bring with him on a Desert Island?

124
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,120
What would he bring, huh...

125
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,160
I think I'll just leave my seat and have one of you write for me

126
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,320

Oh, makes sense

137
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,280
Here's the answer

138
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,940
Uhm...

139
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,200
I'd bring with me a large quantity of food

140
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:59,400
A. A large quantity of food

141
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,300
Man this quiz is sucking up my energy

142
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,470
I'm still at zero points

143
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,000
It's all about food    - Bringing food is a bit obvious

144
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,740
I bet he said it thinking it was something hilarious

145
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,240
Yeah I can see that    - He was smiling all the way

146
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Wasn't funny at all though

147
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,380
If Fujiwara pulls some hair from his nose, how many can he pull out?

148
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:37,720
Q17. How many nose hairs can Fujiwara pull out?

149
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,650
He seems to be the guy who can pull out a lot     - Yeah, he does

150
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,520
He's got power
- Fujiwara-san surely can

151
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,220
Nope

152
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,760
Hm?

153
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,600
I think he...

154
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,460
Oh I see

155
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,760

I think he can

159
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,030
I think he'll get kinda weirded out

160
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,730
I can see it

161
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,900
And be like "I'm sorry"    - This can definitely happen

162
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
It can happen       - That's a good theory

163
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,870
Maybe his finger won't fit

164
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,370
Please show us how many hairs you can pull out from your nose

165
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,880
Okay~

166
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,080
What's with that "Okay~"?    - Is he an idol?
- He's acting like a young girl

167
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,290
Hamada was right

168
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,170
He's just making clear the fact he can't pull a single one out

169
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,960
Wait a moment please, I'm sorry

170
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,300
I told ya the fingers wouldn't fit

171
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,430
For real

172
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,660
He really can't get it

173
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,730
That's because of his chubby fingers

174
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,130
Wait a moment please, I'm sorry

175
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,370
We have to recognize his effort though

176
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,070
I pulled out just one, I'm sorry

177
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,270
He had more     - That was long

178
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,980
He could have pulled more if he changed his method

179
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,180
Don't be so happy about it, geez

180
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,810
The hair was very thick too

181
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,710
Thick and friggin' long    - Yeah

182
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,570
It was a serious nose hair

183
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,400
That nostril hair was the only lively thing he ever had

184
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,430
In case of a major earthquake, what will Fujiwara bring out with him first?

185
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:54,290
Q21. If a major earthquake strikes
What will Fujiwara bring with him first?

186
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,930
Must be that

187
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,340
Giving that he's soooooooooooo predictable...

188
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,140
He is

189
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,210
So we have to think as if we were predictable?  - Yeah, just like him

190
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,210

195
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,040
Yeah, I'm sure of it

196
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,550
Is him really that calm?

197
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,150
It's a bit shifted from his usual ultra-predictable character

198
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,290
BANKBOOK &
PERSONAL SEAL

CUSHION

200
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,150
He shouldn't be laughing

201
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,920
I know right?

202
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Food supplies I guess

203
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,960
What?!

204
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:09,240
A. Food

205
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,590
It went that way again

206
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,760
Should have figured it

207
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,830
He has a huge consideration of food, huh?
- Yeah that's true

208
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,030
Right

209
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,740
They say he recently managed to suck up soups or such with his finger

210
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,240
Soups... with his finger?

211
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,670
Well it's just an urban legend after all

212
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,310
That's...

213
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,910
You'd get fat that way

214
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,480
Manager Orita is 2 hours late to an appointed meeting

215
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:29,650
Fujiwara's subordinate...u..
Current Downtown Manager
Orita Naoya

216
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,680

217
00:06:29,630 --> 00:07:00,150
Q39. Manager Orita is 2 hours late!
Which phrase will Fujiwara say when he's angry?

218
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,490

222
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:49,080
"AS A
PERSON..."

223
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:49,080
"I WONDER
WHY?"

224
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,230
Does he even get mad to begin with?

225
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,600
It's ju--- well

226
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,700
I can't really picture a guy like him raising his voice in anger

227
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,400
What's this "are you taking it lightly?"

228
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,720
"GET
A GRIP"

229
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,720
"HAVE YOU
LOST YOUR
MOTIVATION?"

230
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,270
Like "are you underestimating your job?"

231
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,810
Oh that way    - Yeah like that

232
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,190
A gentle feel      - Well, me too I wrote

233
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,810
"I wonder why?"

234
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,380
It's definitely something like that

235
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,920
How will you get mad if manager Orita is 2 hours late for the meeting you've planned?

236
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,690
He's laughing a lot

237
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,820
What's so funny about it?

238
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,960
Sorry I was so late

239
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,990
Huh?

240
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,490
Woah

241
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,120
Why?

242
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,650
Woah woah    - Something's about to begin

243
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,000
I apologize for being so late

244
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,030
Da hell do ya mean? What happened?

245
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,430
He's angry

246
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,330
Ya overslept?

247
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,300
Don't sleep, moron. Are you an idiot?

248
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,200
Ya always said ya overly concerned about this, aight?

249

The hell are ya doin'?

250
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,080
He's really pissed off!

251
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,380
Huh?!

252
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,750
He's scary

253
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,680
Ya always said that

254
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,220
It's so long!

255
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,150
Now go, idiot

256
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,080
I'm really sorry

257
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,450
I'm sorry

258
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,720
He was really pissed off, right?

259
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:50,310
A. "Haven't you said you care about this?"

260
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:50,310
Endo:
"GET A GRIP"

261
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:50,310

Yamazaki: "ARE YOU

265
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,990
He snapped     - Scary!

266
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,990
He scared me     - He was scary

267
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,290
What the hell     - Wasn't that

268
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,060
I mean wasn't that a bit too... realistic?

269
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,700
I thought so too

270
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,330
It felt like he's used to say that

271
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,410
Yeah, right?

272
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,070
But right after that he said "I'm sorry"

273
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,050
It kinda felt like Oozaki-san (Fujiwara's superior)

274
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,900
It felt like he's saying from his point of view

275
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,340
All the things he's been told by Oozaki-san as they are

276
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,210
He must have studied them

277
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:08,150
What was Fujiwara's most recent reason for why he had a fight with his wife?

278

Q65. What was Fujiwara's most recent reason

279
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:22,810

'Cause it's been a while since they got married

293
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,070
Makes sense

294
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,070
I doubt they fight over such thing at this point

295
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:37,950
BEING FUJIWARA IN A DIFFERENT PLACE, HE CAN'T LISTEN TO THEM

296
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,840
Which was your most recent reason

297
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,840
For why you had a fight with your wife?

298
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,180
Uhm... I'm sorry

299
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,810
Well

300
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,650
There was like this postcard for welfare pension which expired

301
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,550
And she told me I should go and turn it in myself, but I didn't

302
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,190
And she said to me "why are you so irresponsibl-

303
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,190
We don't need to hear the rest

304
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,060
Turn it off please

305
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,830
Let's get back here

306
00:08:52,140 --> 00:09:01,600
A. He didn't turn in the welfare pension postcard

307
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,900
Welfare pension, huh

308
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,130
I see, I see

309
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,400
I don't really think

310
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,700
He knows he's in a quiz and we're here to answer

311
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:06,710
I wish he would think something like "there's no way they can guess it"

312
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,710
I mean, who can write in here all his endless babbling?

313
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,780
Karaoke...

314
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:26,400
Q. Which song does Fujiwara often sing at the karaoke?

315
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,680
As time passes

316
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,940
The true face of manager Fujiwara

317
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,940
Gets clearer and clearer!

318
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,940
I think it may be "Sexual Violet No.1"...

319
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,940
Woah, that's what he'd choose?

320
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,320
"My lovely Eri"

321
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,320
"My lovely Eri"

322
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,320
"Runner"

323
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,320
"Season in the sun"

324
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,320
"TSUNAMI"

325

330
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,400
A. Sexual Violet No. 1

331
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,490
Who could have possibly guessed it!

332
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:38,640
Q. At what age did Fujiwara have his first kiss?

333
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,100
It wasn't serious, but my first kiss was at 14

334
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:38,640
A, At 14

335
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,800
He said "it wasn't serious"

336
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,040
What does he mean?

337
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,100
What does it mean?

338
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,540
Must be something similar to a coming out

339
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:48,680
Q. By fighting which comedian Fujiwara thinks he can win?

340
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,110
Maybe someone like Yama-chan?

341
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,980
Yamazaki Housei

342
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,680
A. Yamazaki Housei

343
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,910
You were right

344
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,280
It was a good option

345
00:09:48,680 --> 00:10:02,340
Q. Which was the thing a woman told him
which made him the happiest?

346
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,050
That's got to be something my wife told me

347
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,080
Probably the time she told me something like "I will follow you"

348
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:02,340
A. When her wife told him "I will follow you"

349
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,560
What the... what the hell is this?

350
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,560
What are we even doing at this point?

351
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,860
This could become a tv show

352
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,830
No way!

353
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Which is the content

354
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Of Fujiwara's favorite adult video?

355
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:16,520
Q261. What's Fujiwara's favorite adult video about?

356
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,410
This too is... like

357
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,750
A really weird question to ask

358
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,910
I agree

359
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,950
Hamada please cut the crap and fix that string

360
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,400
What?

361
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,730
Looking at it pisses me off

362
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,650
What are you...?

363
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,650
Look at it, it's curling like crazy

364
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,720
What's wrong with you?

365
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,350
I want him to fix it so bad

366
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,340
What the hell

367
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,220
Just put it back to its original shape

368
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,360
Just... look at mine, I--

369
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,690
If mine made even a single curl I'd definitely hate it

370
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,830
I feel the same

371
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,600
While his is completely one with the curls

372
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,560
You're right

373
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,070
I hate it when people do that

374
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,500
I wonder why

375
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,070
I hate people who do this!

376
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,070
This is unbearable

377
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,340
What the hell, dude!

378
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:43,970
It's an eyesore

379
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,970
Sorry it was completely unrelated but I had to say it

380
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,810
It makes sense you did

381
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,970
I just couldn't hold any longer

382
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,810
It's good you let us know

383
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,880
We got it, so it's okay

384
00:10:49,880 --> 00:11:16,570
Q261. What's Fujiwara's favorite adult video about?

385
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,950
Reveal your answers

386
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,500
Group sex

387
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,500
Magic Mirror
N°1

388
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,500
Something

389
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,500
interviews

390
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,500
involving

391
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,550
Hamada wrote "Magic Mirror" too

392
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,290
Well, there are tons of them

393
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,090
Come on, you just wrote what you like

394
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,260
That's not it

395
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,330
Magic Mirror
N°1

396
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,330
Something
Sado-masochist

397
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,390
Tanaka did too

398
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,360
Tanaka wrote the same

399
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,560
Ok so YOU just wrote what you like

400
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,060
Right?

401
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,030
What is that about?

402
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,160
Like when she goes to an interview and she's like "please don't, please don't"

403
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,930
Ohhh you mean those!

404
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,800
Oh, those

405
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,560
But then she starts not to dislike it that much

406
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,330
The amateurs ones?

407
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,180
Don't talk that much about it

408
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,470
Here's the answer

409
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,540
It's embarrassing

410
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,140
Like...

411
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,380
Those where there's a neat and clean woman

412
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,810
And she gradually grows wilder and wilder

413
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,110
I have no idea what he's sayin'

414
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,380
Those things turn me on

415
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,090
Sorry

416
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:39,170
A. A clean & composed woman gradually growing wilder

417
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,750
What the hell? It's not something you can think of

418
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,220
But Yamazaki was close, though

419
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:34,920
Was I?

420
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,750
You were

421
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,120
Ohhh, I see

422
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,860
But mine is more like, something ordinary

423
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,490
Yeah

424
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,160
I guess so

425
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,160
It's just like the old uchuu-kikaku stuff

426
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,700
note: Uchuu-kikaku is a japanese adult video production company

427
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,700
Really

428
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,270
Manager Orita successfully got a big employment

429
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,670
Which phrase will Fujita use to praise him?

430
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,810
Fujita..?

431
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,070
Who is Fujita now?

432
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,880
There are like only 3 people

433
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,140
Appearing as characters

434
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,950
How can he screw up the main one?

435
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,480
He said "Fujiwara" countless times till now

436
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,690
There aren't many people

437
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,850
And why he's "Fujita" now?

438
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,490
Are we changing him?

439
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,860
A new one appeared

440
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,360
So we're doing him from now on?

441
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,360
He must feel pretty bad for this

442
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,760
More like, who is Fujita?

443
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,060
Yeah, who's this "Manager Fujita"?

444
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,470
I bet he'd be mad if someone called him Fujita

445
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:27,180
How will Fujiwara compliment him?

446
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:27,180
Q305. If manager Orita gets an big employment

447
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,340
I really don't know

448
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,070
This will do

449
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,650
This---

450
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:34,260
"ISN'T IT
GOOD?"

451
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:34,260
"LET'S GO TELL
OOZAKI-SAN"

452
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:34,260
"WAY TO GO"

453
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:34,260
"WELL DONE!
NOW LET'S
GO TAKE A
BITE!"

454
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:34,260
"YOU DID IT"

455
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:34,260
ENDO

Must be one of those for sure

461
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,250
I wonder who will get it right

462
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,090
Here's the answer

463
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,520
Excuse me

464
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,120
What's the matter?

465
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,120
He should know

466
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,960
You just got... a big job, huh

467
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,760
They told him

468
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,260
That's where it began

469
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
You did it!

470
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,400
I'd love to get it myself too, really

471
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,150
You worked hard for it

472
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,570
Next time I'll get it too, for sure

473
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,270
You did well, really, that's great

474
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,070
I'll snatch it from ya!

475
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,880
You did good, really

476
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,480
Keep going this way

477
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
This is hilarious

478
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,150
This is...

479
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,960
Alright

480
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,960
You did it!

481
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:20,640
A. "Well done!"

482
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,290
He was like "now go away!"

483
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,060
"C'mon get the hell outta here!"

484
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,460
It would have been fine without the last part

485
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,760
Ahhh, this is weird

486
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,580
What's the title of the movie Fujiwara wants to be the main character of?

487
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:36,350
Q337. What's the title of the movie Fujiwara

488
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:36,350
would like to be its main character?

489
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,560
This one kinda suddenly flashed on my mind

490
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,180
Yeah, same here

Stallone everywhere

505
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,700
All Stallone except for me!

506
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,350
You're right

507
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,150
He just popped out

508
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,710
Amazing

509
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,410
He really came to my mind so clearly

510
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,600
BEING FUJIWARA IN A DIFFERENT PLACE, HE CAN'T LISTEN TO THEM

511
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,360
The protagonist of which movie would you like to be?

512
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,660
Well...

513
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,360
Probably "Mission: Impossible" or such

514
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,360
Come on...

515
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:07,220
A. Mission: Impossible

516
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,930
It was Tom Cruise in the end

517
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,930
Tom Cruise, right?

518
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,660
Whatever

519
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,040
What the hell would he do in Mission: Impossible?

520
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,510
He must have thought "It'd be good"

521
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,110
Yeah

522
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,820
You're right

523
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,450
Like "I'd love that"

524
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,350
"I'd love to do that"

525
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,420
"He's so cool"

526
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,760
Yamazaki you haven't get a single one yet?

527
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,760
Not even once

528
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,090
That's impressive

529
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:19,720
Yeah...

530
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,360
Who does Fujiwara think is the manliest

531
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,260
Between the five of you?

532
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,260
It's easy to think he'd go for Hamada

533
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:37,180

534

00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,410
Yeah right

536
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,670
Yeah, makes sense

537
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,210

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,980
Here's the answer

555
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,980
Yama-chan, try to change your target

556
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,210
Just change it

557
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,000
It's Hamada-san

558
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,750
Matsumoto-san

559
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:54,100
A. Matsumoto

560
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
See? I told you!

561
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,880
How do you-

562
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,250
There you go

563
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,820
That was unexpected

564
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,460
Zaki-san is incredible

565
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,590
Yeah

566
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,760
I can't get one right...

567
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,090
You're way too much behind us

568
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,030
Why is this happening?

569
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,490
No luck on this one too

570
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,270
If Fujiwara is told "TV host", who would come to his mind?

571
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:17,520
Q394. Who comes to Fujiwara's mind

572
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:17,520
if someone says "TV host"?

573
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,900
A TV host...

574
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,640
This one has to be...

575
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,240
I wonder if Yoshimoto will censor me for this

576
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,340
Alright

577
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,410
I'm getting it

Everyone

591
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,480
We all wrote the same

592
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,380
Alright!

593
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,450
Everyone the same

594
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,450
But I have a kind of bad feeling about it

595
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,620
'cause Yamazaki is with us

596
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,250
Come on, give me a break

597
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:25,830
You're right

598
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,190
This just happened to pop in our minds so clearly

599
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,260
Right...

600
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,240
But I think he's gonna say Sekiguchi Hiroshi

601
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,060
Here's the answer

602
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,460
Sekiguchi Hiroshi-san

A. Sekiguchi Hiroshi

604
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,460
Holy crap, you were right

605
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,370
You're kidding me!

606
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,500
Look at this...

607
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,370
Are you for real?!

608
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,740
That's a bit creepy...

609
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,040
He was right, it was Sekiguchi-san...

610
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,180
It means it's no good to write the same as Yama-chan

611
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,340
Must be that

612
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,180
Agreed

Well...

616
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,120
It was always your fault since the first time you were here

617
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,060
I mean, on Gaki

618
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,490
Wasn't it since the second time?

619
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,530

He doesn't give a feeling of being healthy...

631
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,040
Of course he gives no healthy feeling

632
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,440
Yeah I guess

633
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,510
Salad?!

634
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,510
Mayo? Ehhh...

635
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,800
Uhm...

A. Potato tempura

Tempura... with potatoes?

Dude...

640
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,330
Did he just say "potato tempura"?!

641
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,100
Never heard of it!

642
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,730
Satsuma-imo

643
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,030
note: a type of fried sweet potato

644
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,030
Everyone calls them satsuma-imo, geez

645
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,360
I know, right?

646
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,030
Yeah that's right

647
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,030
Do you think he's actually confusing them?

648
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,570
If that's so, wouldn't it be weird he'd eat em with mayo?

649
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,800
Guess you're right

650
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,270
I have no idea though

Potato tempur---

652
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,440
Never seen it

653
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,910

00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,510

In how many seconds can Fujiwara wear a bra?

661
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:37,830
wear a bra?

662
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,460
...On himself, right?

663
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,230
Oh, yes

664
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,230
Yeah should be so

665
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,230
On himself

666
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,930
I bet he's going to hook it from the front and then twist it

667
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,880
Oh, is that so?

668
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,830
Normally anyone would go for that one

669
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,670
No doubt about it

670
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,300
Doing it from behind would be a real burden

note: 秒 = seconds

679
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,580
But it could be his hands won't reach

680
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,790
It could happen, couldn't it?

681
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,790
Maybe the hooks won't fit

682
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,850
Please try to show us in how many seconds you can wear a bra

683

686
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,130
He's pretty fat

687
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,700
He's got boobs, he needs that bra

688
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,430
Right

689
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,870
Ok now, ready, set, go!

690
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,810
Woah, you were right on that

691
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,810
Just what is this guy?

692
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,810
Oh!

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,810
See?

694
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,710
He figured that out...

695
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,710
Why is he so good at it?

696
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,710
Shit, it has passed quite a lot of time

697
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,050
It may be close to what Yama-chan wrote

698
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,090
It could be, who knows

699
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,100
For the first time

700
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,460
This part is taking time

701
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,860
What just happened?!

702
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,870
One second!

703
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,570

709
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,140

00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,400
Isn't it better off this way?

745
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,200
It's good, you can find an even better one

746
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,560
Right?

747
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,370
Orita

748
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,900
Orita

749
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,130
Do your best

750
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,900
Orita...

751
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,800
Do your best

752
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,900
It'll be okay

753
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,700
"Do your best" he says

754
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,720
It's alright

755
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,720
He sent him off again

756
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,720
He did it again

757
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,380
When it starts getting long he kicks him away

758
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,380
This one is complicated

759
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,250
He said a lot of things

760
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,320
Yeah...

761
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,420
No no, he said it, this time for sure he said it

762
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,660
It's difficult to judge what he said

763
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:08,910
A. "There are even better girls out there,

764
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:08,910
so do your best!

765
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,730
I did it!

766
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,730
He sounded kinda tired

767
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,130
Yeah, worn out

768
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:01,660
Well

769
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,530
At this point, yeah

770
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,430
After failing all these times

771
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,600
But you know, this might won't be part of the final cut

772
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,070
'cause we're all tired

773
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,070
Even though he came this far!

774
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,100
Exactly

775
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,910
What the heck!

776
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,270
It's like the 480th question!

777
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,270
You should have thought over your answers

778
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,250
But that's... you know I mean... It's his fault, right?

779
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,460
After this

780
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,460
It's finally time for the last question!!

781
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,920
No way, no way

782
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,460
It was you

783
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,820
If Fujiwara would get plastic surgery on his face

784
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,120
What would he change?

785
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:42,510
Q496, If Fujiwara would undergo a facial plastic surgery

786
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:42,510
what would he change?

787
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,890
This part of him made me feel uneasy even through the monitor

788
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:30,990
For real?

789
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,800
Reveal your answers

790
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,480
CREASED
EYELID

791
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,480
MOUTH

792
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,480
MOUTH

793
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,030
It has to be this one

794
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,930
Creased eyelid?

795
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,510
EYES

796
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,510
NOSE

797
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:40,900
Most likely

798
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,800
His eye, huh...

799
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,440
Here's the answer

800
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,870
If you have to undergo a facial plastic surgery

801
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,070
What would you change?

802
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,400
I'd have my nose lifted up

803
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:04,030
A. Nose

804
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,320
You got it

805
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,000
He'd be weirdly balanced if he gets such nose

806
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:09,470
It's like having

807
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,470
an European doorknob

808
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,470
on a Japanese house,

809
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,470
it just feels weird

810
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,370
Oh geez

811
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,170
The last one

812
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:12,570
Really?

813
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:12,920
We did it!

814
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,830
I'm exhausted

815
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,830
This really is the last one

816
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,830
I had enough

817
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,270
Here's the 500th question

818
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,200
Finally

819
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,640
Between the lines Fujiwara never actually said

820
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,850
Which is the cliché line he'd like to say for once?

821
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,950
What the hell is that?

822
00:21:26,950 --> 00:22:00,720
Q500. Between the lines Fujiwara never actually said

823
00:21:26,950 --> 00:22:00,720
which is the cliché line he'd like to say for once?

824
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,230
The 500 questions which extended for a long time

825
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,230
Are finally welcoming the last one

826
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,700
And the color of weariness is painted all over their faces

827
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,000
But in the end...

828
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,930
Who will be the victorious one?

829
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,980
I see...

830
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,380
That's what you thought...

831
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,200
Reveal your answers

832
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,330
"DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME,
JUST KEEP
ON MOVING ON"

833
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,330
"I LOVE YA!!"

834
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,330
"I'M SORRY BUT
I HAVE A WIFE"

835
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,330
"PLEASE,
NOW, GO !!"

836
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,330
"YOU'D JUST
GET BURNED
BY LOVING ME"

837
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,330
ENDO

838
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,330
HAMADA

839
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,330
MATSUMOTO

840
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,330
TANAKA

841
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,330
YAMA
ZAKI

842
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,320
"Don't worry about me, just keep on moving on"

843
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,820
I wonder what happened

844
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,120
I feel like he aspires to be in such scene

845
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,460
Here's the answer

846
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,720
Which will it be?

847
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,030
Who knows

848
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,730
Maybe "I love ya"...

849
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,660
Maybe "I want to make love to you", I'm sorry...

850
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:21,580
A. "I want to make love to you"

851
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,300
He said "I'm sorry" at the end

852
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,170
He said it so clearly at the end

853
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:20,830
"I'm sorry"

854
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,170
"I want to make love to you"

855
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:22,540
"I want to make love to you"

856
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,140
"I want to make love to you"

857
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,520
"I want to make love to you"

858
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,170
"I want to make love to you"

859
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,440
With this, our 500 questions quiz has come to an end

860
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,010
Ok

861
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,310
With that being said

862
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,980
We'll now announce the winner

863
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,650
Of the Manager Fujiwara's 500 things QUIZ

864
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:42,570
ANNOUNCING THE RESULTS

865
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,260
The winner is Hamada Masatoshi!

866
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,340
Hamada Masatoshi

867
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,340
Winner

868
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,160
Congratulations!

869
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,600
You've scored 61 points?!

870
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,570
He surely did

871
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,180
He guessed it right a lot of times

872
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,140
Yeah you're right

873
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,970
The central display was always flashing in red

874
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:57,970
It was, it was

875
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,840
Yamazaki-san you are really something

876
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,640
Yeah that's impressive

877
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,080
One point is impressive

878
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,450
At this point is even more regrettable the fact you just scored one

879
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,110
That's right

880
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,620
Can't we just pretend I didn't get that one right?

881
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,720
We can't do that, so...

882
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,450
Can't we have my score pixelated on screen and make it look as if I didn't get it right?

883
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,720
Why are you saying such stupid bullshit?

884
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Come on, don't say it's bullshit!

885
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,630
How did you came up which such bullshit?

886
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,300
Don't say such things on TV!

887
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,040
Looks like the winner is Hamada-san
