1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
Theory: if the female guest on "Love It!" were remote-controlled by an army of comedians, she would steal all the laughs from the regulars

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,730
Okay, good morning everyone!

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,930
Good morning.

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,130
It's 6:00 AM right now.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,240
Kuu here's a regular on "Love It!".

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,540
Well, I'm a regular on Fridays.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,210
And on "Love It," there's this thing they do...

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,810
where they ask questions like an oogiri show, right?

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,820
It starts as a quiz show but kind of turns into oogiri.

10
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,720
Right, I see.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,320
But there isn't anything like that for the first two hours.

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,230
Yeah, but as soon as I open my mouth it becomes oogiri.

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:01:00,940
"Love It," the program we're featuring today, is a news-variety program that airs Monday and Friday mornings on TBS.

14
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:10,720
However, because of the MC, Hajime, and other comedians in the studio, the quizzes have been turning into oogiri.

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,220
It has since become a news show with a strong comedic flair.

16
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,920
Just so you know, this plan of ours...

17
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,230
isn't known to anybody, including the MC, Kawashima.

18
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:29,030
We've only told a couple of producers about it.

19
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:29,030
[Studio members for today's program]

20
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,140
Tamura, your partner is on the show...

21
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,140
How is it? Do you watch it?

22
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,140
Ah, yeah, of course I do.

23
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,610
Since you're his partner, we figure you'll know all of Kawashima's weak points.

24
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,120
Oh, definitely. Leave it to me.

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,120
This is the lineup we'll have to test the theory today.

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,730
So, to help us with our plan today...

27
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:59,730
the guest appearing on "Love It" will be...

28
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,740
ANO

29
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,740
That's right, it's Ano-san.

30
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,740
She's got a weird vibe.

31
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:19,720
The guest on "Love It" this time will be a former member of the idol group Yurumerumo, Ano.

32
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:28,730
Now working as a solo artist, she's gained popularity among young people for her unusual character.

33
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,730
I think we've worked together once before.

34
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,870
But with Kawashima...

35
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,740
Have you met Kawashima before?

36
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,740
Who-whuh?

37
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,240
Kawashima? Ah-no.

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,940
No, right?

39
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,440
Since he doesn't know her at all...

40
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,410
I want to make him think he's met the funniest girl ever.

41
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,120
You really could!

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,920
I guess so.

43
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,320
But wouldn't it actually make her seem super scary?

44
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,520
I mean she's already pretty intense...

45
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,130
if she brings out that intensity...

46
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,590
wouldn't it scare the MCs?

47
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,130
It's gonna be tough to get the hang of this, so...

48
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,030
let's practice first.

49
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,070
For phrasing and stuff like that.

50
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,070
For the practice, Ano-chan's been brought to another room.

51
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,480
We'll start with previous questions from "Love It!"

52
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,880
Ano-chan, can you hear me?

53
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,780
Yes.

54
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,580
Ok, great.

55
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,220
Good morning!

56
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,220
Good morning.

57
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,620
Thank you for coming today.

58
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,090
I'm going to give you a topic and some instructions...

59
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,820
so please tell us whatever your thoughts are on it.

60
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:31,820
Okay.

61
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,260
Great.

62
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,860
Feeling a little peeved today, are we?

63
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,730
Thanks for having me on.

64
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,730
Okay then, let's begin. Number one:

65
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:48,710
ANSWER: The ratio of kaki-no-tane to peanuts changed to 7:3, based on a national survey

66
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:48,710
When Kameda redid the packaging last year for their kaki-no-tane, what changed?

67
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,710
Buddhist sutras are written all over them.

68
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,280
Yuck.

69
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,280
Buddhist sutras are written all over them. Got that?

70
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,280
Junior relays the answers via earpiece

71
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,890
Buddhist sut-ras're...written all over em.

72
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,490
Yeah, that's it! Good tone.

73
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,790
Scary tone.

74
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,790
And then...

75
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,060
A: Pineapple buns

76
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,060
Q: What are melonpan called in Hong Kong?

77
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,770
Alcindo's head.

78
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,770
* Alcindo Sartori, retired Brazillian footballer who played for Japan

79
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,570
Nice.

80
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:20,970
Kawashima really loves soccer players from his generation.

81
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,180
Now that they've got the hang of things, we'll go into standby for the real deal.

82
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,580
And then...

83
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,590
Finally, the broadcast of "Love It!" begins.

84
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,290
Okay everyone, here we go!

85
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,390
Love It!

86
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,770
Good morning everyone! I'm Kawashima, your MC for this Wednesday edition of Love It!

87
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,570
And I'm Tamura Mako, from TBS.

88
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,570
Thanks for joining us today.

89
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,570
If Tamura's there, maybe it's no problem.

90
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,370
If I was hosting, things might get too heavy.

91
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,780
Today we welcome the multi-talented actor, model, and singer, Ano.

92
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,780
Yeahh, Ano-chan!

93
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,780
You've got this.

94
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,790
And if I'm not mistaken...

95
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,790
it looks like we've got five comedians in the stand today as well!

96
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,890
We are her stand, actually.

97
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,890
Her special ability.

98
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,190
When does the quiz start?

99
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,260
They have to get through some other stuff first.

100
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,170
So not that soon, then.

101
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,970
They have a sort of "ranking" segment first.

102
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,070
They rank some things, and then...

103
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,370
they have a quiz based on that.

104
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:32,280
About twenty minutes into the program, the aforementioned ranking begins.

105
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,080
I'm super nervous.

106
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,780
Really makes you nervous.

107
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,780
And finally...

108
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,990
Today we've got a quiz for you about spicy snacks.

109
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,490
Oh, it's a quiz.

110
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,290
Oh yeah, here it comes.

111
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,990
There it is!

112
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,490
On the top left!

113
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,560
It's a garlic-themed quiz.

114
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,660
Here we go!

115
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,060
A garlic quiz?

116
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,070
It's not about spicy snacks?

117
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,270
Drinking milk is one known way to wash down the taste of garlic...

118
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,580
but there's another well-known way, too. What might that be?

119
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,980
Okay everyone, do your best!

120
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,680
Let's hear from Shibata-san!

121
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,680
Brushing your teeth.

122
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,290
So fast!

123
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,290
And with that, the "Love It!" oogiri-quiz begins.

124
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,390
Apply baking soda.

125
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,400
To your teeth?

126
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,770
Light and integrate a small firework.

127
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,340
That's good.

128
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,270
Saran wrap your tongue.

129
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,770
Let's go with that.

130
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,480
Ano-chan, say "wrap your tongue in saran wrap."

131
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,790
Wrap your tongue in saran wrap.

132
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,790
Wrap your tongue in saran wrap?

133
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,790
Can't say I was expecting that...

134
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,790
They're going for a big shock right away.

135
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,900
Good tension.

136
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,000
* Japanese ventriloquist

137
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,000
Close your mouth and talk like Ikkoku-do.*

138
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,380
Let's try wood glue.

139
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,380
Yogurt?

140
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,780
Ah, because it usually helps with spicy foods, right?

141
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,280
Unfortunately that's not it.

142
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,190
Okay, Ano-chan.

143
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,190
Let's try wood glue.

144
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,190
Wood glue?

145
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,200
Said it perfectly.

146
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,670
Your answers are scaring me.

147
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,670
Let's tone it down, yeah?

148
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,680
For our second hint...

149
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
Ah, go ahead.

150
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,680
Burn some incense on your tongue.

151
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,490
Seems like you've been corrupted by Ano-chan.

152
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,790
She's powerful.

153
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,790
Let's try wood glue.

154
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,590
Wood glue?

155
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:08,100
With Ano's unexpectedly hard oogiri answers, the whole show gets shaken up.

156
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,100
And then...

157
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,700
I'll give you a hint:

158
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,670
it's a fruit.

159
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,570
Yeah, there's a famous—

160
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,870
ah, did you have an answer?

161
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,080
Okay, Kasuga.

162
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,280
Swallowing a watermelon.

163
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,380
Ano just keeps on raising her hand.

164
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,680
Swallowing a watermelon.

165
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,390
That would be a hippo's answer.

166
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,390
A hippo's answer!

167
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,390
He's good.

168
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,390
Kawashima's really something.

169
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,800
And then...

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,600
Yes, go ahead.

171
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,800
Swallowing an apple.

172
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,070
Answer: eating an apple

173
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,080
Oh, they got the answer.

174
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,080
They capped it!

175
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,080
They're capping it.

176
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,080
Shibata must've thought he had to call it there.

177
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,690
Yeah, since Ano's on a rampage.

178
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,090
They put a stop to her rampage.

179
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:10,090
Reading the air of the room, Shibata stopped the action.

180
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,500
They were probably wondering how many times that hand was gonna go up.

181
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,600
She did have her hand up the most.

182
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,800
She had the overwhelming majority of hand-raises.

183
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,780
After ten minutes pass, they move onto the next one...

184
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,780
It's a chili pepper quiz!

185
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,280
A chili pepper quiz.

186
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,280
A chili pepper quiz?

187
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,290
The following ingredients are included in Yagenbori's seven-flavor spice blend:

188
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:41,290
Red pepper, roasted red pepper, poppy seed, hemp seed, sansho pepper, and black sesame.

189
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,500
What is the remaining, seventh ingredient?

190
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,500
This is a good question.

191
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,500
Okay, Moriyama.

192
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
* "Kou Shui Ji", a Sichuanese dish

193
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
Powdered mouthwatering chicken.*

194
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,600
It should probably be the other way around.

195
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,270
* Buddhist deity

196
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,270
Bishamonten.*

197
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,280
You're thinking of the seven gods of fortune.

198
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,880
There aren't any gods in a seven-spice blend.

199
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,180
Shibata's glasses.

200
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,390
Another company's seven-spice blend.

201
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,890
Ooh, that's good.

202
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:10,890
Okay, Nishida.

203
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,390
* Cigarette brand

204
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,390
Unrolled Red Larks.*

205
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,830
Would she even know?

206
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,830
Okay...Mishima!

207
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,830
Pine tar.

208
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,840
With these answers it's like we're on Panel Quiz Attack 25.

209
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,840
You said it so politely that I can't even be mad.

210
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,850
Ano-chan.

211
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,850
Unrolled Red Larks.

212
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,350
Unrolled Red Larks?

213
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,850
Unrolled...relarks.

214
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,720
Red Larks.
- Like, the cigarettes?

215
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,900
I wonder what the people watching it on air were thinking.

216
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,900
Unrolled Red Larks.

217
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,700
Just what the hell is this girl saying?

218
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,580
"Unrolled Red Larks" do not appear in any of the quizzes today.

219
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,180
That kind of pissed him off.

220
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,790
The red part of a 7 Bamboo tile.

221
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,590
Ano-chan.

222
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,800
The red part of a 7 Bamboo tile.

223
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,800
7 Bamboo? Like, in Mahjong?

224
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,240
The top part.

225
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,100
Give it a rest, will you?

226
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,180
Did you bring a fifty-something writer with you here?

227
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,550
He got us!

228
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,850
He's catching on! Oh man.

229
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,950
What are you going for here, exactly?

230
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,730
That 7 tile though...

231
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,860
The studio went totally quiet.

232
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,570
Ms. Yada's shaved-off gums.

233
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,970
Okay, we're getting pretty close. Here's a hint:

234
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,970
It's something you'd find at the supermarket.

235
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:10,980
Ms. Yada.

236
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,980
White sesame?

237
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,980
It is not white sesame.

238
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,280
Although sesame is often included.

239
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Ano-chan.

240
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,280
Ms. Yada's shaved-off gums.

241
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,190
It would be no big deal if Kuu said it, but...

242
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,090
The atmosphere's getting so intense.

243
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,000
This is getting crazy.

244
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,700
Ano-chan...

245
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,100
I think, uh...

246
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,870
maybe you should leave?

247
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,100
There's no way.

248
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,500
It's a bit much, so early in the morning...

249
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,470
"So early in the morning!"

250
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,080
It's the skin of a fruit.

251
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,480
We've really come to a halt here. Nothing like this has happened before...

252
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,020
Unrolled Red Larks

253
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,990
The red part of a 7 Bamboo tile

254
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,330
Ms. Yada's shaved-off gums

255
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,230
A superb triple combo from Ano-chan.

256
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:14,740
After all she'd done to the studio already, what could be in store next?

257
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Go ahead.

258
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,040
Mandarin.

259
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,640
Mandarin, that's correct!

260
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,050
They're getting away!

261
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,250
Hey, c'mon now...

262
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,050
Shibata made a clean escape.

263
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,890
He won't let it to get any crazier that it is now.

264
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,720
Shibata might be the most freaked out of them all.

265
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,590
He's thinking this girl is really nuts.

266
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,530
She's a menace.

267
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,100
Nobody else gets a chance to talk.

268
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,400
And then, during the pre-recorded segment with Suwehiro Garizu...

269
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,170
Do you know about colored contacts?

270
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,880
You mean ----?

271
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,580
----- colored contacts.

272
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,580
Now, we have a question for Mitorizu's Moriyama!

273
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,790
What sort of Japanese reference did Mishima come up with to explain color contacts?

274
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,490
* manga character based on eyeball yokai

275
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,490
Medama-no-oyaji...*

276
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,500
changing his clothes. Something like that.

277
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,530
That's pretty good.

278
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,540
You have seven seconds to answer. Go ahead!

279
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,540
A colorated pupil...

280
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,550
A colorated pupil donning twelve-layer kimono.

281
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,550
Oh, well...

282
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,150
Better try again!

283
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,580
Ano-chan!

284
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,950
Oh, here it comes!

285
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,320
Medama-no-oyaji changing his clothes.

286
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,930
Medama-no-oyaji changing his clothes.

287
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,830
Medama-no-oyaji changing his clothes.

288
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,430
That's great.

289
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,340
We did it!

290
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,740
He even said it was great!

291
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,350
We just witnessed something incredible.

292
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,850
I'm getting such a rush.

293
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,250
Look at Moriyama's face!

294
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,220
Not a single laugh!

295
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,120
Embarassing.

296
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,330
Medama-oyaji changing his clothes.

297
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,730
Playing not only the mischief-maker,

298
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,340
but a hard lined oogiri talent,

299
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,740
Ano-chan continues to surprise and impress.

300
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,740
You mean a color-plated pupil?

301
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,850
Weak.

302
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,550
The answer was "medama-oyaji changing his clothes."

303
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,850
Damn.

304
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,850
The real answer was weak!

305
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,240
About one and a half hours have passed since the program began.

306
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,840
Okay, now it's time for a banana juice-quiz.

307
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,340
Here it comes.

308
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,540
This brings us to the last quiz of the day.

309
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:13,550
To make banana juice like you saw in pre-recorded footage earlier,

310
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,550
what special step do you have to take?

311
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,330
*Keiji Muto, Japanese pro wrestler

312
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,330
Ice Muto's knee.

313
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,530
Moriyama.

314
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,530
* Referring to a joke from Tomonori Jinnai that bombed

315
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,530
All you need is to buy a D'agostini every month.

316
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,940
You just add a little bit in each month.

317
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,840
Might get a discount with your first order.

318
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,870
Okay, moving on. Ano-chan?

319
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,180
Ice Keiji Muto's knee.

320
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,180
- Use Keiji Muto's knee?

321
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,180
Ice his knee.

322
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,580
Yeah, that's not it.

323
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,790
They didn't take it.

324
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,290
He's looking pissed.

325
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,590
Kasuga.

326
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,890
Let the old guy at the store chew it up for you.

327
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,100
Let the old guy at the store chew it up for you.

328
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,800
How about calling it a day?

329
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,670
Every one of your answers is disgusting.

330
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,680
How's Kawashima really feeling?

331
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,580
Probably angry.

332
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,780
He really manages to keep it all under control.

333
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,190
And with that, the quiz comes to an end.

334
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,190
Answer: mash it with a wooden mallet

335
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,390
But finally...

336
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,900
Before we go, we have a little something for our viewers:

337
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,200
an auspicious keyword, this time as conveyed by Ano.

338
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,900
Oh, there's more!

339
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,870
A keyword?

340
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,840
We could say the dumbest thing.

341
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,240
Okay guys, do your worst.

342
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,450
We're gonna come up with some keywords for you, Ano.

343
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,650
There's a lot of content to pick up on from today's show.

344
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,950
I wonder if this'll work.

345
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,950
How about "Kakko-Integra?"

346
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,920
* cool + Integra, pun said by Michael J Fox in famous Honda Integra ad

347
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,630
That takes me back.

348
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,830
Moriyama's D'agostini.

349
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,330
I know, I couldn't believe he went there either.

350
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,070
Everyone just looked the other way.

351
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,070
And so...

352
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:18,780
We look forward to seeing our viewers use the keyword in your retweets from the program's official twitter page.

353
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,780
And now for the keyword:

354
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,780
Ano-chan, if you would!

355
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,780
Here's the keyword.

356
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,790
Moriyama's D'agostini.

357
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,890
She's ragging on you!

358
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,890
That was my answer, wasn't it?

359
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,690
He got ragged on by the kid.

360
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,660
What is the keyword for, exactly?

361
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,170
Well it's usually not a comment that cuts so deep.

362
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,970
I thought nobody'd remember that.

363
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,970
Everyone, please write "Moriyama's D'agostini" in your tweets.

364
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,270
Nobody's gonna get it, right?

365
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,280
They don't know about the banana juice.

366
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,280
And that concludes our keyword segment.

367
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,580
I wish I could read his mind right now.

368
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,320
He got burned.

369
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,320
And with that, the broadcast ended smoothly.

370
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,920
Okay everyone, that's a wrap!

371
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,530
And now, to reveal the prank...

372
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,070
Huh?

373
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,140
What's all this?

374
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,110
That was really something.

375
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,680
Wait, what? Now I'm really scared.

376
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,520
How was today's Love It?

377
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,720
I mean...it was pretty funny, but...

378
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,330
no, really, what's going on here?

379
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,030
What was the funniest part?

380
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,030
Probably the end, where Tamura came out.

381
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,830
Okay sure, but how about the rest?

382
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,900
The whole show, we mean.

383
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,070
You can't just burst into the studio like this...

384
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,070
I'm still kind of in shock.

385
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,370
Do you understand why we're here?

386
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,980
Huh?

387
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,680
With TBS?

388
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,080
What day is it today?

389
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,180
Wednesday.

390
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,880
Wednesday!

391
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,690
Which means...

392
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,890
Wait, this is Wednesday Downtown?

393
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,090
A pleasure to work with you.

394
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,890
What? What was it? Or who?

395
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,560
There was a weird atmosphere, right?

396
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,970
Well yeah, to be honest...

397
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,640
there was, but...

398
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,070
Speaking personally...

399
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,970
Halfway through, I was too afraid to say a word, actually.

400
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,980
I mean, these insane oogiri answers just came one after another.

401
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,280
I was so freaked out I couldn't raise my hand.

402
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,180
Right?

403
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,180
It's true.

404
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,690
Wait, Ano?

405
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,390
Ano was really you guys?

406
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:52,700
A theory that poses: if the female guest on "Love It!" were remote-controlled by an army of comedians, she would steal all the laughs from the regulars.

407
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,500
We've proven it to be true.

408
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,800
It took all of you to prove it?

409
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,400
That's one hell of a team!

410
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,070
"Unrolled Red Larks" was him.

411
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
So it was you.

412
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,180
Red Larks was the weirdest answer of them all.

413
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,680
So that's it.

414
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,080
I was really freaked out.

415
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,290
And who was "Moriyama's D'agostini?"

416
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,990
"Moriyama's D'agostini" was me.

417
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,890
That was some hard shade you threw.

418
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,390
That one really was cruel.

419
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,400
But your cleanest hit was "medama-no-oyaji."

420
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,400
This is your medama-no-oyaji, right here.

421
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,370
That came really out of left field.

422
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,070
Shibata kept giving the right answers, so...

423
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,280
We were like, "don't let 'em get away!"

424
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,780
Usually we comedians don't give straight answers, but...

425
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,180
but Ano's answers left us with no choice.

426
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,890
We thought things would fall apart if we didn't.

427
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,590
They were trying to wrap it up.

428
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,790
So, then...what do make of the theory?

429
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,390
I would say it's been substantiated.

430
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,860
That really was scary.

431
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:10,870
Thank you for tuning in to this special broadcast of Love It!, an Oogiri show airing on TBS from 8:00AM!
