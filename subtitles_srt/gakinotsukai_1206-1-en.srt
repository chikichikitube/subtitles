00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,120
Hey guys, apparently Hamada is quite confident this time

Tsukitei Hōsei

12
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,470
He said he would get the right one so quickly

13
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,650
No, that's not gonna happen

15

100 thousand yen will be given as a prize for correct answer, and a punishment for the wrong one!

16
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:37,330
Drink one non-alcoholic beer while blindfolded, and find the right one among 12 kinds,

Kiki Non-Alcoholic Beer

18
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,450
Yanaoka (staff member) was saying that Hamada is amazing

19
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,820
He said it can't be possible

20
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:40,370
So I have always been the last challenger so far, but today I want Hamada to be the last

21
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,850
Oh, so he's gonna go the last?

22
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,750
Yes let him go last

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,370
Let me be the first challenger today

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,220
This is the first time for me

25
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,020
You are the first!

26
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,020
You will be the first challenger then!

27
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,120
So, what about your experience?

28
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,800
Have you ever tried non-alcoholic beer?

29
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,120
I think I drink it about once a week

30
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,220
But I suppose you don't particularly choose "non-al" beer?

31
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,220
This is "Non-alcoholic beer"

32
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,150
Don't give it a shortened name like "Hama-sho"

33
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,800
Note: Hamada Shogo is a famous Japanese singer.

34
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,850
"Hamada Shogo", ok?

35
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,950
Non-alcoholic beer is a sparkling drink with beer flavor

36
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:16,040
Non-alcoholic Beer

37
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:16,040

We strictly picked 12 non-alcoholic beers which have 0% of alcohol

40
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,900
For the first challenger, Matsumoto

41
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,720
Premium Alcohol Free

42
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,720

47
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,700
It has a rich taste which is quite close to the real beer

48
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,850
Ok, here I come...

49
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,770
Are you familiar with the taste?

50
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,500
I've tried this before!!

51
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,500
You have tried it huh?

52
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,500
You know the taste!

53
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,370
Yeah, tried it before

54
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,910
It's unexpectedly bitter...

55
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,820
I feel this challenge will be easy

56
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,270
It's gonna be so easy to be picked, otherwise I'm just an idiot

57
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,320
Yeah we will be happy if you get the right one by first challenge

58
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,350
Staff of Gaki are famous among TV industry

59
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,350
As they are a bunch of morons

60
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,600
Everybody's saying so

61
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,500
Who's saying so?

62
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,220
Even just ordinary housewives are saying so too

63
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,050
Staff of Gaki no Tsukai are morons?

64
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,020
Yes most of them are morons

70
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,720
First challenge is the toughest

71
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,250
I didn't know that the opening challenge is that hard

72
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,550
Yes and you can't see how the atmosphere changes

73
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,770
I said bad things about the staff a while ago

74
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,870
the atmosphere got even more awkward...

75
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,450
Yes their attitude is cold

76
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,850
They must be so pissed

77
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,170
They are so mad

78
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,950
They must be thinking that we are disrespecting them

79
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,300
They are such morons that they take us seriously...

80
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,370
You're ruining the atmosphere again!

81
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,100
They are not taking it seriously

82
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,600
Let me try this

83
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,800
"Ion Top Value", I think I haven't tried this yet. This is the first time for me

89
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,400
This is absolutely not

90
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,370
Its sweetness and bitterness are utterly different from the one I had

91
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,450
I am absolutely sure about it

92
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:25,770
What I drunk was not "Ion Top Value Barreal 3 Free"!

94
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,270
I am not impressed at all

95
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,620
Was it completely different?

96
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,550
That bitterness...Let me try this "Asahi Dry Zero". I think I might have tried this one

97
00:03:39,720 --> 00:04:16,620

102
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,050
Is it the one? But...

103
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,870
The one I had left a bit stronger bitterness on my tongue...

104
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,750
I better not pick this one!

105
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,870
The one I drunk was not "Dry Zero"!

106
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,100
Oh, give me a break... stop it

107
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,500
It was a long pause

108
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,620
Who the hell is controlling it? He's a real jerk!

109
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,850
This must not be the one...but I dare to try

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,900
I'm gonna try.

I just wanna keep eliminating. It might have the bitterness

116
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,990
It's exactly the same...

117
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,850
But the one I had remained its bitterness a bit longer

118
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,200
I think this is not the one I had!

119
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:13,420
The one I drunk was not "Sapporo Premium Alcohol Free Black"!

120
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,420
They always take time...

121
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,670
They are absolutely merciless

122
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,220
I suspect he must be someone who had left this job

123
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,870
And yet he is placed in quite a crucial position now

124
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,500
Even though he resigned

125
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,570
Ok it's gonna be pretty tough

126
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,520
Even Orion Beer has this kind

127
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,820
BINGO!!!

128
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,050
You reacted as if you just noticed the Orion product!

129
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,370
I noticed it! Your face is a bit red!!

130

Why the hell are you like that?

131
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,820
So what?

132
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,700
So...?

133
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,500
You didn't know that Orion has it. You just realized it now, right?

134
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,400
I got you

135
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,170
I got you

136
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,000
You will be punished by Hamada later

137
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,200
No way!

138
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,940
Tanaka must be so nervous now

139
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,720
You must be thinking of what will happen after filming

140
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,370
He's gonna beat me up?

German beer's ridiculous bitterness

181
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,970
The bitterness that was brought by German beer

182
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,120
We have no idea how it tastes

183
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,750
I'm glad Tanaka is laughing

Sorry but I'm gonna get this out

204

241
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,120
Then I will find the average taste

242
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,950
No, it's not the one

243
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,220
it simply has the different taste

244
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,000

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:51,570

262

00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,320

366

But it's getting funny

379
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,050
I was kinda surprised at the moment though

380
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,620
If he does that once again, I might be laughing a lot

381
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:44,370

He's pathetic...

394
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,220
Look at Endo's face...

395
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,650
That's really messed up

396
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,170
No, it's not the one

397
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,870

He's such a challenger...

407
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,100
No, that's not gonna happen

408
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,450
He's so fearless...

409
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,470
No I don't think he's gonna do it...

410
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,520

459
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,320
May I try this Belgian one?

471
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,070

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,270
The one I drunk was not Kumamoto Free

529
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,670
Is he sleepy?

530
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,770
He's getting sleepy

531
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,150
He's almost falling asleep

532
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,050
Huh?

533
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,750

You have to declare!

550
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,000
You should say "I'm gonna drink this"

551
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,720
Yeah don't just pick

552
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,970
The one I drunk was not RYUMA...

553
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,570
Ryouma!

554
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,570
Ryouma!

555
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,650
It's messed up!

556
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,900
Hey, don't screw around!

557
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,200
He's screwed up

558
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,600
What's RYUMA?

559
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:30,050
You were just playing around with Ryouma though

560
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,550
And it was actually Ryouma

561
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:39,900
You are...

562
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:39,900
You are...

563
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:39,900
You are...

564
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,900
ZERO percent as a human!!

565
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,900
ZERO percent as a human!!

566
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,900
ZERO percent as a human!!

567
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,370
That's no good!!

568
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,350
That was way too long!

569
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:03,000
Hamada often drinks Non-Alcoholic Beer

570
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:12,870
His Beer is Asahi Dry Zero, which has similar feelings to the throat and dry taste that Asahi Super Dry has

571
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,930
Asahi Dry Zero

572
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,930
(Asahi Beer)

573
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,930

574
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,930

576
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,470
I feel the same as Tanaka. What's the main clue?

577
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,070
I think it's bitterness...

578
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,520
Yes, bitterness

579
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,550
Right

580
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,820
It doesn't have much bitterness though

581
00:21:35,760 --> 00:23:17,390
Asahi Dry Zero

582
00:21:35,760 --> 00:23:17,390

Same as Housei, I have tried this and this

586
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,420
I definitely have

587
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,000
But I didn't feel it as the same...

588
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,070
Did you feel it as if you had it for the first time?

589
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,470

The taste is still on my tongue

620
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,770
It's his first trial

621
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,170
It's very important

622
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,620
Yes it is

623
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,370
He's tasting...

624
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
I have no idea

625
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,800
huh?

626
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,800
He's smiling

627
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,800
He's so smiling...

628
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,570
I am so confused more than you think

629
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:43,470
I didn't sense the bitterness...I just felt its sparkling texture

630
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,670
I don't argue if someone says this is it

631
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,820
I don't argue if someone says it's not the one

632
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,080
He reminds me of Mori Shinichi (singer)

633
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,400
Yeah he reminds me of him

634
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,570
He's trying to antagonize Endo...

635
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,000
But it must be not the one!

636
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:15,600
The one I drunk was not Asahi Dry Zero!

637
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,050
You picked the right one!

638
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,100
You are amazing!

639
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:31,320

Seriously?

641
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,950
You are unbelievable

642
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:38,370
You don't drink beer

643
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:38,370
You don't drink beer

644
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:38,370
You don't drink beer

645
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,370
But Mugichai (Barley tea)!

646
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,370
But Mugichai (Barley tea)!

647
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,370
But Mugichai (Barley tea)!

648
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,670
That's long!

649
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,870
Seriously??

650
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,000
You picked the right one first!

651
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,820
It was amazing to see you reaching it

652
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,120
I thought "Oh he got that!"

653
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,400
I thought he's got luck

654
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,450
Absolutely

655
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,820
No way...

656
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,900
It's hard to tell the difference

657
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,200
I don't find any difference as you said
