1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,000
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,000
What's with that voice?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,360
"Absolutely Tasty - I've always wanted to try this": Tapioca championship!

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,210
I didn't like that at all

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,090
Endo Shozo

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,090
Hamada Masatoshi

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,090
Matsumoto Hitoshi

8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,090
Tanaka Naoki

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,090
Tsukitei Hosei

10
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,210
He spoke so softly

11
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,260
There was no passion in it

12
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,730
You just told me last week I'm too loud

13
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,670
You sounded like an average man in his fifties

14
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,200
If I speak too loud it's gonna echo all around

15
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,200
A typical man in his fifties

16
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,360
You know, people watching this show are expecting a man in his twenties

17
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,360
He's right

18
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,960
Today is a new Absolutely Tasty episode in a while, about Tapioca

19
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,490
Tapioca became really popular lately

20
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,790
Last year, a record-breaking tapioca boom surfaced

21
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,190
Now that it's fading a bit, it's time to observe its new possibilities

22
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:53,970
Today, our members will try 2 new Tapioca recipes each

23
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,340
How much tapioca have you had till now?

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,110
I had it before

25
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,540
Yamazaki seems to enjoy it, am I right?

26
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,810
The one I like the most is tapioca milk tea

27
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,320
That's the most clichéd

28
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,550
They call this "tap'ing", right?

29
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,960
You don't like tap'ing?

30
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,950
I don't like it that much

31
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,190
You're such a geezer, dude

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,180
Let's start with Endo's new tapioca ideas

38
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,640
Let me show you my first ingredient

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,190
Here it is

40
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,000
It's a tapioca-paella

41
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,600
A paella, huh?

42
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:46,280
he plans on replacing rice with tapioca pearls

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
As you know I've been doing this show "hirunandesu" for a while

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,300
So we always wonder what's popular at the moment

45
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,120
We get all the info we can and try to catch each trend

46
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,300
And I was thinking, we haven't hit this yet

47
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,500
And I think the most important thing is to have girls like it

48
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,160
If they don't, it will never get popular

49
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,410
It's not like we plan on starting a shop, you know

50
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,870
It's not about that, it should be what you wanted to try

51
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,870
Yeah but, I wanted to try it

52
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,840
But if I had to do it in the first place, I wish it would get popular

53
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,840
Shut up and do it

54
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,910
Well, he's right

55
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,420
Man, I really hated the Endo during this timespan

56
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,960
Time to start cooking

57
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,560
First, he'll fry some chopped onions until they become amber-colored

58
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,600
[SFX: glance]

59
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,730
Alright...

60
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,100
It's time to pour our main ingredient inside

61
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,100
What are you glancing at?

62
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,390
add the previously boiled tapioca pearls and stir-fry again

63
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,490
You can tell he's not doing this for himself

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,490
That's not true at all

65
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,140
Such a bad attitude

66
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,330
It happens to AV actresses too

67
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:46,110
You know? When they glance around 'cause they're uncomfortable

68
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,110
I hate when they do that

69
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,380
Just focus, goddamn!

70
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,450
He used the tapioca pearls instead of rice, then added saffron, turmenic and consommé

71
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,440
Lastly, he adds olives and seafood such as squid and shrimp

72
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,180
Thank  you

73
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,960
Now, we place the lid

74
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,400
And we wait for roughly 2 minutes

75
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,420
Endo's second recipe is an extremely simple one

76
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,000
What I had in mind is to have this accompany the paella one

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,330
And here it is

78
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,420
Brown-sugar tapioca beer

79
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,040
Previously I told Yamazaki the milk tea is a cliché

80
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,060
But if we add this sweet tapioca to a beer...

81
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,090
Don't you think... it's going to be a perfect match?

82
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,040
Is it going to be sweet?

83
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,040
Sweet, you say?

84
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,120
It's really simple

85
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,710
What's with this color?

86
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,710
It's brown sugar

87
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,740
It seems Instagrammable enough, though

88
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,740
Yeah, girls would love this

89
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,950
Just like a tapioca milk tea, you enjoy it with a straw

90
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,940
And now it's time to taste Endo's first idea, "Tapioca Paella"

91
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,940
Endo's Idea

92
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,940
Tapioca Paella

93
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,940
I must say, it smells good

94
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,880
Not bad, huh?

95
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,880
It smells the same as paella

96
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,360
There are some crispy ones too

97
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,080
Let's try this

98
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,080
They kept their shape nicely

99
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't hate it that much

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,510
It tastes nice

101
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,510
I must say, onion...

102
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,960
Was a really good choice here

103
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,960
Yeah, I put in a lot of it

104
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,710
This can be a thing

105
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,000
It's not bad, I agree

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,430
And together with this dish

107
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,320
Endo's Idea

108
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,320
Tapioca Beer

109
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,070
This one?

110
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,300
You can drink your brown-sugar tapioca beer

111
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,460
Maybe it makes it more easy to drink

112
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,900
It's so good!

113
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,130
Don't you think it's good?

114
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,130
It's just beer

115
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,230
Not really that good

116
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,230
Are you kidding me?

117
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,910
To be honest, this sucks

118
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,880
It sucks?!

119
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,350
It takes away that desire you have to gulp it all down at once

120
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,650
It's an obstacle to the beer itself

121
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,640
How should we judge this, guys?

122
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:11,220
They'll score each dish by discussion, with 10 points as the highest score

123
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,840
Well

124
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Seven

125
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,090
Thank you

126
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,090
That's pretty high

127
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,980
I think it's around seven

128
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,220
You think so?

129
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,490
He placed it in front on me with such confidence, I was like what?

130
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,330
But when he told me to eat it, I dug it

131
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,700
Even still...

132
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,350
I think it's around 3 or 4

133
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,700
3 points

134
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,700
Tapioca Paella

135
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,350
Four, yeah

136
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,770
That low?

137
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,870
This time I'm supporting you, Endo

138
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,620
I think it can be higher than that

139
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,780
But it seems today everyone's condition isn't that good

140
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,450
Did something happen at home?

141
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,990
What about the beer?

142
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,710
I'm not lying, this one is a two

143
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,080
Really?

144
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,080
I agree, two for me too

145
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,730
2 points

146
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,730
Tapioca Beer

147
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,780
We can all agree to this  - It's an insult to beer

148
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,930
Really? I could easily get drunk to this

149
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,930
Next up we have Hamada's ideas for tapioca recipes

150
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,770
My first recipe is going to be a very plain one

151
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,820
Plain?

152
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,860
Here it is

153
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,990
Asazuke?

154
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:09,000
note: a pickling method, usually done with vegetables (tsukemono)

155
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,140
An asazuke-tapioca

156
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,480
Tsukemono?

157
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,480
He's making a tsukemono

158
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,480
He's making a tsukemono

159
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,760
I'm gonna pour 'em inside this bag

160
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,990
I'm looking forward to the crispy texture, if asazuke works

161
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,810
It's simple, I'm adding this too

162
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,810
That's the standard method

163
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,540
Looks like you're making some nasty stuff

164
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,480
That's one heck of a vision

165
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,480
I'm not, dude

166
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,430
I mean, the way he's doing this...

167
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,510
I wonder if he's gonna be okay if the police see this?

168
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,660
Hamada's second idea is a tapioca-filled hamburg steak

169
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,760
First off he'll chop some onions

170
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,250
I've been told if you cut it this way, it's easier to chop

171
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,090
Who said that?

172
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,220
Someone...

173
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,520
Not your wife?

174
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,260
Right, my wife

175
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,130
What a complex way to phrase it

176
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,010
I mean, you asked me "who", so--

177
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,730
What's wrong?

178
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,800
Don't point that knife at me

179
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,430
Knives are bad
- That was scary

180
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,370
He said "someone"...

181
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,370
I know that

182
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,060
How can we eat that?!

183
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,060
No way

184
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,540
You have to cut it properly

185
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,080
He's not even trying

186
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,080
How can we eat that?

187
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,190
The knife isn't reaching the board

188
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,520
Look, it's not touching it

189
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,990
Feels like he's worried about damaging the cutting board

190
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,090
When he doesn't give a shit about damaging people

191
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,340
Next up, he's going to add minced meat, breadcrumbs, egg, and salt & pepper to the chopped onion

192
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,040
And lastly, I'm adding tapioca pearls

193
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,820
How will this turn out?

194
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,850
I'm worried about its texture

195
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,850
Yeah, me too

196
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,220
I have no idea

197
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,100
There's a lot of them

198
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,590
I've added lots of them

199
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,970
More than expected

200
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,120
Oh, he's ready

201
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,880
That's the sound

202
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,400
Lastly, he covers it in flour so it won't crumble, and it's now time to cook it

203
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,290
Make it firm

204
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,300
Hot!

205
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,770
Hot!

206
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,750
What's hot?

207
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,150
He touched it

208
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,950
He touched the frying pan?

209
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,950
Yeah, his fingers

210
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,430
What are you doing?

211
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,590
He was making sure it wouldn't jump out

212
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,260
Yeah

213
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,230
Let's see how his first dish "tapioca-asazuke" turned out

214
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,890
The asakuze was prepared ahead, rested for one night

215
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,100
Don't say it

216
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,570
If my wife would bring this to the table at dinner, I'd snap

217
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,240
What's this?!

218
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,240
That's too much

219
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,710
It's just asazuke

220
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,060
Let's eat up

221
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,240
What's this?

222
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,960
It's so sticky!

223
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,260
It's lacking salt

224
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,490
Feels like the salt has been completely sucked away

225
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,520
This tapioca

226
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:14,160
1 point

227
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:14,160
Tapioca asazuke

228
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,280
Sucks so bad

229
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,160
It feels like...

230
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,700
Chewing a vinyl figure's finger

231
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,170
You've done it before?

232
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,690
Hamada's Idea

233
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,690
Tapioca Hamburg

234
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,690
Next up is Hamada's tapioca-hamburg

235
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,120
Let's eat it as it is at first

236
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,480
Simply

237
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,480
Yeah, don't add any sauce

238
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,950
Let's eat it

239
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,290
What do you think? Isn't it far from tapioca?

240
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,160
It's not bad...

241
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,160
Really?

242
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,760
What do you think?

243
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,760
I hate it

244
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,660
I don't really like this

245
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,530
Endo-kun, you seem to be enjoying it

246
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,770
Yeah, I love it

247
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:53,440
Don't call him "Endo-kun", you'll scare him

248
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,740
I like it too

249
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,740
Really? Nice

250
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,200
It depends on how much tapioca you get in a bite

251
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,200
I see

252
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,340
I think kids would really like it...

253
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,730
But we're not doing this to satisfy kids

254
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,750
Why is he so angry?

255
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,320
We're a bunch of old dudes

256
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,520
We're all old dudes and we're all sayin' it's good

257
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,280
But my old-dude-self disagrees

258
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,930
Ok, Matsumoto-old-dude says no

259
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,570
But every other old dude is saying yes

260
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,570
We old dudes liked it

261
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,990
I hate to say it, but it's good

262
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,760
8 points

263
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,760
I just thought...

264
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,760
Tapioca Hamburg

265
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,520
It could also work as an hamburger

266
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,310
Of course it does, it's an hamburg

267
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,140
You just have to insert it between buns

268
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,650
I mean, its texture...

269
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,380
The tapioca's tapsture----

270
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,390
And now it's time to reveal Tanaka's tapioca ideas

271
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,390
Here's my first dish

272
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,840
There's a load of 'em

273
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,000
It'll be a tapioka-kake-gohan

274
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:57,000
note: tamago-kake-gohan is steamed rice with a raw egg mixed in, usually with soy sauce too. A simple yet tasty dish.

275
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,610
But with no rice?

276
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,880
We'll use it instead of rice, simple as that

277
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,370
Tapioca instead of rice?

278
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,840
Tapioca instead of rice

279
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,840
This will be our "rice"

280
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,840
So it's basically kake-tapioca?

281
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,810
It's time to boil it

282
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,250
You're boiling it?!

283
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,040
Not like that?

284
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,040
Not raw?

285
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,100
We had to cook it first

286
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,350
This is reckless

287
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,480
Is it gonna be ok?

288
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,560
How much water?

289
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,410
I made it so it matches the pearls' quantity

290
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,670
After it's done, we can enjoy it like a kake-gohan

291
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,170
You like tamago-kake-gohan, don't you?

292
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,170
Yeah I mean, everyone does

293
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,260
Now we just press the "cook" button here

294
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,010
And we just have to wait until it's done

295
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,040
30 minutes later

296
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,480
I'm not sure myself how it's gonna turn out

297
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,550
How is the tapioca cooked inside the rice cooker going to look like?

298
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,410
Here I go, let's open it

299
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,560
It's the same

300
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,560
It's exactly how it was before

301
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,560
There's just less water

302
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,830
See? It became shiny

303
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,830
Don't say that as if it's rice

304
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,620
Is it rice?

305
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,330
It was shiny to begin with

306
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,350
The freshly-cooked tapioca is placed in bowls

307
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,840
Now just add the raw egg and it's done

308
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,840
Tanaka's second dish is a risky attempt

309
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,190
Here's my second dish

310
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,420
What's that?

311
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,880
I added food coloring to tapioca powder

312
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,710
And I mixed them

313
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:28,040
Now I'm gonna make some tapioca pearls with each of them

314
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,590
You're going for a party feeling?

315
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,600
You do it like this

316
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,780
Are they gonna be round?

317
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,780
Stupid question...

318
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,780
Yep

319
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,910
One by one, like this

320
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,440
I don't wanna eat those...

321
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,940
They're being given birth to on an old dude's hand...

322
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,040
Before recording this episode

323
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,280
Tanaka prepared a lot of colorful tapiocas

324
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,590
And how they look once boiled...

325
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,430
They changed quite a bit

326
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,910
They look really pretty

327
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,720
Now these are really Instagrammable

328
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,910
I know, right?

329
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,470
That's something Chad would eat

330
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,610
Chad Mullane would eat this

331
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,680
What are you gonna do with them?

332
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,480
I'm making an omurice with them

333
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,980
I'm---

334
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,000
This is too much, man

335
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,500
When the egg isn't solidified yet...

336
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,000
Pour the colorful tapiocas in it: then wrap it up and you're done

337
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,460
This looks really bad for your health

338
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,460
It's so pretty

339
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,500
Let's see how Tanaka's tamago-kake-tapioca is going to be

340
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,500
Tamago-kake-tapioca

341
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,500
Tanaka's Idea

342
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,280
Feel free to pour soy sauce on it

343
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,200
Over the egg

344
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,080
Just like a normal tamago-kake-gohan?

345
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,080
Yep, just like it

346
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,240
It looks disgusting

347
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,600
Eat it first, feel its texture

348
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,600
I won't say I hate it so much

349
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,390
Feels like your mom cooked the rice for too long

350
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,610
Ah, you mean when there's too much water in it?

351
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,230
It's the thing you eat when you catch a cold

352
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,550
And you don't have much of an appetite...

353
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:24,010
His second dish is the "rainbow tapioca omurice"

354
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,040
Rainbow Tapioca Omurice

355
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,040
Tanaka's Idea

356
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,600
Ready for this?

357
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,410
They came out, look!

358
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,550
Is this that german tabletop game!?

359
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,220
It's the game we played on Let's Play With Tabletop Games

360
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,850
It's flashy

361
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,450
They're kinda hard

362
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,870
It's not so bad...

363
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,870
Maybe it needed some more salt and pepper

364
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,440
How is it with ketchup on top?

365
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,180
It just tastes like ketchup

366
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:11,790
3 points

367
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:11,790
Rainbow Tapioca Omurice

368
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,870
You like it, right Hosei?

369
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,240
This kind of flashy food?

370
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,920
No

371
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,490
It sucks

372
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,500
And now it's time for Hosei's tapioca dishes ideas

373
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,920
Here's the first one

374
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,920
Here it is

375
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,490
Tapioca is made of cassava, which is a tuber

376
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,280
And we have its powder here

377
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,680
This has been mixed with curry powder

378
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,960
And this one is mixed with salt

379
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,780
So, what am I going to do?

380
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,110
We just take it as it is

381
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:43,840
He makes some curry & salt tapioca balls around 3cm in size

382
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,970
It's gonna change its texture as well

383
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,560
My tapioca pearls are going to be huge

384
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,280
I don't think they're that huge

385
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,560
And once you boil the freshly done tapioca balls for 20 minutes...

386
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,100
I'm gonna fry them

387
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,100
Fried?

388
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,000
I love potato fries

389
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,980
So I've been wondering what if I did the same?

390
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,790
Just like this

391
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,640
Gonna drop 'em all like this

392
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,560
And here they go

393
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:17,870
Shit

394
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,400
How are Hosei's tapioca-fries going to look like?

395
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,680
His second dish is a sweet made by using a banana

396
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,160
It's sweet to begin with, after all

397
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,160
Tapioca? Yes

398
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,490
First off, we peel the banana

399
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,600
You peel it off, ok

400
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,720
You have to be careful at this point

401
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,720
Why?

402
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,330
'Cause we're gonna reuse it later

403
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,610
The peel is important?

404
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,810
It is

405
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,600
So make sure to be careful at home while making this

406
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,600
As if anyone would

407
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,110
Then he mixed the banana with tapioca powder in the mixer...

408
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,540
Mix it up good like this

409
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,920
Then forms it into a banana shape

410
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,680
This is the point

411
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:11,610
When it's the most Instagrammable, so make sure to snap a pic

412
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:16,280
"It'S tHe MoSt InStAgRaMmAbLe, So MaKe SuRe To SnAp A pIc"

413
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,250
If I had to choose between saying that or dying, I'd pick death

414
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,240
And it's not over: he also makes some smaller tapioca worms

415
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,500
Then he boils all of them together

416
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,870
Get ready to see Hosei's special arrangement!

417
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,860
Let's start by tasting Hosei's first dish: tapioca fries

418
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,120
They don't look bad

419
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,040
Kind of

420
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,830
Let's eat em as they are

421
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,120
Bon appetit

422
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,120
Fried-tapioca

423
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,140
So hard!

424
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,720
Delicious!

425
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,800
It's a mochi

426
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,800
Really

427
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,080
It's like a mochi

428
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,790
They can work as a sweet

429
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,930
Man, this makes you hyper-thirsty

430
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,930
Their flavor is too strong

431
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,840
Feels like eating curry roux

432
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,770
2 points

433
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,770
Tapioca fries

434
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
You're right

435
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,140
You have to drink a whole water dispenser for one of these alone

436
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,100
Here's his second dish: how is it going to look like?

437
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,310
Here goes

438
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,010
Hosei's second dish is a sweet made of banana and tapioca powder

439
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,800
How is it going to look like?

440
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,320
Here it is

441
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,520
What the hell is this?

442
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,720
Grotesque banana

443
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,420
But it's delicious

444
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,170
Grotesque Tapioca Banana

445
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,170
Hosei's Idea

446
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,340
What's with the grotesque image?

447
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,570
You know they have those gummy worms in America, right?

448
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:57,440
So kids eat them and their parents are like "what are you eating, bugs?!"

449
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,170
That's how they play pranks on their friends' parents

450
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,650
So I want all of you to go back to your child self

451
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,230
So you can surprise your parents with these

452
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,800
Surprise our parents? At this age?

453
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,300
How old are they?

454
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,800
I think around 86 years old

455
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,800
86 years old, huh?

456
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,060
How is this a good idea?

457
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,480
It tastes great, trust me

458
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,720
It really doesn't make me wanna eat it

459
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,250
But it's good once you eat it

460
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,670
You can't cut it at all

461
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,950
This is not ok

462
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,310
It's gonna chip your knife

463
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,360
It's so stiff

464
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,920
It really is

465
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,760
What's this?

466
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,160
Its elasticity is impressive

467
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,680
This is really something

468
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,780
So bad

469
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,560
Horrible

470
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,560
Disgusting

471
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,600
It's horrible

472
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,710
Tastes like the valve on a beach ball

473
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,310
It's just like that

474
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:03,550
Grotesque Tapioca Banana

475
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:03,550
Skull Mark

476
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,730
This is the worst

477
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,080
This is no good

478
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,580
So bad

479
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,590
And now we get to see Matsumoto's tapioca idea

480
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:13,890
First, I want you to see how it's going to look like once it's done

481
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,640
Here's how it looks like
- No need to cook?

482
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:23,020
Tapioca gunkan maki (salmon roe sushi)

483
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,320
This is...

484
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,320
Instead of salmon roe?

485
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,030
Of course there's also rice in it

486
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:28,670
I'm wondering if it's okay to put some wasabi on it

487
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,670
There's no need for it

488
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,880
Are we going to eat only this dish now?

489
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,770
Let's go to the table then

490
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,250
Take a look

491
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,430
Yeah, yeah...

492
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,430
We've seen it

493
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,200
wasabi

494
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,200
→

495
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,370
We're looking at it as we walk

496
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:48,240
Matsumoto's Idea

497
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:48,240
Tapioca gunkan maki

498
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,240
Let's jump right in into his first dish, "tapioca gunkan maki"

499
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,340
Here goes

500
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,900
Man, this is so gross...

501
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,140
This is the best

502
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,910
Maybe adding some soy sauce could make this stronger

503
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,910
Is that it?

504
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,550
Feels like eating salmon roe

505
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,550
Hear that?

506
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,890
He said it!!

507
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,090
I mean, the texture is the same as salmon roe

508
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,090
He clearly said it!!

509
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,600
I also thought of a hybrid, half salmon roe and half tapioca

510
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,230
Maybe it gets harder to tell which is which

511
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,230
Is there some roe?

512
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,900
Maybe it'll be hard to tell

513
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Oh, but...

514
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,820
See? Like this

515
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,640
Like this

516
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,140
Real salmon roe and tapioca

517
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,040
This is surprising

518
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,580
"Sworn enemies, same boat"

519
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:53,260
I took a bite of just the salmon roe half, and it tasted delicious

520
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,260
Of course it does

521
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,160
Tapioca gunkan maki's score is 5 points

522
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,010
Now, it's time for our last one, and I...

523
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:06,110
I chose to do something different from the usual, more party-themed

524
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:10,650
I prepared something you could enjoy at a festival

525
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,950
Matsumoto is going to show us a fun way to eat tapioca

526
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,340
Our last one

527
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Is a simple one

528
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,160
That's a tapioca milk tea

529
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,460
But I thought it may be nice to have it this way

530
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,490
Huh? That's--?

531
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,600
Here's nagashi-tapioca-milk-tea

532
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:37,600
note: based of nagashi-somen, noodles running down a water-filled bamboo log

533
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,000
Are we gonna suck 'em up with straws?

534
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,900
Exactly, each one of you is gonna suck them as they flow down

535
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,380
Isn't this really fun?!

536
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,510
I don't really know about that...

537
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,510
Guess we have to try it first

538
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,640
Let's go

539
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,640
Oh, here comes

540
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,160
This is milk tea, right?

541
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,330
Is it flowing down?

542
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,650
Having fun?

543
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,220
I don't know

544
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,270
Here they come!

545
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,560
Isn't Gaki no Tsukai fun?

546
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,510
I got so many of them

548
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,510
Yeah

549

Typesetting & QC by  RIDDELL (springmanRIDDELL))

550
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,680
I got way too many pearls

551
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,290
This is so good
