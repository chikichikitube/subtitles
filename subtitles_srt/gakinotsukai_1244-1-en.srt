4
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,020
I wrote these letters for me by myself

5
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:10,030
Hosei wrote fake thank-you letters the other members will read

6
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:10,030
Hosei wrote fake thank-you letters to surprise himself

7
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:10,030
It's Hosei's 47th birthday

8
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:10,030
It's Hosei's 47th birthday

9
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:19,500
You put my 100 yen lighter inside your pocket and gave me 10,000 yen

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,480
You told me you liked when I said "ho-ho-hoi"...

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,880
And you asked me: "ivory or Downtown, pick one"

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,520
Your words resonated in me so much I quit searching for ivory

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,890
Tonight, Matsumoto will read his (fake) letter for Hosei

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:50,000
Secret

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:50,000
A surprise guest will read their own letter

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,320
We'll also have a surprise guest with us

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,000
That's my precious memory...

18
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,000
I said it...

The Drunkards' Bar

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,400
Quit it, guys

23
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,520
Really, give me a break, I just can't

24
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,220
Mama

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,220

Tsukitei Hosei

28
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,210
Really, let's stop this

29
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,620
Cocorico

30
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,620

Hamada Masatoshi

33
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,820
I can't anymore

34
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,890
Cocorico

35
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,890
Tanaka Naoki

36
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,890
Let's call it a day

37
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,860
He's right, that's enough

38
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,060
This one will be our last one

39
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,060
Oh, come on!
- It's really gonna be our last one

40
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,570
I can't, guys...

41
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,740
How far are you planning to go?

42
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,620
Everyone read their own letter one after another,

43
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,540
but I don't have a fixed timing to read my own, so...

44
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,780
Oh man...
- That's something...

45
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,660
I mean, that's my plan
- I get it

46
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,990
It'd be bad if I don't have anything to read, right?

47
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,360
Come on guys, what's this? A prank?

48
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,160
Oh boy...

49
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,160
This is too much

50
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,800
Is this really happening?

51
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,480
Is this Gaki no Tsukai? It barely fits in!

52
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,380
What's with this episode?

53
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,640
But we're already here, so...
- Yeah, he's right

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,890
There's a lot we don't know
- Right

55
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,100
Here's Matsumoto's letter for his beloved junior

56
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,320
From Matsumoto to Hosei: a letter of gratitude

57
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,260
Dear Yamazaki,

58
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:38,440
To be honest, I never thought I'd be writing you a letter





in my entire life, let alone a letter of gratitude

59
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:45,350
If there's something I should be grateful to you for,





it's from the time Downtown had success in Tokyo

60
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:52,420
And I was at the peak of my popularity,





being featured in over 10 regular shows

61
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,590
But no one ever asked for my opinion,





I was nothing more than a yes-man

62
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:08,540
But only you, between all of them,





you told me, "are you an idiot, Matsumoto?"

63
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:17,550
You got near me with your usual friendly smile





and told me lots of funny stories everyday

64
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:32,930
When I looked at you, always behaving like that,





I thought "It would be nice to have a little brother like him"

65
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,800
I always thought of you as my little brother

66
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,640
One more thing,

67
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,810
I'm not sure if this is a thank you or an apology,

68
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:49,010
But five years ago, when we were walking down Roppongi...

69
00:03:49,010 --> 00:04:00,420
We got attacked by 5-6 gangsters, do you remember?

70
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,600
I was trembling with fear, my legs were shaking

71
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,470
But you suddenly jumped towards them

72
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,170
And you shielded me, saying "run away, Matsumoto!"

73
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,440
Sorry for running away, that day...

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,280
But then you came to my house

75
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:28,080
You told me "it's alright", with your face all swollen

76
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,960
And then you showed me again that friendly smile of yours

77
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:41,830
From that day on, I decided I needed to protect you,





and not the other way round, so I started working out

78
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:52,480
And now I'm friends with all the musclehead comedians

79
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,350
If you didn't show me your courage, that day

80
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:01,080
I don't think I'd be a muscle-comedian to this day

81
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,750
Thanks so much, Yamazaki

82
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,920
What the...

83
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,830
You chose to become a rakugoka, a wonderful job

84
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:18,070
You study so much and work really hard,





I'm sure you'll become a master in no time

85
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,370
And when that happens,





let me, your biggest fan, hear a rakugo story

86
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:31,180
And when I'll eventually stop being a comedian,





please stay with me as my brother

87
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:40,620
To my little brother, Tsukitei Hosei

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,620
Signed: Matsumoto Hitoshi, from Downtown

89
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,620
I see...
- I didn't know about that

90
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,400
That's news to me

91
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,960
I didn't know it

92
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,800
You really remember a lot of stuff, don't you

93
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,610
Your memories are really good

94
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,410
I have lots of things I've forgotten myself

95
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,410
You do?

96
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,110
Yeah

97
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,010
I may have forgotten about them, but you guys...

98
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,550
Just how many things do you remember?

99
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,220
It makes me think I should try to remember more

100
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,290
So I can reconfirm them all

101
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,180
Oh boy...

102
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,580
Were you...

103
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,940
Are you crying?

104
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,270
Did you come up with this together?

105
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,070
You decided this thing together?

106
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,600
It's one of those surprise shows, huh?

107
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,370
You all knew that, right?

108
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,080
Well, not exactly...

109
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,680
How can I put it...
- You did, didn't you?

110
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,610
Well, the shop is...

111
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,490
We're about to close here,
I don't think anyone else will be coming

112
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,150
Yeah, I guess so

113
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,360
Hey, are you still open?

114
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,360
Manabe Kaori

115
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,920
What now?

116
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,130
Here I am!
- Don't say it as if I knew it!

117
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,870
Staged dramatic episode:
Hosei's Fake Birthday Letters - Conclusion

118
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,440
Yeah, I guess so

119
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,840
Hey, are you still open?

120
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,900
What now?

121
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,410
Manabe Kaori

122
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,850
Here I am!   - Don't say it as if I knew it!

123
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,550
Sit down, please
- Can I?

124
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,050
How are you? Is everything alright?

125
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,420
Are you that familiar with him, Manabe?

126
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,600
Kinda

127
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,420
Don't worry about that

128
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,460
Try this oolong high

129
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,160
Alright, one oolong high

130
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,160
Sure

131
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,320
What the hell is happening, today?

132
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,430
Here
- Thanks

133
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,430
Come on, staff!

134
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,530
I didn't expect this guest, to be honest

135
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,400
I agree

136
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,580
- Can I drink it? Cheers, guys!

137
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,580
I'm gonna scold the staff, later

138
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,980
Cheers!
- Alright, alright, cheers I guess

139
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,810
Manabe's image doesn't really line up with Hosei's

140
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,980
But I'm glad she's here

141
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,250
I mean, this bar was getting pretty melancholic

142
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,120
I agree   - Oh, is that so?

143
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,590
Now she can liven up the mood a bit, I guess

144
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,620
Ah, I'm glad

145
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,300
Yeah, I agree

146
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,460
It's more lively now
- I'm glad, guys

147
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,560
After all today's... you know, Hosei?

148
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,130
It's your birthday, right?

149
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,130
That's right

150
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,270
It's his birthday
- Wow, she actually knows that

151
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,770
I really wanted to come here today

152
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:15,450
And since you're having this set up for today, I wanted to...

153
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:21,050
I wanted to let Hosei know about some things...

154
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,050
Oh my!

155
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,390
You meant that?!

156
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,740
Yeah, that's...

157
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,120
You came here for this?!

158
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,730
That's right

159
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,460
You tricked me again...

160
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,560
I thought it was a good moment, can I?

161
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,000
Did you write a letter?
- I did, actually

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So, can I read it?

163
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,570
I mean, she's here already, just listen to her

164
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,570
Oh my...

165
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,920
- Can I?

166
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,140
Alright, but please, read it cheerfully!

167
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,140
Alright, in a positive way!
- Yeah

168
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,150
The atmosphere got really tense in here, enough of that

169
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,500
I see

170
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,150
Alright

171
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,950
So read it cheerfully ok? Go!
- Sure

172
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,380
Dear Hosei,

173
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,760
We happen to meet frequently when we're working,

174
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,500
And I bet you think all we do is just say hi to each other

175
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,970
But it's not the same for me

176
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:21,740
To be honest, before I entered the showbiz,





I used to be your biggest groupie

177
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,550
My youth was painted in your colors, Hosei

178
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:33,360
As soon as I finished school,





I rushed my way towards the TV stations to see you

179
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,760
And I always checked every show





you could have popped up in

180
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:45,400
Black Pig Paradise

181
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:45,400
I especially liked "Kurobuta Tengoku" from Tokyo TV

182
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,940
And of course, I still have lots of Hosei-themed goods





in my parents' house

183
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,280
Tee-hee! How embarrassing!

184
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:02,450
Before entering college, I was scouted





by someone from the showbiz in Shibuya's Yoshinoya

185
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:07,390
And the first thing I thought was "I get to enter Hosei's world!"

186
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:17,830
And the first time I met Hosei in real life,





I was so nervous all I could do was watching you from a distance

187
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:24,470
That time you glanced over at me only once,





and that's my most treasured memory

188
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,910
Tee-hee! I actually said it!

189
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,850
From that moment on, we even shared some TV shows together,

190
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:39,260
But my girly heart was so nervous,





I couldn't talk to you at all

191
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:46,260
Oh, sorry, this was supposed to be a gratitude letter,





but it ended up being a sort of love letter

192
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,930
I'm sorry, tee-hee

193
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,930
m 0 -4 l 1 -6 l 3 -7 l 5 -7 l 6 -7 l 7 -7 l 8 -6 l 9 -5 l 10 -3 l 10 -1 l 9 2 l 7 5 l 2 9 l 0 11 l -7 5 l -9 2 l -10 0 l -10 -2 l -10 -4 l -9 -6 l -7 -7 l -5 -7 l -3 -7 l -2 -6 l -1 -5

194
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:56,770
There are lots of reasons for why I'm grateful to you,





but if I have to say one in particular

195
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:02,280
That would be the third time I met you while we were working

196
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,310
That day, you were kind of different...

197
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:12,520
I remember seeing you in a corner, looking cool,





typing a draft on your PC by yourself

198
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,760
When I looked at you like that...

199
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:23,200
I thought "that's right, maybe Hosei can get to know me





if it's through a PC!" and so I started my own blog

200
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:30,640
I always waited for the day Hosei would notice me,





and I kept updating my blog on a daily basis

201
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,580
And then, one day, the media started





referring to me as "the Blog Queen",

202
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,580
And I was able to get lots of job offers from that

203
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:49,230
That blog I've created just to be seen by you





changed my entire life forever...

204
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:56,870
Maybe it makes sense only inside my head,





but I'm really grateful for what you've done

205
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,840
You chose to become a rakugoka, a wonderful job

206
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,510
Rakugo? Again?
- Yeah...

207
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,240
I don't think you know this, but actually...

208
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:16,190
Truth be told, I snuck up several times to see you perform





your rakugo skits, and sometimes I waited for you outside...

209
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:25,290
Hosei, thank you for making me experience such youth

210
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,290
Signed: Manabe Kaori

211
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,100
I see...
- Come on...

212
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,340
I didn't know that's the story behind her blog

213
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,810
There's a lot we can't know, if we don't ask

214
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,810
That's right

215
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,610
I had no idea, really

216
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,020
I didn't realize

217
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,480
You really saved me, I owe you so much

218
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,920
You've been so good at hiding it

219
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,290
You were my groupie?

220
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,290
That's right

221
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:00,000
Since I was part of TEAM-0?

222
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,500
Yes, that's right

223
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,380
Since TEAM-0?!
- Since TEAM-0

224
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,260
But really, mama...

225
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,770
Let's call it a day, shall we?

226
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,610
Yeah, I'm running out of tears here

227
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,770
- Can I have this?

228
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,060
Thank you so much

229
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,240
More?!

230
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,250
Thank you so much

231
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,620
More?!

232
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,220
Shimoda Kageki

233
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,890
Seriously...
- You were here, huh

234
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,260
Hi there, Shimoda

235
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,160
It's been a while
- Indeed

236
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,660
Please, have a seat

237
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,200
So what do you...
- You too?

238
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,870
What do you want to drink?

239
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,870
- Let's see...

240
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,470
Sweet potato shochu, mixed with hot water

241
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,870
Sweet potato shochu...

242
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,470
Sweet potato shochu, huh?
- With hot water, please

243
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,310
He's a pro at writing, isn't he?

244
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,680
That's right, he's a professional

245
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,780
Cheers
- Nice atmosphere

246
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,950
Here's to you

247
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,590
Cheers, cheers

248
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,260
This is a surprise

249
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,260
Really?
- What brings you here?

250
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,560
Can I read you something?

251
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,560
No way...

252
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,330
Whatever, please...

253
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,800
I have no idea about his relation with Yama-chan

254
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,550
I didn't know they knew each other
- That's news to me

255
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,510
To my dear Hosei-chan,

256
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:32,260
Hosei-chan, it's been almost 3 years since we last met,





how have you been doing since?

257
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,390
Today I'm here to tell you how grateful I am to you,

258
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,000
But I want to start by recalling our memories together

259
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,100
Me and Hosei-chan first met around 20 years ago

260
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,440
We had this episode in which





I appeared inside your fantasy

261
00:14:52,480 --> 00:15:00,580
And we slapped each other,





and in the end, we kissed. That was it

262
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:06,820
That time, we parted our ways without getting any closer,

263
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:13,800
But we had a miraculous second encounter





at the hair salon we both went to

264
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,670
And then, Hosei-chan, you suddenly told me...

265
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:26,940
"I happen to know a clothing store which I think





is perfect for your tastes, wanna go there with me?"

266
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,850
And so we went shopping together

267
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:38,390
It was a shop in Nippori full of fancy stuff,





some of those clothes were a bit showy

268
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:49,000
And there, you bought me fishnet stockings,





which were perfect for my tastes

269
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:58,410
From that day on everything else happened so naturally,





and in the end, we started living together

270
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:08,150
The life I shared with you was really exciting

271
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:16,660
You were particularly picky on my fashion sense,





you told me "no-sleeves is too flashy, don't wear it!"

272
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:22,770
You gave me lots of advice,





such as wearing more than 10 colors together

273
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,270
And after 17 years of living together...

274
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:36,610
A period marking the end of our life together finally came

275
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:44,950
You became a rakugoka, and moved away to Osaka

276
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,090
The day before you left our house,

277
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,230
We went to the hot springs together

278
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,530
And then we talked all night about silly stories at the Bamiyan

279
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:01,270
Like that time we went to pick up girls in Odaiba

280
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:08,740
We recalled so many things, and we cried together, until dawn

281
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:21,460
Hosei-chan, you're the one who brought the most joy





in my life, the life of an old 74 years old man

282
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:26,900
And I'm truly grateful for that

283
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:32,370
And now you chose to become a rakugoka, a wonderful job

284
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:42,910
I still dream of the day we can live together again

285
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,980
Signed: Shimoda Kageki

286
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,500
That's incredible...

287
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,330
I had no idea this happened...

288
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,700
What you just told us couldn't have happened

289
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,630
Yeah...
- You know,

290
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,300
If it was anyone else besides Yamazaki, am I right?

291
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,300
That's right

292
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,310
He's the one behind my hair, and my job

293
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:14,980
And even my activity as a writer for illustrated books

294
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,730
Man, he had such an impact on your life

295
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,900
Oh boy...

296
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,040
You didn't say anything, did you?

297
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,880
That was the most unexpected one

298
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,200
I mean...
- Yeah, I think so to

299
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,020
They lived together, huh

300
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,230
I feel like I've been completely uncovered, today

301
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,600
That was really evil of you

302
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,170
Such a bunch of bad guys

303
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,940
We can't have other episodes like this one

304
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,450
I agree on that

305
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,640
No one's gonna gain anything from it

306
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,830
Alright, we're done!

307
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,970
The fuck are we doing?!

308
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,490
So irritating!
- What's the meaning of this?!

309
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,140
I had no idea what's going on anymore myself...

310
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,060
From: Downtown, Cocorico, Shimoda Kageki, Manabe Kaori

311
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,060
Happy birthday, Hosei

312
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,060
I had no idea what to feel about it

313
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:11,030
How were your rooms arranged when you first moved to Tokyo?

314
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:11,030
Short Talk

315
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,340
When I first came to Tokyo, huh?

316
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,160
I don't really remember...
- I'm done with mine

317
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,400
Mine was like this

318
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,280
It was a single room made of 6 tatami mats, in an apartment

319
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,280
Where was it?

320
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,480
It was in Kugayama, monthly rent around 66,000 yen

321
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,480
Ah, Kugayama?

322
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,350
Here's mine, it wasn't far from Tanaka's apartment

323
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,740
In Tokyo, yeah

324
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,350
We lived pretty close

325
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,580
I lived together with my cousin

326
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:35,660
1 room (8 tatami)
- Bathtub
- TV
- Front door
- Kitchen

in Kugayama

327
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:39,460
My cousin lived there in Tokyo for a while,
I moved here as a freeloader at first

328
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,930
And two months later, Tanaka came to Kugayama
and we started to work together

329
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,380
I see

330
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,870
Tanaka didn't have a bathtub, so...

331
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,870
That's right

332
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,240
He used a coin shower, usually

333
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,240
That's right
- But...

334
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,470
You had a bathtub, right, Endo?

335
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,470
Yeah, I had one

336
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,710
Sometimes Tanaka...

337
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,250
Like, when the coin shower place was closed, during nighttime

338
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,750
He dropped by to take a bath

339
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,750
That's right

340
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,420
Coin showers are 100 yen for 4 minutes

341
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,420
And I had no money back then

342
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,520
Endo always told me to feel free to use his own bathtub

343
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,560
But he made me pay the same price, 100 yen every 4 minutes for it

344
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,330
For real?
- And I was like, whatever, I'll go to the shower

345
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,330
No way

346
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,520
That's evil, Endo
- Back to the coin showers, I guess

347
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,670
There are still traces left of his evil
- That's when it started

348
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,970
It was like this

349
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,970
I see...
- So...

350
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,780
It was when I was 20, 27 years ago

351
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,780
27 years ago, huh

352
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:31,650
I used to live with Noriyasu, my former partner (TEAM-0)

353
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,650
With him? I don't know much about that period

354
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,650
- Really?!

355
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,820
We shared a single room in Higashi Jujo

356
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,820
- Higashi Jujo...

357
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,350
Even so, the rent was around 80,000 yen

358
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,890
It was the peak of the bubble, you know

359
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,130
Its price was really high
- Really...

360
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:48,400
It's this room's fault we stopped getting along

361
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,980
I can understand that

362
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,530
It's the worst, you were always together
- That's right

363
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:56,570
During summer, Noriyasu slept during the day

364
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,570
While I worked part-time

365
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,410
I used to leave home after setting the heater up

366
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,120
Man, you're evil
- You suck!

367
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,310
Really?
- What the hell, dude

368
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,820
I guess it was fate you couldn't stay together

369
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,820
Right...
- It really sucked

370
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,920
I remember one time me and Hamada had this show

371
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,120
And stayed in Okinawa in the same room for a week

372
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,590
We were still around 20

373
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,530
Being one entire week with him made me so angry...

374
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,100
He grinds his teeth so hard when he sleeps

375
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,170
I swear, I couldn't sleep because of his bruxism

376
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,640
I could only sleep when he woke up

377
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,240
And he even said "How long are ya gonna sleep?!"







it was so goddamn infuriating!

378
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,780
I remember that

379
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,980
I couldn't wake up properly in the morning, because of him

380
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,420
I couldn't even have breakfast!

381
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah, sometimes I went alone
- Cause he slept through, huh

382
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,020
Yeah, I was asleep
- When I got back, he was still sleeping

383
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,410
And you went "are ya still sleepin'?!"

384
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,040
Inside my head I was so furious

385
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,630
You know what I mean?
- I know

386
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,860
Man, this guy sucks...

387
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,340
I remember I clearly thought he sucked
- That was around 30 years ago, right?

388
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,700
Coming up:

389
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,700
Downtown's rooms reveal

390
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,100
Here's mine

391
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,770
The fuck is wrong with you? What's this way of drawing?

392
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,770
- What are you...?

393
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,640
What's that?
- What do you mean?

394
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,280
I mean...
- Is that a map?

395
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,640
Is that a treasure map?

396
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
It's an office
- What's that?

397
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,280
Come on, it's easy to follow
- This is my office

398
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,060
Ah, is that an office?

399
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,120
That's not it, this is...
- You lived in an office?

400
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,490
We can see his style even when he draws stuff like this

401
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,490
The hell is this?
- This is not the entrance, this is a hallway

402
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,380
A hallway?

403
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,960
Is that it?
- I had a bedroom here...

404
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,870
Then, kitchen, toilet and bathtub...
- What the...

405
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,470
It's so hard to tell

406
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,670
There was also a living room, on the left corner

407
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,870
It was shaped like an L

408
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,870
- Oh, I see

409
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,710
Do you remember how much the rent was?

410
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,710
- I think it was...

411
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,510
200,000 yen or something like that

412
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,510
- Yeah, makes sense

413
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,680
My apartment too was around 200,000 yen

414
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,860
- Yeah

415
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,680
- Must be that

416
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,020
It was like this, a big L

417
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,960
Did you have any friends at the time?
Or like, some juniors you knew?

418
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,820
Weren't you married?
- Yeah, I had my wife

419
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,930
I see, so you had your family
- He lived with her

420
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,340
That's right; what about you?

421
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:06,580
I don't think I remember clearly,
I was in an apartment too

422
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,940
I had an entrance, a bedroom and...
man, the proportions are all weird

423
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,940
It's all weird

424
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,080
Why is the living room so small?
- What's this? What's this part?

425
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,380
Sorry, these two are bedrooms

426
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,250
This is the bathroom

427
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,350
With the bathtub and all?
- That's it

428
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,160
And what's this?
- It's the hallway

429
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,160
You suck at drawing, you know?

430
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,210
And I hosted several parties in this room here

431
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,460
I mean yeah, he was single back then...

432
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:39,200
One time we had a great party,
but Yamazaki disappeared in the bathroom

433
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,250
I went there and asked him if he was ok,
and I saw him washing his dick

434
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,250
m -11 2 l -11 -2 l 12 -2 l 12 2

435
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:48,240
Why are you washing your dick here?!

436
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:48,240
m -11 2 l -11 -2 l 12 -2 l 12 2
