00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,370
There was no match fixing or anything like that

24
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,350
You must have got some help from the staff or something...

25
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,350

69
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,970
Okay, go and get me one

70
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,820
First off is Hamada, who got it right last time and has been accused of "match fixing" in the previous Kiki

71
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,340
Calpis

72
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,340
Correct answer for Hamada

73
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,340
Welch's Apple 100

74
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,340
m 0 0 l 716.5 -0.25 l 716.5 118.625 l 716.5 118.625 l -0.5 118

75
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,620
so for Hamada, he gets the 140-year-old company, Welch's Apple 100

76
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,450
The sample you try at the beginning

77
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,400
always seems to trick your senses

78
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,050
This actually has a weak taste

79
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,750
weak?

80
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,420
You know, there are some strong tasting ones

81
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,220
Well they are delicious

82
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,470
When the taste is weak, it's just a bit...

83
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,800
Yeah yeah yeah, I agree

84
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,390
They are delicious

85
00:01:55,360 --> 00:05:15,490

89
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,220
I have never drunk apple juice from a bottle so I will try one

90
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,320
Oh, he's never tried one from a bottle...

91
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,300

96
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,550
The first sip is just so important

97
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,550
It's so important

98
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,470
No, this is quite thick

99
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,550
This is wrong; the one before was thinner and this one is thick.

100
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:23,150
The one I drank was not Posmann apple juice

101
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,860
Â¤ We throw away all empty bottles

102
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,850

103
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,320
The one I tasted was NOT Kibounono Shizuku

This is always so tiring

126

It tires me out, this does

127
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,570
But you haven't done that many yet

128

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,600
He's got the most right out of all of us in the past...

132
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,700
I know...

133
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,800

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,050
Man it's thick

140
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,350
I don't think it was this thick

141
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,650
Can I just

142
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,650
quickly drink this one too?

143
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,400
Huh?

144
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,950
No no, you must get rid of that one first

145
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,050
It's like love

146
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,990
You have to get rid of this one first

147
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,990
before you move onto the next one

148
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,720
You can't be with two people at once

149
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,900
No, it wasn't this thick

150
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,800
The one I dr- ank was...

151
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,020
NOT Apple's Cheek

152
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,970
Please, I beg you, please

153
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,620
Oh man, I don't know

154
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,820
Are there really no clues?

155
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,800
I'm sure there is

156
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,770
OK, this one, if it's a thin juice, I think this one could be...

He's gone through 5 now...

169
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,070
It's close

170
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,720
Hang on...

171
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:19,150
It's so tiring

172
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,150
it's so bloody tiring

173
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,050
It can't be tiring, can it?

174
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,920
I don't think it can be tiring surely, just...

175
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,550
This is really sweet though, right to the last

176
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,300
You're so close to me

177
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,770
Too close, way too close

178
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,070
I'm sure it was thinner though

179
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,070
He's struggling on this one, isn't he?

180
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,420
Oh man, what should I do

181
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,620
Am I going to regret not choosing this one?

182
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,520
The sweetness though was just

183
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,020
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

184
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,050
He's having so much fun over there!

185
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,020
I'm so happy for him

186
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,050
The sweetness is different?

187
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,970
I'm so happy he's enjoying it

188
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:13,550
The one I tasted was NOT Welch's Apple 100!

189
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,750
I really thought he was going to go for it

190
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,900
I thought he would too

191
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,600
I thought he would go for it

192
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,810
It's coming

193
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,120
The Batsu...

194
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,370
Wait, what the hell, oh shit...

195
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,350
IDIOT PIECE OF SHIT APPLE GORILLA!!

196
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,750
Apple Gorilla?

197
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,070
Wait, from so close??

198
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,720
That's not good!!!

199
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,020
Oh shit oh shit, this is bad!

200
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,350
Is it bad?

201
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,000
Shit shit shit shit

202
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,150
That hurt so much, so fucking much

203
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,920
Oh man, it was that one!!

204
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,700
2nd up is the man who looks to get one right in nearly 10 years: Tanaka

205
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,400
The one chosen for him is Aomori prefecture's Gold Nousen's "Ringouen"

206
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,880
Correct answer for Tanaka

207
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,880

208
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,880

210
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,720
Will he make up for his previously poor results?

211
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,620
How is it?

212
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,250
Umm... yeah

213
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,660
It's not got anything strong in particular

214
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,190
It might be a really easy

215
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:27,950
It might be a really easy

216
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,950
apple juice to drink... I believe

217
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,200
What kind of apple juice is that!?

218
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,970
Surely they are all "easy to drink"

219
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,950
Have you ever drunk one which was "hard to drink"?

220
00:06:30,970 --> 00:07:23,190

But Tanaka is really bad, man; he's only got 2 right

225
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,820
Yeah, he's not got one right since 2002

226
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,370
You've participated in every episode, right?

227
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,220
Yes I have

228
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,700
I would like to try this one, the most expensive apple juice at 1800 Yen,

229
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,690
This Ougon apple juice

00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,270
It's so wrong

235
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,420
It's wrong!

236
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,520
Everything is different!

237
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,400
Everything is different!

238
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,700
That's great then, if it's all different

239
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,700
It's all different?

240
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,400
Then go and bin it already

241
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,450
If it's all different

242
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,450
I might get this...

243
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,050
Every time on the first one, he says "it's totally different"

244
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,050
It's wrong!

245
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,600
The one I tasted was NOT Ougon's apple juice!

246
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,380
Â¤ We throw away all empty bottles

247
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,370
I see, so there is a difference...

248
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,250
So the key is what is different...

249
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,870
yeah, you need to find out what was different

250
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,850
But the colour is different, maybe the ones over here have a stronger taste.

When the juice comes into my mouth

256
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,530
it comes in at a totally different pace

257
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,600
That's probably because you drink it differently every time...

258
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,570
Surely that's got nothing to do with it...

259
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,370
The speed is completely in your hands

260
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,370
It is actually different though

261
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,500
You mean when you swallow?

262
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,000
Umm... sure

263
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,540

You can't do that, no way.

302
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,580
the one that he got wrong

303
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,450
Just say the one he got totally wrong

304
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,450
the one that he got totally wrong

305
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,520
I guess when he's playing, anything goes...

306
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,750
I think it's Welch's because I am looking for a smooth and light one

307
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,200
I will go for the Welch's apple juice

308
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:44,940

It's wrong

313
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,750
It's wrong, it wasn't this kind of taste

314
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,470
Everyone always say it's wrong and then we get it wrong...

315
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,300
However, today's Tanaka was different

Today's Tanaka is different to usual!

333
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,300
3 more left!

334
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,300
Amazing Tanaka!

335
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,720
Surely he's got it

336
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,320
I'm going for Kibouno Shizuku

337
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,320

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,120
It might be the first time he's got this far

343
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,120
It might be

344
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,470
The scent is really close

345
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,250
It was close

346
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,950
But the taste...

347
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,120
The taste is close but...

348
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,440
You've got a blocked nose man

349
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,750
Did you hear that noise?

350
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,270
I'm not convinced at all...

351
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,850
It's close but it's wrong

352
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,970
Wrong, it's close but it's wrong

353
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,620
The one I tasted was NOT Kibouno Shizuku

354
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:42,160

YES!

362
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,970
It's been over 30 minutes since he started...

363
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,870
I know, right?

364
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,870
The question is how much will he remember?

365
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,400
I'm sure it was a bit more refreshing

366
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,370
Tanaka-san, you have to go up front or chuck one of them

367
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,600
I understand

368
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,000
He has to decide on one of these after all

369
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,820
I'm sure it was a bit more refreshing

370
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,650
He keeps repeating that

371
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,650
I get it... I totally understand how he feels

372
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,250
Well it is one of them after all

373
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,630
How many times is he going to say that?

374
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,630
That's all he's got to go on

375
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,570
That's his only clue

376
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,960
After the break

377
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,960
Will Tanaka get it right after 10 years?!

But I'm sure it was more refreshing

388
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,620
How many times are you going to say that?

389
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,170
That's not going to make it into the final edit, you know?

390
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,700
How many years worth of times are you going to say that?

391
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,700
Seriously...

392
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,200
WRONG

393
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,850
This is different, so the one I think is correct

394
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,200
is this one

395
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,550
The one you haven't drunk

396
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,550
I haven't drunk it

397
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,020
You're going to take that one to the front?

398
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,020
but I will take this one to the front

399
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,000
The one I drank WAS RINGOUEN!

400
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,230
CORRECT!!

401
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,370

I haven't seen this dance in ages

408
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,100
Yes!

409
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,450
You're right

410
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,800
It's been so long

411
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,900
Tanaka finally, since 2002 custard,

412
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,900
Wins 100,000 Yen!

413
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,850
Thank you so much!

414
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,900
If that was Yama-chan up there, we would have changed the answer

415
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,630
I really didn't think they would fix it at this stage

416
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,630
I really didn't think they would fix it at this stage

417

I really didn't think they would fix it at this stage

418
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
It was fixed?

419
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,370
Because he didn't get it right for 10 years...

420
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,900
Next up is Endo, who also hasn't got one right in 3 years

421
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,120
The correct answer for Endo is Dole's Apple 100%

427
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,780
Drink up, Endo!

428
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,950
Down it, Endo

429
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,470
I see, but that might be a good idea

430
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,500
I might put a bit on my tongue and taste it and stuff but

431
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,720
I wonder how that would turn out

432
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,050
The moment when it passes through your throat

433
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,800
That was a lot at once, like it really was

434
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,200
It didn't all go down though

435
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,200
No it didn't

436
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,000

Wow amazing

451
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,150
Your stomach is going to fill up so fast though

452
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,550
Are you serious?

453
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,550
Yes Shozo!

454

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,300
Amazing Shozo

456
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,850
Damn it, it would have been so funny if the buzzer went off there

What's the order strategy here though, Shozo?

464
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,750
You should remember the taste still

465
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,300
You should be able to

00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,050
He must be in hell when he knows it's wrong

472
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,870
He knows it's wrong and he still has to down it...

473
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,250
That must be hell!

474
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,200
Jus de Pomme 840 Yen

475
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,370

480
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,020
That's a good price

481
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,270
The smell is

482
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,870
If he knows it's wrong at this stage...

483
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,400
The scent is totally wrong

484
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,370
The scent is totally wrong huh, there is no way it could be this one..?

485
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,300
It's totally wrong

486
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,120
It's totally wrong

487
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,600
The one I tasted was NOT Jus de Pomme

488
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,300
Endo this is just...

489
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,520
It's a new character

490
00:13:28,850 --> 00:15:50,230
Correct answer

498
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,360
Finally Endo has risen

499
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,500
The scent is totally wrong

500
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,920
It's totally different huh?

501
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,800
He's drunk so much

502
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:44,570

506
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,250
He downs them all at a frightening pace

507
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,620
and he adds to his growing list

508
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,410

516
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,150
He's not going to be able to drink much more...

517
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,470
His stomach should start hurting now...

518
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,550

00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:03,670
However, Endo's drinking pace doesn't slow down at all

00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:13,130
Now tasting

527
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,870
and he downs one after another

528
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,220
His face is so scary when he drinks

529
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,770
In a blink of an eye, there were only 4 left

530

This is a great pace

533
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,270
He's got 11 right so far

534
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,500
There are only 4 left

535
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,500
4 more

536
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,250
Can I just have some water?

537
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Wait what, you're still going to drink?!

538
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,200
He's going for it!

539
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,270
Go for it

Amazing, Endo-san

556
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,850
Let's down the water

557
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,000
This is important too

558
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,200
There you go

559
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,720

560
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,650
I know, I feel bad

561
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,750
What a kind senior

562
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,510
It's one or the other

563
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,120
I'm amazed you've managed not to pick the right one up until this point

564
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,550
It's amazing

565
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,200
This is the last one

566
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,120
After all that

567
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,670

Okay

584
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,150
I don't think it's this one

585
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,400
If he has to receive a punishment, that would be so bad...

586
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,150
He will spit it all out

587
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:49,220
The one I drank was Fruits Fiesta Apple Juice!

588
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,950
What was the point..?

589
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,400
Stand up

You, stop smoking with the waitress!!

591
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,570

Your stomach must be SO full

596
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,960

597
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,930

604
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,600
Wait, this is so sweet, are you serious right now?!

Wait wait, I'm serious

609
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:00,300
we are just not bothered

610
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,470
They aren't?

611
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,270

The weight is different

622
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,750
The weight? Maybe there isn't as much in this one...

623
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,200
It's totally wrong, 120% wrong

624
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,250
This one, you idiot!

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,620
I'll kill you!

626
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:25,350

What is this..?

647
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,380
Unfunny comedian

648
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,750
Unfunny comedian

649
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,200
It's so quiet here...

650
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,200
It really is

651
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,020
I'm going for Grated apple juice

It's wrong

657
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,300
Huh?

658
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,620
What?

659
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,850
Are you serious?

660
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,170
Are you serious, sir?

661
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,620
Are you serious?

662
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,810
Finally, did you feel that?

663
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,580
No one is laughing in the slightest

664
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,380
No one is laughing in the slightest

665
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,200
Hold on

666
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,020
Give me a second

667
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,750
Have you possibly chosen it?

668
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,730
Yes possibly, this is a tough one. Please please please...

669
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,470
This is not fun at all, is it?

670
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,800
This is not fun at all, is it?

671
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,300
I just want him to finish already

672
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,070
Me too, I want him to just finish

673
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,550
That's exactly what I wanted to say

674
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,270
I want him to just finish already

675
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,420
I'm going for it

676
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,320
I always look stupid

677
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,950
because I don't go to the front

678
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,320
Man he's mucking around

679
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,750
This is just really bad huh?

680
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,750
Yes, he's totally mucking around

681
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,870
The one I tasted WAS grated apple juice

682
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,920
The one I tasted WAS grated apple juice

683
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,550
Obviously not, you were mucking around too much

684
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,560
You apple amateur! You piece of shit comedian!

685
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,100
Piece of shit comedian...

686
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,270
This looks so painful

687
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,220
Please don't...

688
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,770
Hold on a second

689
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,570
That looks so painful

690
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,300
I'm sure he was pissed off too

691
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,300
Yeah...

692
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,010
Thinking like "this guy"...

693
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,720
Last up is Matsumoto

694
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,200
He didn't participate last time so it's been around a year since he last did Kiki...

695
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:14,630
Correct answer for Matsumoto

696
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:14,630

699
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,720
The one chosen for him was the same as Endo: Dole's Apple 100%

700
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,550
I don't think that will help at all...

701
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,220
I've not seen this approach before

702
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,550
Nope, I haven't either

703
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,170
What an idiot

704
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,310
It's not very sour

705
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:35,610
The amount of sourness

706
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,510
This is what is very important

707
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,610
This is what is very important

708
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,150
I see...

709
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:48,050
I think umm... I would like to go through all of them

710
00:20:43,090 --> 00:23:06,830

714
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,050
I am the last of us after all

715
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,350
Who decided which one to give me, I'm guessing

716
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,330
Hamaya-nen did right?

717
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,600
Hamaya-nen

718
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,100
We all chose it together

719
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,850
Hamaya-nen?

720
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,250
Was that your nickname back in the day?

721
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,320
During your school days? Hamaya-nen?

722
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,300
We chose together

723
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,410
I really like

724
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:13,950
don't know which one to

725
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,950
pick first

726
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,250
Eh??

727
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,250
Eh?

728
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,600
You can choose any of them

729
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,370
Just choose one that you want to

730
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,350
Okay okay, I got it

731
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,470
Anyway, I will go for Welch's first

732
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,450
Man he pisses me off

733
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:47,950

737
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:24,090
This is really sticky

738
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,500
I totally get it

739
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,120
I totally get it

740
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,700
Oh man, it's this easy? The sourness in this one is too strong

741
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,050
Compared to the one I drank

742
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,650
The one I tasted was NOT Welch's

743
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:53,190
Â¤ We throw away all empty bottles

744
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,270
You know what

745
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,650
It's about the sourness, not about the cloudiness and all that

746
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,970
It's about the sourness

747
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:10,570

Seriously, can I just go through all of them really quickly?

752
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,450
Yes of course

753
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,920
It's totally wrong, the one I tasted was NOT Tropicana

754
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,650
Impressive

755
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,600
Can I just go through them one after another?

756
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,600
He's getting into it

767
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,220
He stopped...

768
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,850
He just said he was going to go through them one after another

769
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,670
He did say that

770
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,950
Can I just do something?

771
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,500
Oh I see

772
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,900
This is a new technique

773
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,650
He got it really quickly but do you think he can see through the eye mask?

774
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,020
That's true!

775
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,600
It's totally wrong

776
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,100
When I tried this one, my memory from before

777
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,600
came flooding back to me in colour

778
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,950
I see

779
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,800
Can I just keep the eye mask?

780
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,800
Wait, you got to get rid of that

781
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,250
I meant the eye mask

782
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,250
That might be a good idea

783
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,820
The one I tasted was NOT Dole Apple 100%

784
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,000
Just as he came up with that new innovative idea

785
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,500
with the eye mask

786
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,270
Are you serious?

787
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,700
Man, our senior is lame!

788
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,220
Your bald head! Shall I grate it!?

789
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,520
He's so angry

790
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,470
Of course he will be angry

791
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,770
Oh shit, it's scary

792
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,300
Oh God!!

793
00:23:37,590 --> 00:24:09,930
This video was brought to you by tofu panda fansubs

794
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,020
Ouch!

795
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,570
That is going to hurt

796
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,770
You're sweating so much

797
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,870
It was Dole

798
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,850
It was Dole

799
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,650
You didn't "get it" at all

800
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,150
I really thought from here on, I'm going to be working hard

801
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,270
using the eye mask

802
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,850
I really thought I was going to be using this loads so I was just...

803
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,850
shocked...
