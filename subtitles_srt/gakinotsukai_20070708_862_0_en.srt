00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:07,890
The first in the series on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende! Chiki Chiki, who is the true leader of Morisanchu? Rubik's Cube in a sauna battle!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,340
Matsumoto, what do you think of this?

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,340
Well

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,300
T/N: Morisanchu is an all female comedy trio.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,300
Thing is, it seems with Morisanchu...

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,160
Downtown

7
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,160
Hamada Masatoshi

8
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,160
Matsumoto Hitoshi

9
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,160
It seems that they don't even know who is the leader anymore

10
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,470
Yamasaki Hosei

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,840
Who cares who it is

12
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,940
Originally

13
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,720
It seems they decided that the fat one is the leader

14
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,240
"The fat one"?

15
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:23,940
Recently though, they've all become fat

16
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,270
Recently though, they've all become fat

17
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,870
Recently though, they've all become fat

18
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,870
That's right

19
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,840
Then they decided the ugly and fat one will be the leader

20
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,840
Cocorico

21
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,840
Endo Shozo

22
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,840
Tanaka Naoki

23
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,310
But all of them are, so...

24
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,210
All of them?

25
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,880
All of them

26
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,880
Yes, I agree

27
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
Let's get started then with the introduction!

28
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,920
Yeah!

29
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,880
Morisanchu, welcome!

30
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,900
Come on in!

31
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,320
Oh, but wait...

32
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,720
The atmosphere is so gloomy...

33
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,460
The hell is up with all of you?!

34
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,560
Current leader

35
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,560
Kazuko Kurosawa

36
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,560
Miyuki Oshima

37
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,560
Morisanchu

38
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,560
Recently unable to restrain from fighting

39
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,560
Tomoko Murakami

40
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,570
m 68 404 l 578 404 578 442 68 442

41
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,560
Hard to look at you guys

42
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,720
Seriously though, I can't follow such a leader

43
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,880
I don't even think of you as a leader, you know

44
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,500
In terms of age, she's only 1 year older

45
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:54,830
In terms of age, she's only 1 year older

46
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,930
In terms of age, she's only 1 year older

47
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,160
Oh really?

48
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,930
Excuse me for a moment

49
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:58,840
Do you need a leader?

50
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,640
Do you need a leader?

51
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,640
Of course we do

52
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,270
If I'm the leader,

then I think everything would be sorted out!

53
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,440
No way!

54
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:07,610
If I'm the leader,

then I think everything would be sorted out!

55
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,610
It's not sorted out at all

56
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,610
It ain't sorted out at all

57
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,580
It's almost as if...

58
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,380
Tensions are really high right now, aren't they?

59
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,080
I'm just saying that I can't accept it

60
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,500
I won't accept it if one of these two becomes the leader

61
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,750
Why the hell not? I refuse to accept you

62
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,160
You just happened to get married by chance, right?

63
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,160
My marriage has nothing to do with this!

64
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,280
Oi oi oi!!

65
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,340
Ahhh!

66
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,880
What is with this strength?!

67
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,460
Stop!

68
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:33,870
What the hell are you doing, you bastard?!

69
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,170
What the hell are you doing, you bastard?!

70
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,040
What the hell are you doing, you bastard?!

71
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,720
Oh no, oh no!!

72
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,040
The hell you doing?!!

73
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,520
I was helping you!

74
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,360
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

75
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,520
Hey!!

76
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,640
What the hell are you doing?!

77
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,020
Hamada!!

78
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,880
What were you doing?

79
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,550
And you, you should oppose him!

80
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,530
I'd like to let you do as you please here since you got married and all

81
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,920
My marriage has nothing to do with this!

82
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,700
All because your husband is filthy rich, ain't he?!

83
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,200
All because your husband is filthy rich, ain't he?!

84
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,270
All because your husband is filthy rich, ain't he?!

85
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,540
You shouldn't say things like that...

86
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,060
Stop it!

87
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,570
Kurosawa!

88
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:13,110
Morisanchu in a destructive crisis!

Gaki no Tsukai to the rescue with a game!!

89
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:13,110
Morisanchu in a destructive crisis!

Gaki no Tsukai to the rescue with a game!!

90
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,100
Morisanchu, after reaching their ninth year since debut, Gaki no Tsukai will save them from their destructive crisis!

I WANT TO BE THE LEADER!!

97
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,820
So, Matsumoto

98
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,160
Yes!

99
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,160
To start it off, let's explain the rules

100
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,440
Yes yes yes

101
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,440
Over there to the right is a sauna

102
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,700
Ah, a sauna, yes

103
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,770
All three will enter the sauna together

104
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:42,640
Rules

105
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:42,640
Whoever finishes their Rubik's Cube the fastest


will become Morisanchu's true leader! (Time limit one hour)

106
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:40,410
The person who finishes their Rubik's Cube the fastest is the winner

107
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,640
I see!

108
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,640
I understand

109
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:52,650
Escape Button

110
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:52,650
If this button is pressed during the battle, that person may


take a break from the sauna as many times as they want!

111
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:51,980
Narrator: Noda Keiichi

112
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,860
During the battle, there is an Escape Button inside the sauna

113
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,720
If pressed, they may take a break from the sauna as many times as they want

114
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,360
When that happens, we'll support them with all of our might!

115
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,260
We will support them!

116
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:01,390
In the Case of an Escape


Gaki no Tsukai members will support with all their might!

117
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,260
We will support them

118
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,260
Do your best!

119
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,240
Thank you

120
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,480
Please give it your all

121
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,400
Let's do it

122
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,560
Oshima, are you okay?

123
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
You're not okay

124
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,240
Oshima, what happened?

125
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,840
What happened?

126
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,140
We're going to start soon

127
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,140
Come on

128
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,980
It's okay

129
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,980
Kurosawa

130
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,980
Murakami

131
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,980
Oshima

132
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,980
Those who leave the sauna while holding the white flag



will immediately drop out of the competition!

133
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,160
In addition, those who leave the sauna with a white flag

134
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,500
they will immediately be dropped out of the competition!

135
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,920
You never know!

136
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,700
Let's do this!

137
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,460
Yes, let's go!

138
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,620
Rubik's Cube in a Sauna challenge!

139
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,720
I want to be the leader...

140
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,720
Ready...

141
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,790
Rubik's Cube in a Sauna Challenge

142
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,790
Rubik's Cube in a Sauna Challenge

143
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,500
LET'S DO THIS

144
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,800
Yeah!

145
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,660
Who will win this scorching hellish catfight and become the leader?!

146
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,920
A battle to become the leader in this scorching hell,

147
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,360
Who will be victorious in this catfight?!

148
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,960
Sauna temperature: 98° Celsius

149
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,960
T/N: Approximately 208° Fahrenheit.

150
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,580
So damn hot!

151
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,000
It's too hot for even the camera to be in the sauna

152
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,790
This is bad

153
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,800
It doesn't look like they can do it

154
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,820
Right?

155
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,080
They're all sitting a little differently

156
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,230
True

157
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,380
Murakami is the only one sitting on her knees

158
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,480
Oh you're right

159
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,410
Murakami's makeup is thick, isn't it?

160
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,350
Murakami's makeup is thick, isn't it?

161
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,920
Today's makeup is, yes

162
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,520
That is right

163
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,190
Perhaps she thinks a leader should...

164
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,920
Maybe she's expressing her feelings



about wanting to become the leader

165
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,060
Maybe she's expressing her feelings



about wanting to become the leader

166
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,060
I see

167
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,160
Hm?

168
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,320
Gotta quickly line it up

169
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,200
People who are good at it can do it so quickly

170
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,520
She's lost all her focus

171
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,270
She's already drenched in sweat!

172
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,700
What the hell are they doing...

173
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,360
I mean, it seems like they're surprised it's so hot

174
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,500
No no no, it's way too quick to call it, it's too soon!

175
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,680
Oh already...

176
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,280
With every second, she's losing



about three points on her looks

177
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,950
With every second, she's losing



about three points on her looks

178
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,080
With every second, she's losing



about three points on her looks

179
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,830
Although she originally doesn't have much...

180
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,740
Isn't she going into the negatives then?

181
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,740
Right

182
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,420
Oshima is also



starting to lose steam

183
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,930
Oshima is also



starting to lose steam

184
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,460
If you entered a sauna and saw these three, what would you do?

185
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,910
Well, you know, we don't know who will escape the sauna, so we must indiscriminantly help

186
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,310
In the Case of an Escape


Gaki no Tsukai members will support with all their might!

187
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,880
Yes, let's help them!

188
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,880
Yes, let's help with all of our strength!

189
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,280
Here, Murakami isn't looking so good

190
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,880
Her eyes hurt from all the sweat

191
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,540
It got in her eyes, oh dear...

192
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,120
That's gotta hurt

193
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,020
So much sweat!

194
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,240
It's only been about three minutes and a half...

195
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,460
There's still so much time left...

196
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,620
What the hell is this

197
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,530
They look like old ladies from the crappy apartments

198
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,660
They look like old ladies from the crappy apartments

199
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,660
Because there's no air conditioning

200
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,740
Hey!

201
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,660
What is this?!

202
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,220
You guys!!

203
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,730
It'll never end this way so come on!

204
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,060
Come on, do the puzzle!

205
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,060
It's like...

206
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,020
This is uh

207
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,240
T/N: The Ueno Zoo is a zoo in Tokyo. It's known for being pretty rundown.

208
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,240
The Ueno Zoo

209
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,120
Hippos!

210
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,900
They look like hippos!

211
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,480
5 minutes since the start

212
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:47,360
These three, who don't even normally go to saunas,



are immediately showing expressions of anguish...

213
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:47,360
These three, who don't even normally go to saunas,



are immediately showing expressions of anguish...

214
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,920
These three, who don't even normally go to saunas,

215
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,100
are immediately showing expressions of anguish

216
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,540
What the hell is this

217
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,670
Murakami escapes!!

218
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,900
Murakami escapes!!

219
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,400
Over here

220
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,240
Come here, Miss Murakami

221
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,740
Come on in

222
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,820
Here you go, here you go

223
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,160
Yeah

224
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,760
How do you feel? Better, right?

225
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,760
Here you go

226
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,120
See, it feels nice

227
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,040
Do you feel refreshed?

228
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,820
How are you?

229
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,840
Are you okay?

230
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,680
There you go

231
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,340
You feel good right?

232
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,520
Okay, back in you go

233
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,820
Alright

234
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,140
Come on!

235
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,120
Back in you go

236
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Looking good

237
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,840
Do your best!

238
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,840
Do your best!

239
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,840
Finish the puzzle!

240
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,010
Murakami all refreshed

241
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,180
Come on!

242
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,160
Let's do it!

243
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,420
Oshima vs Kurosawa

244
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,180
After this, an outburst from the sauna!



Oshima vs Kurosawa, another destined altercation!!

245
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,520
Another destined outburst!

246
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,450
Morisanchu's true leader to be decided!

Rubik's Cube in a Sauna Battle!!

247
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,450
Morisanchu's true leader to be decided!

Rubik's Cube in a Sauna Battle!!

248
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,530
Morisanchu, nine years after their debut

249
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,460
Their true leader will be decided tonight!

250
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,620
You know, they shouldn't push themselves

251
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,200
When they want to get out, they should get out

252
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,190
Of course

253
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,420
Her expression is completely different!

254
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,990
Her expression is completely different!

255
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,140
Very true

256
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,140
Ah yes, she's looking good

257
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,980
She looks refreshed

258
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,630
Her looks went up five points!

259
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,330
Her looks went up five points!

260
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,160
You serious?!

261
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,980
Kurosawa escapes!!

262
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,320
Okay, Kurosawa

263
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,100
Open wide and say, "ah"

264
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,150
Come on, drink up

265
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,320
There you go, there you go

266
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,230
Kurosawa all refreshed

267
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,600
How much do you have done? How many rows?

268
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,700
Not even one row

269
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,700
Ah, not much progress at all

270
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,370
Why the hell won't you say anything?

271
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,370
Yeah

272
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,170
You're looking real pretty

273
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,070
She didn't get prettier at all

274
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,080
10 minutes since the start

275
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,090
We have just passed the 10 minute mark since the start

276
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,450
The three don't look to have any intention of giving up

277
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:51,350
No one looks even close to retiring

278
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,100
They silently look towards finishing the Rubik's Cube!

279
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,020
Oi oi oi

280
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,300
Murakami's really looking like

281
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,490
Murakami's really looking like

282
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,490
a teddy bear

283
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,770
You're right!

284
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,790
A teddy bear! So cute!

285
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,770
Cute!

286
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,270
Let's support them

287
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,500
Kurosawa is looking a bit...

288
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,970
That side wall is also incredibly hot!

289
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:12,340
That side wall is also incredibly hot!

290
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,350
The sides are hot!

291
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,340
That side wall is also incredibly hot!

292
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,250
The side wall is hot too!

293
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,380
Murakami isn't looking too good...

294
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,650
Murakami escapes!!

295
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,120
Here she comes! What do you want?

296
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,820
Water! Water!!

297
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,850
Water

298
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,850
We got water over here

299
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,990
Here you go

300
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,550
You can lay down

301
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,120
Go on and eat

302
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,230
-----------------------------

303
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,230
Support Item

Cold Somen

304
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,230
T/N: Somen is a thin wheat noodle which is often eaten in the summer with a cold dipping sauce.

305
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,120
We won't tell anyone else!

306
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,600
Don't tell anyone else about this!

307
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,620
You should eat

308
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,370
You're looking so gorgeous!

309
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,900
It's delicious, right?

310
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,020
What's wrong?

311
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,020
What's wrong?

312
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,020
You're gorgeous

313
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,050
Is it good?

314
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,600
Even the inside of your body will cool off

315
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,220
It's good right?

316
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,050
Good, right?

317
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,370
How's it looking?

318
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,890
Oshima escapes!!

319
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,720
All at once! Come over here

320
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,080
Oshima!

321
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,960
Don't look, don't look

322
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,480
Oshima goes here

323
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,420
You guys are rivals

324
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,930
Hurry up

325
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,250
Hurry and get in

326
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,040
Feels good, huh?

327
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,220
Nice!

328
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,890
Here, have some somen

329
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,720
Good

330
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,400
You're so pretty

331
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,370
How is it, Oshima?

332
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,900
Oh wait, this isn't good!

333
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,900
Huh?!

334
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,720
What's wrong?

335
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,410
Not looking good

336
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,240
Kurosawa's not looking good!

337
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,890
Murakami, come on

338
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,560
Murakami is taking her time

339
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,560
Oshima all refreshed

340
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,560
All good, Murakami?

341
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,890
Murakami all refreshed

342
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,300
Looking good

343
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,930
Why are you walking like that?

344
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,170
Why?

345
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,640
Why are you walking like that?

346
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,880
Did something happen?

347
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,620
Come on

348
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,580
T/N: I'm not sure what the censored word is, but it's most likely something vulgar.

349
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,580
Why are you looking like a ***?

350
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,340
All of them look like that

351
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,380
Excuse me, but it looks like all three of them aren't moving...

352
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,720
How's it look?

353
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Oh, well actually, I guess they are moving

354
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,930
Even still, Kurosawa isn't really...

355
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,250
This is okay, right?

356
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,860
Sitting in the same place, just fiddling with the cube... So scary!

357
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,460
Oshima altogether just dropped her cube

358
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,740
Really?

359
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,560
Oh??

360
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:22,820
Oh?

361
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,060
What's going on?

362
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,060
Is she gonna come out?

363
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,110
Oshima escapes!!

364
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,980
Hurry up over here

365
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,620
You okay?

366
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,170
Good job

367
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,940
Your face, Oshima... Your face is looking real funny

368
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,080
Just imagine yourself in Hawaii

369
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,280

Tonic Shampoo

380
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,070
T/N: Tonic shampoo is used for people suffering from hair loss. It supposedly promotes hair growth.

381

This is the last before you go back

The women continues to clash with their stubbornness

389
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,010
They approach the limits of their physical strength

390
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,220
"I want to be the leader!"

Oshima probably wants the

396
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,010
That's right, she did go in just like that

397

00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,930
You made it this far!

557
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,700
What're you going to do?!

558
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,700
What will you do?

559
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:33,470
Murakami quits!!

560
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,970
She left!

561
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,560
Quickly gets into the cool bath

562
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,660
She won't even look this way

563
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,420
So quick to get in

564
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,100
That's enough

565
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,260
Well, can't be helped

566
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,730
Well, yeah

567
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,450
Can't do anything about it, she's already in the water

568
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,260
And there you have it, Murakami is out of the game

569
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,590
44min and 32sec since the start




Murakami's dream to be the leader is wiped out

570
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,200
Murakami

571
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,540
Her dream to become the leader is wiped out

572
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,620
Now, the current leader and Oshima are battling it out

573
00:16:53,790 --> 00:17:02,780
15 minutes remaining

574
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,080
Yes, that's right

575
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,200
There already was some tension between them

576
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,570
True

577
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,400
The atmosphere has gotten worse

578
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,410
Right, before

579
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,050
There was Murakami between them

580
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,360
You gonna fight in there?!

581
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,610
Fighting here is dangerous!

582
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,940
We're also... What?

583
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,720
What is happening?

584
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,380
What's going on?

585
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,480
They're telling the other to take it and leave

586
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,280
I see, I see

587
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,580
"That's your flag"

588
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,450
They just traded places?!

589
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,170
That's it, they traded places?

590
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,040
What the hell

591
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,820
They just traded places, that's it

592
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,010
Huh?

593
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,010
Fighting in there is...

594
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,970
Fighting inside (the sauna)



is dangerous!

595
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,970
Watch out!

596
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,690
Wow, so sluggish

597
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,100
That's all they can manage

598
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,100
They can't stand it

599
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,650
No strength

600
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,080
Get out!

601
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,250
No, you get out!

602
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,730
Get out!!

603
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,190
You hurry and get out!!

604
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,180
Get out!!

605
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,660
Hurry up!!

606
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,300
What is this

607
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,080
So hot!!

608
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,620
Just sweating out crap

609
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,770
Get out there!

610
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
Ah!

611
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,460
Bring them out!

612
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,960
Will she kick her out?

613
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,010
Oh, this one!

614
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,450
You can't do that, can't do that

615
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,650
Oshima isn't leaving of her own will

616
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,980
Get out!!

617
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,540
That's right

618
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,010
It's not her free will

619
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,690
Get out!!

620
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,450
That's no good

621
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,760
How many bars have they gone to already?

622
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,410
This is the sixth bar, I think

623
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,100
Is it already six?

624
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,400
"Let's go, I'll pay the next round, damnit!"

625
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,050
Take a look at



Murakami's face, who is just watching this all happen

626
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,800
What do you want?!

627
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:30,790
Take a look at



Murakami's face, who is just watching this all happen

628
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,760
Take a look at



Murakami's face, who is just watching this all happen

629
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,300
Get the hell out!!

630
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,700
Completely dead

631
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,730
Just acting as a bystander

632
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,560
What the hell?!

633
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,130
What are they doing?

634
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,470
We cannot show what is happening here

635
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,200
After this, Kurosawa goes back into the sauna alone

636
00:18:54,310 --> 00:19:02,590
Kurosawa continues to work on the Rubik's Cube alone



and completes one side

637
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,930
To continue on the Rubik's Cube

638
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,400
She finished one side so we called the battle over!

639
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,440
So Murakami gave up, right?

640
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:14,570
-----------------
-----------------
-----------------
-----------------

641
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:14,570
Murakami


Quit

642
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,440
Kurosawa's flag isn't even out

643
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:14,570
-----------------
-----------------
-----------------
-----------------

644
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:14,570
Kurosawa


1 side complete

645
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,540
Oshima, your flag is out here already so

646
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,570
-----------------
-----------------
-----------------
-----------------

647
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,570
Oshima


Quit

648
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,610
Oshima, can't help it, right?

649
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,030
I WANT TO BE THE LEADER!

650
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,290
I understand, but

651
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,020
It's kinda...

652
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,520
Hey Hamada

653
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,840
Feeling pretty ambivalent

654
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,840
I get you, but...

655
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,750
If we think of some other way...

656
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,740
But...

657
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,820
We just have to go with this, don't we?

658
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,480
Oshima, are you fine with losing?

659
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,740
No way!

660
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,900
I WANT TO BE THE LEADER!!

661
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,660
Well, that's it

662
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,640
But if you look at reality, you lost

663
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,360
I didn't lose! I want to be the leader!

664
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,790
I didn't lose! I want to be the leader!

665
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,800
No no no

666
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,000
No, look at the reality of it, Kurosawa...

667
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,570
Let's say Kurosawa is the temporary leader!

668
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,240
Temporary, yes. Until next time, Kurosawa will be the leader

669
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,250
Yes

670
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,170
Not the leader! She's not the leader!

671
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,740
Not the leader! She's not the leader!

672
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,020
Where are you even from?!

673
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,090
For a while now

674
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,980
After this,




We will tell you how not to be looked down by [blank]!!

675
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,760
What the hell did you find while in there?!

678
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,850
“When you go to the hair salon,

679
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:14,160
when asked ‘What would you like to do with your hair color?’, how should I answer without being looked down on by the stylist?”

680
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,930
I don’t get the purpose of this question…

681
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,230
What does this mean?

682
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,860
I don’t really know either

683
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,230
Well, there is a way to not get looked down on

684
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,340
Then let’s go with that, that’s fine

685
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:28,770
First, before you enter the salon, just kick the door like BAM!

686
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,140
Well, it’s not that kind of “looking down on”...

687
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,280
Even those revolving doors, you gotta go BAM!

688
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,550
And those automatic sliding doors, when there’s a slight opening, you gotta go WHAM!

689
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,550
I see

690
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,420
Once you do that, they’ll be like, “Ahh!”

691
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,660
Their scissors will be shaking like, "Snip snip snip"

692
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,660
It’ll be like that

693
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,590
Well… That is pretty scary

694
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,760
They’ll think, “I would’ve never thought this kind of guy would come to Aoyama!”

695
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:52,600
T/N: Aoyama is a very posh city in Tokyo.

696
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,330
I see, I see

697
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,260
They’ll be like, “Ahh!”

698
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,270
They’ll be like, “S-s-sir...”

699
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,330
Well, if at first…

700
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,670
I see

701
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,840
Those salon chairs, you can’t sit on them like this

702
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Is that so?

703
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,840
You gotta face towards the back of the chair and go like this

704
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,910
What if they turn the chair around?

705
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,610
Well, if they turn it, then just let them do it and then sit properly

706
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,880
And then after that, what happens with the haircut?

707
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,020
You wanna be higher in popularity

708
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,050
You should get a… Star haircut

709
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,220
That’s enough of that. And after that, you get your haircut, right?

710
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,230
You don’t know anything about a star stylist

711
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,560
You may be a star stylist, but I’m a star at getting a haircut

712
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,360
I get it, so shut up already

713
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,400
So you get the haircut

714
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,630
It’s all about getting the cut

715
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,770
I said that’s enough, damnit! So you get the haircut…

716
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,900
I said that’s enough, damnit! So you get the haircut…

717
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,600
And then they say, “What would you like to do with your hair color?”

718
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,600
Oh, I see

719
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,910
What do you mean by hair color?

720
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,910
Like, how would you like your hair colored?

721
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,980
Do you want your hair colored or not?

722
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,780
So they’ll ask if you want it colored or not?

723
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,580
Then they'll definitely look down on you,

724
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,480
if you awkwardly go, "Yes, please"

725
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,620
So it’s at that point

726
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,720
You have to make sure you’re not looked down on

727
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,390
Right. Well, they finish cutting your hair, right?

728
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,150
Right. Well, they finish cutting your hair, right?

729
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,720
They finish, yeah

730
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,220
Well they’ll say things like, “Ahhh…”

731
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,660
Or, “Ohhh…” They’ll say a lot of things like that

732
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,360
Oh, while they’re cutting?

733
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,660
While they’re cutting

734
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,070
That thing fastened around you here… You know… I will not put that on

735
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,070
That thing

736
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,600
You’re the one who is going to suffer later

737
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,210
All that hair is going to be on you

738
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,480
Well, well, even if I do, it’ll be a V-neck

739
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,910
V-neck??

740
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,380
A V-neck so deep that even your chest hairs show

741
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,880
To about where you can see the chest hair

742
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,550
Well, if the person themselves say it’s okay, then a V-neck…

743
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,020
Can’t have them look down on you

744
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,820
Right, and then they finish cutting and then, “How would you like it?”

745
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,790
First, you go, “Huh?!!” Like that

746
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,630
First, you go, “Huh?!!” Like that

747
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,030
“Huh?!?!” Gotta say it like that

748
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,100
Gotta say it like that?

749
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,960
You gotta say it like that

750
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,070
So that you’re not looked down on

751
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,970
Usually, generally, you shouldn't respond to what they say the first time

752
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,970
Before anything, first you have to go, “Huh?!!” to start

753
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,710
Alright, alright

754
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,710
Then, “What would you like to do with your hair color?”

755
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,940
“Huh?!?!”

756
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,710
Right? First, you gotta start it off like this

757
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,950
You have to. Because you can’t have them look down on you

758
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,380
Yes, that’s right.

759
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,950
It’s no good if you make it seem like you’re actually listening the first time

760
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,390
So you say, “Huh?!” the first time, okay

761
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,120
So, “What would you like to do with your hair color?”

762
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,820
“Huh?!?!”

763
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,320
I’ve had enough of that

764
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,990
Typical

765
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,030
What were you saying?

766
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,530
“Would you like your hair colored or not…” If you’re not, then that’s fine and just let it be

767
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,170
Well first, if you ask me,

768
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,040
it’s no good if I’m still there by the time they ask that

769
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,040
Whoa whoa whoa

770
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,870
If you ask me

771
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,040
What do you mean by this?

772
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,280
First, when they come up to me like this, I’ll just go like this

773
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,240
“Stop that”

774
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,250
“Don’t do that to me,” is what I’d say

775
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,150
You’re the one who came to get a haircut, aren’t you?

776
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,490
When the guy comes with the hairdryer, I’d just pull the plug like that

777
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,550
Because I hate that kind of thing

778
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,560
Because I’m not that kind of person

779
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,460
Wait what?

780
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,730
Because I’m not that kind of person

781
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:39,200
“Don’t treat me like your customers from yesterday”

782
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,830
“Don’t treat me like that customer over there,” you know that saying

783
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,970
Then after that, just be sloppy drunk

784
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,740
Wait, you’re drunk?

785
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,270
Because I’ve been drinking bourbon

786
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,140
Then you don’t need to get your haircut on that day

787
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,850
Even as they’re cutting, slam it, and then bottoms up

788
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,550
You’re an idiot. You’re an idiot

789
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,980
A shot of tequila. Slam it and then take the shot

790
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,450
You’re an idiot. You’re an idiot

791
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,620
A shot of tequila. Slam it and then take the shot

792
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,800
No way!

793
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,060
I WANT TO BE THE LEADER!!
