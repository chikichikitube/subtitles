These are things that the real Mori Shinichi would...

14
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,330
would probably never do for us.

15
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,800
Say it right

16
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,800
I apologize.

17
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,530
You've been off since you announced the episode.

18
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,720
Your voice was a little too loud and shaky.

19
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,500
So these are things that the real Mori Shinichi would never show us,

20
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:37,680
Endo will act as Mori Shinichi and

21
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:37,680
do what the Gaki members want to see

and they are requests from the members.

24
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,680
And the plan is that I, Endo Shouzou, will impersonate him and act them out.

25
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,490
But I never thought that Endo

26
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,490
was that good at impersonations or anything

27
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,070
Impersonations aren't really my strong suit, but...

28
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,300
That lip syncing thing was the first time I've seen it.

29
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,700
That was the start, huh

30
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,700
I spent a day and a half recording that segment.

31
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,670
I spent a day and a half recording that segment.

32
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:57,770
A whole seperate day?

33
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,300
Of course it took so long.

34
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,440
Mori Shinichi does it every second of his life.

35
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,410
Mori Shinichi does it every second of his life.

36
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,170
A day and a half is nothing

37
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,950
But he's not Mori Shinichi!!

38
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,950
Is that so

We gathered your requests beforehand

52
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,700
and recorded them, so let's start with Matsumoto-san.

53
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,200
What did you want to see?

54
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,200
Right.

55
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,070
I actually,

56
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,310
Recently I went to his concert

57
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,310
at Nakano Plaza

58
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,000
Mori Shinichi's?

59
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,370
That's right.

60
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,950
I wanted to finally hear his songs live, so

61
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,200
I went to his concert and thought "he really is that good" but

62
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,790
There was something

63
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,790
that I wanted to see that he would never do there.

64
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,450
That one thing is this.

65
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,090
Swimming.

66
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,090
Him swimming.

67
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,920
What he looks like swimming...

68
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,760
It's possible that he actually

69
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:05,970
Matsumoto's Request

70
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:05,970

72
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,270
swims by himself a lot.

73
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,770
Well, I went swimming while impersonating Mori Shinichi,

74
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,970
so please take a look at the tape.

75
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,710
Roll It.

76
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,200
That's just the right amount.

77
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,300
Don't overdo it.

78
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,410
Good evening, I'm Mori Shinichi.

79
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,650
Good evening, I'm Mori Shinichi.

80
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,420
Today,

81
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,960
There was a request to watch me swimming, so

82
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,590
I'd like to start swimming for them.

83
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,500
Was Mori Shinichi
always that tan?

84
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,450
He is very tan.

85
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:37,170
If Mori Shinichi

86
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:37,170
were to go swimming...

87
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,020
You have to
keep doing that
face the whole time

88
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,480
Via Sports Avenue

89
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,900
Right, that was
the hard part.

90
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,300
Especially
while swimming...

91
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,620
On your mark, get set...

92
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,070
It's Mori Shinichi...

93
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,420
If Mori Shinichi went
swimming, It might
look something like this.

94
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,920
Does this really need a
song and slow motion?

95
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,150
What is this?!

96
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,270
This is just boring to watch

97
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
It's not a great impression...

98
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,570
Right? It's way
more Endo than Mori

99
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,970
It's mostly just Endo.

100
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,350
Especially in slow motion

101
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,350
Ahh

102
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,300
Ah, this might be better

103
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,850
The freestyle
stroke looks better

104
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,350
I tried hard to
keep doing the face

105
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,670
Seriously?

106
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,400
I just saw him
for a split second

107
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,600
Mori Shinichi's...

108
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,420
This song is about
a cold place though, so

109
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,200
It doesn't
really fit here.

110
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,870
But you're still able to swim as him.

111
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,000
That's right.

112
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,020
Oh, but you're kinda
starting to look like him.

113
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you.

114
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,970
I don't know about that...

115
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,720
Here's the butterfly.

116
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,670
Butterfly...

117
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,600
You aren't
even doing it right

118
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,150
He's not doing
the butterfly or the
impression right.

119
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,870
It's bad

120
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,100
A double failure

121
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,650
Yea, I see

122
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,670
The freestyle
part was better

123
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,670
That was better

124
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,120
I see I see

125
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,220
That face, huh

126
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,770
I see

127
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,750
How was it?

128
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,250
There were single moments where it was really good.

129
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,170
Like Mori Shinichi was there for just a moment?

130
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,520
Especially the freestyle.

131
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,520
Especially.

132
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,320
How do you think you did?

133
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,260
After filming for so long, my face started to get numb.

134
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,800
After filming for so long, my face started to get numb.

135
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,300
I couldn't tell what face I was making anymore.

136
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,320
And it stays like that.

137
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,970
The Mori Shinichi we think of is the singing version, so

138
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,810
the real Mori might actually swim just like that.

139
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,480
Considering that, it was really realistic.

140
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,750
Next up is Housei-san.

141
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,750
Right

142
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,350
My request, is this.

143
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,920
I've never seen Mori-san get pranked.

144
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:17,760
Housei's Request

145
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:17,760
Sleeping Prank

146
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:17,760
m 0 0 l 0 33.75 l 40.5 33.75 l 40.5 0

147
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,020
And since he's such a star, a sleeping prank would be...

148
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,600
Not to mention, now of all times.

149
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,770
Right, I'd love to see this.

150
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,030
Well, I went and did it.

151
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,930
Please Watch

152
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,930
Roll It

153
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,070
Good evening, I'm Mori Shinichi.

154
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,910
Good evening, I'm Mori Shinichi.

155
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,270
Hey, it's pretty good.

156
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,310
Today,

157
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,600
This is good

158
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:35,050
It seems that there was a sleeping prank request

159
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:35,050
for me, so

160
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,420
I'd like to start right away.

161
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,720
Got Pranked

162
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,720
If Mori Shinchi

163
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,720
While Sleeping...

164
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,270
Good morning!

165
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,430
Fujiwara Kazuhiro

166
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,430
Inomoto Takafumi

167
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,430
License

168
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,500
Oh, it's License

169
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,120
They play the
pranksters, huh

170
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,050
That's usually
their role

171
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,920
Right now,

172
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,650
in room 107 here,

173
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,820
So this was definitely
Fixed right?

174
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,400
Exactly

175
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,920
we've heard that it's Mori Shinichi's room.

176
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,470
He's sleeping.

177
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,870
He's sound asleep.

178
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,720
Sleeping Mori Shinichi

179
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,970
Take a look at this.

180
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,020
All of his clothes are here.

181
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,260
Clothes Taken Off All Over the Bed

182
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,050
Surprisingly, he doesn't hang up his clothes.

183
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,600
Mori-san does that?

184
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,000
Perhaps, in the bed he's...

185
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,870
Ah, hold on

186
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,140
Let's take a look at his face.

187
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,800
Won't he wake
up if they do that?

188
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,100
Here we go.

189
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,770
Slowly...

190
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,750
Even slowly
he'll wake up

191
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,590
Sound Asleep Mori Shinichi

192
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,170
He's really sleeping.

193
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,170
What is this

194
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,220
You can't sleep
through this

195
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,750
He's wearing the hotel pajamas.

196
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
The hotel pajamas.

197
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:00,050
His buttons are nicely buttoned as well, as expected from a real entertainer.

198
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,070
That was close, that was close.

199
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,320
He just rubbed his face.

200
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,100
What IS this

201
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,150
There's some power in that thing.

202
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,920
With this bazooka,

203
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,850
Waking Up Mori Shinichi with a Bazooka!

204
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,970
I'd like to try and wake him up with one shot.

205
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,770
Wait wait, that's...

206
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,920
And now,

207
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,250
If they do this...

208
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,650
3, 2, 1...

209
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,720
Good morning!

210
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,950
His face

211
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,520
His face...

212
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,450
Mornin'.

213
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,420
This is a sleeping prank!

214
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,900
It's very realistic

215
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
It's very realistic.

216
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,960
Come on, give me a break.

217
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,870
This is the face

218
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,450
It's not
quite right.

219
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,170
I thought you were
doing someone else.

220
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,720
How was it?

221
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,780
When you were sleeping I thought "That's probably what he'd look like" but

222
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,110
When you woke up you became someone else.

223
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,980
When you woke up you became someone else.

224
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,420
By "someone else" you mean...?

225
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,390
It was a bit different.

226
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,920
Maybe a little too much.

227
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,190
Mori Shinichi's gear shift

228
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,230
Mori Shinichi's gear shift

229
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,230
slips into different gears sometimes.

230
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,170
What does
"Mori Shinichi's gear shift" mean?

231
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,800
If you do the face for a long time

232
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,800
you start to lose control of it.

233
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,270
Like...

234
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,300
First gear looks like this.

235
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,240
But, if...

236
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,970
If you're lying down,

237
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,970
it's hard to get into that gear.

238
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,810
We're never gonna do this, though.

239
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,920
Just in case you guys ever do

240
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,620
We're never gonna ride that machine.

241
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,870
At any rate,

242
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,870
The next request is, Hamada-san.

243
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,860
Ah, yup.

244
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,400
Mine is this.

245
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,970
I'd also like to see this.

246
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,100
How does he get scared?

247
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:16,130
Hamada's Request

248
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:16,130
Test of Courage

249
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:16,130
m 0 0 l 0 33.75 l 40.5 33.75 l 40.5 0

250
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,100
Right.

251
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,120
Like "Does he scream?"

252
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,150
What scares him in the first place?

253
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,150
Exactly.

254
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,070
I completely became Mori Shinichi and did it.

255
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,040
This'll be tough.

256
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,040
Roll it.

257
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,110
To all,

258
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,210
Good evening, I'm Mori Shinichi.

259
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,840
Good evening, I'm Mori Shinichi.

260
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:33,080
It was requested that I perform a test of courage

261
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:33,080
for our viewers today.

262
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,150
He's looking
less and less like him.

263
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,750
I'm here at Fuji-Q's Shudder-With-Fear Maze today.

264
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,090
I'm here at Fuji-Q's Shudder-With-Fear Maze today.

265
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,300
This is straight up Endo

266
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,670
He's just making
his eyes bigger

267
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,800
I've heard it's an extremely scary attraction.

268
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,800
You went all
the way to Fuji-Q?

269
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,370
I'd like to start right away.

270
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,800
This is the second
day of filming

271
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,470
It's getting
hard to believe

272
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,450
It is getting
hard to sell it

273
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:54,740
If Mori Shinichi

274
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:54,740
Tested His Courage...

275
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,720
Is this
for real?

276
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
It really is
scary, you know?

277
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,720
Here I go.

278
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,870
This is a good angle.

279
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:09,350
I've heard that

280
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,450
I'd never do this.

281
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,350
the Shudder-With-Fear Maze is seriously scary.

282
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,320
I've heard it's actually scary.

283
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,070
So scary...

284
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,660
I already know, things are gonna pop out.

285
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,060
I already know, things are gonna pop out.

286
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,570
He's still
making the face.

287
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,800
I tried showing what
Mori Shinichi would do
the whole time.

288
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,550
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

289
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

290
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,190
Stay!

291
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,190
Stay!

292
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,190
Stay!!

293
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,120
It's clearly you.

294
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,170
But look,
it's Mori Shinichi.

295
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,120
Look!

296
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,490
Seriously,

297
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:49,990
Seriously, seriously, seriously, seriously.

298
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,960
Seriously, seriously, seriously, seriously.

299
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,300
Seriously, seriously, seriously, seriously.

300
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,770
Seriously, seriously, seriously, seriously.

301
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,320
There's definitely something in here.

302
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,300
Hey

303
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,800
Look, this is
completely Mori Shinichi.

304
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,320
This is good.

305
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,920
Isn't it good?

306
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,250
It's good some
of the time.

307
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,200
This was...

308
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,300
These parts where
you're scared is where...

309
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,700
I think it's the voice.

310
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,610
Stay! Stay! Stay!

311
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:34,870
Stay! Stay! Stay!

312
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,370
Stay! Stay! Stay!

313
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:35,810
Stay! Stay!!

314
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,810
Stay! Stay!!

315
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,670
What the hell is "stay"?

316
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,570
They really
come at you.

317
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,200
Like "stay over there"

318
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,220
Mori Shinichi would
never say that.

319
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,760
This hallway can't be good.

320
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,000
Something's gonna...

321
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,570
This can't be good.

322
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,250
The voice is good.

323
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,470
This was a really long hall.

324
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,380
He Prepares Himself and Continues

325
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,170
This was
really hard to do.

326
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,230
This...

327
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:32,300
You really need some courage for this.

328
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,900
I couldn't
even take a step.

329
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,070
Give me a moment

330
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:40,510
Ghost From Behind

331
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,820
This one was
persistent.

332
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,720
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

333
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,110
He Has to Run For It

334
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,550
Stay!!

335
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,650
You had to start
running away, huh.

336
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,520
Oh, it's kinda good.

337
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,470
It's pretty...

338
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,400
It's Endo again.

339
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,750
So that's where
he came from.

340
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,720
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

341
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,600
Mori's back.

342
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,050
This part was really good.

343
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,650
That part is great.

344
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,100
I liked that.

345
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,950
This is just Endo.

346
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,120
Then suddenly.

347
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,920
I guess when you get scared

348
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,200
Endo starts to come out.

349
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,660
Right, since I'm being scared there's nothing I can really do.

350
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,860
Your voice starts to go back to normal.

351
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,300
That's what I wanted to see as Mori-san.

352
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,800
So,

353
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,840
I want you to try a little harder, for the next episode.

354
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,040
I want you to try a little harder, for the next episode.

355
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,880
This episode isn't over yet, though.

356
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,550
We still have more.

357
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,550
Right.

358
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,250
Okay, this here.

359
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,620
Searching for real estate.

360
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,620
I was really surprised by this one.

361
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,960
I thought we could see the closest thing to the real, natural Mori-san with this.

362
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:11,830
Searching for
Real Estate

363
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:11,830
Tanaka's Request

365
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,670
Something only your partner here could show us.

366
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,830
Take a look, roll it.

367
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,100
Good evening, I'm Mori Shinichi.

368
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,870
Good evening, I'm Mori Shinichi.

369
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:21,170
There was a request to see me

370
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:21,170
choosing real estate property at a Realtor,

371
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,440
So I'd like to show this especially for the requester.

372
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
So I'd like to show this especially for the requester.

373
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,670
Well, here I go.

374
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,420
Only the
end was good.

375
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:34,990
If Mori Shinichi

376
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:34,990
Looked for Real Estate...

377
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,730
He Will Visit a Realtor in Yamanashi Prefecture

378
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,260
I'm Mori.

379
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,550
Nice to meet you.

380
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,400
Like he's getting
a holiday house.

381
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,660
What kind of place where you looking for today?

382
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,900
Oh, like a villa.

383
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,700
A place where I can sing would be great.

384
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,770
A place where I can sing would be great.

385
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,370
A place where I can sing would be great.

386
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,240
Where you
can sing.

387
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,670
Right now there's 2 properties.

388
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,620
Places where you could sing.

389
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,010
This here,

390
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,810
There's only 7 of these buildings in Japan.

391
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,850
The insulation is fantastic in these.

392
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,350
You would never get
to see the real Mori
Shinichi doing this.

393
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,330
Mori-san?

394
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,450
This might be the
closest one to the
real thing.

395
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,690
Including everything, it's about 44,000,000 Yen.

396
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,450
Up to now, yea.

397
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,200
Including everything, it's about 44,000,000 Yen.

398
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,150
True

399
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,300
That's quite a price.

400
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,300
That was Endo
right there.

401
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,150
That was me?

402
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,240
There's also a place with a view of Mt. Fuji and the lake.

403
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,150
That was just you.

404
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,620
This is turning out
just like Fuji-Q.

405
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,410
We can set that property up for a visit right now,

406
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,410
if you'd like to go see it after this.

407
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,750
I see.

408
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,120
It's all over the place.

409
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,950
Are you sick
or something?

410
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:49,290
They Head to the Resort Apartment Near the Lake.

411
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,600
The resort mansion...

412
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,300
It's this one here.

413
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,070
16065, huh.

414
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,300
This was the best
room in the whole
apartment.

415
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,600
It's huge.

416
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,570
Oh, it's big.

417
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,620
The living room is 329 sq ft, and feels nice and wide.

418
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,420
But the best part is...

419
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,690
The Amazing

420
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,690
View

421
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,590
Yamanaka Lake

422
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,170
That's a great view of Fuji.

423
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:27,200
Mount Fuji

424
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,220
What a view.

425
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,620
Bravo.

426
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,070
To the right, Yamanaka Lake, and to the left, Mount Fuji.

427
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:37,720
Taking that all into consideration, 8,000,000 Yen isn't so bad. What do you think?

428
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,000
His face must
hurt by now.

429
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,620
His eyes are
really shining.

430
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,070
He has other
songs, you know?

431
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,670
He had a lot of
other hits, you know?

432
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:01,200
Why are you only
using this one song?

433
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,670
That's not the
right face.

434
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,850
Sometimes the
wrong face just
happens.

435
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,400
Thank you.

436
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,820
It was very natural.

437
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,770
The most up to this point.

438
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,580
It was the best of all so far.

439
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:24,870
That place's view was actually really good

440
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:24,870
so I thought I'd just take it all in and reflect for real.

441
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:25,760
Do you mean as Endo or as Mori-san?

442
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,860
Do you mean as Endo or as Mori-san?

443
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,860
Mori-san.

444
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,850
As Mori-san?

445
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,100
That's confusing, huh

446
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,300
You have to mean as yourself or else it's too confusing.

447
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,000
Did Mori-san say that?

448
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,570
Mori-san said "I'm gonna reflect" or

449
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,070
Mori-san said "I'm gonna reflect" or

450
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,070
something along those lines.

451
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,440
See, that's just weird.

452
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,810
That one word makes it all weird.

453
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,100
I have more request, a prank

454
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,300
This here,

455
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,670
Ah,

456
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,620
I wanna see what will happen.

460
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,500
If Mori-san was pranked like that it would probably never be allowed on air,

461
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,670
and we'd never be able to see it, so

462
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,900
I went and did it, take a look. Roll it.

463
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,300
Good evening, I'm Mori Shinichi

464

Good evening, I'm Mori Shinichi

465
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,910
watch me get pranked sexually,

466
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,910
There was a request to

467
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,910
So I'd like to show this especially for the requester.

468
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:27,920
Got Pranked

469
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:27,920
If Mori Shinichi

470
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:27,920
Sexually...

471
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,170
So he's pretending to
not know he's gonna
get pranked?

472
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:33,090
Mori Shinichi's

473

The first lesson is the approach.

479
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:44,840
1st Lesson

480
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:44,840
Approach

483
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,570
We'll start with around a 35 yard approach, and slight downward slope.

484
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,850
This is a pretty hard approach.

485
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,070
Why is it at a
golf course?

486
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,200
It's getting confusing.

487
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,820
It's too complicated.

488
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,150
I think that was pretty good.

489
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,950
I recommend actually getting it on the green.

490
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,480
Alright, that's good!

491
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,070
We'll prepare for the next shot, so please wait a bit.

492
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,800
This is a tough shot, right?

493
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,300
Mori-san, Good work. Would you like a drink?

00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,320
Ah,

501
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,700
What else do you have?

502
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,940
Suddenly-Squatting Mori Shinichi

503
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,720
Uhm, tea,

504
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,370
coffee, sports drinks, and mineral water.

505
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,650
What would you like?

506
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,990
Pretending-Not-to-See Mori Shinichi

507
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,800
What is this?

508
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,950
Which one would you like?

509
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,850
I don't even know
what I'm watching
anymore.

510
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,450
This is just bad.

511
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,450
I don't know what
this is anymore.

512
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,750
What IS this?

513
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,300
Wow! Nice swing!

514
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,300
It was nothing.

515
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,870
Here you go.

516
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,510
Clueless-and-Lighthearted Mori Shinichi

517
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,970
So stupid.

518
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,510
Recording

519
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:07,250
2nd Lesson

520
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:07,250
Putting

521
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:07,250
m 0 0 l 0 33.75 l 40.5 33.75 l 40.5 0

522
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:07,250
m 0 0 l 0 33.75 l 40.5 33.75 l 40.5 0

523
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,500
Anyway, a put shouldn't be swinged

524
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,950
so let's make it roll to the hole.

525
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,000
Just like that.

526
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,090
Alright, we got it.

527
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,920
Please come wait over here.

528
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,970
Alone With the Sexy Assistant...

529
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,800
Uhhh,

530
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,550
Yes?

531
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,210
If you keep standing

532
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,340
you'll get tired, so have a seat.

533
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,210
you'll get tired, so have a seat.

534
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,350
No, I shouldn't.

535
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,550
It's no problem.

536
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,350
Forcing-the-Assistant-to-Sit-Together Mori Shinichi

537
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,800
Ok, thank you.

538
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,800
You know,

539
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,150
Since we're doing golf today,

540
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,750
could I get a hand massage?

541
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,820
Ah, of course.

542
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,430
Demanding-a-Massage Mori Shinichi

543
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,700
If I may.

544
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,920
What is this?

545
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,850
Does this hurt?

546
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,000
Her Breasts are Right Before His Eyes ❤

547
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,650
Not at all.

548
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,620
Ok, good.

549
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,150
What is he doing?

550
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
He's touching her leg.

551
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,370
Hey, where are you touching? Stop it you pervert!

552
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,200
Stop it you pervert!

553
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,500
That was just Endo.

554
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,550
Straight up Endo.

555
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,720
Big Success!

556
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,770
Right?

557
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,200
From the viewer's perspective,

558
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,720
it was hard to watch.

559
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,350
The viewers won't know what to do.

560
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,020
I wonder how they explained it all to that actress, too.

561
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,630
I wonder how they explained it all to that actress, too.

562
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,870
"Because Mori-san is watching."

563
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,870
And now, I received another, final request.

564
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,840
And now, I received another, final request.

565
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,670
And now, I received another, final request.

566
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,710
So I'd like to finish the program with this.

567
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,740
Winter's Riviera.

568
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,280
Winter's Riviera.

569
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,790
This is funnier than everything else.

570
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,750
I love this.

571
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,650
Not bad.

572
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,250
He's pretty good.

573
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,900
Not bad!

574
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,060
He got way better since last time.

575
00:23:04,130 --> 00:24:09,790
This video was brought to you by Tofu panda Fansubs

576
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,150
He's a little better.

577
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,070
He wasn't great at first, but.

578
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,450
He really drew that out.

579
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,400
Much better than before.

580
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,400
I agree.

581
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:45,740
I hope to see you all again soon.

582
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,820
Have a good night.

583
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,800
Halfway through he started doing Shimura Ken...

584
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,720
There were a lot of parts like that.
