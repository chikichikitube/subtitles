1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,680
My First Errand -
Don't be disheartened baby special.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,090
We are showing this today as a special thing.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,960
To give strength to the disheartened kids.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,330
Miyagi ● Sendai

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,990
First off

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,660
In east Japan after the great earthquake, Ritsuki was born.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,470
Ritsuki
3 years 5 months

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,800
Both his parents are beauticians.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,270
Ritsuki has been independent since birth.

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,240
And they made a shop called Avenire which is French for future.

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,510
Avenir

12
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,740
How fancy.

13
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,340
Future

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,650
They redid the interior after the great earthquake with the help of an acquaintance, Taira-san.

15
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,450
He's also a member in a cheering squad.

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,950
Mr. Taira

17
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:45,360
Filmed in 2016

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,590
The father was invited by Taira to join their cheering squad.

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,460
From the soft world of a beautician
As a beautician, he comes from a gentle world...

20
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,530
Father

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,260
He wants to be regarded as cool by his kids

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,400
The reason for the formation of the squad...

23
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,140
(Volunteer force in Miyagi prefecture)

24
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,140
Team Shovel

25
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,370
The "team shovel" which was created during the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami

26
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,410
who brought their support in a time of need.

27
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,140
That's when the group leader Taira thought: "We need some encouragement."

28
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,710
Blue sky cheering squad

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,380
That's when he formed the "Blue sky cheering squad".

30
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,450
They will go wherever they've been requested to.

31
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,050
Hospitals, festivals and weddings.

32
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:17,120
It's because when someone has someone rooting for them, they can show extraordinary strength.

33
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,200
And it's not just the dad. The entire family is putting their heart into the "Blue sky cheering squad".

34
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:31,340
Ritsuki

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,300
Ritsuki's dream is to be part of the blue sky cheering squad.

36
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,840
So he wants to be part of it.

37
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,900
He's always scampering around so his nickname is "scampy".

38
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,470
Like his father he's not good at raising his voice.

39
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,650
"But in order to cheer up others he has to learn to do better."

40
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,420
That's what his parents have decided.

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,950
His brother has already gone on an errand alone.

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,020
Brother
Ruito

43
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,260
Today is the 6th birthday of his beloved big brother.

44
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,360
And as a secret to celebrate his brother...

45
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,030
the "blue sky cheering squad" will come.

46
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,570
Ah! He has a bruise on his forehead.

47
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,170
Oh no.

48
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,670
He wore his shoes on the wrong foot and started running.

49
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,700
Oh no.

50
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,410
Wonder if brobro will be happy.

51
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,410
Um.

52
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,010
For today Ritsuki will also

53
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,110
be joining the cheering squad.

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,050
How nice.

55
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,820
What haircut will he settle on?
He's full of vigor.

56
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,050
So cute.

57
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,850
How cool.

58
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,390
And with this along with Taira and the cheering squad...

59
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,160
His father has prepared clothes for the cheering squad.

60
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,790
Pants and... ah!

61
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,960
There is no jacket.

62
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,530
The important jacket is missing.

63
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,630
You better bring it.

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,830
Filmed in 2016.

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,400
This is...

66
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,400
Oh no. That's no good.

67
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,500
Since I have to cut the customers' hair...

68
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,500
And we begin...

69
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,840
Ritsuki, can you go?

70
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,040
All by myself?

71
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,670
He's getting it at his home.

72
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,910
Mama is at home so...

73
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,350
I can't do it by myself.

74
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,650
Yes, you can. You've ridden the bus so many times already.

75
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,980
Going by bus?

76
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,980
So he's going by bus.

77
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,020
It's fine.

78
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,820
Just like his dad.

79
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,090
I can't cheer without a jacket.

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,830
Ritsuki, don't you want to cheer Ruito?

81
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,130
I do.

82
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,070
But I will feel lonely.

83
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,770
They are both trying to persuade each other through subdued mutterings.

84
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,970
Boys will be boys.

85
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,310
And then...

86
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,540
Dad will give you an encouraging cheer...

87
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,850
His father has become decisive.

88
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,820
Yo!

89
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,020
Yo!

90
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,690
Heeeeey.

91
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,320
Heee-eeey.

92
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,390
Ri-tsu-kiii.

93
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,430
Now he can do his best.

94
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,000
Aaaand... Hey! Hey!

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,870
Ritsuki.

96
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,740
Hey! Hey!

97
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,940
Ri-tsu-kiiiiiiiiii.

98
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,470
His face changed.

99
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,010
Right, really, really....

100
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,570
Yo!

101
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,880
Yo!

102
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,380
Can you go by yourself?

103
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,920
His tone went down a lil...

104
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:05,760
Beauty parlor

105
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:05,760
Home

106
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:05,760
Nishinakayama

107
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,080
Across the road from the store

108
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,650
he will ride the bus towards Nishinakayama.

109
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,760
Get off on the last stop and get the jacket from his home.

110
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,860
That's tough.

111
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,230
See you.

112
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,260
Off you go.

113
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,360
A father-son that are like peas in a pod.

114
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,560
I will be working then.

115
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,560
The one sending off...

116
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,030
understands how the one being sent-off feels.

117
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,940
Bye bye.

118
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,940
He's hesitating.

119
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,740
Alright. Off he goes.

120
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
Oh. He's running.

121
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,050
The bus stop is across the road from the beauty parlor.

122
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,750
His father tried to time it with the bus timetable.

123
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,020
And Ritsuki should make it just in time however...

124
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,090
But looking at the timetable again...

125
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,460
The first bus to arrive will not be the right one.

126
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,460
Oh no.

127
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,260
A bus that won't reach home.

128
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,230
- Oh no.

129
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,230
- No good.

130
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:54,070
Kitanakayama

131
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:54,070
Kitanakayama Nishinakayama

132
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:54,070
Zanezawa eigyoujyo

133
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,400
The next one is going to Zanezawa

134
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,070
but to get home he needs to ride the bus to Nishinakayama.

135
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,440
- That's bad.
- He's definitely gonna board it.

136
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,280
You shouldn't board the next bus.

137
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,250
Of course he can't read the destination on the bus.

138
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,190
Would be good if he asked the driver. But he's not good at letting out his voice.

139
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,250
- Looks bad.
- What will he do?

140
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,890
Excuse me.

141
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,060
Are you heading to Nishinakayama?

142
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,090
Ah, good job!

143
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,090
Nishinakayama?

144
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,090
Yeah.

145
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,630
I'm sorry but I'm not.

146
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,330
Dad, Ritsuki was able to ask loud and clear.

147
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,670
He didn't board it indeed.

148
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,670
He did it.

149
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,500
What a relief.

150
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,780
Truth is that he's been playing "bus pretend" in the bath with his brother.

151
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,840
His brother takes the role of the driver.

152
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,150
And Ritsuki is the passenger.

153
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,150
And he will say: "Going to Nishiyama?"

154
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,980
Excuse me.

155
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,860
Are you going to Nishiyama?

156
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,090
Excuse me. Nishiy...

157
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,090
Please wait.

158
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,300
The bus driver went as far as getting off the bus.

159
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,500
I am going to Nishiyama.

160
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,300
Please touch this thing.

161
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,700
He's going as far to teach him how to ride.

162
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,700
How kind.

163
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,440
Touch here and then sit...

164
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,280
He's even showing him a place to sit.

165
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,980
How kind.

166
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,510
He boarded it.

167
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,790
Filmed in 2016

168
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,650
Just like the bus driver requested.

169
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,760
He's holding on tight to the handrail.

170
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,630
He's nervous.

171
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:22,660
He's nervous.

172
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,660
He isn't scampering around today.

173
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,830
Today he isn't even wearing his shoes on the wrong foot.

174
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,830
That's great.

175
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,970
Needs to go 10 bus stops.

176
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,780
But since it's the last stop he doesn't need to hit the stop button.

177
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,940
He's riding while quietly listening to the driver.

178
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,890
Thank you for riding.

179
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,560
Last stop. Nishinakayama.

180
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,330
This is the last stop.

181
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,730
Please touch here.

182
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,900
He's even teaching him how to disembark.

183
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,440
Thank you very much.

184
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,010
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

185
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,710
How remarkable.

186
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,680
He's letting out his voice today.

187
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,190
"After the bus ride I'm counting on you."

188
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,320
That's what his dad said over the phone.

189
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,390
Will he be like: "I want to go back with mom?"

190
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,390
Huh?

191
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,600
Huh? Ricchi what's up?

192
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,870
You see...

193
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,400
I'm busy.

194
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,400
You're busy?

195
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,170
The jacket.

196
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,940
Jacket?  What's up with the jacket?

197
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,210
There it was. Daddy totally forgot it.

198
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,410
Yeah.

199
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,450
He's no good.

200
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,050
He's no good... hahaha

201
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,450
See Ricchi.

202
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,590
Isn't it cool?

203
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,120
Yeah.

204
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,620
It's cool.

205
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,730
His mom, is making sure to encourage Ritsuki.

206
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,900
If it's too big then you should wear your own.

207
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,330
No, it's small.

208
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,630
It's huge.

209
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,630
You can lift your spirits.

210
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,740
Aaaaaah.

211
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,170
Aaa-aaand

212
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,710
Go!

213
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,810
Aa-and

214
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,940
go!

215
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,410
Cheer-ing squad

216
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,180
With the jacket his grandmother made he has powered up.

217
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,320
I clawed you.

218
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:37,060
Beauty parlor

219
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:37,060
Choumeigaoka sanchoume nishi

220
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:37,060
Home

221
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:33,190
The way back also has five bus routes, so he must ask if the bus will stop near the salon.

222
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,060
Will he be able to say: Choumeigaokasanchoumenishi?

223
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,200
That's difficult.

224
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,200
Hey hey.

225
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,370
One more time, what bus was it again?
Choumeigaokasanchoumenishi

226
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,370
...choumenishi

227
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,140
Choumeigaokasanchoumenishi

228
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,040
Did you get it?

229
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,040
Yep.

230
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Off you go.

231
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,640
It will be difficult from this point on.

232
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,340
Do your best.

233
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,810
But in this outfit he will definitely give it his all.

234
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,850
- How cool.

235
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,850
- Amazing. Looks like he's going into battle.

236
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,890
At the crossing there are flags left there.

237
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,820
Ah, he has his own.

238
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,160
He will use his own?

239
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,020
The flag of the cheering squad.

240
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,760
His mother made it by hand.

241
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,890
Amazing.

242
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,870
The scampering Ritsuki is appearing to us like an entirely different person.

243
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,070
For real.

244
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,870
Can he?

245
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,340
Excuse me.

246
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,140
Excuse me.

247
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,110
Are you going to Choumeigaoka sanchoume nishi?

248
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,950
He said it.

249
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,720
We go that way. Please board.

250
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,820
He said it properly.

251
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,390
And what he learned before?

252
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,820
To present the card.

253
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,360
This time he was asked to ride behind the driver.

254
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,300
Look look. He's properly holding on to the handrail.

255
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,110
Both his parents said: "Do your best."

256
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,510
And therefor Ritsuku has become more reliable than usual.

257
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,380
It's not the last stop so you better press the button.

258
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,290
The big birthday cake sign is the landmark visible from the bus.

259
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:17,630
Next is Choumeigaoka Sanchoume West.

260
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,230
There. It's even being announced.

261
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,230
It's there.

262
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,630
There. You better press it.

263
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,470
Did he become sleepy?

264
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,260
Become sleepy?

265
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,800
An old lady is getting off.

266
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,770
How great.

267
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,370
The bus stopped at Choumeigaoka Sanchoume West.

268
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,380
Oh no. You should get off.

269
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,880
Are you not getting off?

270
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,880
What a relief.

271
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,850
What a relief.

272
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,250
Better listen to the driver.

273
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,550
We are at Choumeigaoka Sanchoume West.

274
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,790
Thank you very much.

275
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,520
How great.

276
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,190
He was taught to get off.

277
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,530
Yes. Thank you.

278
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,260
Thank you very much.

279
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,000
How great.

280
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,240
Dad has been starring at the bus stop the entire time.

281
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,100
He's worried.

282
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,840
Daddy. Yahoo.

283
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,880
He's so tiny.

284
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,220
Welcome back.

285
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,220
Daddy, it was there.

286
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,220
Thank you.

287
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,090
Thank you.

288
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,390
You did well while going by yourself.

289
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,430
Were you scared.

290
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,430
Yep.

291
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,230
Were you sad?

292
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,800
But you were able to go by yourself.

293
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,400
Now dad can be part of the Blue Skies Cheering Squad.

294
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,400
Ritsuki.

295
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,500
Thank you.

296
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,970
Cool.

297
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,410
And now they are about to cheer his brother on for his birthday.

298
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,890
Let's make it the best birthday for him.

299
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,690
With squad leader Taira in front Blue Skies have gathered.

300
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,390
Yo.

301
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:00,700
Seeing the Blue Skies Cheering Squad up close.

302
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:02,070
Filmed in 2016.

303
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,670
Let's do our best.

304
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,900
It carries a punch.

305
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,900
Yo.

306
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,040
Yo.

307
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,170
He'll cry.

308
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,340
He's slightly intimidated.

309
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,480
It carries too much of a punch.

310
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,980
Alright. It's beginning now.

311
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,880
The mother is bringing his brother.

312
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,290
The squad leader has deferred dad to be in the center position.

313
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,820
Yo!

314
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,320
Yo.

What a nice smile

317
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,930
Let's do this.

318
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,470
Heeeeey.

319
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,700
Heeeeeeey.

And a...

322
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,810
Hey. Hey. Ruito.

323
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,620
Hey. Hey. Ruito.

324
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,120
Ruito do your best.

325
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
Do your best.

326
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,590
Hey. Yo!

327
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,590

Ritsuki.

341
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,090

How is it? Is it small?

346
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,900
It's small.

347
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,570
Where is it tight?

348
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,940

Fukui ● Echizen Town

365
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,320
We've arrived at Fukui in the coast of Sea of Japan.

366
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,090
Filmed in 1996.

367
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:44,160
The owner of this sushi shop is very strict when it comes to serving Echizen crabs as sashimi.

368
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,490
Father

369
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,230
But he has a sweet spot for his eldest son, Iori.

370
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:51,470
Iori
3 years
6 months old

371
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,470
And Iori knows that quite well.

372
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,470
Iori come here.

373
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,140
This is Iori and his first errand.

374
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,940
Iori. Ask grandpa

375
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,780
for crabs. Get the best one.

376
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,720
That's right. Crabs are counted with the modifier "pai".

377
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,090
'K? Can you do it?

378
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,790
Can you go?

379
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,790
He can't?

380
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:19,630
Crab fish tank

381
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:19,630
Grandpa

382
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:19,630
Shop

383
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:17,130
400 meters down the same street to get grandpas to take him to the crab fish tank.

384
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,630
That's what the entire errand.

385
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,900
"I told you, I can't go daddy."

386
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,900
Can you go if I hug you once?

387
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,470
His dad is so soft on him.

388
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,470
And then you will go?

389
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,680
His mothers eyes are shining.

390
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,910
Please.

391
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,280
Why can't you go?

392
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,080
Will you get lonely?

393
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,150
Getting lonely?

394
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,720
Mother

395
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,690
The mother is an Echizen woman. She's tough on her husband.

396
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,990
She grabbed him.

397
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,320
Leave him be.

398
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,830
He's not going because you are putting it that way.

399
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,190
You are so soft.

400
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,960
It's beginning. The usual fight.

401
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,330
Fulfill your duty seriously.

402
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,030
Leave him alone if you want him to go.

403
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,040
Hope they will forget all about the errand.

404
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,840
Please leave him be, dad.

405
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,810
You are not allowed to speak.

406
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,380
Now that they went each their own way it means that daddy is coming.

407
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,850
Iori. Go and come back!

408
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,450
His dad changed his way.

409
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,450
There is no one who can go but you Iori.

410
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,450
That's right.

411
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,460
Carry this. Yes.

412
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,520
Iori.

413
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,960
Will you not listen to your father?

414
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,930
That's right. That's right.

415
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,930
You.

416
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,360
Go and come back.

417
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,300
Did you get it?

418
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,130
Alright?

419
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,470
I want you to go.

420
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:33,200
Carrying him? Isn't that bad, dad?

421
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,670
Treating Iori like a baby.

422
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,440
He's taking him to where his mother can't see.

423
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,480
Ok? I'm begging you.

424
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,810
If you listen to your daddy

425
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,180
I will take you to your favorite place.

426
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,760
Right? Go and get the crabs. Listen to your daddy.

427
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,960
No good dad.

428
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,060
Got it?

429
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,130
This is a test of endurance for the father.

430
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,330
But hey Iori. Dad is different today from his usual self.

431
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,940
He will quit it eventually.

432
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,940
He will come to get him back, right?

433
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,210
Huh? You are still lingering around?

434
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,790
Worried of a grinning mother.

435
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,590
What is she doing?

436
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,620
I will lend you the sword, Iori, since you are a scaredy cat.

437
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,630
You're not strong, are you?

438
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,930
Do you want the sword?

439
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,360
Will you take the sword?

440
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,960
It's Iori's cherished sword.

441
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,270
He will likely grow strong as soon as she gives it to him.

442
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,670
Take the sword. How cool.

443
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,010
Won't you be a man, Iori?

444
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,940
Will you go? Won't you?

445
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,840
I won't. I won't.

446
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:54,920
TN: They are speaking in a heavy dialect and this time the narrator is mimicking him thus the faint studio laugh.

447
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,050
I will be watching you.

448
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,520
For his first errand his mother must battle it out with him.

449
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,690
I don't wanna.

450
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,120
Only babies want to be held and hold hands.

451
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,430
A baby after all.

452
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,360
His mother withdrew her hands.

453
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,630
If she holds out her hands here he will want to be cuddled even further.

454
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,970
His mother knows that.

455
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,870
The kind smell of his mothers apron.

456
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,600
You will be laughed at by babies like a baby.

457
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,670
But today is different.

458
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,440
Then you can't be a big brother.

459
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,950
It's no good hitting her.

460
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,480
Nor is hugging her.

461
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,780
Or flailing and making a scene.

462
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,020
Go!

463
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,390
I won't let you back in.

464
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,460
Look forward and walk.

465
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,930
Look forward and walk.

466
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,200
While withdrawing her hands his mother thinks of a new strategy.

467
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,330
I...

468
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,870
If you walk over to that electric pole

469
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,540
then I will walk right behind you.

470
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,980
Look forward and walk.

471
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,980
She will make him walk a little more and more by himself.

472
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,110
Ah, you arrived.

473
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,180
And without forgetting to praise him.

474
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,720
Huh? You've walked this far?

475
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Where's home? Iori's home.

476
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,020
You've walked so much.

477
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,990
Go the yellow circle next.

478
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,990
Go.

479
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,000
Go.

480
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,200
It's just a bit more until the yellow circle.

481
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,740
Go!

482
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,270
- He's not going.

483
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,270
- Not going.

484
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,310
Go!

485
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,110
Oh, just a bit more.

486
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,650
Your feet are outside of it. Go to the middle .

487
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,450
Alright.

488
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,920
She keeps her promise.

489
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,250
See? I actually came.

490
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,620
Hehe. He has started having fun.

491
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,530
Next... next, go to where that line is...

492
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:48,300
And like that Iori's mother increased the distance bit by bit.

493
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,140
For his first errand his mother's strategy is necessary.

494
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,980
His grandfather should be at the seashore at this time.

495
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,640
Cross. Iori cross.

496
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,150
Alright. He went.

497
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,150
He's alright now.

498
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,380
Echizen women are strict with their boys.

499
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,850
Brother.

500
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,850
Brother.

501
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,190
But she's also kind.

502
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,320
Grandpa.

503
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,060
He's running.

504
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,800
Crab. Crab. Crab.

505
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,330
Iori. What's up?

506
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,830
Crab.

507
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,000
I am here to get crabs.

508
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,340
Wow.

509
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,740
Were you told to collect crabs?

510
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,670
Yes, I was.

511
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,910
But for grandpa

512
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,040
it might be a bit difficult.

513
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,250
But you came to grandpa, didn't you?

514
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,980
I'm getting the one in the back.

515
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,980
You will?

516
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,220
Yeah, see.

517
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,880
Like you were told by grandpa, right?

518
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,050
This one is huge.

519
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,590
This one is huge.

520
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,590
He grabbed it with his hands.

521
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,060
Aren't you scared?

522
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,060
One crab is 20.000 yen.

523
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,000
He was asked to only bring one crab.

524
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,230
But you can't carry it.

525
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,800
It's fine with just this one.

526
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,070
I don't just want that.

527
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,610
I was told to get many crabs.

528
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,610
TN: The counter for (1) crab (ippai) makes it sound like many (ippai).

529
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,410
One (/Many)? That would mean one.

530
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,010
We better get more crabs.

531
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,950
Otherwise my mom won't be glad.

532
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,720
You want to make her happy?

533
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,720
This one is small.

534
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,220
He intends to bring the biggest ones.

535
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,030
This one is huge.

536
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,560
This one is the biggest one.

537
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,400
An even bigger crab than the previous one.

538
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,670
He's not afraid of the pincers.

539
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,840
As expected from a child of the seashore.

540
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,010
Heave-ho​. Heave-ho.

541
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,010
I bet it's heavy.

542
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,540
Big brother. Big brother.

543
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,610
I wonder if mom will be happy.

544
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,420
He's happy with himself.

545
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,150
Despite crying so much on the way there.

546
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:51,160
Did he forget it all? Even the thing about the yellow circle.

547
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,530
It's fine. I can go by myself.

548
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,430
It's fine.

549
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,100
As long as Iori has his sword he's someone to be feared.

550
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
It's fine. It's fine.

551
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,940
Even the customers are waiting for Iori's crabs.

552
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,670
You came back.

He came back.

555
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,780
It took him 5 minutes to walk back.

556
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,610
Welcome back.

557
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,550
You are such a well-behaved boy.

558
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,650
Bring it to dad.

559
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,790
Dad...

560
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:26,660
said 1 crab so why did you bring 2?

561
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,660
One crab / many?

562
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,830
About the crab

563
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,760
get 1 / many.

564
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,800
Didn't dad say to get many?

565
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,040
What a good boy.

566
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,410
Don't gush all over me, mom.

567
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,410
I am a big brother after all.

568

Because of the novel Corona

00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,490
at our place

575
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:04,330
we've had about 300 cancellations from March to April.

576
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,800
I hesitated towards doing my best

577
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,270
despite the bleak outlook.

578
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,410
But now I've decided to put my all towards what I'm doing right now.

579
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,680
I just

580
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,110
don't want to lose this fight.

581
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:28,390
I don't want to lose to Corona. That's my intention.

582

Iori is a company worker in Tokyo.

583

Even though you have a cup.

586
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,660
Haha, that's right.

587
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,900
No no. He has a girlfriend.

588
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,830
She's the one filming.

589
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,470
He washes his hands and gargles as a precaution against Corona.

590
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,410
I am working at home.

591
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,010
And this type of work

592
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,950
is remote work on my computer.

593
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,780
And even today I had meetings where...

594
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,550

My girlfriend is cleaning.

600
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,310
You see...

601
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,280
A messy room is a messy heart.

602
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,480
Yeah.

603
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,710
You look at it constantly and think

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,710
Yep.

605
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,080
This is no good. The room is a mess.

606
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,950
A perfect match for Iori.

607
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,790
The mother has decided.

608
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,800
Mother

609
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,360
To create an errand on her day of giving birth.

610
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,070
How surprising.

611
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,400
Ibaraki ● Jyousou city

612
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:58,400

613
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,800
2 months before the expected date.

614
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,440
We met with them at the beginning of the summer.

615
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,410
The mother had a single worry.

00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,140
About Hideki who is the middle child of 3.

618
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,080
Who is a kind and easy to comprehend boy.

619
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,620
Hideki
4 years 10 months

620
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,420
As the mother's stomach grows larger,

621
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,420
She's worried he'll become jealous of the attention given to the baby.

622
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,290
And that's why his mother decided

623
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,120
to put him on an errand on the day of the birth.

624
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,060

An errand for the baby.

627
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,260
Something that will change Hideki as a big brother.

628
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,870
And suddenly the contractions began.

629
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,940
"Hideki, your mother is giving it her all so let's all do our best."

630
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,310
That's what his father told him.

631
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,950
And then it happened while the kids were at the pool.

632
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,620
Predicting this his mother made a phone guide.

633
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,120
If you Use this to get to the hospital.

634
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,860
And his father hurried to the hospital from his workplace.

635
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,130
It's the dad. He can't know when the actual birth will take place.

636
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,770
Father

637
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,170
It's a crucial time.

638
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,470
And he asked the kids to jump on a taxi and ride to the hospital.

639
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,840
And that's the errand that his mother thought up.

640
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,650
The kids should be back by now.

641
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,550
Hideki and his little sister Natsuki.

642
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,350
Hello?

643
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:19,860
Hideki. It's dad. Mom still hasn't given birth...

644
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,820
Yep.

645
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,590
but the baby will be born soon so

646
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,130
can you call a taxi and ride it here?

647
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,130
Yep.

648
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,860
Next to the TV

649
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:32,040
your mother's maternity health record book can be found.

650
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,970
She forgot her maternity health book.

651
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,040
She needs it while giving birth.

652
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,140
Found it.

653
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,410
Can you bring it with Natsuki?

654
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,410
I can.

655
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,410
Natsuki is still only 1 years old.

656
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,820
Do you know where to find the wallet?

657
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,290
His mother's wallet. They will need money.

658
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,290
It's in her bag.

659
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,760
And then there is a basket. For carrying the baby in.

660
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,760
Yeah.

661
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,160
Natsuki only has to follow along.

662
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,760
Baby basket.

663
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,160
Then call the taxi. I'm relying on you.

664
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,500
Father, son and mother.

665
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,970
This is the beginning of their fight.

666
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,310
This is Hideki's first time calling for a taxi.

667
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,250
Thanks for calling. This is Kantetsu Taxi.

668
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,590
I see.

669
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,920
Please send a taxi.

670
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,420
Alright. We will be there soon.

671
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,230
He was able to call for a taxi.

672
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,400
Hideki is doing it properly.

673
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,830
And closing off the house.

674
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,600
Alright.

675
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,470
- Wow. Remarkable.

676
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,470
- Remarkable.

677
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,410
And he put shoes on his sister Natsuki.

678
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,380
And locked the front door.

679
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,050
We've asked for permission to film from the taxi company

680
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:57,020
and we've placed cameras in the car.

681
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,830
Thank you very much.

682
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,660
Natsuki is not good with strangers.

683
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,470
Especially old guys. She won't talk with them.

684
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,970
It's fine.

685
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,740
The driver came from the city over.

686
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,940
It's his first time coming to this residence.

687
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,210
We have not told him where to go.

688
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,850
We only asked him to go where the kids tell him to.

689
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,950
Hey, don't cry, Natsuki.

690
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,850
Were are we going?

691
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,250
My mother is

692
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,090

693
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,390
both of us are going there.

694
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,030
Which hospital?

695
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,430
It's called Shoujisensei...

696
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,560
Do you know where?

697
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,100
I will teach you.

698
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,100
Thank you.

699
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,270
This is the first time for him to go to this hospital.

700
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:54,180
Home

701
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:54,180
Hospital

702
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:50,740
Hideki has gone to this hospital several times with his mother.

703
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,440
How well does he remember?

704
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,350
At the place called Kobayashi Store

705
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,250
there's a traffic light.

706
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,790
And go straight from there.

707
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,790
Straight ahead?

708
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,020
Ah, I forgot the basket.

709
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,830
The basket for the newborn.

710
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,290
You need to bring the basket?

711
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,600
Oh no.

712
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,770
Then we need to go back and get it, right?

713
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,270
I see. A baby has been born?

714
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,270
Yeah.

715
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,170
It looks like she's about to be born.

716
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,970
That's right. At the hospital...

717
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,340
the mother hasn't given birth yet.

718
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,080
The brother went to bring the basket.

719
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,180
Huh? She's not crying.

720
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,150
Natsuki who is timid towards strangers. s

721
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,850
The basket that will be used when leaving the hospital.

722
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,560
About 13 km to the hospital.

723
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,060
If everything goes well they will be there in 15 minutes.

724
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,900
Alright. Passed the Kobayashi store.

725
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,140
We could also go this way.

726
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,140
Which way?

727
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,970
Straight ahead.

728
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,970
Straight ahead?

729
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:59,010
Looks like the contractions are getting stronger.

730
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,490
The child will be here soon so please hang in there.s

731
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,950
Huh?

732
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,990
If I continue straight, will we hit it?

733
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:13,990
That's right.

734
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,990
TN: He meant to say "Un so" (Mhm, that's right), but his nervousness made it sound like "Uso" (I lied). That's why the narrator is asking him if he's alright.

735
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,800
You okay? Hideki.

736
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,170
Should I call them?

737
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,170
Just before the birth.

738
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,670
They are parting now.

739
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,810
The mother insisted on walking there by herself.

740
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,210
Amazing.

741
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,210
Remarkable.

742
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,690
The strong father can't be of any help today.

743
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,960
Turn this way.

744
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,960
Turning this way?

745
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,370
This is a narrow road.

746
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:55,370
That's right.

747
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,300
But we have to go this way, right?

748
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,170
If we go this way it will be even closer.

749
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,770
I know it all.

750
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,740
Really? They've driven for more than 20 minutes.

751
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,680
They should've been there by now.

752
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,450
I've seen a show on TV about going on errands by yourself.

753
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,120
And after seeing this I wanted to do my best

754
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,850
and that's why I'm doing it.

755
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,850
I see.

756
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,320
We are getting closer.

757
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
Is that really the case?

758
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,460
We decided that I first

759
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,470
Rice ball coated with sweetened red beans, soybean flour or sesame​

760
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,470
must go purchase a bald.

761
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,570
A (rice) ball?

762
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,570
A bald.

763
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,740
What's a bald?

764
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,000
A bald is

765
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,570
it's like a coated rice ball.

766
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,170
Who will eat the bald?

767
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,040
Mommy.

768
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,040
Ah, I see. Your mother.

769
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,880
His mother never asked for a rice ball.

770
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
The battle has started inside.

771
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,780
His father is nervously moving like the second hand while waiting.

772
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,920
The baby is about to be born.

773
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,190
Despite there not being a moment to spare, Hideki...

774
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,390
We decided that I first

775
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:00,400
must go purchase a bald.

776
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,260
A (rice) ball?

777
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,530
A bald.

778
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,600
What's a bald?

779
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,940
A bald is

780
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,500
it's like a coated rice ball.

781
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,100
Who will eat the bald?

782
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,970
Mommy.

783
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,970
Ah, I see. Your mother.

784
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,840
Can you wait?

785
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,580
His sister Natsuki has fallen silent.

786
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,910
Can you wait, Natsuki?

787
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,150
Even though he wasn't asked Hideki has decided to purchase rice balls.

788
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,090
It's fine here.

789
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,090
Is it fine here?

790
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,920
It's a shop.

791
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,020
They will have rice balls and dango, you see.

792
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,330
I will be looking after her, then.

793
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,300
Natsuki is not getting off.

794
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,830
Your brother will be back soon, okay?

795
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,270
Natsuki and an old guy.

796
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,710
Only today she has no major problem.

797
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,980
Hideki why are you worried about rice balls at this time?

798
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,620
If you don't hurry then Natsuki will cry.

799
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,120
The driver thought of a topic.

800
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,860
The brother talked about a baby. It would be nice if it was a girl, right?

801
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,130
Then both of you will be able to play.

802
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,130
She's answering a bit.

803
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,440
Excuse me.

804
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,510
Where do you have bald?

805
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,510
Huh? What? Ah, rice balls?

806
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,650
We don't have any rice balls.

807
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,280
They don't have rice balls?

808
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,590
Is it about to happen?

809
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,060
Still? Still?

810
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,990
Just a bit more.

811
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,130
He can't stand it here and there.

812
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,300
My mother is about to give birth

813
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,570
to a baby

814
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,500
and her breasts

815
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,440
need to produce milk

816
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,180
so I am here to purchase bald.

817
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,110
TN: Imitating Hideki he calls them bald on purpose.

818
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,110
That's why he's looking for "bald".

819
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,780
Hideki is kind after all.

820
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,220
Then...

821
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,220
For the baby

822
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,120
milk will come out.

823
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,120
From the breasts...

824
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,690
She will eat it to produce breast milk, right?

825
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,290
Hideki has learned that

826
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,760
when Natsuki was still a baby.

827
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,700
That's what his mother would often say while eating rice balls.

828
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,000
Rice cake stuffed with bean jam

829
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,000
Will daifuku do?

830
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,970
Daifuku. They share the mochi and anko qualities.

831
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,410
He decided to get daifuku instead of rice balls.

832
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,610
Ah... mh... did.

833
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:34,520
Daddy did? Papa?

834
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,520
Natsuki started talking.

835
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,260
Papa called on the phone.

836
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,530
Ah, I see. That's what he said.

837
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:45,260
I don't understand it that well.

838
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,030
That'll be 306 yen please.

839
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,170
Alright hurry. You got the daifuku.

840
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,910
I will splish-splash.

841
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,040
What will you splash? The pool?

842
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,310
The bath.

843
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,310
The bath? I see.

844
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,350
He's able to understand.

845
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,950
Will you take a bath?

846
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,890
I might also take a bath.

847
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:14,520
When I sweat or before sleep.

848
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,630
Did you take one?

849
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,130
Today?

850
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,930
I haven't taken one yet.

851
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,770
How nice.

852
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,570
While Hideki went shopping

853
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:32,110
the old guy and Natsuki were exchanging pleasantries.

854
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:35,080
He's back.

855
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,350
Hideki doesn't know about that.

856
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,750
Since your brother wants to get on can you move this way?

857
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,820
Since he...

858
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,820
If the guy says so.

859
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,660
The purchase has been made. Better hurry.

860
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,030
It will say Shouji Hospital

861
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,670
on the sign.

862
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,000
Their father in the hospital.

863
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,640
Not yet.

864
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,880
Huh. Around here?

865
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,480
This is Shouji Hospital.

866
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,120
Sorry for doubting you, Hideki.

867
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,520
40 minutes have passed since they left the house.

868
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,990
And for me...

869
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:23,030
It will be 5690 Yen.

870
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,060
A 5000 Yen bill.

871
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,600
And then 690 Yen.

872
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,870
Truth be told, it was supposed to be only 2000 Yen.

873
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,540
Thank you very much.

874
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,210
But it's great that they've arrived.

875
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,010
Alright. Don't forget the basket.

876
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,410
And this?

877
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,350
And her?

878
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,780
Natsuki.

879
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,020
You better follow him.

880
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,380
I will go on this.

881
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,550
Papa.

882
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,550
No, I don't want to go.

883
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,090
The old guy is here.

884
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,430
Will you not go to where papa is?

885
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,430
I will go.

886
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,190
You will go?

887
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,530
Then get off.

888
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,400
You can't go if you don't get off.

889
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,400
Don't wanna.

890
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,670
Why?

891
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,670
Here.

892
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,670
Maybe I can help you get off.

893
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,140
Get off with me.

894
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,610
If the old guy says so...

895
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,280
And that.

896
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,080
You can't forget what is good for the breasts.

897
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,990
Their father and mother are waiting.

898
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,950
Hey, Natsuki.

899
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,890
The old guy...

900
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,930
...left?

901
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,330
The bath loving old guy.

902
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,740
Natsuki come here.

903
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,140
Father, just a bit more.

904
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,410
I brought Natsuki.

905
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,780
You managed to do it.

906
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,580
Well done.

907
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,280
Hey. Thank you.

908
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,050
Thank you. Natsuki.

909
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,920
Hey, thank you.

910
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,990
You came.

911
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,830
Was it fine? You did great.

912
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,060
And then...

913
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,630
16:23. Their little sister was born.

914
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,630
Still warm from the birth.

915
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,270
The mother did well too.

916
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:19,980
With its 4180 gram quite a big baby.

917
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,980
It's a baby.

918
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,010
Natsuki's baby.

919
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,150
My baby.

920
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,880
What's this. It's big.

921
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,290
See right there. A baby. It's so big.

922
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,890
It's my baby.

923
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:36,990
So tiny.

924
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,990
She's tiny?

925
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,830
She's smaller than me.

926
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:43,030
Her legs are small.

927
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:47,840
Natsuki will splash-splash into the bath with her new baby sister.

928
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,370
It's cool inside.

929
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:53,110
She's cute no matter which way she looks.

930
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,380
With this we will be 4 people.

931
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,410
Mother.

932
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:01,180
Thank you for enduring the hardships, mother.

933
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,950
Thanks for your hard work.

934
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,750
And you too Hideki.

935
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,960
Hideki is suddenly embarrassed and can't look at his mother.

936
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,290
Go to your mother.

937
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:12,400
Oh yeah. Better give the mochi.

938
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,400
Yes, the mochi...

939
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,000
Until yesterday he has been jealous of the baby she carried.

940
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,470
Sorry, mother.

941
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,470
You did your best, Hideki, and came in a taxi.

942
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,680
Your mother also did her best.

943
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,980
Everyone, everyone did their best.

944
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,980
Natsuki also did her best.

945
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:33,920
You bought this?

946
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,920
One is fine.

947
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,250
Can I try it?

948
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,930
It's delicious.

949
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,460
How great.

950
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,460
It's really delicious.

951
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,560
Thank you kindly.

952
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,030
She can use it for her breasts.

953
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,300
The breast milk for both the baby and mother.

954
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,400
Really, thank you.

955
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:00,240
The former Japanese soccer representative Yoshito Ookubo.

956
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,310
The striker that carries a number 13 on their shirt.

957
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,620
And in the J.League

958
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,390
he has been the top scorer 3 years in a row.

959
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,840
Amazing.

960
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,410
Good morning.

961
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,980
At home he is a kind child rearing papa.

962
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:39,750
3rd son Touri

963
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,710
And...

964
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,580
Alright.

965
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:38,850
Your hat.

966
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:42,190
He waits every day to pick up his 3rd son, Touri.

967
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:45,660
Filmed in 2016

968
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,020
And when they get home...

969
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,860
The first, second and third son.

970
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,160
He plays with his three sons every day for several hours.

971
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,200
A year prior to that at the Ookubo residence.

972
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,100
A big thing happened.

973
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:02,970
Rie (wife)

974
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,900
His wife, Rie, had a miscarriage.

975
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,080
And then naturally.

976
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,680
Ookubo and his three sons shaved their heads.

977
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,110
I see.

978
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,220
"Don't worry!" He said in encouragement to his wife.

979
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,620
What a reliable husband.

980
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,120
And since this incident a year has passed.

981
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,230
And the subject of the errand wil be...

982
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:28,730
Rie

983
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,900
A 4th...

984
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,570
Yes.

985
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,370
- How great.

986
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,370
- Joyous.

987
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,770
I still haven't told people around me.

988
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,270
Even the kids don't know.

989
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,140
Yes, we haven't even told the 3 brothers.

990
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,910
Con-gra-tu-lations.

991
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:49,420
Ultrasound from week 11

992
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,010
Truth be told, from the complication a year ago

993
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:49,890
they were told that it might be complicated to become pregnant again.

994
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:58,790
Kanagawa ● Yokohama

995
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:53,520
And then on the day of the errand.

996
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,590
They announced to their sons about the coming baby.

997
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,790
Alright. Take a seat.

998
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,530
Papa go first.

999
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,230
Very exciting.

1000
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,700
I will announce it.

1001
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,840
Are you ready?

1002
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,840
Yes.

1003
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:10,070
Aito

1004
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:10,070
Ryokuji

1005
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:10,070
Touri

1006
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,670
Are you ready?

1007
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,670
YES.

1008
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:14,080
You know that mama has been feeling sick lately.

1009
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,310
And the reason for that.

1010
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,280
And the reason for that.

1011
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,120
Mama,

1012
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,750
inside of her belly

1013
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,750
inside of her belly

1014
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,490
a baby

1015
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,490
a baby

1016
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,060
has appeared.

1017
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,060
has appeared. Really.

1018
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,230
Touri will be a brother.

1019
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:41,640
- They did it.

1020
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,640
- What a celebration.

1021
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,340
Amazing.

1022
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,840
Why are you sulking.

1023
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,170
What's wrong?

1024
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,310
He wants to be a big brother

1025
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,580
but he has to become a big brother first.

1026
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,980
A complicated mental state.

1027
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:52,950
I see. That's what struck him.

1028
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:54,220
Usually he's the spoiled child who clings to his father.

1029
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,590
And with the timing of him knowing he will be a big brother

1030
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,120
they have thought up an errand for him.

1031
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,890
His two brothers have left.

1032
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,060
Get up.

1033
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,330
Stand here.

1034
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,330
Today they will have a home party.

1035
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,370
That will absolutely not be enough.

1036
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,100
It's not enough meat.

1037
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,000
Not enough.

1038
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,040
The families of his teammates will amount to 10 people coming.

1039
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,010
Pizza and salad won't be sufficient.

1040
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:25,150
They will want meat no matter what since they are pro sports players.

1041
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,650
We better have meat.

1042
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,920
Wait.

1043
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,920
We don't need it.

1044
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,320
They haven't reached talks about the errand and he's already opposing it.

1045
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,960
They will be 10 people.

1046
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,790
- He caught on.

1047
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,790
- His face shows he caught on.

1048
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,090
Kids like you Touri and...

1049
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,090
For the kids this

1050
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,330
will be enough but

1051
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,100
what will us fathers do?

1052
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:46,940
His father still hasn't said "Touri, go and purchase the meat."

1053
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,640
Mama, can't you go and purchase it?

1054
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,910
I can't right now. Not feeling too well and everyone is coming in a bit.

1055
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:56,050
Then we better not purchase any.

1056
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,780
Huh? Is that the conclusion you've come to?

1057
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,550
His father has had enough.

1058
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:05,450
He stopped.

1059
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,920
Can I take a rest?

1060
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,820
Yes, please do.

1061
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,690
Will we make it?

1062
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,790
We won't.

1063
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,260
Touri, what will you do?

1064
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,330
I can't go by myself.

1065
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:11,130
He understood it without being asked.

1066
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,190
Wait wait, Touri.

1067
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,730
What if you bring Mr. Grasshopper.

1068
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,200
Then you won't be alone.

1069
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,330
He will go on an errand with a grasshopper?

1070
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,170
How about it?

1071
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:21,270
Talk with the grashopper about it. Ask if he wants to join you.

1072
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:24,610
No way that this is all it takes.

1073
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:25,740
Okay.

1074
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,110
This grashopp...

1075
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,110
Eh? He will go?

1076
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:30,280
With the grasshopper. Both of you go.

1077
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,510
- Eh?

1078
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,510
- Nice grasshopper.

1079
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,510
Tell him to join you.

1080
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:31,510
No way.

1081
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:34,050
As expected. The grasshopper trick didn't work.

1082
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,550
Oh no.

1083
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:39,320
If papa and mama join then I can go.

1084
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,320
Mama definitely can't.

1085
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,260
Yet tears are not forming.

1086
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,330
This looks promising.

1087
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,160
What should be done, dad?

1088
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,030
So... Touri, what will you do now?

1089
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,700
You better show it to the new baby.

1090
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,570
How about showing them?

1091
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:55,200
"What a cool brother."

1092
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,470
"Touri bro, is so cool."ß

1093
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,840
Right, Touri?

1094
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:58,840
Yep.

1095
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,510
Amazing response.

1096
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,510
He stopped crying.

1097
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:02,580
He wants to become a big brother after all.

1098
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,680
Here

1099
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,250
Sanpachi train is right here.

1100
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,050
Sanpachi is a restaurant he often frequents with his teammates.

1101
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,320
They will order grilled meat to-go from there.

1102
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,590
And how will he order it?

1103
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,690
Do you have meat?

1104
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:20,260
Meat.

1105
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:20,260
Will be be able to remember?

1106
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,500
Tell them "salted tongue".

1107
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,700
Salted tongue.

1108
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,900
That's difficult.

1109
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,200
5 pieces of salted tongue.

1110
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:28,240
Basil marinated chicken neck.

1111
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,810
That is just too much.

1112
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:32,610
Basil marinated chicken neck.

1113
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,610
Yes, 5 of those.

1114
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,440
And what is papa's favorite?

1115
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,750
There's still more?

1116
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:39,320
Extremely spicy intestines.

1117
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,320
Extremely spicy intestines.

1118
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,080
Will he be able to remember that?

1119
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,690
Okay?

1120
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,120
What's up with that.

1121
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:45,090
Wear this sports shirt.

1122
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:48,060
A tiny nr. 13 shirt.

1123
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,360
This one which you got with me the other day.

1124
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,660
When he wears this shirt

1125
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,430
he will feel as strong as his papa.

1126
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,300
His father is writing a message on the good-luck charm.

1127
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:04,710
If you get lonely then look at this.

1128
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,840
You-can-do-it.

1129
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,280
Touri, you can do it.

1130
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:13,550
And his mother who pretended to fall asleep on the couch will secretly follow him.

1131
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,920
You recently went to the cake shop with your mother.

1132
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,960
Do you remember the cake your mother ate? The sweet and sour one.

1133
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:19,960
A shortcake.

1134
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,390
Can't you purchase one for mama?

1135
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,390
Okay.

1136
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:26,060
If the baby is a girl

1137
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:30,500
can you ask them if they havea pink artificial flower.

1138
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:36,210
His dad noticed they sell pink flowers at the cake shop.

1139
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,670
What a kind dad.

1140
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,140
Then mama will be so delighted.

1141
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,110
Off you go.

1142
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:54,790
Cake shop

1143
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:54,790
Home

1144
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:54,790
Yakiniku shop

1145
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,010
Take-out at the restaurant: Salted tongue, basil marinated chicken necks and spicy intestines.

1146
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:52,250
At the cake shop a short cake and a flower for his mom.

1147
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:53,460
There's so much.

1148
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,790
She will be so delightfully surprised.

1149
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,530
Alright, off you go.

1150
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,800
Remarkable.

1151
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,100
Amazing.

1152
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,600
Touri is full of energy.

1153
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,340
Alright. Today he's going on an errand by himself.

1154
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,970
His father went out.

1155
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,510
Don't lose.

1156
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:16,910
He wants to say something.

1157
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,280
What now?

1158
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,750
What?

1159
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,180
Don't lose, Touri.

1160
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,490
Eh?

1161
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,350
What?

1162
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:26,860
Touri, go!

1163
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,190
Eh?

1164
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:31,830
Touri pretends not to hear him and returns.

1165
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,530
- Oh no.

1166
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:33,530
- This is on the dad.

1167
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,600
What?

1168
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,800
Even though he was already on his way.

1169
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,500
You were doing great.

1170
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,500
You were doing great. How far did you get?

1171
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,170
How far did you get?

1172
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,170
All the way there.

1173
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,240
Amazing. You went all the way there.

1174
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,040
We're relying on you.

1175
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,750
Touri, do your best.

1176
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,020
Alright, this time...

1177
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,020
Alright, do your best.

1178
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:58,550
He left.

1179
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,120
He left again. Amazing.

1180
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,120
Don't lose.

1181
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,060
Um.

1182
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:05,330
He's doing totally fine.

1183
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,960
Wouldn't it be better if he got back quick?

1184
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,800
Got a point there.

1185
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,670
He's still peeking out.

1186
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,740
See? Now he's heading back.

1187
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:22,440
Papa I'm getting tired.

1188
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:22,440
What?

1189
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,580
Don't engage him in a conversation.

1190
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,250
What?

1191
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,990
See? He returned.

1192
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,520
Papa.

1193
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,620
What?

1194
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,160
I'm getting tired.

1195
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:37,290
He's piling on the excuses.

1196
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:43,800
And what if my butt gets wet?

1197
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,800
It won't get wet.

1198
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:45,800
See?

1199
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,340
If you hold the umbrella then it won't.

1200
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:52,740
My butt won't get wet.

1201
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,740
Yeah, you have a raincoat on.

1202
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,880
His butt won't get wet.

1203
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,380
Touri, we are relying on you.

1204
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,310
Papa can't go so please do it.

1205
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,310
Yep.

1206
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,420
Do your best, Touri.

1207
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,220
Touri, don't lose.

1208
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,220
Yeah.

1209
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,020
Thank you.

1210
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,020
Dad, hurry back.

1211
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:10,930
Touri, see you. Do your best.

1212
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,060
Just go. Go.

1213
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,170
- And papa, you go too.

1214
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:19,170
- Hurry and go, papa.

1215
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:21,340
Papa is in the way.

1216
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:23,140
He finally went back into the house.

1217
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,410
Alright. It will be fine from now on.

1218
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,350
What's wrong.

1219
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:38,120
I forgot something.

1220
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,020
I don't know the name of the meats.

1221
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:45,260
That's true. Remember the names was a bit too difficult.

1222
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,560
Papa.

1223
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,800
Huh, what's wrong?

1224
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,740
I haven't bought anything yet but...

1225
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,640
I don't know.

1226
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:55,640
Let's go outside.

1227
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,140
But that's also an excuse.

1228
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,740
I want to go with papa.

1229
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:03,810
Papa and...

1230
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,810
I can't leave now. Everyone will soon...

1231
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,480
I told them that Touri will go and buy the meat.

1232
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,880
You are fine.

1233
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,680
Say it.

1234
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,490
Are you too scared to say it?

1235
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,490
Unless papa... can't...

1236
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:12,590
Look. What does it say?

1237
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:16,490
He's just lacking a bit of courage.

1238
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,490
I want to go with papa.

1239
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,490
What does it say?

1240
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:22,830
Can...

1241
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:23,930
Do it.

1242
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:25,630
His tears stopped.

1243
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,500
Touri, you can do it. Do your best.

1244
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:31,240
Ah, he's sucking on his finger.

1245
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,210
But his legs...

1246
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:37,550
are moving forward. Take a look.

1247
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:37,880
Alright. Alright.

1248
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:41,320
Touri, do your best.

1249
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:47,220
I want my mama.

1250
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:45,650
Touri, do your best.

1251
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:48,090
He wants his mom.

1252
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,130
He's not up for it today.

1253
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:56,170
I don't know.

1254
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,170
I have to go defeat the monster.

1255
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:57,270
Monster?

1256
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:00,070
I need to beat it up so you can come back.

1257
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:02,400
It's still there.

1258
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,470
I will use the umbrella.

1259
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:04,970
Beat it with an umbrella?

1260
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:07,510
I'm relying on you.

1261
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,510
I want to see it.

1262
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,480
He wants to see the monster?

1263
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,150
What are they even doing?

1264
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,750
The monsters. It's calling me.

1265
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,580
No no no. It's fine.

1266
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,820
So he can speak with the monster over the phone?

1267
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:17,890
Touri, do your best.

1268
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,220
Let's defeat it.

1269
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,520
- What's up with the pretend.

1270
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,990
- He's pretending so hard.

1271
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,230
Yep.

1272
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:26,560
Dad, please defeat the monster.

1273
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,360
- What was that.

1274
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:27,360
- A phone call from the monster.

1275
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,870
Running at full speed.

1276
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:36,670
Alright. He's off.

1277
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,080
Dad, isn't there something you must do?

1278
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,610
You better go fight the monster.

1279
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:49,590
If he can get past the first intersection, he's all set, dad explained.

1280
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:57,930
We beg of you, Touri. Please go for real this time.

1281
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,560
It's fine.

1282
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,630
He crossed.

1283
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:04,600
He's so great. He will be fine.

1284
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,840
He finally left.

1285
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:12,410
Touri, does he resemble his dad?

1286
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:16,680
Who does Touri ressemble?

1287
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:13,980
Or his mom?

1288
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,640
That's me.

1289
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,680
Which part?

1290
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:22,420
He can do it but he doesn't have the courage.

1291
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:25,750
Like with me he will worry: Will I be fine?

1292
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:32,260
Ah, it's getting dark outside.

1293
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,760
It really is.

1294
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,730
In no time the sun has set and it's approaching twilight.

1295
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:39,300
Surely they are worried if Touri is doing fine?

1296
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,140
But he seems to remember the directions.

1297
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,270
And crossing the street properly.

1298
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:46,570
He really is.

1299
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:51,050
I don't know the name of the meats.

1300
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:56,990
He doesn't know, yeah. His dad's order is too complex.

1301
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:56,020
I don't know.

1302
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:01,360
Salted tongue, basil marinated chicken neck and extremely spicy intestines.

1303
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,730
Though he doesn't remember he enters the store.

1304
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,730
What will he do?

1305
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,670
At the entrance there is a wall of autographs from patrons.

1306
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:14,070
His father is also a regular customer.

1307
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:18,470
What type of meat do you have?

1308
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,470
He could also do it like that.

1309
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:20,780
Did you come to buy meat?

1310
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,850
He intends to make the waiter cite all the types of meat.

1311
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:26,550
If he hears it he will remember.

1312
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,020
Will he notice the three options in between?

1313
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:33,160
The assistant manager who knows his dad well came out.

1314
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,420
I will start with the ones that your papa likes.

1315
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:39,030
If it's one of those then say "yeah", okay?

1316
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:41,030
It's starting now.

1317
00:53:39,360 --> 00:54:25,410
Basil marinated
chicken neck

1318
00:53:39,360 --> 00:54:25,410
Extremely spicy
instestines

1319
00:53:39,360 --> 00:54:25,410
Salted tongue

1320
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,870
Did he mention "Basil marinated chicken neck?"

1321
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:45,070
He did.

1322
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:46,870
He got the first one right.

1323
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,100
Alright. Alright.

1324
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:50,510
And then what else...

1325
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,310
What about marinated ribs?

1326
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:55,140
It's a pass.

1327
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,140
He didn't get it.

1328
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,750
And your father likes salted tongue. Did he bring that up?

1329
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,220
He did.

1330
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,390
A splendid hit.

1331
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,820
There's still more?

1332
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,820
The last one is difficult.

1333
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:09,220
Is it sweet? Or spicy? Do you know?

1334
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,690
It's spicy.

1335
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:11,790
Great piece of info.

1336
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,160
I see.

1337
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:19,000
If it's something your dad likes then... intestines?

1338
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:20,400
He did say that.

1339
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,300
He said that.

1340
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:22,300
How splendid.

1341
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,610
Is that all?

1342
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:25,410
He got them all right.

1343
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:28,380
For how many people?

1344
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:32,210
So you want 5 of each?

1345
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,210
Yep.

1346
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,680
He was able to get it out of him.

1347
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:34,120
He remembered the amount.

1348
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:39,420
He's getting 5 of each so they are preparing food for 15 people.

1349
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:40,790
That's amazing.

1350
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,160
Touri, do you want to have a drink?

1351
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,890
You really did well.

1352
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,530
He really did.

1353
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:47,530
He said that there's a monster.

1354
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:52,200
There's a monster? At home?

1355
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:52,200
- There's a monster.

1356
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:53,370
- The scare worked.

1357
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:56,170
Papa will beat up the monster.

1358
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:56,170
He will beat up the monster? Papa?

1359
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,470
He was able to grasp the situation.

1360
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,110
I see.

1361
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:04,950
Since papa is fighting him then Touri also needs to do his best.

1362
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:05,880
He's so great a peptalk.

1363
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,450
It's done cooking now.

1364
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,750
Be careful. See you again.

1365
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:12,750
See you again.

1366
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,960
How great. He's a nice guy.

1367
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:14,460
Bye bye.

1368
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,590
Do your best.

1369
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:17,930
I will.

1370
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,230
It started raining.

1371
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,810
The rain became more intense. Hurry up and get home.

1372
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,380
I must buy cake.

1373
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,150
Oh that's right. That's right.

1374
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:39,150
His father asked him to do it as a secret.

1375
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:42,720
For his mother and the baby she's carrying.

1376
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,190
How nice.

1377
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:45,320
He better go.

1378
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:48,820
I will leave it here.

1379
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:51,230
His raincoat is drenched from the rain.

1380
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:55,160
Thinking it would be bad to drip in the shop. What a good boy.

1381
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:55,030
He's so thoughtful.

1382
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:58,100
He's only bringing in the wallet.

1383
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,510
Welcome.

1384
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,510
What?

1385
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,880
Huh? What's wrong?

1386
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,750
He forgot what type of cake.

1387
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,210
What was it again?

1388
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:16,250
Touri needs to psyche himself up for the moment.

1389
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,790
Good evening.

1390
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,790
Without being prepared...

1391
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:21,490
the shop door opened up to him.

1392
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,290
Did you come to buy a cake?

1393
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:25,290
Yep.

1394
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,800
What did you come to buy?

1395
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,800
He's in trouble.

1396
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,470
Short cake.

1397
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,470
He suddenly remembered.

1398
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:33,470
The sweet and sour strawberry cake.

1399
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:36,040
Who will eat it?

1400
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:36,040
Mama.

1401
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:41,510
Because she said that she's nauseous...

1402
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:44,050
so she wants something sweet.

1403
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,580
Can she eat cake despite not feeling well?

1404
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,320
But she's not actually sick.

1405
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,920
Yep.

1406
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,920
So she's fine.

1407
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:54,990
The lady totally thinks that she's sick.

1408
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:56,800
TN (written): Mama, hurry up and be well. From Touri.

1409
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:58,760
He noticed something.

1410
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,200
That thing.

1411
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,570
The flowers his dad mentioned.

1412
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,640
I will buy this.

1413
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,270
This?

1414
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,110
It's called preserved flowers.

1415
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,910
Flowers that don't wilt.

1416
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:17,580
Since she's carrying a baby.

1417
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,080
So you will be a brother.

1418
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,080
That's right.

1419
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,580
Mom will appreciate it.

1420
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:24,690
I will put it together.

1421
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,560
"I will be a big brother."

1422
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,160
He is able to properly say goodbye.

1423
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,940
While it's all dark

1424
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:48,680
he can still see his father and mother.

1425
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:51,880
Can you see him?

1426
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,050
Touri.

1427
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,790
Touri isn't crying.

1428
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,160
Touri.

1429
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:04,930
Touri.

1430
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:06,290
You are so cool.

1431
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,530
Are you okay? Is it not heavy?

1432
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:10,500
Mama.

1433
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,070
We've been waiting.

1434
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:13,700
We've been waiting.

1435
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,870
I bought the cake.

1436
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:19,640
How amazing.

1437
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:24,750
I bought it.

1438
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:28,020
The goal is his baby that his mother is carrying.

1439
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,420
You've become a big brother.

1440
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:39,860
You bought it all?

1441
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:42,060
Thank you.

1442
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,060
There's some in this one too?

1443
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,600
Mama, flowers.

1444
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,340
I also bought flowers.

1445
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,340
Where?

1446
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,670
At the cake shop.

1447
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:53,940
How admirable.

1448
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:57,680
When the baby is born

1449
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,920
both you and the baby can use it.

1450
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:04,290
No one taught him to say that.

1451
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,090
Please use it for decoration.

1452
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:08,160
Hug me tight.

1453
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,160
Thank you.

1454
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:16,300
I'm home.

1455
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:16,300
I'm home.

1456
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,130
His two big brothers have come home.

1457
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:22,200
He was succesful in his errand.

1458
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:23,310
Look. He bought all this.

1459
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,310
Amazing.

1460
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:27,140
He also bought flowers for his mom despite not being told to.

1461
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,240
Flowers.

1462
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,140
Eh?

1463
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,710
Now they will be 3 big brothers.

1464
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:31,250
Perfect.

1465
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,850
Should we call everyone?

1466
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:39,520
Filmed in 2016.

1467
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:36,590

Mischievous rascal but cute.

1505
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,970
That's right.

1506
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:07,780
A boy you want to spoil.

1507
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:11,950
So he's exactly like Touri was back then.

1508
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:13,750
Do you like your big brother?

1509
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:13,750

And about dad?

1524
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:42,310
Might be heartbroken the day they will finally spread their wings.

Since he turned 3 years he has been asked to serve the customers.

1533
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:07,670
He did it. His first time doing it.

1534
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:08,840
I will go get it.

1535
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:12,340
Will you eat sweets today?

1536
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:12,340
He can even take their orders.

1537
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:15,510
Corn and... Corn and...

1538
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,850
we have soup pulp donuts.

1539
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:18,850
Soy pulp (okara) donuts?

1540
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:20,850
They understood from the "soup pulp".

1541
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:24,320
Soy pulp (okara) is healthy and a popular menu item.

1542
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:28,860
Filmed in 2013.

1543
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:29,560
Listen, listen. About the soy pulp...

1544
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,130
we've run out but...

1545
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:33,230
we will make more okara donuts.

1546
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,500
Taiyou, go and shop.

1547
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:36,430
Did he get it?

1548
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,270
At the tofu shop say: "Okara, please."

1549
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,930
By car.

1550
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:41,770
Not by car. By foot.

1551
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,170
He wants to go by car.

1552
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:44,170
Not by car.

1553
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:43,640
Can you do it?

1554
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:43,640
Yep.

1555
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,710
When you go out...

1556
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,370
An insect!

1557
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:47,510
Is he listening properly?

1558
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:47,510
When you finish shopping...

1559
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:48,310
Is he listening?

1560
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,210
At the agricultural cooperative...

1561
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:52,950
I want to make salad today so get some Chinese cabbage.

1562
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:55,520
Sure.

1563
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:55,520
You sure? Okay?

1564
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:58,620
After you buy it you can also buy your favorite candy.

1565
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,120
Yep-did-it.

1566
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,890
Smooch.

1567
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:04,860
Alright. Off you go.

1568
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:06,630
See you.

1569
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:09,830
I love you.

1570
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,830
I love you.

1571
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:12,500
He's going on his errand on a high note.

1572
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:24,080
Agricultural
cooperative

1573
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:24,080
Home

1574
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:24,080
Toufu shop

1575
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:16,100
At the tofu shop used by everyone at Ooshikamura

1576
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,100
the okara is said to be different.

1577
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,870
Perfect for donuts.

1578
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:26,360
At the agricultural cooperative on the way back he is asked to get Chinese cabbage.

1579
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:25,550
Will he be fine?

1580
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,350
I'm tired.

1581
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:31,590
He just left the house.

1582
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,190
Just a bit more.

1583
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:35,190
There's still a lot to go.

1584
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:37,960
Just a bit more. Oh yeah!

1585
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,190
What's up?

1586
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,190
Is he fine?

1587
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:42,500
Meimei's flowers were here.

1588
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,700
It's not a goat.

1589
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,800
I will give it to Meimei.

1590
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,870
His mothers' name is Mei.

1591
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:51,240
Will his mother even be delighted by these leaves?

1592
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:55,140
Arriving at the highly regarded Minoya tofu shop.

1593
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:00,320
He's not getting tofu, though.

1594
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,620
He's supposed to say "okara, please".

1595
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,690
Here.

1596
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:08,290
We are making soup pulp donuts so...

1597
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:10,290
please.

1598
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:11,130
Yes?

1599
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,530
Welcome.

1600
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:14,460
What's wrong?

1601
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:18,130
Soup pulp.. donuts, we are making it

1602
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:21,440
I was told to get soup pulp.

1603
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:26,210
What do you... donuts?

1604
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:26,210
Yep.

1605
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:27,310
Ah.

1606
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:28,040
I see.

1607
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:31,010
Your mom is making her famous soy pulp (okara) donuts.

1608
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:33,480
She understood him.

1609
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,750
They are right here.

1610
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:35,750
It's 50 yen per bag.

1611
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:38,050
This?

1612
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,050
Yes, this one.

1613
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:40,920
Will this do? Just one?

1614
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:40,920
Um, it's fine.

1615
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,660
He has seen the donuts before but never the ingredients.

1616
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,430
"Is this really soup pulp?" He wonders.

1617
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:48,630
Is all fine?

1618
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:48,630
I can go.

1619
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:52,070
He didn't even put it in the basket  that he brought all the way here.

1620
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:52,070
Thank you.

1621
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:54,240
Next is the Chinese cabbage.

1622
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:54,970
Put it in the basket.

1623
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:57,940
Oh no, he's heading straight home.

1624
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:00,780
He must be worried if he got the right thing.

1625
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:03,140
They said that this is soup pulp.

1626
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:04,010
Soup pulp?

1627
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:05,050
An old lady from the neighborhood.

1628
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:05,050
Soy pulp.

1629
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:05,980
Otera (temple)?

1630
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,880
Okara (soup pulp).

1631
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,780
Otara.

1632
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:10,590
Welcome back.

1633
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:12,420
They said that this is it.

1634
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:13,720
They told you this is it?

1635
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,320
They said "otara".

1636
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:17,320
O-ka-ra.

1637
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,030
Thank you. You did well.

1638
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:20,560
What? It was really this thing?

1639
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,330
I did it.

1640
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:24,330
Ah, you forgot one thing. What was it?

1641
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:25,130
The Chinese cabbage.

1642
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,530
This.

1643
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:29,540
Ah, for Meimei? Thank you.

1644
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,540
Huh? She was pleased.

1645
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,070
And then...

1646
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:34,140
At the agricultural cooperative what was it that you needed?

1647
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:37,680
What type of vegetable?

1648
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:40,280
Vegdable.

1649
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:40,280
Ha, which one?

1650
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,080
Vegdable

1651
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,380
Want me to teach you? Chinese cabbage.

1652
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,750
Chinese cabbage.

1653
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:45,750
Chinese cabbage.

1654
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,760
Chinese cabbage.

1655
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,760
Chinese cabbage.

1656
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,590
Chinese cabbage, huh?

1657
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:50,090
Right?

1658
01:05:50,090 --> 01:05:52,160
I got it.

1659
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:52,160
Off you go.

1660
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:53,800
- Did he really?
- Really?

1661
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,330
He's leaving once again on a high note.

1662
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,400
It's a worry.

1663
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:56,700
With the okara...

1664
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:57,930
With the okara...

1665
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:01,170
Go ahead and make donuts.

1666
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:02,600
Let's make them together later.

1667
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,540
Yes, I did it!

1668
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:09,980
Today Taiyou is shopping.

1669
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:12,350
He came out on the big street.

1670
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:14,180
Look at his game face.

1671
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:17,120
He needs to cross at this crossing.

1672
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:17,850
What a serious face.

1673
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,620
He trained so many times with his mother.

1674
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:22,560
However he passed it.

1675
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:23,890
- Huh? What?
- The other way.

1676
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,790
The agricultural cooperative is on the other side.

1677
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:28,330
I should go over there.

1678
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:30,370
You want to cross?

1679
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,370
It's the cameraman.

1680
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:32,700
Then you should cross at this crossing.

1681
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:35,000
See? Over there where people cross.

1682
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:41,980
Ah, it's people!

1683
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:39,470
It's people!

1684
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:42,280
He realized midway.

1685
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,210
Even a 3 year old person can cross there.

1686
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:47,150
I will cross.

1687
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:53,490
He has arrived at the cooperative agricultural supermarket.

1688
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,730
Welcome.

1689
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:57,730
Excuse me...

1690
01:06:58,690 --> 01:06:59,760
Chinese cabbage, right?

1691
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,960
You came back.

1692
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,960
You see...

1693
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:09,940
Meimei told me to buy vegetables.

1694
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:09,940
Is that right?

1695
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:11,310
Which vegetable?

1696
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:13,270
Let's go to the vegetables and have a look.

1697
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:15,380
Going to the vegetable corner.

1698
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:17,380
Which one, I wonder.

1699
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,680
This one. Cabbage?

1700
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,650
It's not cabbage.

1701
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,720
It's different.

1702
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:24,090
She said "vegetable".

1703
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,090
What a pickle.

1704
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:27,420
I wonder exactly what your mother said.

1705
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:27,420
Vegetable.

1706
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:29,090
What a pickle.

1707
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:29,890
Vegetable.

1708
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,630
What is this?

1709
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:32,990
This is mizuna.

1710
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:34,360
It's not mizuna.

1711
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,530
Green onion.

1712
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:36,530
It's not green onion.

1713
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:38,800
Is this pumpkin?

1714
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:38,800
Pumpkin.

1715
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,330
Tomato.

1716
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,330
Yes, tomato.

1717
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:42,470
It's not pumpkin nor tomatoes.

1718
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,500
What was it?
It's right there.

1719
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,270
This is daikon.

1720
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:45,270
So close!

1721
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:46,240
Below it. Below it.

1722
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:46,970
This is Chinese cabbage.

1723
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:46,970
That's it!

1724
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:48,440
And this one is daikon.

1725
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,940
And that's also daikon.

1726
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,610
This is mandarin.

1727
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,610
He skipped it.

1728
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,980
You know so much. It's mandarin.

1729
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,890
You don't have vegetables?

1730
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:02,190
We do. Which one are you here for?

1731
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,190
They went to the vegetables because of him.

1732
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:04,660
Is it Chinese cabbage?

1733
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,440
Though it's right in front of his eyes.

1734
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,730
Vegetables.

1735
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:08,200
Then...

1736
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:12,730
Go back to your mother and ask: "Which vegetable was it again?"

1737
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:15,570
Since you don't know go back and ask.

1738
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,710
I...

1739
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:21,940
What vegetable did she say?

1740
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:26,710
What type of vegetable.

1741
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,320
He couldn't buy vegetables.

1742
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:32,220
Even though his mother was looking forward to it.

1743
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:34,690
Welcome back. Did you buy it?

1744
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:36,690
What type of vegetable was it?

1745
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:39,330
You forgot? Did you say it right?

1746
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:41,760
Vegetable.

1747
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,760
Chinese cabbage.

1748
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,200
Chinese cabbage.

1749
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,200
Chinese cabbage.

1750
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,370
His mother got an idea.

1751
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:50,140
Taiyou, how old are you?

1752
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:51,870
3 years old [san sai].

1753
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:51,870
That's right 3 years.

1754
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:54,580
And you should get? Chinese cabbage [hakusai].

1755
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:55,740
Say it.

1756
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:57,580
100 years old [hyakusai].

1757
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:57,580
Say it once more.

1758
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,010
Chinese cabbage.

1759
01:08:58,250 --> 01:08:59,010
Once more.

1760
01:08:59,010 --> 01:08:59,680
Chinese cabbage.

1761
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:00,580
Once more.

1762
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:04,550
Whether it's 100 years [hyakusai] or Chinese cabbage [hakusai] I'm sure they will understand.

1763
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:05,990
100 years.

1764
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:05,990
Chinese cabbage.

1765
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:07,160
Taiyou, how old are you?

1766
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,290
I'm 3 years old.

1767
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:10,930
What type of vegetable will you buy?

1768
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:14,360
Chinese cabbage.

1769
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:14,360
That's right. Amazing.

1770
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,100
- What an amazing mother.

1771
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,130
- Amazing mother.

1772
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:18,100
Basket. Basket. And the wallet too.

1773
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:21,270
What are you going to buy?

1774
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:23,400
Leafy vegetables [hayasai].

1775
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:25,410
He turned it into leafy vegetables.

1776
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:24,670
Chinese cabbage.

1777
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:26,270
Chinese cabbage.

1778
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:26,270
Repeat it on the way.

1779
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:27,880
Chinese cabbage, Chinese cabbage, Chinese cabbage...

1780
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:30,410
Chinese cabbage. Chinese cabbage.

1781
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:31,880
That's right. While he still got it.

1782
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,850
- While he still remembers.

1783
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:34,850
- Keep saying it.

1784
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:36,480
Alright, off you go.

1785
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,390
I love you.

1786
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,390
I love you.

1787
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:42,190
Don't mix it in.

1788
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,990
It's Chinese cabbage.

1789
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:45,160
Chinese cabbage. Chinese cabbage.

1790
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,900
Chinese cabbage. Chinese cabbage.

1791
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:47,900
Chinese cabbage.

1792
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:48,830
Go and say "Chinese cabbage".

1793
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,300
Alright. Off you go.

1794
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:57,210
Chinese cabbage. Chinese cabbage.

1795
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:59,140
That's so good.

1796
01:09:57,210 --> 01:09:59,370
Almost Chinese cabbage. [As in: almost 100 years old]

1797
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:00,840
That's the spirit.

1798
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,310
Chinese cabbage. Chinese cabbage.

1799
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:05,780
Chinese cabbage.

1800
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:08,950
This time it will surely be fine.

1801
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:11,820
Taiyou is 3 years old.

1802
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:16,760
3 years? What a good boy.

1803
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:19,760
And then... what age?

1804
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:22,360
Did you go and ask?

1805
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,600
She said Chinese cabbage.

1806
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:26,300
He did it.

1807
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:30,540
This is Chinese cabbage.

1808
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:32,210
Is it really Chinese cabbage?

1809
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,210
Here you go.

1810
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:33,640
Since this is Chinese cabbage.

1811
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,780
So this is what Chinese cabbage looks like.

1812
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,780
How great that you went and asked.

1813
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,050
You are a good boy.

1814
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:39,710
Can you carry it?

1815
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:42,150
This time he puts it in the basket.

1816
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,390
Chinese cabbage. Chinese cabbage.

1817
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:50,090
Chinese cabbage is @#!?&...

1818
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:51,890
Yahoo.

1819
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,660
Thank you for your hard work.

1820
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,100
Chinese cabbage. Chinese cabbage.

1821
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:03,840
No matter his age in the future he will never forget: Chinese cabbage

1822
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:05,840
Chinese cabbage.

1823
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,510
Ah! The lady who helped him cross the street.

1824
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,380
He exchanged glances with the cameraman.

1825
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,120
How old are you now?

1826
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:17,850
Come on. Tell the truth.

1827
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:22,020
I can't tell you.

1828
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,460
Can't tell him.

1829
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:26,660
Taiyou is 3 years old.

1830
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:26,660
You are 3 years old?

1831
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:28,600
You are not 100 years old?

1832
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:30,030
Isn't your mother waiting?

1833
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:32,030
It will get dark. Hurry up.

1834
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:35,770
So cute.

1835
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:39,440
He's such a cute kid. Just the best.

1836
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,240
I brought it.

1837
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:44,780
You did it? All by yourself?

1838
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:47,480
You are amazing, Taiyou.

1839
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,580
You bought this?

1840
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:51,820
What is it called?

1841
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:51,820
Chinese cabbage.

1842
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:54,420
So cute.

1843
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,620
You are amazing. Give me a smooch.

1844
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,160
Your favorite Chinese cabbage salad.

1845
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:05,370
Shredding the cabbage and sprinkling some Katsuobushi​ on top.

1846
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:08,070
Then add sesame oil and soy sauce and it's done.

1847
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:10,200
Memei's specialty: Chinese cabbage salad.

1848
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,240
Bon apetit.

1849
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,610
Thank you, Meimei.

1850
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:17,080
Does it suit the taste of a 3 year old?

1851
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,450
Taiyou is it tasty?

1852
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:19,510
Tasty.

1853
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:23,620
Meimei, you should eat too.

1854
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:25,620
I might eat later.

1855
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:29,590
As long as you eat this you might get to live to 100 years.

1856
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:31,860
It might be gone by then.

1857
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,230
As the cold gains pace by the day

1858
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,140
the autumn colors have appeared

1859
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:46,770
It's the height of the autumn colors.

1860
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:49,180
In this town a girl was born.

1861
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:55,880
Kureha
[Autumn colors]

1862
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:55,150
Since she is autumn colored and makes everyone happy they called her Kureha [autumn colors].

1863
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:59,720
She always sticks to her mother and is such a cuddled baby girl.

1864
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:04,060
But when Kureha turned 2
her mother was hospitalized.

1865
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:06,260
It was cervical cancer​.

1866
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:09,660
Her mother rarely came back home.

1867
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:12,470
And in no time she turned into a well-behaved child.

1868
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:15,000
"I don't want to be a burden on mother"....

1869
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,410
she suddenly said when she turned 4.

1870
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:21,740
"Mama, if you want me over, just tell me. I'll be right there."

1871
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:25,450
Kureha has said that she can ride the bus and go by herself.

1872
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:26,950
"We will make Kureha do it"

1873
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:30,420
her mother said while thinking up an errand.

1874
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,390
But it won't be an easy one.

1875
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:35,490
This is the father.

1876
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:40,730
Filmed in 2013.

1877
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:38,330
He has passed 58 years by a little bit.

1878
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:41,260
I have a leftover.

1879
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:44,470
They are all over each other.

1880
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:46,270
And normally

1881
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,740
because of doting on her he ends up buying her anything she desires.

1882
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:54,940
Working hard as a truck driver.

1883
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:58,850
He has to since had his first daughter late in life.

1884
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:02,520
Even the big brother has started to worry about her.

1885
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:06,250
She knows it will be tough but she wants her to do her best.

1886
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:08,160
That's why she's writing her a letter.

1887
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:13,530
As long as papa believes that Kureha will be fine

1888
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:20,730
and he can convey it then Kureha will also say: "Alright".

1889
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:24,210
The father decided to make her bring her onigiri.

1890
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:28,140
Kureha is preparing various things on her own.

1891
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:30,410
This...

1892
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:32,080
You should give it to the bus driver.

1893
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,410
She will go by bus.s

1894
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:36,320
This won't be enough, though.

1895
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,320
It is enough.

1896
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:38,820
They are using the town-loop bus.

1897
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:40,650
It comes once an hour.

1898
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:43,620
There's 26 minutes until the next bus.

1899
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,230
However...

1900
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:46,760
I want to go with papa.

1901
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:49,930
Despite having resolved that she will go by herself.

1902
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:52,730
Then put it in here.

1903
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,730
Don't wanna.

1904
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,400
Mama is waiting.

1905
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,400
Wonder what's wrong?

1906
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:02,940
Mama said if Kureha comes then I will feel better.

1907
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:06,280
But she wants to go with papa after all.

1908
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,820
Kureha, please go.

1909
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:11,690
But I can't go by myself.

1910
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:15,290
Yes you can. If it's you, Kureha, then you can do it.

1911
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:16,990
It's fine.

1912
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:19,660
Kureha who knows how to get her way.

1913
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:22,760
This is where he usually caves in and buys her a toy.

1914
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,800
It's fine. Since it's you, Kureha, then you can do it.

1915
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:28,570
Come here. I will hug you.

1916
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,770
A hug?

1917
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:33,840
Yes. Come here.

1918
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:43,320
It will be fine.

1919
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:47,320
But if papa doesn't come with then I will be lonely.

1920
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,320
It's fine.

1921
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:53,060
The more he hugs Kureha, the weaker she becomes.

1922
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:55,100
... Since it's dad, right?

1923
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,000
Don't you want to go to your mom?

1924
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,700
I do.

1925
01:15:58,170 --> 01:15:59,700
You do, don't you?

1926
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:01,340
Then you better do your best.

1927
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:03,070
Deep down she wants to go.

1928
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:04,770
But her tears won't stop.

1929
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:07,580
The bus will come by in a bit.

1930
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:10,640
Maybe she changes her mind if they go outside?

1931
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,510
Yes, do your best.

1932
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:14,050
It's fine. It's fine.

1933
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:14,980
But...

1934
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:19,190
I can't stop crying.

1935
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:19,190
You can't stop crying?

1936
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:22,490
Alright.

1937
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:24,260
Only a baby can't cease crying.

1938
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,690
It's fine. Okay?

1939
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:29,800
Kureha is no longer a baby.

1940
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:35,300
In the end she didn't get on this bus.

1941
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,640
The next bus is in one hour.

1942
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,770
Drink a bit of water.

1943
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:42,180
They go back to the house and start over.

1944
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:42,980
But...

1945
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:45,380
He's constantly carrying her around.

1946
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:46,910
Ah, that's true.

1947
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:48,980
He's even making her drink water. Though she's already 4 years old.

1948
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:51,020
The phone is ringing.

1949
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,020
The caller is the mom.

1950
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:54,560
Hello?

1951
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,390
You aren't constantly carrying her around, right?

1952
01:16:57,390 --> 01:16:59,890
It's as if she can see inside the house.

1953
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:02,260
Papa, you better pull yourself together.

1954
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:03,860
Or Kureha won't leave.

1955
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:06,870
The mother wants the father to do it.

1956
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:08,940
Not with kindness

1957
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:11,410
but for him to know that love needs strictness too.

1958
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,940
Toughen your heart. Please.

1959
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:19,110
She's scolding him, the dad!

1960
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:20,910
Do you want me to read mama's letter?

1961
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:23,650
The letter from before the errand.

1962
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:33,590
I'm really appreciative of being able to watch the growth and development of Kureha.

1963
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:36,630
Right? So you will go to your mom's by yourself. Right?

1964
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:47,340
It's tough for Kureha and it's tough for papa who must send Kureha out of the house on her own.

1965
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:57,520
It's your first time riding a bus on your own however please pull yourself together.

1966
01:17:57,650 --> 01:18:00,290
Mama is saying that she's waiting.

1967
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:04,590
If Kureha doesn't go then she will be lonely.

1968
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:07,930
I will go to the hospital.

1969
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:09,700
Will you ride the bus this time?

1970
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,300
Yes?

1971
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,540
Kureha, you can do it.

1972
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:16,800
Right?

1973
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:17,770
Right?

1974
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,280
He decided to take her to the bus stop.

1975
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:25,950
He couldn't stop her tears.

1976
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:27,920
But he's not carrying her.

1977
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,920
He must toughen his resolve.

1978
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:33,390
You shouldn't run.

1979
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:35,620
Okay?

1980
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:39,530
Kureha, you can do it. That's what mom said.

1981
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,200
It will be fine. Alright.

1982
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:44,570
Just carry me a little bit.

1983
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:47,900
He wants to hold her tight but he fights the feeling.

1984
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:49,400
Do you best, dad.

1985
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:49,070
Lift your spirits.

1986
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:50,970
High five. High five.

1987
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:56,040
Do your best. Do your best. Do your best.

1988
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,610
Alright. Bye bye.

1989
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:00,610
Do your best.

1990
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,490
He has decided not to turn his face back.

1991
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:14,360
He endures the desire to look back.

1992
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,730
Ah, she stopped crying.

1993
01:19:18,730 --> 01:19:20,730
For real.

1994
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:26,810
Home

1995
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:26,810
Hospital

1996
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:22,400
Ride the bus for 10 minutes

1997
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,100
and the hospital will be right there.

1998
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,810
She's on an errand to cheer up her mom.

1999
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:29,610
The bus arrived.

2000
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,010
Her expression changed.

2001
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:34,250
For real.

2002
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:41,120
Alright, confirm the destination.

2003
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:43,990
Do you go to Chuuou Hospital?

2004
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:46,190
Yes, we do.

2005
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:47,730
Ooh, she was able to say it.

2006
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:50,000
Remarkable.

2007
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:53,270
To avoid missing her stop she rides behind the driver.

2008
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,270
We are taking off. Please be careful.

2009
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,900
The dad was right there!

2010
01:19:57,570 --> 01:19:59,610
He's waving.

2011
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:00,270
Even though Kureha can't see.

2012
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:04,080
For a moment the dad watches her go.

2013
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:11,590
10 minutes on the bus and it will stop right in front of the hospital.

2014
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:18,260
The errand is onigiri that the father made and the cheer of Kureha's presence.

2015
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:19,290
Filmed in 2013

2016
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:21,700
The hospital is within sight.

2017
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:25,870
Next is Ina Chuuou Hospital.

2018
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:28,870
Alright. Soon she will get to see her mom.

2019
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:31,370
Remarkable.

2020
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,510
She can get hugs from her mother.

2021
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:34,810
She's been holding it in the entire time.

2022
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:40,750
Thank you very much.

2023
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:43,450
She has arrived at the hospital.

2024
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:48,590
It's her first time coming here by herself.

2025
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:50,860
The hospital where her mother is.

2026
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:53,690
Mom, she's coming.

2027
01:20:53,690 --> 01:20:55,690
Kureha all by herself.

2028
01:20:57,530 --> 01:20:59,700
Hello.

2029
01:20:58,870 --> 01:20:59,700
Hello.

2030
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:03,400
Though she doesn't know the nurses.

2031
01:21:03,970 --> 01:21:06,810
Hello.

2032
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,810
Hello.

2033
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:10,580
If she turns here then it will be her mothers' hospital room.

2034
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:16,220
Please knock gently.

2035
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:17,650
She flew in the door.

2036
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:21,560
What?

2037
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,560
Kureha.

2038
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,190
Did you come by yourself?

2039
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:28,100
Amazing.

2040
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:30,560
And you will go home by yourself.

2041
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,570
How great.

2042
01:21:31,570 --> 01:21:33,730
She believed in her.

2043
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:33,730
You did your best.

2044
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,700
Want to take off your raincoat?

2045
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:38,740
Take off the raincoat

2046
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:40,910
and get an embrace from your mother.

2047
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:45,710
Kureha noticed that the nurse is acting different from usual.

2048
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:47,050
They are really calm.

2049
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,120
It's been a while with her mother

2050
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:52,290
But rather than embracing longingly

2051
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:55,160
their conversation is as if they are back home.

2052
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,560
I did it like you said.

2053
01:21:57,690 --> 01:22:00,030
You brought this? Halloween.

2054
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:02,960
I brought it since mom requested it.

2055
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,130
It's Halloween soon.

2056
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:09,200
The mother has borrowed a picture book at the book corner in the hospital.

2057
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:12,210
But... he ate it.

2058
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:17,910
The apple...

2059
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:17,910
There's so much the mother wants to do.

2060
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:19,310
Reading a picture book out loud.

2061
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:21,280
Talk about kindergarten.

2062
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:22,620
And eat onigiri.

2063
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:25,490
These are well made.

2064
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:29,760
I get energized when Kureha comes.

2065
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:33,030
And to energize Kureha

2066
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,730
She's giving her a manicure.

2067
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:37,800
Alright.

2068
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:38,800
Now wait a bit.

2069
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:46,540
Time flies when you are having fun.

2070
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:48,980
I will give you a letter.

2071
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,210
Did you write a letter? Thank you.

2072
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,380
Kureha, did you write it?

2073
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:56,950
She can write?

2074
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:02,620
| \ + [] Δ -| ' /\ | \ + [ Δ -| ' /\

2075
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:03,490
What does it say?

2076
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:04,460
She read it to her mother.

2077
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:06,860
I see.

2078
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:10,930
You wrote: "I hope mama will get better soon."?

2079
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:13,470
Thank you.

2080
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:14,770
Since Kureha came...

2081
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:15,700
Look.

2082
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,500
Wow, it...

2083
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:17,500
The mother

2084
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:20,110
has decided not to cry in front of Kureha.

2085
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:22,240
If she does then it will weaken Kureha.

2086
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,010
This is a letter.

2087
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:28,520
When you get back home have papa read it for you.

2088
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:31,350
Mama also wrote one.

2089
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,760
Do come back again full of vigour.

2090
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,790
I have lots of vigour.

2091
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,790
Come with all your vigour.

2092
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:39,860
She got the letter from her mother.

2093
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:42,230
And will head home to her father who is waiting.

2094
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:48,000
Bye bye.

2095
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:48,000
Saying their goodbyes at the elevator.

2096
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:57,040
She didn't cry. It really surprised me.

2097
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,210
The mother too.

2098
01:23:58,210 --> 01:24:00,080
She tried to keep it in.

2099
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:03,620
She was able to do it by herself.

2100
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:07,550
From now on she will be able to go by herself.

2101
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:20,100
The bus departed with Kureha on it.

2102
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:31,750
As she was bestowed energy tears start appearing.

2103
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:38,320
As she has given away energy tears start appearing.

2104
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,590
The mother's handling was so kind.

2105
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:04,850
I will do my best.

2106
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:07,950
Since this the mother

2107
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:11,690
recovered so much the nurses were astounded.

2108
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:21,730
Though she was only in there with her mother for 1 hour.

2109
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:23,360
But it's fine.

2110
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,300
The story from the picture book continued in her dreams.

2111
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:28,200
Just a bit more and you will pass home.

2112
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,170
Close the picture book.

2113
01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:34,740
It's the next bus stop.

2114
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:41,250
She's still fast asleep.

2115
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:53,760
Young lady. Young lady. We arrived. We arrived at your home.

2116
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:50,990
What a relief.

2117
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,500
Young lady. Wake up.

2118
01:25:56,830 --> 01:25:58,170
Right?

2119
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:00,170
We arrived to your home.

2120
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:02,200
Home? Huh?

2121
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,470
I was dreaming of my mother.

2122
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:12,380
But the errand wasn't just a dream.

2123
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:17,620
This is the time her father always sleeps so she enters quietly.

2124
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,350
Welcome back.

2125
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:22,260
He was pacing restlessly around the room.

2126
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:23,260
You did your best.

2127
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:24,990
I want to give you a letter.

2128
01:26:24,990 --> 01:26:26,590
Is it this one?

2129
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:26,590
Um.

2130
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:29,630
The letter. Yes.

2131
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,630
The letter that her mother handed her.

2132
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,070
Alright.

2133
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:34,670
I will now read mama's letter.

2134
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:36,800
To papa,

2135
01:26:37,370 --> 01:26:43,380
Today you believed in Kureha.

2136
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:48,250
Thank you for properly sending her off.

2137
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:55,620
Papa, give this award for the girl doing her best.

2138
01:26:56,290 --> 01:27:02,960
It's tough when you have to do what's necessary to fight an illness.

2139
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:13,540
It's tough but I have a family. I have all of you.

2140
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:15,880
That's why I am happy.

2141
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:26,350
Let's enjoy the development of a child together and embark on a happy life.Thank you.

2142
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:29,760
Right? That's what mom wrote.

2143
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:30,820
Right?

2144
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:32,690
Mama has...

2145
01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:37,530
This wonderful gold medal. She wants to say "here you go, Kureha".

2146
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:40,870
Wonderful.

2147
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:42,040
Hug me.

2148
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:48,280
You did your best.

2149
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,580
Right?

2150
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:53,210
You did your best. You did your best.

2151
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:58,490
Papa is crying.

2152
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:04,460
And she will keep developing. From here on out.

2153
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:08,360
I'm happy that I get to watch her development.

2154
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,930
And I want to see much more of it.

2155
01:28:09,930 --> 01:28:11,130
That's right.

2156
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:14,430
And has the father developed through this too?

2157
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:18,100
Good girl. Good girl. Good girl.

2158
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:18,810
He hasn't.

2159
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:18,810
It's no good.

2160
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:22,210
It's hot.

2161
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:22,910
It's hot.

2162
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,380
It's hot.

2163
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:24,380
Right.

2164
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:26,280
You did well in going to your mother's.

2165
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,750
2 weeks later.

2166
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:31,050
The mother who quickly improved was discharged.

2167
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:32,650
Amazing.

2168
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,650
How great.

2169
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:34,950
Bringing grandad and grandma to go watch the fall colors.

2170
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:40,630
The sun is shining brightly.

2171
01:28:39,330 --> 01:28:43,800
Shizuoka ● Morimachi

2172
01:28:40,630 --> 01:28:42,800
In the best region in Japan for tea, Shizuoka.

2173
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,800
Where two kids are brought up strong.

2174
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:54,310
Beni
4 years 1 month

2175
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,170
Beni who recently turned 4 and

2176
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:54,310
Gen
3 years 9 months

2177
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:51,440
the 4 months younger Gen who is still 3.

2178
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,810
Even after kindergarten is over they hang out as the familiar duo.

2179
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:57,710
Even today Gen came to Beni's house to play.

2180
01:28:57,710 --> 01:29:00,710
Beni is pouring tea into the container.

2181
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:03,850
We are running out of tea leaves.

2182
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:06,190
But we have to bring it tomorrow.

2183
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:09,820
At the kindergarten they must bring tea in every day.

2184
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:12,090
It's to rinse their mouths.

2185
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:16,600
At this elementary school tea comes out of the faucet.

2186
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,600
Amazing.

2187
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:20,400
It's not for drinking. Only rinsing.

2188
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:22,670
Eh. What is this?

2189
01:29:21,370 --> 01:29:25,810
Filmed in 2011.

2190
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:27,470
It is said that it helps protect against the common cold and influenza.

2191
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:30,310
As expected from a tea producing region.

2192
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:32,950
They will go buy tea for gargling.

2193
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:34,910
What are you going to purchase?

2194
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:38,320
Tea for gargling.

2195
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:38,320
That's exactly it.

2196
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:42,990
He brings Beni's tea container.

2197
01:29:42,990 --> 01:29:43,920
How kind of you.

2198
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:54,130
Home

2199
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:54,130
Tea shop

2200
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,660
They are going to buy tea for gargling.

2201
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:50,260
It's the same route as on the way to the kindergarten.

2202
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:54,130
The mothers have found a safe path with no cars.

2203
01:29:57,270 --> 01:30:01,110
Uwa, looks like it will be a fun little errand.

2204
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:03,140
Off you go.

2205
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:04,780
Off we go.

2206
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:10,750
The two of them depart in a good mood and friendly.

2207
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:12,990
However...

2208
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:15,990
It's kinda scary.

2209
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:20,290
For some reason tears are forming.

2210
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,860
She was overcome with loneliness.

2211
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,930
Want to cry?

2212
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:26,930
Want to cry?

2213
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,340
Want to cry?

2214
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:32,640
I want to go back to my mother's.

2215
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:35,310
Where mama is, yeah.

2216
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:37,180
I do want to go.

2217
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:40,750
While saying all that they proceed with smiles.

2218
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:42,850
It will be fine cause I am with you.

2219
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:46,420
Gen is a man. He's reliable.

2220
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:50,920
Continuing down the straight path.

2221
01:30:54,030 --> 01:30:57,400
Mr. Sun, don't go away, okay?

2222
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:00,300
Mr. Sun, don't go away, okay?

2223
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:03,640
It won't go away just yet.

2224
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:07,940
Eh, a quarrel?

2225
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:10,280
But in fact...

2226
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,710
Gen's win.

2227
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:14,080
They are playing around.

2228
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,750
Oh, I see.

2229
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,650
A kappa's leaf.

2230
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:21,620
What's a kappa's leaf.

2231
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:24,990
Since the kappa is coming

2232
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:27,490
this will protect you from getting wet.

2233
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,700
A kappa will also come for me.

2234
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:34,070
A kappa's leaf! To be honest this old guy doesn't have a clue.

2235
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:36,070
But it's a good overall feeling.

2236
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:37,170
What's wrong?

2237
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,510
Let's eat a rice balls.

2238
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:42,510
They found a place to eat rice balls.

2239
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:43,980
Gen...

2240
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:46,450
Beni has an edamame rice ball.

2241
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,680
- How nice.
- Nice.

2242
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,050
Delicious.

2243
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:52,250
And Gen has a seaweed rice ball.

2244
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:55,090
And there's kelp mixed with the rice.

2245
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:59,430
They are really relishing it.

2246
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,260
Even this old guy wants one now.

2247
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,500
Please take care of the litter.

2248
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,800
The always kind Gen.

2249
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:12,010
I am going.

2250
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:15,380
Please wait. I'm getting ready.

2251
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:19,610
Their stomachs are full.

2252
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:21,280
And the sun is pleasantly warm.

2253
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,480
Which means...

2254
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,080
Want to take a break? Right here.

2255
01:32:24,350 --> 01:32:25,080
Okay.

2256
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,120
Want to lay down?

2257
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:29,060
Lay down?

2258
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:31,460
It feels good to lay down.

2259
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:34,960
This is a post-feast nap.

2260
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,430
Mr. Sun didn't go away as promised.

2261
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:40,500
Here we are.

2262
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,140
We finally arrived.

2263
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:45,170
Mr. Sun, don't go away, okay?

2264
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:46,410
How nice.

2265
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:50,310
Full of playing around 1 hour and 45 minutes have passed since they left.

2266
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:52,780
We've arrived so it will be fine from now on.

2267
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:55,380
Finally time for the errand.

2268
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:57,380
What type of tea do they need to buy?

2269
01:32:58,890 --> 01:33:00,190
Welcome.

2270
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:02,820
One for the lid, please.

2271
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:04,890
One for the lid, please.

2272
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:11,500
Tea leaves.

2273
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:14,000
Gen, nice follow up.

2274
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,840
First they get to enjoy a tea sample.

2275
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:20,070
This isn't for gargling.

2276
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:21,980
Since this is first-rate tea.

2277
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:26,180
They appreciate good tea.

2278
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:30,020
Will this one be fine?

2279
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:30,020
No no. No need for first-rate tea.

2280
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,290
Tea for gargling.

2281
01:33:32,290 --> 01:33:34,920
You need it for gargling?

2282
01:33:33,450 --> 01:33:34,920
That's right.

2283
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:38,730
It's tea for gargling that they need to bring to the kindergarten.

2284
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:41,560
For gargling the cheapest one is sufficient.

2285
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:50,340
They help pouring it in the containers.

2286
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:52,810
How old are you?

2287
01:33:52,910 --> 01:33:54,940
4 years old.

2288
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:54,940
4 years?

2289
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:56,940
She's a bit proud of it.

2290
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,210
And you?

2291
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,810
3 years old.

2292
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:02,810
It's a bit frustrating.

2293
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:06,620
The containers are now full to the brim.

2294
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:09,220
Please be careful.

2295
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:11,790
Hurry up and go home.

2296
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:11,790
Thank you very much.

2297
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:15,360
Mr. Sun waited for them.

2298
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:18,360
Today is our first errand.

2299
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:21,070
Huge success.

2300
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,440
No no. The errand isn't over until you get home.

2301
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:27,810
I'm tired already.

2302
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:27,810
Yeah.

2303
01:34:27,810 --> 01:34:29,710
Their legs started getting heavy.

2304
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,780
If they don't hurry home it will start to get dark.

2305
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:36,450
Should we take a break here?

2306
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:39,850
Want to eat Ramune.

2307
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,850
Ramune?

2308
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:45,020
They were told to eat it if they started feeling tired. The mothers prepared it.

2309
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:47,960
This is for both of us.

2310
01:34:52,170 --> 01:34:53,930
It revitalized them.

2311
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:02,680
Beni, it's dangerous to go there.

2312
01:35:07,710 --> 01:35:10,980
If they don't hurry the sun will set.

2313
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:23,130
Mr. Sun is taking his sweet time for the sake of both of them.

2314
01:35:26,070 --> 01:35:27,400
I can see it.

2315
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:30,570
The moon is so red.

2316
01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:32,910
It's the sun.

2317
01:35:58,230 --> 01:36:02,500
The mothers have turned on all the lights in the house and are waiting.

2318
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:09,640
Gen.

2319
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:13,010
I am home!

2320
01:36:11,210 --> 01:36:13,010
Welcome back.

2321
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,380
They returned safely.

2322
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:18,480
Gen, you have so much strength.

2323
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:22,660
Gen is carrying it.

2324
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:22,660
The kind man, Gen, also reached the goal.

2325
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:25,390
It's been 3 hours and 50 minutes since they left the house.

2326
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:27,560
They did their best without quarreling.

2327
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:28,860
It must've been heavy.

2328
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:31,700
You really did your best.
You've been a great help.

2329
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:34,700
They got the right tea for gargling.

2330
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:38,070
Bacteria is being spat out.

2331
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:45,040
Let's say cheers with our cups.

2332
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:45,040
Let's say cheers with our cups.

2333
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,650
It's such a nice time when you gargle tea.

2334
01:36:47,650 --> 01:36:52,220
This spring they started junior high school and they both sent us a video.

2335
01:36:52,650 --> 01:36:56,290
They didn't get to do their elementary school graduations.

2336
01:36:52,850 --> 01:37:01,090
Beni
Junior High 1 year

2337
01:37:01,530 --> 01:37:02,930
It's bitter.

2338
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:06,400
Even at junior high they still gargle on green tea.

2339
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:07,930
Gen
Junior High 1 year

2340
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,070
They always do it when they wash their hands.

2341
01:37:09,070 --> 01:37:13,040
It would be nice if life can get back to normal as soon as possible.

2342
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:19,810
Our first errand. Huge success!
