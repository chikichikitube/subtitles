00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,040
Tonight's Gaki no Tsukai is the "Eating Marathon Challenge"

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,320
"Bikkuri Donkey" finale

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,500
If you want to eat it, just go for it, that's what we worked so hard for since we were 18, right?

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,590
The rules are, for the 32 items on the main dish and steak menu

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,470
The team will draw from a lottery to determine which dish to eat and finish

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,140
Starting from the Hachioji restaurant, which is a bit far away from downtown

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,170
They will finish the mean at each chain

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,350
And work towards the goal of dominating all 21 locations in Tokyo

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,080
In addition, the new rule of only 4 people will be eating each time

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,690
And the one other person can rest up has been added

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,760
And then...

12
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,240
This person   -Eh? Matsumoto-san?

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,690
What's going on?   -This seriously pisses me off

14
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:03,510
Up until the sixth chain, the resting man has been between Matsumoto and Endo

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,640
Tonight is another 30 minutes full of hamburgers

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,430
Will they be able to dominate all 21 locations in Tokyo?

17
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:20,460
Subbed by Appieopie, more episodes at
www.laughseejapan.com/user/18797

18
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,100
4 hours after the challenge started

19
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,560
The members are now at their sixth chain in Mizuho

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,800
The restaurant is here, look at these stairs

21
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,540
Eh? This is it?   -No, the restaurant is up here

22
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,400
Welcome   -Welcome

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,760
The seats are tatami mats for this chain   -Eh?

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,350
*Seiza is the Japanese term for the standard formal traditional way of sitting in Japan.

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,350
Seiza while eating hamburger?

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,360
For his third round of rest, Endo ordered ice oolong tea

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,360
Sorry to keep you waiting   -Thank you

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,770
This is the 300g grated radish burger

29
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,730
Wow, it looks so good

30
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:10,280
Grated radish burger (300g) 1,175 yen

31
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,420
The burger is divided into 4 equal parts, and they're working together to finish it

32
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,260
Comparing to the 3 members who ate continuously

33
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,760
Matsumoto has been resting for 3 rounds, and should be able to finish it with ease

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,870
How does it taste?   -Really good

35
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,720
It's just the same

36
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,250
You mean it's the same good taste right?   -Yeah

37
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,060
It tastes good as always

38
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,730
Hmm...

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,170
Matsumoto-san you seem to be...

40
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,970
You're giving off a "heave-ho feel"   -No problem, I'm fine

41
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,140
I just feel like the fork is a bit heavy

42
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,570
Is that because of the salad you ate previously?

43
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,370
Yeah surprisingly enough, salad actually make you feel full

44
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,420
But I'm fine, I'll digest it before we arrive the next chain

45
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,620
Glad that there's no rice

46
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,030
Yeah, it will be tough if there's rice

47
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,690
Okay, let's draw the dish for the next Higashimurayama chain

48
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,690
I'll choose this one

49
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,360
Pineapple curry burger dish

50
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,720
Pineapple curry burger dish

51
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,980
Oh, I see, the pineapple curry burger dish

52
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,360
Yamazaki is responsible for pineapple   -Yeah, you're right

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,610
Who will be the resting man, this is the main point...

54
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,300
Let's see who gets to rest up   -I'm not looking at it

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,510
The resting man has been between Matsumoto and Endo so far

56
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,530
Who will be the resting man this time?

57
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,240
Please show it to us   -One, two, three...here it is

58
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,850
Ah, Housei-san   -So it's Housei-san

59
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,500
The tide is turning   -Yeah, the tide is finally turning

60
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,660
And you don't need to eat the pineapple   -Yeah

61
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,440
You can't rest when there's pineapple right?

62
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,650
Based on article 42

63
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,720
What kind of law is that?

64
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,960
When you're responsible for the food...

65
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,620
Side menu   -I want oolong tea

66
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,770
Hot, hot, hot   -Hot oolong tea

67
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,580
Oh yes, oh yes, let's go

68
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,080
So now the tide is turning

69
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,200
Tanaka and I have been eating non-stop   -Yeah, we never get to rest

70
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,370
This is awful

71
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,920
This is seriously awful

72
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,300
We just finished the sixth chain, are you guys feeling full now?

73
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,950
I'm completely fine

74
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,570
Yeah, I'm completely fine

75
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,030
What about you, Hamada-san?

76
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,080
Hamada-san kept looking into the distance

77
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,080
That's why he's so quite   -He's staring out the window all the time

78
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,350
And he don't even want to answer our question

79
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,350
The seventh restaurant is Higashimuryama chain

80
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,250
Cocorico should eat the pineapple...   -We'll eat the pineapple

81
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,420
Yeah, we'll eat the pineapple together

82
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,360
This is delicious

83
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,860
It's curry, so maybe it's a bit easier to swallow   -Yeah, it is

84
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,240
Tastes so good

85
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,660
You're eating so fast

86
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:26,810
The resting man Housei is enjoying his coffee

87
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,950
What are you doing, dude

88
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,480
I'm having a pleasant time here

89
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,880
It's really good to just take a rest

90
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,260
No way, this is just...

91
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,390
Well, you're about to finish it

92
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,970
You guys are quite fast

93
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,760
Okay, so we finished it

94
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,140
The dish for the next chain is...

95
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:04,550
The dish for the 8th chain will be egg burger steak

96
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,720
Please, Yama-chan...   -Please let the tide turn here

97
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,610
I want to rest again too though

98
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,390
What is this guy talking about

99
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,320
Tanaka-san

100
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,960
I'm the only one who is continuing...

101
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,870
Well, there is nothing that we can do about this

102
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,950
Yeah, I know, but still...

103
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,500
My countdown has started...

104
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,560
Endo show us the "Hamburger" gag seriously

105
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,160
-The Hamburger gag right?
-Yes, think of yourself as the Hamburger-shisho

106
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,570
Hamburger

107
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,660
You're so annoying

108
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,430
The person beside said I'm annoying in a low voice

109
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,430
So I'm afraid that I won't be able to continue

110
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,490
Isn't that too long?

111
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,350
Is it too long?   -Yes, it's a bit too long

112
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,900
You're saying it like the length of "Ametalk"

113
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,610
Make it shorter, please

114
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,590
Hamburger

115
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,080
You're so annoying

116
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,220
Sorry, but the person beside me is in a really bad mood now, so...

117
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,920
The one just now was too short   -Really?

118
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,880
Yeah, it's too short, it sounds weird

119
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,430
Really? It sounds weird?

120
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,410
Hamburger

121
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,510
Ouch

122
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,260
He even hit me in the face now...

123
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,480
Tanaka should do this for you then

124
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,790
Hamburger...

125
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,060
Seriously?

126
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,760
What is that fade out?   -Are you kidding me?

127
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,370
The members arrive at the 8th restaurant, Kodaira Onuma chain

128
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,340
Is it over here?

129
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,110
Yes, it's over here

130
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,400
All of it?   -Yes, the whole building

131
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,620
I'll eat it first

132
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,080
Sure

133
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
The resting man, Tanaka, ordered strawberry soft

134
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,660
This is the 300g egg hamburger steak   -Thank you very much

135
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,020
I'll pour the sauce too

136
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:37,200
Egg hamburger steak (300g) 1,175 yen

137
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,680
I don't want to eat it, just by looking at it

138
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:48,320
I'm so freaking full already!!

139
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,320
There's still a long way to go   -He must be joking

140
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,100
Do you know how many more chains are yet to be finished?

141
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:03,910
Even now, the dish has been divided into 4 equal parts

142
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:11,140
Hamada-san, please eat it while it's still warm...

143
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,800
I really want to get through this

144
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,680
Treat this as the most important stage

145
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,430
I'm so full...

146
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,070
Okay, then we don't need you to eat the egg

147
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,550
No, I just can't eat anything anymore

148
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,500
What?   -Can't eat anything...

149
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,490
What happened?

150
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,230
Did you become a baby again?

151
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,120
But you don't need to eat the egg, someone else will eat it for you

152
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,140
Yeah, just eat the rest   -No, I can't...

153
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,740
Should we draw the next resting man first?

154
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,500
No, that's not the problem

155
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,340
I'm just suffering

156
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,810
Did Hamada make this sound?

157
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,690
That's because other customers are entering

158
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,500
That's not Hamada's sound...   -Ah, he's digging in

159
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,380
Wow, that's amazing   -Incredible

160
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,470
You ate nothing

161
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,710
You ate nothing   -You're just pretending

162
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,900
That's my trick

163
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,890
When I try to trick people!!

164
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,490
Three of the members have finished their quota

165
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,820
Only Hamada is left

166
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,210
I'll try to eat it bit by bit   -Yes, please

167
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,360
That's a good tactic

168
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,510
Slowly but surely

169
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,440
Oh, he did it

170
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,420
Well done my boy

171
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,430
He did it

172
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,990
This is just impossible!!

173
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,580
If you can eat that bit, you should be able to finish it

174
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,190
Yeah, he seems to be able to finish it

175
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,830
Just eat it bit by bit

176
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,010
Good, he did it   -Nice

177
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,330
He's trying hard

178
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,910
Look at his thumb

179
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,330
He's putting his thumb in his fist

180
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,520
Just two more bites...

181
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,020
Well done   -Good pace

182
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,340
This is exactly what happened to me before

183
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,130
You can feel the wave   -Oh, I see

184
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,630
You can feel the wave inside you

185
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,160
You need to feel it and ride on the low waves

186
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,780
Or else it will go "bang!"

187
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:25,280
You need to ride on this low wave, or else it will go "bang!"

188
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,100
So you need to feel and catch the low waves

189
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,540
We don't want that "bang!"

190
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:40,370
He's feeling the wave now   -Yeah, he is

191
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,380
Now!

192
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,330
He did it   -He grasped the chance

193
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,230
He finished the hamburger

194
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,720
Yes, only the egg is left   -So he finished it right?

195
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,360
He's digging in   -He did it!

196
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,650
Egg hamburger steak completed!

197
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,840
So for the next chain...

198
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:10,120
The dish for the 9th chain will be grated radish and perilla hamburger dish

199
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,830
And the resting man will be...

200
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:21,010
Better let Hamada, who went way beyond his limit, to rest this round

201
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,010
Go for it   -This is crucial

202
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,750
I have faith in you

203
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,790
The next resting man will be...   -I hope it's you too

204
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,680
Will be this person   -Come on

205
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,220
Tanaka-san again

206
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,140
You drew yourself?

207
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,060
He must feel lonely too

208
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,770
This is the first consecutive draw today

209
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,940
This really hurts mentally

210
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:50,280
Up till the 8th chain, Hamada who hasn't get to rest at all, along with Housei, are both reaching their limits

211
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,420
Fujiwara therefore prepared something for them

212
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,880
I've brought a rescue item for you guys

213
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,700
What is it?

214
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:07,540
Since herbal tea is a powerful digestive aid, would you like to have some, Hamada-san?

215
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,680
Hey, why do I need to go so far as to finish the challenge?

216
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,960
This man said something philosophical

217
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,550
Can I have some herbal tea, please?   -Of course

218
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,000
Say something, dude!!

219
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,440
Now at the 9th chain

220
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,020
Will Hamada be able to get through this?

221
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:54,190
-How do you feel for resting consecutively?
-Well, I feel really easy

222
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,980
I bet you do   -Yes

223
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,690
Aiming to finish it together, the dish is again divided into 4 equal parts

224
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,780
Just eat it slowly but surely

225
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,030
Wow, he's digging in

226
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,660
That's amazing

227
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,800
He finished it in the blink of an eye

228
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,700
That's so cool   -Incredible

229
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,410
That's really cool   -Awesome

230
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,540
He finished it before those strange waves arrive   -Oh, I see

231
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,760
I just have to pour it into my mouth

232
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,240
And with water

233
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,150
Endo met his quota

234
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,250
Housei-san finished it too   -Yes

235
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,420
Herbal tea helped a lot

236
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,830
Matsumoto met his quota

237
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,800
Hamada made an incredible effort, and the 9th chain is completed too

238
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,080
The menu for the 10th chain is cheese packet dish with rice

239
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,760
I'm sure that Hamada will be the one resting this time

240
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,620
Just pick the right one, okay?   -I bet it will be Hamada

241
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,420
Yeah, of course it should be me resting this time

242
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,420
Hamada-san please   -Looking good

243
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,120
Come on! Come on!

244
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,650
One, two, three!

245
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,370
It's Hamada-san

246
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,040
This is amazing   -This prolonged his life

247
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,760
Yeah, you're right   -This really prolonged his life

248
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,990
What about the side dish? You want some Spaghetti with Meat sauce?

249
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,370
And let him perform the dig in again

250
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:31,680
Hamada finally get to rest during the 10th chain

251
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,760
The dream to complete all 21 chains is coming true

252
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:41,860
The next one will be the 10th chain, how full is your stomach now?

253
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,150
I'm like 8 over 10 now

254
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,060
About 8 over 10?   -Yes

255
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,850
What if you didn't eat that green salad?

256
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:57,760
Well, I don't regret eating that green salad at all

257
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,380
It was such a good memory

258
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,510
And we were attracted to each other

259
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,120
But if you didn't meet it...   -Then you won't be 8 over 10

260
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,190
But it is the encounter with it...
that helped me go through all this...

261
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,640
Your voice is so quiet

262
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:24,270
Well, I'll speak louder when I come up with something more interesting

263
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,700
Even Matsumoto-san have those moments!?

264
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:35,510
The challenge that started from the Hachiouji chain,
has finally reached Tokyo 23 wards during the 10th chain

265
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:43,390
Hamada ordered coke for his first round of resting

266
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,850
-This tastes a bit strange
-Yeah, the sauce is completely different

267
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,190
Something is inside   -It's cheese

268
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,190
Looks good

269
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,000
How does it taste?   -Delicious

270
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,960
-Tanaka has been resting for two rounds
-Yeah, so it still tastes good for me

271
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,490
Ahhh...

272
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,340
And this has a different taste too

273
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,600
Ahhh...

274
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,960
What's wrong with you?

275
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,220
Seriously...I feel exhausted just to sit here

276
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,840
You can't see the salad?

277
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,970
At this time of day...under this light...I just can't see it

278
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,810
-You don't know where the salad is?
-I don't even know what I'm eating

279
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,520
You're just eating whatever there is?   -Yes

280
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,560
We've reached the 10th chain in 6 and a half hours

281
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,500
We can do this, just a couple more hours

282
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,810
Only 11 more chains to go

283
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:51,090
Everyone finished it, so let's get Hamada to draw the dish for the next chain

284
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,220
Better draw a hamburger-only dish

285
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,480
Okay, what is it?

286
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,200
Oyako burger...   -Eh?

287
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,220
You must be joking   -It's Oyako burger dish with cheese

288
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,330
It's awful to have Oyako burger at this point of time

289
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,000
Why Oyako burger now...   -Oh no, we're in danger

290
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,800
And the resting man who everyone wants to be is...

291
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,630
Please!

292
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,220
Eh? Tanaka again?

293
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,690
Thank you very much

294
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,250
This is awful   -Why Tanaka...

295
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,040
The challenge has started for 6 and a half hours

296
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,530
Yet, there's still a long way from dominating all 21 chains

297
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:35,860
Come on, dude, even their CEO won't be able to dominate all 21 chains in one day

298
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:44,210
*Oyako literally translates to parent and child, which refers to a dish with one bigger and one smaller burger

299
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:44,210
Arriving the 11th chain, this is their fourth Oyako dish*

300
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,060
Here it is   -You mean this thing as well?

301
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,060
Yes, including this thing, everything

302
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,300
Since when did you start to keep on asking these things?

303
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,230
Seriously, he kept on asking me these things

304
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,040
Such a pleasure to have Oolong tea at this point in time

305
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,860
Tastes good

306
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,530
I bet so

307
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,060
This is Oyako burger dish with cheese

308
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,230
Amazing   -That's a big portion!

309
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,940
Yeah, was it this big before?

310
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,190
Isn't the child surpassing it's parent?

311
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:27,760
No way, it has always been like this

312
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,970
It's like old people providing care for old people

313
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,180
Let's start eating

314
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,390
Hamburger and rice is divided into 4 equal parts

315
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,630
Aiming to finish everything together

316
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,450
I can't see it

317
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,130
Can I wear my glasses? I really can't see it

318
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,000
Sorry, I'm really sorry for this

319
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,580
But I can't see it   -What's wrong with you?

320
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,350
What are you doing?   -Makes me feel stressed

321
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,570
Maybe it's better to not see it though...

322
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,430
What happened to Big Daddy?

323
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,350
He's sitting without moving a muscle

324
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,020
Like a daddy feeding his 3 children

325
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,760
Thank you daddy

326
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:15,360
Wow, Housei-san is digging in   -Housei-san is amazing

327
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,160
House meets his quota

328
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,250
Awesome   -He finished it

329
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:29,800
Endo-san met his quota as well

330
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,250
Only Downtown is left

331
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,140
Are you waiting for your helper?

332
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,860
Yeah, he can't pick up the food

333
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,300
Someone is looking a bit strange

334
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,190
I'll work hard

335
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,210
He's wearing his hat like Julie (Kenji Sawada)

336
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,900
Ah, Matsumoto-san is about to finish

337
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,100
Go for it

338
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,900
Awesome! He finished it

339
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,040
Three of them have met their quota

340
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,890
Endo finished the salad as well

341
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,820
Only Hamada is left

342
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:24,890
However, time has passed, and he's not eating it at all

343
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,760
Finally, the give up countdown has started

344
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,020
Three minutes, ready, set, start!

345
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:40,610
But remember he has that "dig in" thing right?   -Yeah

346
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,860
We call it the "Hamada Dig"

347
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,980
Wow, he's digging in

348
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,560
That's amazing   -He finished it

349
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,920
He's just trying to build up tension

350
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,870
To dig in and finish it in the last few seconds

351
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,450
Like "here I go!!"

352
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,970
One minute has passed

353
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,110
He's still not going for it yet

354
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,790
Not yet, it's not time yet

355
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:21,570
Time has passed, and he doesn't seem like eating it at all

356
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:29,510
-He's drinking a lot of water though
-2 minutes has passed, 1 more minute left

357
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,380
No problem, I'm sure that he will do it for us

358
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,210
Here he goes, he's getting prepared   -Yeah, he is

359
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,810
The countdown starts now, 30 more seconds

360
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:51,380
Last 30 seconds   -It's time for him to shine

361
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,940
Cameraman, take a close-up shot please

362
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,980
Make sure my partner looks good on camera!!

363
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,580
Finish!!

364
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,740
No way, no way, this is impossible

365
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,910
For a split second, I thought he is going to do it

366
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,820
Yeah, I thought so too, for a split second

367
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,790
When he murmured like "umm"

368
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:34,460
Hamada will be paying the bill for everyone

369
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,620
By the way...

370
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,600
Who will the next resting man if we drew the cards?

371
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,230
So Tanaka-san will be drawing the card

372
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,620
One, two, three!

373
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,060
Tanaka?!

374
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,840
You're resting too much, dude

375
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,590
This is ridiculous

376
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,130
What the heck, dude?

377
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,130
This is ridiculous

378
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,760
He'll probably eat dinner at home as usual man

379
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,130
You're still hungry right?

380
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,860
I can still eat a lot!
