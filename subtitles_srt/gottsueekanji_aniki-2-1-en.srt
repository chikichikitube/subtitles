00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,980
You're always asking me--

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,820
Hands down

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,580
Sorry

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,940
Big bro...
- Have a seat, please

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,460
Sorry for that, please take a seat

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,100
I know it's hard to say the same thing everytime...

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,480
But I don't have the money you want, I'm sorry

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,580
Are ya sure about that?
- Yes, I swear

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,420
We recently heard that you're
kind of a big deal, huh

17
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,790
What are you talking about, that's stupid

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,920
Ahh, you're really getting in trouble, ya know
- Why?

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,180
Mr. Hamada...

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,820
Japan surely is flourishing, don't ya think?

21
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,540
Answer
- Yes, that's true

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,060
Ever rode a shinkansen before?

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,620
Yes I did

24
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,800
It's incredible how fast a bunch
of metal scraps can run

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,380
That's true...

26
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,820
It can go from Tokyo to Osaka in 2 hours

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,420
I took it recently

28
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,320
Ya know it has the
announcement speakers, right?

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,220
Right?
- Yes

30
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,280
It said "this train has just passed Shizuoka"

31
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,280
Think of me when I'm being told this...

32
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,280
WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT IT?!

33
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,840
THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED OT DO?!

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,360

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,260
MORE!!!
-WHAT IS HE SUPPOSED TO DO?!?!

37
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,140
NOW JUST IN YOUR HEAD!!

38
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,440
Answer the phone, please
- Yes

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,440
Ah-- yes, please wait a second

40
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,120
Boss, we have a call from Osaka

41
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:08,220
Yes? Oh, hi, yes, so what's the estimation?

42
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,480
Yeah

43
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,440
15 million? Each? For Hawaii?

44
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,980
That's cheap, but it's still a lot!
Alright, that's it then

45
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,760
Oh, is that so?

46
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,860
Can I take my employees with me?

47
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,100
Yeah I mean...
once a year it's not a big deal, right?

48
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,120
Alright got it, let's stick with that,
thanks for calling

49
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,740
We're going to Hawaii!

50
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,560
Let's go to Hawaii!

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,260
We're gonna have a blast!

52
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,460
What should I bring with me?

53
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,080
Hey

54
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,760
You... seem to be enjoying yourself a lot

55
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,690
Yes...

56
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,330
Do you know Sakata the dumb?

57
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,860
Do you know him?

58
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,040
Oh, mr. Sakata? I do...

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,240
Looks like he had a little accident, lately
- Oh, I heard that

60
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,420
Gotta be careful, huh?
- True, true

61
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,060
You know, everybody called him dumb for that

62
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,480
They really did

63
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,840
But he said,
"if you're dumb, you can't be a comedian"

64
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,940
Is that so?

65
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,720
"I can act dumb because I'm smart"

66
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,360
I see...
- It's the same in a circus

67
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,560
The clown, you know... the clown
is actually the most skilled member

68
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,740
Ah, is that so...
- He's so good he can act that way

69
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,220
I see, makes sense...

70
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,560
It may be like this...

71
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,900
But THAT GUY IS A REAL IDIOT!
- A REAL IDIOT!

72
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,460
A REAL IDIOT!
- A REAL IDIOT!

73
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,700
A REAL IDIOT!!
- A REAL IDIOT!!

74
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,920
MORE!
- A REAL IDIOT!

75
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,420
MORE!!
- A REAL IDIOT!!

76
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,540
IN DARK DUCKS STYLE!!
- A re～al idiot ♪

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,680
I... huh... my head is aching a bit

78
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,540
Can you bring me some medicine?

79
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,840
Sorry, let me take that first

80
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,460
Ouch, it hurts

81
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,740
Of course it happened...
- Maybe this...?

82
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,600
How many pills?
- Two of them

83
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,900
Alright
- Just two

84
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,530
As expected from my big bro

85
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,840
Serves you right!

86
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,480
Let's bounce!
- Yeah!

87
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,660
Welcome back to reality, gramps

88
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,400
