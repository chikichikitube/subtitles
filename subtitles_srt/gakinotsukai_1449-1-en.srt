It's a library, so...

10
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,690
Right, I'll be quiet

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,240

Really?

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,340
Are you kidding me?

27
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,480
That can't be true

28
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,310
Gimme a break...

29
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,980
It happens

30
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,250
Wait, this is not safe

31
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,690
This...

Can you say a countdown?

36
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,160
Like, two, one...?

37
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,770

38
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,280
That--

39
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,010
I'd hate that

40
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,780
It hurts so bad

41
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,620
It still hurts

42
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,690
You have no idea

43
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,250
I'd hate it too

44
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,950
Right in the middle

45
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,690
It hurts

46
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,460
It's getting red

47
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,460
Yeah...

00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,420
That's your cushion

This is my usual...

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,000
Hamada's favorite cushion soaked in something with a strong smell

66

Huh? What now?

68
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,220
It stinks so much...

69
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,460
It's unbearable

I'm glad it wasn't me

80
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,920
Stand up

81
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,350
What now?

82
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,350
I'm glad I'm safe

83

I really am

84
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,520
This looks bothersome

85
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,230
Huh?

86
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,260
Scary

87
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,530
He's gonna do it?

88
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,900
Just like the World Cup

89
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,200
This is so scary

90
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,200
He must stay still

91
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,540
If he moves he's dead

92
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,140
Stay quiet

93
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,490
I'm glad it wasn't me...

94
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,020
Yeah, I agree

95
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,460
It stinks

96
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,030
You stink

97
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,030
Did you poop your pants?

98
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,570
Hosei, 51 years old, pooped his pants?

99
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,270
It really stinks!

100
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,470
Try to smell him

101
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,940
Huh?!

102
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,770
He pooped himself!

103
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,770
It stinks!!

104
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,870
Eh? Poop?

105
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,480
He pooped himself...

106
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,480
Poop?

107
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,710
Are you kidding me?

108
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,150
Really?

109
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,550
It stinks so much!

110
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,920
I won't deny I farted, but...

111
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,420
But it smells like poop

112
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,920
It really stinks

113
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,020
Sniff it

114
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,190
Just to make sure

115
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,030
You liar!

116
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,270
Be quiet

117
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,270
In front of our guest?

118
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,270

133
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,340
What is--?

134
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,800
This one sucks

135
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,670
What should --- are we moving?

136
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,080
Step forward

137
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,390
There's an old dude

138
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,130
When you say ramen, I'd say garlic a-go-go

139
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,240
This is incredible

140
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,810
Such a strong smell

141
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,880
He's basically eating only the garlic

142
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,880
Yeah...

143
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,560

Oh man, the smell

It reeks...

148
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,050
I bet it does

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,250
Directly on your face

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,720
Yeah, that's it

It stinks so much...

152
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,190
I could smell it from behind you

153
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,560
It came like a wave

154
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,830
It still stinks

Unbelievable

You can't avoid smelling that

158
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,670
There was too much garlic

159
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,670
Yeah

160
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,270

This isn't good at all

It is

00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,070
He might bleed

Holy shit

Shut your trap!

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,400
It looks painful

184
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,000
Is he bleeding?

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,300
He's gonna bleed

186
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,640
That was amazing

187
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,640
People can bleed from that

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,840
I bet it hurts, doesn't it?

189
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,640
I think that's the worst one yet for me

190
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,280
That guy was good

00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,050
Yeah, incredible

No reason

396
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,180

405
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,160

We're finally getting it

409
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,870
You gotta be kidding me

410
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,870
What the hell is this?

411
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,240
Finally

412
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,600

413
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,600

414
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,170
That's what I wanted

00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,810
You're kidding me, aren't you?

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,080

417
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,610

418
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,850
Ouch

00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,450

424
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,390
What is--?

425
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,290
No way

426
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,230
It hurts

427
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,730
Ow ow ow

00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,030

429
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,260
It hurts

430
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,260

431
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,060
Wait--

00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,830
This is gonna hurt so bad

434
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,670

437
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,680
No!

438
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,650
Let's do this

439
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,530
Am I bleeding...?

440
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,940
Is that a thing?

441
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,240
Great, huh?

442
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,250
That was incredible

443
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,250
Satisfying

444
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,750
As expected

445
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,980
This is gonna be our last one, right?

446
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,980
Yes

447
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,890
Here we are

448
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,520
I want him to go

449
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,060
Yeah, he deserves to

450
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,690
We don't know what we'll get

451
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,400
Mh? You're handing em out?

452
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,700
What?

453
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,330
No way

454
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,830
Can't be helped

455
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,910
Like this

456
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,410

Alright!

466
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,230
You got to be kidding me...

467
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,230
Tanaka

468
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,230

470
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,570

Don't shout

476
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,020

477
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,820
Please

478
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,060
Be one of you two

479
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,060
May I...?

480
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,060
Please don't...!

481
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,690
No way

This is so messed up

486
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,800
You got it

487
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,800
It should

488
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,430
Should have been one of them

489
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,430
I know, right?

490
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,440
I agree

491
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,770
Can't be helped, dude

492
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,770
It had to be one of them

493
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,910
You gotta accept it

494
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,070
Why me? Why not one of you two?

495
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,910
You're talking so friggin' much

496
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,750
One of you would have been
way more suited for this than me

497
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,820
Static electricity machine

498
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,720
I know for sure this is going to hurt

499
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,250
Geez...

500
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,920

501
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,260
Come on man, quit it...

502
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,030
Ehh? Come on...

503
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,460
Is it fine now?

504
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,330
It's not running?

505
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,270
Share the same one

506
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,670
Come on, are you kidding me?

507
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,270
Gimme a break

508
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,410
Didn't my lips get weird?

509
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,180
From before?

510
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,180
Kinda

511
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,450
They do, right?

512
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,080
A bit, yeah

513
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,580
It feels like they're swollen

514
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,550
Yeah, a bit

515
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,920
They're a bit swollen

516
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,620
They're redder than usual

517
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,390
Red and swollen

518
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,990
But you're fine

519
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,990
Yeah

520
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,460
They have to eat it?

521
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,390
Are they eatin' it?

522
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,760
Slowly

523
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,090
They're slowing eating it

524
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,930
Slowly

525
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,830
Calmly...

526
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,840
It made a zap sound

527
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,510
You heard that?

528
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,770
This sucks so bad

529
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,770
I'm done

530
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,940
I'd hate it

531
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,940
It hurts

532
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,740
This isn't ok

533
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,740
No friggin' way

534
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,650
Enough of this

535
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,520
It hurts

536
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,020
Holy shit

537
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,720
We can do it again, right?

538
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,520
Yeah

539
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,950
Eh?

540
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,950
It can be used again

541
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,020
It stores electricity

542
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,020
Of course you can

543
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,060
How about the other 4...?

544
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,860
How about the other 4...?

545
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,920
Oh, you're right

546
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,860
Excuse me?!

547
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,800
I don't get it

548
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:28,170
Between the remaining 4 members, 2 of them will go for it

549
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,800
What do you mean?

550
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,500
Sit down, you four

551
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,500
Why?

552
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,770
But--

553
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,800
You sure I haven't fucked up my lips?

554
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,770
I wanna pick it up myself

555
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,510
I don't like being given one

556
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,080
But we don't really know, I haven't seen them

557
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,210
Here

558
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,550

559
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,680
Alright, go on

One by one?

561
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,220
Starting from you, Tanaka

562
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,090

563
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,020

567
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,960
Shut up, Tanaka!

568
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,730

573
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,400
Please not me

574
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,570
Spare me

00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,210
Alright, let's do this; this one's yours

576
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,810

591
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,460

You do your job and then you go home

601
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,530
Yeah...

602
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,000

Thank you

608

Everything's set

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,540
Now they even know what's gonna happen...

610
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,540
That's right

611
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,110
Huh?

612
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,350
What the-?

613
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,080
So irritating

614
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,680
Are you kidding me?

615
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,750
I felt something--

616
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,850
I swear

617
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,850
Oh, come on

618
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,520
It made a sound

619
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,150
It's still charged

620
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,260
Really?

621
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,260
I heard it

622
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,690
I'm seriously scared

623
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,790
Oh man

624
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,800
Here, take this Yama-chan

625
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,570
It's still fine while you hold it

626
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,570
Yes, you don't feel it

627
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,570
That's true

628
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,840
Incredible

629
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,740
Now he's gonna charge it

630
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,710
Are you good?

631
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,710
Eh-- what's--?

632
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,640
We're not done yet

633
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,750
It made a zappy sound just now

634
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,520
Keep on charging it

635
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,780
Let's go

636
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,320
Hold it with your mouth, it's still safe

637
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,160
It's fine

638
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,190
Now start eating it

639
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,190
Eat it

640
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,200
Start eating it

641
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,760
Eat it

642
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,140
Ah-- enough, please

643
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,370
Oh my oh my

644
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,910
Now that we're done, how was it?

645
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,010
Tell us

646
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,080
It went---

647
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,920
It went to my nose

648
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,520
Your nose? I see

649
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,920
Woah, incredible

650
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,190
Which punishments did you--?

651
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,190
That old man...

652
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,490

653
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,460

655
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:12,830

00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:12,830
Granny bike seesaw

657
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,560
Ah, the garlic thing That one

658
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,020
"Granny bike seesaw" too That one too

659
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,330
"Granny bike seesaw" too That one too

660
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,830
All of them revolved around old dudes

661
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,060
Till the end

662
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,000
Even with him at the end

663
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,470
