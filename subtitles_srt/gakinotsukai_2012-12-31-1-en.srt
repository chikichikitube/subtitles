00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,910
A barrage of laughter

00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,310

00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,690
Field trip to the Edo Period

21
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,690
Superhuman hilarity ensues, one attack after the next

22
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,800
She came!!!

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,330
She came!!!

24
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,600

The actress Endou tried to seduce arrives!

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,480
Could this really happen!?

30
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,900
The text

31
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,900
in question

32
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:10,900
was this!!

33
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,700

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,350
Are you out of your mind!?

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,820
The full picture on his misdeeds disclosed!!

36
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,360
Brave men risk bodily harm

37
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,200
Just wait a second

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,830
Just wait a second

39
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,770

52
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,760
So we've come to this time of year again.

53
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,560
Yamazaki Hosei

54
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,730
Um, I say this every year, but

55
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,730
The only time they're this excited is during this brief moment.

56
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,740
Well... it is pretty long

57
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,740
Many are so excited, they can't align their hands to clap.

58
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,280
That excited?

59
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,340
That excited? Yeah, yeah.

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
So what is it this year, Hamada?

61
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,950
This year's setting is at a School.

62
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,480
My hemorrhoids didn't heal for two weeks after this recording!!

63
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,240
Seriously!

64
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,440
Non-stop leakage?

65
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,360
Non-stop!

66
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,320
Absolutely should not excrete things came out of there...

67
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,740
Uh... but it's absolutely should not laugh

68
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,930
Things you absolutely should not expel

69
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,030
You really suck at backing me up here...

70
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,270
But I haven't done anything...

71
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,930
I hated that

72
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,340
I REALLY hated that

73
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,740
Even though I haven't done anything...

74
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,610
Matsumoto,

75
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,740
Yes! Please!

76
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,610
could you set us up for the clip?

77
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,450
He really let that out

78
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,290
Absolutely No Laughing Enthusiastic Teachers

79
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,290
8:00 am

80
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,960
That morning

81
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,190
The chirp of the birds letting you know its time to wake

82
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,260
A soothing ambiance from the shimmering light of the morning after a heavy downpour

83
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,570
Soothing Ambient Light

84
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,840
We're almost there, let's keep going since we're gonna have to go anyway

85
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,900
We've arrived

86
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,340
Matumoto's done nothing but sigh the entire time

87
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,440
If I could get 9 hours of sleep like you'd

88
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,440
I'd be just as energetic

89
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,740
That is the ideal scenario after all

90
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,380
It's because I've been cut off from drinking for two weeks

91
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,680
What do you mean by that?

92
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,680
I was told by the producer that

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,720
"if you let your physical condition get any worse

94
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,720
I'll snap"

95
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,260
It says to wait here

96
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,760
We're really going to do this, we do it every year after all.

97
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,200
So this isn't going to be the year

98
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,200
where we quit while we're ahead?, is it?

99
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,270
or maybe "Play badminton, here"

100
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,270
and we'll go after we're done...

101
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,230
Enjoy ourselves a bit first

102
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,700
There'd be a point limit so we don't do too many sets

103
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,740
No, no point limit

104
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,240
Cut this kinda stuff out...

105
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,240
I don't like it when they come out at random like this

106
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,520
Aren't they dressed like the characters from School Wars?

107
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,920
Jus... wait...

108
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,920
stop!

109
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,960
He's wearing

110
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,960
guy clothes for once!

111
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,730
Ok we're going to start.

112
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,360
They're the Kawahama High School team (from School Wars)

113
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,630
The legendary "haka"  hometown rugby chant

114
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,650
I'm not looking...

115
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,650
but you can see his balls...

116
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,890
Hey, hold up!

117
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,290
Hey you number 1!

118
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,900
We could see your balls the entire time!!

119
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,730
That's no good!

120
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,130
Is he that kind of number 1?

121
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,230
Hey

122
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,730
What is up with that!?

123
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,740
We could see number 1's balls the entire time

124
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,430
Former Downtown Manager

125
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,430
Fujiwara Hiroshi

126
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,740
That was our rugby team's traditional...

127
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,740
our traditional dance

128
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,590
I know the script was so thick and all...

129
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,590
Anyways, ya... yamazaki

130
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,860
Anyways, ya... yamazaki

131
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,860
how many years since has it been?

132
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,740
How many years since?

133
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,130
It's been a year hasn't it...

134
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,130
Freaking moron!!!

135
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,230
Do you have no sense of

136
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,230
foolishness this year too?

137
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,000
Ah, your response wasn't silly enough

138
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,570
No matter what you say,

139
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,570
it always bombs

140
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:32,180
If you could at least speak

141
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,180
casually at the right time

142
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,180
That's

143
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,180
"yud atta speak casually"

144
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,320
So how should I go about that?

145
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,620
Fujiwara, on a clear day you can see

146
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,620
your face is just covered in acne...

147
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,790
I think everyone still will come watch

148
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,790
even with me the way I am, but anyways...

149
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,200
this year we're

150
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,200
enthusiastic teachers!!

151
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,930
Ah, that makes sense...

152
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,930
So that's what this chant was about...

153
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,000
Enthusiastic Teachers?

154
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,900
So everyone

155
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,900
is to become new enthusiastic teachers,

156
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,670
and instill in your students

157
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,670
a burning desire to learn

158
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,750
Although,

159
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,750
I'm so old you'd think I'd be the vice principal by now...

160
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:19,920
24 hours of service as new teachers

161
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:19,920
The five are put to the test through

162
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,760
If you guys are gonna be teachers,

163
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,760
what's with your clothes!?

164
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,930
Over there are boxes,

165
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,930
there we have prepared a change of Clothes for you.

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,630
Let's go

167
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,770
And like that

168
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,770
before working as teachers

169
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,870
they first have to change into suitable uniforms

170
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,080
Once your ready, we'll have you come out in order

171
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,120
Ok, Matsumoto.

172
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,190
How's that?

173
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,210
Macho Muscle Man Kinpachi

174
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,880
I'm not one to leave things in the air so...

175
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,460
It's not like I'm totally digging this look...

176
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,930
Yamazaki!

177
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,000
It's a little small, but makes you look like you got guts

178
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,160
Naive Funny Guy Kinpachi

179
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,140
Thanks!

180
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,160
Good luck!

181
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,120
Endo!

182
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,130
Oh, as usually you're the hunk

183
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,650
Oh really?

184
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:20,010
Once-divorced hot stuff kinpachi

185
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,820
You'll be popular among the students...

186
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,350
Thanks!

187
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,350
Good Luck!

188
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,920
Then, Tanaka!

189
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,060
Ah,

190
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,640
Ah, the look of a liberal arts teacher!

191
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,560
No good, liberal arts kinpachi

192
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,300
Lastly, Hamada!

193
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,920
You moron

194
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:44,870
Kinpachi with a bad taste in wig

195
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:44,640
Only Hamada would pick a wig in poor taste...

196
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,850
Can such a subtle difference

197
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,850
be that funny!?

198
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,450
It's perfect!

199
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,120
It's like a single grain of rice

200
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,120
that makes the whole meal delicious

201
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,190
That's so unfair!!!

202
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,760
Okay, I'm gonna say the rules now...

203
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,700
1st: Henceforth everyone as new...

204
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,700
uh,

205
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,700
novice enthusiastic..

206
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,500
sorry, one more time...

207
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,100
As novice... Novice Enthusiastic Teachers...

208
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,140
you will do a variety of...

209
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
COUGH!!

210
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,600
...tasks

211
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,680
1st rule: Work 24 hours as novice enthusiastic teachers

212
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,540
Next,

213
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:21,540
while performing your duties,

214
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,540
no matter what happens you absolutely can not laugh.

215
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:27,680
2nd Rule: While performing duties, you can absolutely not laugh.

216
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,150
Next,

217
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,150
in the likely event you do laugh...

218
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,900
you'll receive a severe spanking on your behind.

219
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,550
That is all.

220
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,890
3rd rule: In case of laughter, severe spanking

221
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,120
It's the same pattern as every year...

222
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,160
Okay, everyone...

223
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,560
So let's go to the school...

224
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,060
we're going by bus

225
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,630
Here it comes...

226
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,630
There's even a bus stop over there...

227
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,870
Its time...

228
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:52,110
Ever growing tension

229
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,220
As the start finally draws near...

230
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,460
the long hated growing air of tension takes hold.

231
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,130
Argh, we're really going through with it

232
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,960
We're going to wait for the bus here...

233
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,180
No! It's already here!

234
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,610
It's here?

235
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,620
Contrarily, y'know, I do want it to come faster, but...

236
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,690
though, I still do kinda want to wait a bit...

237
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,750
The bus is here

238
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
The sister bus?

239
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,480
Uh, we'll go to the school by this...

240
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,630
Gaasu Inc. St. Kurobikari School

241
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,630
This is the name of the new school you'll be working at.

242
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,710
The GSG work share bus

243
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:31,080
On the body of the bus is the school symbol and design of sister Gasu.

244
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,080
Sister Gasu

245
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,080
We'll be headed for the school by this bus.

246
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,920
So we're going on a bus with this shocking of design

247
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,760
This uh...

248
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,290
where do you get these from?

249
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,830
Argh...

250
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,830
don't make me ride this...

251
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,830
Let's laugh at it while we can...

252
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,830
Ok, then...

253
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:52,140
The moment you get on,

254
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,140
the no laughing rule takes effect!

255
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,640
Once you've prepared yourselves, go ahead and board...

256
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,510
Before we get on,

257
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,510
y'know Hamada's face...

258
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,410
did you

259
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,410
remember to put on sunscreen?

260
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,280
We don't want your face

261
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,280
getting iron hot red and all...

262
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,150
It's already so bad...

263
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,120
wait until tomorrow and he'll be sparkling...

264
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,120
Please just stop...

265
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,860
You're face is just so funny

266
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,000
We're all hopeless

267
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,360
Try a little harder to get used to this wig for me

268
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,360
Argh, so frustrating...

269
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,000
Alright, so once you're ready we'll leave...

270
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,650
If the wind got any stronger, this wig would be out

271
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,580
They always do a good job preparing every time

272
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,070
I'm going!!

273
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,580
You're going?

274
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,580
Damn straight!

275
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,750
We're going and all, but... So soon?

276
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,180
We're gonna have to get on anyway so...

277
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,420
Oh! He went!

278
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,790
Absolutely No Laughing Enthusiastic Teacher 24 Hours

279
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,790
Start

280
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,220
Right now, only Yamazaki will get punished if we laugh...

281
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,140
If I laugh... it'll be totally fine...

282
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,330
See, he laughed!

283
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,120
Hey! Why aren't you guys on board!?

284
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,630
We're not on yet... They're here!

285
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,840
Only Yamazaki is obeyed to the rules...

286
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,910
He saw Hamada laughing
from inside the bus...

287
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,170
Ow! Ow!

288
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,250
4th Rule:

289
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,250
Spankings delivered by the black army unit

290
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,150
Japan's first victim

291
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,220
They came this year too...

292
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,150
Hamada you should get on first!

293
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:21,690
I don't want to look down at you from above...

294
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,690
Hamada, please go first...

295
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,690
Yeah...

296
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,090
So Yamazaki and Hamada get on then...

297
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,110
Yamazaki, Hamada get on...

298
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,100
Noo!

299
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,430
Look at him while he gets on...

300
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,340
Why do I have to look at him when he gets on?

301
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,070
I don't want to watch as he gets on...

302
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,710
Please watch over him as he boards!!!

303
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,510
Otherwise he won't get on...

304
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,250
Change Hamada's wig!!!

305
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,180
Let's get on, get on... get on...

306
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,200
Ok, we're finally starting...

307
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,720
Is it ok if I sit here?

308
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,230
Once we're like this, he can
get by without looking at Hamada...

309
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,800
Ok, I'm not going to laugh!

310
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:20,780
At last, the bus departs for kurobikari school, and then the unimaginable...

311
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,390
You don't have anything applied to your face don't you, Hamada?

312
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,390
Did you apply anything while you were in the changing box?

313
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,430
Did you apply something like tsubaki oil?

314
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,100
I didn't apply anything...

315
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,570
You're trying so hard not to laugh...

316
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:42,610
Laughter will not be forgiven

317
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:42,400
The tension from laughter becoming prohibited slowly fills the bus

318
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:49,750
Before long, their comradery will fall to pieces and turn against each other...

319
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,660
If people don't know about Hamada's wig when they get on...
it will be hard for them not to laugh...

320
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,620
If people don't know about Hamada's wig when they get on...
it will be hard for them not to laugh...

321
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,580
Yeah, I agree

322
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,530
If all Japanese wore wigs like these

323
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:11,020
we probably could win a war...

324
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,090
What prompted you to say that?

325
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,360
There's no point in saying random stuff like that!!

326
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,580
If we everyone tried this out...We'd definitely win

327
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:23,150
Hamada's hairdo already portrayed as a weapon of mass destruction

328
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,150
We'd win right? I'm already getting the will to fight

329
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,880
We'd win and all, but...

330
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,190
I hate getting called out for this...

331
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,160
Aaah, ow ow...

332
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,490
We're going to start this again...

333
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,330
I'm going to cut it out...

334
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,110
Let's please stop this...

335
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,030
Messing with Hamada is not worth it...

336
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,360
Just ignore it

337
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,100
Yet, I keep getting the urge to tease him since he keeps facing this way...

338
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,710
I was only looking over there for a moment...

339
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,140
Oh no, I said something I shouldn't have...

340
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:55,710
5 minutes elapsed since starting

341
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,640
Just stop from here

342
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,580
Just another bit I want to say though...

343
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,750
I said something unnecessary. I said something really unnecessary there

344
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,650
Arrival at bus stop

345
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:11,130
Arrival at bus stop

346
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,540
You're kidding, already!?

347
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,570
Wait up!

348
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:20,900
Band Manager


Touno Nagiko

349
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:20,900
Band Singer


Himura Yuuki (Banana Man)

350
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,100
I said wait!

351
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,140
Give it up, I'm breaking up with you!

352
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,060
Wait a second, what are you saying!?

353
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,110
I can't do this anymore!

354
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,050
Just wait though, we've got a big gig coming up...

355
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:31,510
Relationship troubles, talk of breaking up

356
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,510
There it is again!

357
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,400
What is it?

358
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,600
"Gig this, Gig that" Are gigs more important than me!?

359
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,510
"Gig this, Gig that" Are gigs more important than me!?

360
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,620
Of all the people who'd understand the significance of this gig...

361
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,490
It would be a crisis for our fans!...

362
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,490
you, as the manger, would know best...

363
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,090
Pick one then, gigs or me!

364
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,690
I don't know what's going on in your head!!

365
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,090
Then just ask!

366
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,500
I...love you!

367
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,440
I...love you!

368
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,050
Don't force that viewpoint on them...

369
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:11,350
Something has started to develop between the two...

370
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,050
You get what I mean, right?

371
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,200
Too long, too long...

372
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,970
That was really long...

373
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,540
This was too much...

374
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,510
They didn't even kiss either!

375
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,550
It's a little tight here...

376
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,070
It was right in the middle of my back...

377
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,070
That was tough Endou...

378
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,160
Nagiko, calm down...

379
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,600
Band Guitar

Itou Ichirou (ELT)

380
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,040
What keeps dragging him to this special so regularly...

381
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,620
Aa, too much!

382
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,960
What's going on? Why so silent...

383
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,590
Hey, nightmare

384
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,390
Why're you here?

385
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,720
What 's up with this?

386
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Two-Timing between band members exposed

387
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,780
I'm sorry, I've been going out with Jade too...

388
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,770
Two timing?

389
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,550
I'm so sorry

390
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,740
You're two timing?

391
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,440
He's not projecting himself...

392
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,050
It's clashing with his look

393
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,980
If you're going to show up on TV, I'd prefer it if you projected a bit more...

394
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,220
Say it clearly!

395
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,260
This one's gonna be tough...

396
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,560
It'll be a challenge...

397
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,200
I can't decide between Jade or Nightmare

398
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,340
I'm going to leave since I'm in the way of both of you...

399
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,170
Hold it, that doesn't matter...

400
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,660
Hold it, that doesn't matter...

401
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,640
I'm, seriously loving you

402
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,820
Seriously Loving you?

403
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:30,390
They've lost all interest in their performance...

404
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Seriously Loving you?

405
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,060
So what was hamada saying about me just now...

406
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,010
No, it wasn't about you...

407
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,080
Nagiko, what're we gonna do?

408
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,050
I just want you to express your true love for me...

409
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,890
Display her your true love

410
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,890
Nagiko's Demands

411
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,630
A long time ago we went to a traditional massage therapist...

412
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,680
I want to reminisce with your suctioned nipples

413
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:08,860
Reminiscing with Jade

414
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,860
Suction Tits

415
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,550
Why would you prepare for something like this?

416
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,300
They became sooo big!

417
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,070
This one too!

418
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,580
Why such a disregard for your own band?

419
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,480
You've got a live show after this...

420
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,180
No it's a gig...

421
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:43,370
The two reminisce about the good times by themselves

422
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,560
What's up with this!?

423
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,950
If you don't take those off...

424
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,590
She doesn't know how to take it off right...

425
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,400
That's really gotta hurt

426
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,550
He's panicking a little bit...

427
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,900
Too rough, too rough

428
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,260
If you don't take it off by the grip on front...

429
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,510
Are you satisfied with this?

430
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,140
Then WHAT?!

431
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,140
Not yet!!

432
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,840
We still need to reminisce about the time on a mountain in Ibaraki...

433
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,780
where you expressed your love for me by letting a stag beetle bite your nose

434
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,550
Nagiko, you've had enough...

435
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,450
Are you going to do this!?

436
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,050
You love me, right?

437
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,320
NIGHTMARE! You got the guts for this!?

438
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,720
Reminiscing with Nightmare

439
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,720
Stag Nose

440
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,100
You mean me?

441
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:03,010
Haven't we gotten just a little bit off topic?

442
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,110
Man, I want to go to this live show of theirs...

443
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,850
I've really come to like them...

444
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,920
Nightmare's so awesome!

445
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,590
Nightmare's crying!

446
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,190
Not the lips...

447
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,530
Not his lips

448
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,440
He said "Not my lips"

449
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,580
We gotta get going for the gig!

450
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,340
Yeah!

451
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,050
Let's Go!

452
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,160
Ah,

453
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,160
that was...

454
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,560
They got us hit a lot...

455
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,550
The really hit us a lot!

456
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,550
They really did...

457
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,200
With so much aimed at my back...

458
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,670
A mere 20 minutes from starting

459
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:10,010
The five suffer a rush of non-stop spankage!

460
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,550
Ever more funnier challenges await them ahead

461
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,520
and sure enough...

462
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:26,660
Arrival at bus stop

463
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,160
I'm sick of this shit

464
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,170
So fed up...

465
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,970
(Sekine Tsutomu)

466
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,970
Movie Critic

467
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,970
Osugi

468
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,670
I loathe being mistaken for piko (his twin clothing critic brother)

469
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,900
Just really, recently it's...

470
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,370
I'm not even wearing pink

471
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,370
and yet I'm asked "Are you Mr. Pako?

472
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,040
Isn't that Tanaka?

473
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,950
What are you doing in a place like this?

474
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,350
It's kokoriko's

475
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,350
Tanaka!

476
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,460
No good, I'm hopeless here...

477
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,460
To stumble upon him in a place like this...

478
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,030
A place like, he he he...

479
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,520
Kokoroki's Tanaka

480
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,020
Ah crap, noo, this'll be trouble

481
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,070
You are Tanaka, right?

482
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,070
Yes...

483
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,040
Darling, I've seen your movie!

484
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,840
By Osugi

485
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,820
"Minna no Ie" (Everyone's House) written and directed by Mitani Kouki

486
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:22,880
I was really moved! Mitani's world  is full of emotion and laughter as

487
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,880
Kokoriko's Tanaka Naoki stars in this enthusiastic performance

488
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,690
Kannu Film Festival was brought to tears, an absolute must see

489
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,000
Those who don't watch will be trampled

490
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:41,100
Introduces all five by narration of their stage appearance

491
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,040
Oh! My dear Matumoto is here too!

492
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,570
Darling, I watched your movie too!

493
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,120
By Osugi

494
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,540
"Scabbard Samurai" Directed by Matsumoto Hitoshi

495
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,210
A truly splendid creation

496
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,680
This ultimate parent-child affection story will send you spinning with laughter and emotion

497
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,260
While it is plausible this parent-child affection is purely theatrical,

498
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,290
what's really amazing is director Matumoto Hitoshi's

499
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,130
personal endeavors as a doting parent

500
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,700
and above all else

501
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,900
he remains to be just an old man

502
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,000
just an old man with a bottomless pit of retirement money

503
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:17,510
Those who don't come see this affectionate style will be trampled

504
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,050
Tanaka, you can do better than that!

505
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,050
You can do better, Tanaka

506
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,590
Wha? Hamada's here too?

507
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,550
My dear, I've seen your movie too!

508
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,860
That's freaking old!

509
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,060
Released in 1991 Nihonkai
(The Sea of Japan)

510
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,080
Why'd you press the "stop request" button?

511
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,080
By Osugi

512
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,720
"Nihonkai" Starring Hamada Masatoshi

513
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,120
This is a very shocking tale, and if you ask why

514
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,430
The star, Hamada Masatoshi, does a splendid job of portraying the dark yakuza world and yet...

515
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:15,160
I can't get over the fact he looks like a gorilla

516
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:22,070
Breaking promises or shooting guns, no matter what he does he's a gorilla! A child-faced gorilla!

517
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:27,410
Whatever he's doing he's still a gorilla! Even though its a yakuza film, it's become an animal film!

518
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:32,550
Anyone who doesn't watch this gorilla flick will be trampled!!

519
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,120
A gorilla movie... huh...

520
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,040
That's scathing

521
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,520
Harsh!

522
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,800
Yamazaki, you aren't in any movies are you?

523
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,080
Yeah... well, about movies...

524
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,540
I used to do some V-Cinema (direct to video) shoots...

525
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
What'd you appear in?

526
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,700
Pappakapa

527
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,550
Pappakapa?

528
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,550
Don't show up in such odd films!

529
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,070
Don't show up in such odd films!

530
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,070
Such a ridiculous title...

531
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,070
It's horse racing, right?

532
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,070
Just the way he said it...

533
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,560
Let alone Osugi's reaction...

534
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,290
Weren't you in some dramas then too?

535
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,600
Yeah...

536
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,600
What dramas?

537
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,900
Pokkapoka

538
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,520
I'd swear they're the same thing...

539
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:30,100
Pokkapoka

540
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,060
Enough of this...

541
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,510
Don't show up in things with funny names!

542
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,030
Tough

543
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,920
Endo!? Endo's here too...

544
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,780
Endo!? Endo's here too...

545
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:49,520
Endo, my dear, I've seen your movie too

546
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,160
By Osugi

547
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,100
Endou Appears in "Minna no Ie" (Everybody's House)

548
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:02,270
Anyways, Endou's bartering skills must be a work of art

549
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,410
To this day he reads from the script without emotion

550
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,880
and brags about what he can hook in

551
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,480
Which is why since said film Mitani has largely ignored Endou

552
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,120
I'm just gonna trample over him

553
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,550
I was only playing a martian in that film...

554
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:31,070
"Minna no Ie" (Everyone's House)

555
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:31,070
Endou's Scene

556
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,530
I was only on-screen for like 3 seconds...

557
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,520
Everyone's been in something these days...

558
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,200
Mr. Osugi, you really know a lot about movies.

559
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,080
I'm a movie critique, that's just common sense.

560
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,920
Tada Kenji

561
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,920
Yamada Yoshi

562
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Well, everyone, it's time for our common sense warm-up, Endou Version.

563
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,520
Let's do it with just as much energy as usual!

564
00:26:52,190 --> 00:27:01,230
Common Sense Warm-up
Endo Version

565
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,220
Common Knowledge~ Common Knowldege~ Use your head, Endou

566
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,260
Common Knowledge~ Common Knowldege~ Use your head, Endou

567
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,800
Common Knowledge~ Common Knowldege~ Use your head, Endou

568
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Even though he's from Kansai, he doesn't use Kansai dialect on Lunch Time Wars

569
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,900
Even though he's from Kansai, he doesn't use Kansai dialect on Lunch Time Wars

570
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,570
Get away weirdo

571
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,030
I'm not consciously aware of that...

572
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,070
It's just so plain obvious, Endo

573
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,510
Uhm...

574
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,320
Get away dunce

575
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,540
You really did that too...

576
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,040
That's true...

577
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,850
Use your head, Endo

578
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,590
I really can't say the alphabet...

579
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:30,290
His girlfriend is Sekine's (Osugi) Former Manager...

580
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,290
Get away perv

581
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:37,560
Sorry, but in such case I'm fine if your put off by that

582
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,270
They just don't stop coming...

583
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:49,880
Last year he danced with 2700

584
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:53,910
No Laughing Airport

585
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:53,910
Sekine's Scene

586
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Yeah... yeah he did...

587
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,040
It's so hot...

588
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,750
That was a lot...

589
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,960
That was pretty funny, heh

590
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:19,470
Kurobikari school draws near!!

591
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:19,470
The drive to school draws to a close

592
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,610
We'll be arrive at the new school shortly...

593
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,050
Ah~, we've arrived!

594
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,920
We've arrived at Kurobikari School

595
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,750
That was so long

596
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,080
At last the bus carrying the five draws near enough to see the school

597
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,000
however, this isn't their goal, but merely the beginning of a new battle!

598
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,770
That was long

599
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,200
it really was

600
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:47,430
It was especially long this year

601
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,170
Alright, we're here, we're here!

602
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,740
We're here!

603
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,870
Finally here!

604
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,000
Oh my god...

605
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,510
The setting for our no laughing special...

606
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:10,660
A school where laughter comes before education.

607
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:10,660
A very tough battle will start here.

608
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,830
What is with Gaasu Inc...?

609
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:18,100
I know right... You don't see that anywhere.

610
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:24,200
Arrived at School

611
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,670
Guys, we're getting off now.

612
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
We're finally here.

613
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,380
Check it out. It's a fantastic looking school, isn't it?

614
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,380
Yes

615
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,380
Yes

616
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,980
It is.

617
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:35,720
Amazing huh?

618
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:35,720
The teachers and student's sweat and tears make this school what it is now.

619
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:37,280
Kurobikari School Building

620
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,290
Okay this way.

621
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,930
This is the entrance.

622
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,900
School Entrance

623
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:49,400
Look, it's beautiful isn't it?

624
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,900
Wow, it's amazing.

625
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,900
It's really nice.

626
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,900
That's amazing.

627
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:58,640
Main School Lobby/Corridor

628
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,970
They've even got a monitor and everything.

629
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,400
You would want to show this kind of thing off wouldn't you?

630
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:04,080
Okay everyone, the school nurse is over here...

631
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,580
She's the most beautiful teacher at this school so try not to get too excited okay?

632
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,580
Okay, let's go say hi to her.

633
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:08,350
Excuse us

634
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:13,450
Nurse's Room

635
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,220
I get the feeling something's going to happen.

636
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,190
Yeah, I agree.

637
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,460
Well it definitely won't be good for us.

638
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:20,460
Hamada, Matsumoto, Endo, Tanaka, and Yamazaki here.

639
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:24,030
Lining up to meet Miss Madonna.

640
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Hm, Sensei isn't here.. I wonder where she could be?

641
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,270
She's really beautiful, right?

642
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,670
Teacher!

643
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,870
Teacher!

644
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,140
Miss Madonna

645
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,140
Hisako Manda

646
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,330
This is Hisako speaking.

647
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:58,700
My manager went and got me a casting role,

648
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:58,700
on a New Year's special program.

649
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:08,070
But when I looked at the details of the job,

650
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:08,070
It was actually a really shitty job.

651
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,180
This is Hisako speaking.

652
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:21,120
Even though it's such a shitty job,

653
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:21,120
I only get a little bit of money from it.

654
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,890
What are you saying?!

655
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:29,200
This is Hisako...

656
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,560
What're the staff making her say?!

657
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:29,200
This is Hisako...

658
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,200
This is Hisako...

659
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,430
It's not even about being out or whatever.

660
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,510
I thought you were the nurse of the school.

661
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,180
I am Miss Manda,

662
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,180
the school nurse.

663
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,750
Fujiwara who are our trainees ?

664
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,420
They are here today to learn

665
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,420
how to be teachers.

666
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:55,790
Commence analysis of new teachers!

667
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,690
Looks like they could do a good job.

668
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,060
You,

669
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,060
what's your name?

670
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,530
I'm Endo

671
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:05,670
Endo,

672
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:05,670
what do you think of the current education system?

673
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,440
Well, umm, I'm not really sure but...

674
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,440
I think they should do orders on achievements in class

675
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,580
so they work harder.

676
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,280
Hmmm,

677
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,690
Hisako speaking.

678
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:34,130
Endo... Who only got into High School to be a baseball jock,

679
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:42,240
desperately trying to show himself off

680
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:42,240
as a knowledgable person.

681
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:51,980
Even though he tried so ever hard

682
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:51,980
with his Middle School exams.

683
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,850
He only managed

684
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,850
to be second to last in his class.

685
00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:01,190
As soon as he got his results

686
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,190
he called the testing staff

687
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:11,260
And asked

688
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:11,260
"Can you do anything to raise my class rank?"

689
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,230
Matsumoto says "you are the worst..."

690
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:17,640
Just an idiot...

691
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:18,640
Just an idiot...

692
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:17,640
What an idiot...

693
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:18,640
What an idiot...

694
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,640
Just a bloody idiot.

695
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:18,640
Just a bloody idiot.

696
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,880
Wait, hold on a second.

697
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,080
You are really well informed.

698
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,450
Obviously you can't do that.

699
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,990
Everyone, it's so scary.

700
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,850
Can't believe she did that.

701
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,490
And your name is?

702
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,360
I'm Tanaka

703
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,200
Tanaka,

704
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,200
how do you get to work?

705
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,600
I drive.

706
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,670
Hmmm...

707
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:54,640
Last year,

708
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,640
even after being abused so much about it

709
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:02,450
Tanaka still drives a

710
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:02,450
20 year old used Volvo

711
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,590
The car he drove before that was a

712
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,590
used Saab.

713
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:13,930
On top of that,

714
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:13,930
the car he bought for his wife

715
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:21,670
was again, not a new, but a used Volkswagen

716
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:32,580
Many people before him have used these cars.

717
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:32,580
What a strange habit to have.

718
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:40,190
He's just used...

719
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:41,190
He's just used...

720
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:40,190
used...

721
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:41,190
used...

722
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,120
What she mean 'weird habit!?'

723
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,190
a used comedian.

724
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,190
a used comedian.

725
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,960
I like riding them

726
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,070
So much knowledge about us

727
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:53,700
She has so much inside knowledge about us

728
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,340
Scary.. Manda Sensei is really scary...

729
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,840
And... what's your name?

730
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,170
I'm Hamada

731
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,380
Tell me,

732
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,380
how do you usually dress?

733
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:12,020
Well usually I just wear jeans and a casual shirt.

734
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,120
Amazing she doesn't laugh at him here

735
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:16,790
Hmmm....

736
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,030
Hisako here.

737
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:31,470
This man, who was a fashion leader once of a shitty little company called HAMADAA!

738
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:45,120
Now wears a weird perm,

739
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:45,120
which have hair resembling pubes

740
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:53,060
So ugly...

741
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:54,060
So ugly...

742
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:54,060
So ugly...

743
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:53,060
So ugly...

744
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:53,060
He's just an ugly comedian...

745
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:54,060
He's just an ugly comedian...

746
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,100
Manda-sensei, let's stop here, please!

747
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,640
So mean.. isn't she!?

748
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,010
Moving on...

749
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,010
what's your name?

750
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,980
I'm Matsumoto

751
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,550
You have a really good body.

752
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,550
Do you work out a lot?

753
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:20,420
No.. I just go to the gym every now and then.

754
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Really?

755
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,060
Hmmm...

756
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,000
Hisako here.

757
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:40,340
A long time ago,

758
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:40,340
I heard a story that, Matsumoto

759
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,340
was told by one of his juniors that

760
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:45,080
if he had muscles, the public wouldn't find him funny anymore due to his stature

761
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:55,590
But now, he has a body like

762
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,590
Chuck Wilson (Number 1 Body Builder in Japan)

763
00:36:55,590 --> 00:37:04,530
He even wears tight tops now. Even when wearing a

764
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,530
Hanes top. He's an M size.

765
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:11,570
He's M size...

766
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:12,600
He's M size...

767
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,570
He's M size...

768
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:12,600
He's M size...

769
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,570
He's M size.

770
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:12,600
He's M size.

771
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,950
I'm sorry for making you wait, Yamazaki.

772
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,620
Now it's your go.

773
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,290
I heard you moved houses lately, am I correct?

774
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,160
Yes you're right, I moved to Osaka.

775
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,630
Hmmm....

776
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,040
Hisako here.

777
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:50,310
Even though none of his jokes are funny,

778
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,310
Yamazaki, who lives just as glamorously as other celebs,

779
00:37:51,110 --> 00:38:01,490
has mistakenly thought he's funnier now

780
00:37:54,980 --> 00:38:01,490
with his comedic storytelling

781
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:06,630
He said he wanted to study at University

782
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,630
and then quit straight away.

783
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,930
And even at one point said he only wore suits to look good,

784
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:18,640
and then comes to work casually in denim

785
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:25,010
At any rate, I'm sure he will quit comic narration too.

786
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:32,050
He's all talk,

787
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:33,090
He's all talk,

788
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,050
he's disgusting,

789
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,090
he's disgusting,

790
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,050
he's just a dirty stain.

791
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,090
he's just a dirty stain.

792
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,590
She's absolutely ridiculous.

793
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,430
Everyone got destroyed!

794
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:51,670
From here on, please don't be an embarrassment to the school please, okay?

795
00:38:51,640 --> 00:39:00,280
End of analysing teachers.

796
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,940
Thank you

797
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,940
Thank you

798
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,940
Thank you so much

799
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,140
Good luck!

800
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,410
First of all, you all need to cut your hair huh?

801
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:07,390
She's really beautiful huh?

802
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:07,390
Well yeah, she was beautiful but...

803
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,390
She was meant to be Hiroshi right?

804
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Are there still more people to meet?

805
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,730
Right guys, now we are going to go say hello to the headmaster.

806
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,830
Headmaster?!

807
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,830
Headmaster?!

808
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:21,570
He's the man in charge of this school, so don't be rude to him okay?

809
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,970
Excuse us.

810
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:30,010
Headmaster's Office

811
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,640
Man I'm so scared.

812
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,670
Can we sit down?

813
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,680
Oh, let's stand and wait.

814
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,650
Do we line up in the same order?

815
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,650
Yep, same as before.

816
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:40,690
Meeting the headmaster

817
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,820
I wonder where he is?

818
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,820
He isn't here.

819
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,920
Headmaster!

820
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,590
Headmaster!

821
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,470
Headmaster of School

822
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,470
Takenaka Naoto

823
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,640
I wonder where he is?

824
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,640
He isn't here.

825
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,610
Headmaster!

826
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,010
Headmaster!

827
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,360
Headmaster of School

828
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,360
Takenaka Naoto

829
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:18,360
Here I am! Here I am! Here  I am!

830
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,110
Is this school actually normal?!

831
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,280
WHAT DO YOU THINK?!

832
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:45,020
Headmaster's Special Interview

833
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,850
What's with that?

834
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,850
What's your problem!?

835
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,820
I mean come on! If he doesn't stop, I'm going to laugh every time!

836
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,860
Yeah, you're right.

837
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,490
No way!

838
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:52,760
No way!

839
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,060
No way!

840
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,060
Headmaster!

841
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,060
Headmaster!

842
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,600
WHAT'S THE ANSWER?!

843
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,840
This isn't right. This can't be right.

844
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,310
It's not possible to NOT laugh!

845
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,850
He's just so energetic the whole time!

846
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:21,090
WHAT IS IT?!

847
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,860
I would laugh at this forever.

848
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,830
Headmaster?

849
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:33,160
What the hell are you trying to say?!

850
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:38,440
Can you please translate

851
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,440
what he's saying?

852
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,940
Hello, I am

853
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,910
Tarzan.

854
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,110
I eat... Raw meat

855
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,710
HERE, HAVE THIS!

856
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:50,720
Headmaster's unique welcoming gifts

857
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:49,850
HERE YOU GO!

858
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,820
HERE YOU GO!

859
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,850
AND HERE YOU GO!

860
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,960
THIS IS FROM MY DAYS IN HIGH SCHOOL

861
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,200
MY CLASSMATE, TARO SHIMONEGA'S SHOE.

862
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,870
SNIFF, SNIFF, SNIFF IT PLEASE~!

863
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
Damn it, I thought I didn't laugh!

864
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,880
I thought I managed to hold it in.

865
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,120
I guess I will go to my desk

866
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,450
AND SIT DOWN!

867
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,320
That's your desk?

868
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,160
I know it's not my desk, you dumbass!

869
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,870
Don't mess with me, you fool!

870
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,870
He's smiling while being angry...

871
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,840
He's having so much fun.

872
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,850
Okay everyone!

873
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,320
SIT DOWN!

874
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:59,320
SIT DOWN!

875
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,320
SIT

876
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,320
DOWN!

877
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,320
SIT

878
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,320
DOWN!

879
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,820
And...

880
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,550
Oh... Sensei?

881
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,860
Sir?

882
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,290
Headmaster?

883
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,860
OWWW!!

884
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,860
MY KNEE HURTS SO MUCH!

885
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:19,900
That hurts like a bitch if that happens to you.

886
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,840
That really hurts.

887
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,480
That was really painful!

888
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,250
From here, for a long...

889
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,250
LONG time, we are going to...

890
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:32,850
Are you okay headmaster?

891
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,820
Well of course that's going to happen to you if you're that energetic...

892
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:38,390
Faints from being too hyper.

893
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,850
Has he gone to sleep?

894
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,660
Oh no! The headmaster!

895
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,160
Somebody help! Somebody!

896
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:50,740
Headmaster be rushed to hospital by stretcher.

897
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,870
Is he okay?

898
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,870
No way, he's definitely going to die.

899
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:54,840
You know the principal's facing downwards?

900
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,870
Usually you face upwards...

901
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,870
Yeah usually..

902
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,880
It's pretty dangerous...

903
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,650
But is everything going to be okay? With the headmaster like that...

904
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:03,850
It should be fine.

905
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,650
Man, he was so energetic.

906
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:10,650
Can you be anymore energetic?

907
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,090
Seriously, we haven't seen anyone sane yet.

908
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:22,670
Guys, this is the staff room for newly appointed teachers.

909
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,870
Finally, we're here.

910
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,870
Finally, the staff room!

911
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,540
Finally. Takes so long just to get to here.

912
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,840
Okay everyone, come in.

913
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,880
We finally made it here.

914
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:38,920
New Trainees Room

915
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,850
This is the staff room where you guys will be resting.

916
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:36,850
So if you could just sit at the desks with your names on it.

917
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:38,850
That's where you're going to be sitting today.

918
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,820
Okay.

919
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,760
I'm really thirsty.

920
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,760
Yeah, me too

921
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:54,670
An hour and forty-five minutes from the beginning

922
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:53,860
A time dedicated for the members who fight the temptation of laughter to rest.

923
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:58,870
But... They cannot afford to be off-guard.

924
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,500
Carelessness  forbidden

925
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:05,510
Frame in the back to fall out.

926
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,710
Oh man, it's so tough...

927
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:06,780
*BUMP*

928
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:09,150
*BUMP*

929
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:13,480
Would that ever happen?

930
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,890
Ow! What the hell man?!

931
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,860
Surely this isn't right?!

932
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,060
There are even these kind of traps!

933
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:25,630
Come on man, this is just hurting me for fun!

934
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,800
I mean this kind of thing...

935
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,840
All I did was get a piece of cake!

936
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:37,710
Eraser to fly out.

937
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:38,880
On top of that, it really hurt a lot.

938
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,220
Tanaka, you get scared way too easily!

939
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,860
You're kidding me...

940
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,730
This is freaky man.

941
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,730
I'm starting to get scared.

942
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:01,400
Come on,

943
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:01,400
make this our little safety zone.

944
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:02,570
I agree. It should be that.

945
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:06,240
No need to tear us apart more..

946
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:13,410
The members struggle against the traps of laughter

947
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:13,410
Two hours in

948
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,180
After this.

949
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,250
The desk drawers await to be opened by the members.

950
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,920
So, we've started now and

951
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,820
Manda was amazing, huh?

952
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,820
Oh yeah, she was

953
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:31,230
Hisako Manda

954
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:24,890
Acting as Hiroshi.

955
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,860
She memorized the whole act perfectly too.

956
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,860
And what's really amazing is that those guys...

957
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,230
It was the first time they saw Hamada.

958
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,000
Yeah, you're right.

959
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:33,830
Well him with his wig.

960
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,800
Hamada's wig.

961
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,870
And they didn't just break down laughing at him.

962
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,840
They're so calm, aren't they?

963
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,340
When you think about it, Takenaka was ridiculous, huh?

964
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:48,780
Headmaster of School

965
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,810
Oh, the headmaster!

966
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,880
That was a really long part too.

967
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,880
Yeah, he used so much energy there.

968
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:50,850
Okay, shall we go to the next clip?

969
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,250
Let's go.

970
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,150
Okay Matsumoto. Do your thing.

971
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,120
VTR!

972
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,350
V

973
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,350
T

974
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:57,350
R

975
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,350
!!

976
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,160
Two hours in,

977
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:05,760
The mystery contents of the drawers await.

978
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,870
So, what are we going to do?

979
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:13,240
About the drawers and stuff.

980
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,940
You're right... The one we do every year?

981
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,280
I really...

982
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,720
just want to

983
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:25,720
rest for a while.

984
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,920
Same. We only just got in.

985
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:40,660
Oi man, that face you make...

986
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,470
It's like the face when you're reminiscing about something.

987
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:44,130
I was really shocked.

988
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:47,840
If I get

989
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:47,840
called OUT for this,

990
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,840
I am going to be screwed by the end.

991
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:54,040
You said the same thing last year too 'If I get called OUT for that..'

992
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,020
Oi, he's been smiling

993
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,020
for a while now

994
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,690
but isn't getting called OUT at all!

995
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:05,560
Oh come on, let's not start the whole 'He's laughing..'

996
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:09,360
Frame in the back to fall out..

997
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:07,560
No no, Seriously.

998
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,560
No no no, I agree, Hamada let's not...

999
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:11,500
*BUMP*

1000
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:14,700
*BUMP*

1001
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:17,470
*BUMP*

1002
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,540
What the hell man! What the hell is wrong with you!

1003
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,570
What the hell man!?

1004
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:27,310
It's chaos.

1005
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,920
I mean seriously Tanaka,

1006
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,850
when everyone is concentrating on over here...

1007
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,020
Can you not like be falling over by yourself over there?

1008
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,890
What did you do even?

1009
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:39,560
Sorry, I hit my leg on the...

1010
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,030
I was thinking "I'm sure Hamada

1011
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,030
was laughing there..."

1012
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,290
Yeah you're right, he was laughing.

1013
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:47,000
No no no, we all laughed together and then I got hit.

1014
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,700
After that, right?

1015
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,770
When Matsumoto said "Don't be falling over by yourself

1016
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:51,770
over there"

1017
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:54,740
He was like... KUU KAAW

1018
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:04,550
Come on man! Is that allowed?!

1019
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,560
But you really do

1020
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,560
have that kind of laugh...

1021
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:26,970
What the heck man?!

1022
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,410
If you're going to spell it, do it smoothly and quickly please!

1023
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,250
Please stop that laugh like a bird from the south...

1024
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,180
The ones that live in the subtropics.

1025
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,020
The ones that go 'KU-KAW!'

1026
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,120
The ones that live there are really beautiful, aren't they...?

1027
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,460
The feathers and stuff...

1028
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:54,900
Hamada, please try harder not to laugh!

1029
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,970
Just change the subject!

1030
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,970
It wasn't even meant to be funny or anything!

1031
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:59,770
Yeah, seriously guys!

1032
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:06,780
It's because you're saying unnecessary things though!
It would be better if you would just keep your mouth shut.

1033
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,410
Yeah, none of that Endo.

1034
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,410
Yeah you're right, let's stop that kind of thing..

1035
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:12,180
Yeah we should stop talking about Hamada...

1036
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:14,150
Yeah, I prefer if you stop talking about me.

1037
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,390
There's a DVD player again this year...

1038
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,320
Oh crap... Inside the desks...

1039
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,560
I'm not really worried

1040
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,560
about the DVD player...

1041
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,560
No, to be honest I'm not worried either.

1042
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,630
Endo, you look like Waraimeshi..

1043
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:29,300
Waraimeshi Nishida

1044
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,300
Nishida, huh?

1045
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,370
Isn't there another style for Hamada?

1046
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:36,070
Can you just try something? With our hair, we can do this..

1047
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,770
What would it look like if you do it?

1048
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,510
I don't think with mine, I can't really do anything different...

1049
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,890
Can you not let down a bit of the left hand side please?! Please?

1050
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,990
Don't talk about him anymore... Just ignore him...

1051
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,990
Seriously!

1052
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:02,730
That's just who he is, just leave him.

1053
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:07,500
It's so unfair, it is the whole time.

1054
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,500
I know...

1055
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:14,040
You look like Koshino Junko.

1056
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,590
I hate this guy! Just throw him out already!

1057
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,750
How many hits do we have to take because of him!

1058
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:24,890
No seriously...

1059
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,890
I won't get used to it...

1060
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,890
Throw him out!

1061
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:28,890
I won't ever get used to it, seriously!

1062
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,890
No seriously, we are in trouble!

1063
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:33,900
Let's stop, please!

1064
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,900
He can't see what he's doing.

1065
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:38,740
It's just endless

1066
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:42,910
It's his hair.. I just can't stop laughing at that hair of his.

1067
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:45,880
And it's not like he's laughing or anything..

1068
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:48,080
Yeah because he can't see himself...
He's just sitting there silently..

1069
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:53,320
What is this feeling...?

1070
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,120
Oh my god, please.. wait...

1071
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:57,890
Enough, seriously... Enough.

1072
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:59,890
Hang on a second...

1073
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,590
It's the whole time!

1074
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:06,730
Okay fine, let's open the draws then

1075
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,700
Do we have to...?

1076
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:08,300
Well yeah, let's focus on something else...

1077
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,470
Shall we change the subjects from hairstyles?

1078
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:14,740
Yeah, we talk too much about Hamada...

1079
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:15,910
Yeah, we'll be here forever.

1080
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,910
That's why we should do the draws.

1081
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,110
Well who's going to start?

1082
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:22,880
Usually I'm first..

1083
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,880
That's why someone else should go

1084
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:26,020
Shall I go first then...?

1085
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,880
We're going to start with Tanaka then..

1086
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:32,790
First up is Tanaka.

1087
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:30,890
One of the drawers is really wide...

1088
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:31,450
I know right?

1089
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:34,460
I'm opening it....

1090
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,460
That's the most worrying one...

1091
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:39,960
Oh!

1092
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:40,900
Nothing?

1093
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,970
Nothing.

1094
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,970
There's nothing in here.

1095
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,370
So just the side draws left...?

1096
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,880
See? I told you.. I told you.!

1097
00:52:54,680 --> 00:53:01,420
Mystery DVD

1098
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:55,880
There it is...

1099
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,880
Just one DVD?

1100
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:59,950
Yeah, there is just one..

1101
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,350
No nothing here..

1102
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,820
Oh, this year there's only one...

1103
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,700
Mine only had one DVD.

1104
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,700
Tanaka, there's something underneath your desk... What is it?

1105
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,100
Oh yeah, there is.

1106
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,100
What is that..?

1107
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:26,580
It's an insole...

1108
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:30,150
Someone's insole.

1109
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,080
It's not that funny...

1110
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:35,720
Wait.. Hasn't someone forgotten to take it...?

1111
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,590
It stinks!

1112
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:42,060
It stinks!

1113
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,390
What the hell was that about?

1114
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:48,900
What are you doing?!

1115
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,170
Don't throw it towards Hamada!

1116
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:53,570
Does it actually stink?

1117
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:59,780
The insole smells awful.

1118
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:57,370
I'm really sorry.

1119
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,380
I'm really sorry about just now.

1120
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,080
Oh my god, you're right, it really stinks

1121
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:08,350
Tanaka, get a tissue and wrap it. We need to bin it

1122
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:09,450
Man, it stinks!

1123
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,920
I guess tissue will do

1124
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,660
Everything has just been put here to piss us off!

1125
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,090
We can't relax at all.

1126
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:22,460
This insole had been worn for 3 months straight by the assistant director and never washed.

1127
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:19,090
What, he didn't use any sprays to clean it or anything?!

1128
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,100
That's disgusting!

1129
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,200
How rude is it that after realising it stank, he threw it at Hamada?

1130
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,100
I know right?

1131
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,570
Man, it stinks...

1132
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,410
Isn't it better you stick it in a plastic bag or something?

1133
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:33,410
Yeah, you're right.. the smell is just...

1134
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:35,410
Are there any zipped plastic bags?..

1135
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:37,410
I'm so scared to like meddle with the things..

1136
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:38,880
How about this?

1137
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,420
Oh, but hold on. There's something in this..

1138
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:45,920
There's something in here.

1139
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,420
Oh, this looks like it stinks too.

1140
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:51,330
And it's really freaky, this doesn't shut.

1141
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:02,670
What are you talking about? It shuts just fine!

1142
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:09,580
We over thought the situation. There was nothing about it in the first place.

1143
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:15,720
Let's just hurry up and throw that away!

1144
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,720
Just throw it out like that

1145
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,020
Oh, thank you for holding the bag.

1146
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,820
Go on, smell it once.

1147
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:24,090
No, no, no way, this stinks.

1148
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:24,090
No come on, just once.

1149
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,230
Yuck!

1150
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:30,930
That STINKS!

1151
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,970
Hamada loves reactions to smells and stuff

1152
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,210
Come on let's just stop now

1153
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,650
Ow ow ow ow, it hurts

1154
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,220
It really really hurts

1155
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,590
Go throw it... what?

1156
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,220
No seriously, sniff it

1157
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,220
Why would I want to?

1158
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,560
Look, just throw it away.

1159
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:58,560
Can I throw it away?

1160
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,530
Please just sniff it once.

1161
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,730
Yeah it really stinks.

1162
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:04,970
No, I think I will throw it...

1163
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:07,000
No, then give it to Matsumoto

1164
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,370
Oh no, I'm not good for that.

1165
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,740
What?

1166
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:12,310
I'm just not good for that.

1167
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,940
I've told the school nurse about it too

1168
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:31,730
Did you throw it out, Endo?

1169
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:32,430
Yeah.

1170
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,430
No seriously, we're getting hit loads this year.

1171
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:35,260
Wow, that does smell bad

1172
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,100
And also, don't make this frame fall on our
heads everytime we're around here, seriously.

1173
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:40,640
Yamazaki, do you wanna open your drawers...?

1174
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:39,070
Yeah, okay.

1175
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:40,640
Oh yeah, the desks, the desks.

1176
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:43,410
Nothing

1177
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:45,010
Nothing there

1178
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,310
There might not be much this year.

1179
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:49,310
Oh?

1180
00:56:49,310 --> 00:57:05,830
Scratching Card

1181
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:55,020
Scratch card? Wow...

1182
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,890
You might win something if you do it..

1183
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:59,820
Geez your voice went weird there!

1184
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:14,040
Yes, I managed to hold in my laugh!

1185
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,810
Just don't bother saying those kind of things!

1186
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:18,810
Yosh Yosh Yosh Yosh!!

1187
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:27,350
Scratching Card

1188
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:23,710
This is a special kind of a scratch card, look

1189
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:26,010
Hold on, let me check the other drawers.

1190
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:31,050
Weird, that's it

1191
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,050
Nothing below

1192
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:35,590
So just a scratch card..

1193
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:36,220
You want to do it now?

1194
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:36,930
Why don't you?

1195
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:40,330
Does everyone want me to do it before we open all the draws up?

1196
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:44,870
Scratching Card

1197
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:43,200
So you scratch 1 box from A and one box from B?

1198
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,830
And you can win a prize apparently.

1199
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:50,210
This scratch card, which came out of the Yamazaki's drawer.

1200
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:56,210
Let's you choose one box from A and one box from B

1201
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:04,390
If you get two of the same, you get 50,000 Yen. If you get a combination (Downtown/Cocorico) you get 10,000 Yen.

1202
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,420
Okay, here I go.

1203
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,620
I'm going to go for the one in the middle.

1204
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,930
So for A, you're taking the middle one.

1205
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,930
Yeah, for A, the middle box.

1206
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:12,230
Put the scratch card straight.

1207
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:15,230
Who is that?

1208
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,570
Is that Housei?

1209
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,570
I can't see yet.

1210
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,670
Oh yeah, it is Yamazaki,

1211
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,210
If you get another one of you, you get 50,000 Yen

1212
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,210
If I get myself again, I get 50,000 Yen, right?

1213
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:31,980
It says Thai Kick..

1214
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,350
What?!

1215
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:34,220
That's the worst thing possible.

1216
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:36,520
THAI KICK

1217
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,220
HOLY CRAP!

1218
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:38,220
Wait wait wait!

1219
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:43,220
You can't just casually Thai-kick me as if it's nothing!

1220
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Oh my god, wait wait!!

1221
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
This person, this person!

1222
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's that person.

1223
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
This person.

1224
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,980
You should come over here!

1225
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Yeah, otherwise you're endangering yourself.

1226
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
You need to go somewhere with more space.

1227
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Hold on a minute!

1228
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Oh my god, this is so scary.

1229
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Crap, crap, crap, crap...

1230
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,000
You can't do anything about that...

1231
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,100
You're the one who scratched that result...

1232
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:20,480
Wait, so this means it was just Housei-san this time who got Thai Kicked.

1233
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,000
Yeah, that is... Wait.

1234
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,810
Oh crap,

1235
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:22,810
it's not like it was just because it was him who did it!

1236
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,550
He just coincidentally scratched his own face out and got Thai Kicked!

1237
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:28,690
So any one of us could have been Thai Kicked...?

1238
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,690
Don't scratch out any more out!

1239
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:32,000
Let's hide this somewhere.

1240
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,630
I bet there are going to be more of these...

1241
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Fearful Scratch Card...

1242
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,130
What's up Yamazaki?

1243
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:43,330
Can we just...

1244
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,330
Try this one more time?

1245
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:46,600
Just scratching out B and using your face?

1246
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,840
Can we just scratch the B box out?

1247
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:48,840
Yeah, just the B box.

1248
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,180
No, there's no point doing that.

1249
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:53,180
I want to see something.

1250
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:57,720
Oh, you want to see if all of the A boxes were you?

1251
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,880
Yeah.

1252
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,580
Yeah.

1253
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,150
Oh to see if the staff...

1254
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,150
Really hates you that much?

1255
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:06,910
I'm not really that hated though.

1256
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,500
This as well as the Thai Kick... Crap…

1257
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:15,800
Yeah the Thai Kick is tough.

1258
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,800
Yeah true.

1259
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:19,470
Should we have a look

1260
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,470
at one more?

1261
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,910
How much do we get?

1262
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,760
50,000 yen

1263
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:25,640
There's one for each of us,

1264
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,640
There's enough for all 5 of us

1265
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,640
Yamazaki just had bad luck.

1266
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,650
So if by chance it's me...

1267
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,560
Yeah

1268
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:34,190
Will you do just one more?

1269
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,140
Yep.

1270
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:36,820
Endo, you do it.

1271
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,360
Okay, do it from B.

1272
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:41,210
I wonder what they have other than Thai Kick?

1273
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:42,910
Where? From here?

1274
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,380
We'll leave it to you, yeah from there.

1275
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:48,420
Thai Kick. . .

1276
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:53,970
THAI KICK

1277
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,120
It's not me?

1278
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:55,710
Just a second!

1279
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,680
No, NO!

1280
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,250
It's not me!

1281
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,280
This has gotta be a mistake right?

1282
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,800
Cause they said "Yamazaki, Thai Kick!"

1283
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:09,220
So that's Koskei-san! Crap, crap!

1284
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,720
Wait!!

1285
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:13,720
Not me!

1286
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,230
OWWWWW!

1287
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,810
It hurts so much.

1288
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:26,440
So B is just Thai Kick?

1289
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:30,310
And A is only Hosei-san?

1290
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:32,000
Shall we try it once more?

1291
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:34,980
It hurts so much...

1292
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,210
Again... crap.

1293
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:43,470
It does hurt!

1294
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:46,310
Yes it does.

1295
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:51,460
Stop complaining so much!

1296
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:52,800
But it hurts...

1297
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:56,100
Okay, okay, so then how about we do it from A?

1298
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:59,800
But B is always going to be Thai Kick.

1299
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,710
But A could be someone else?

1300
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:03,690
Yeah, it could be.

1301
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:06,610
No... Let's not...

1302
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:08,910
I can't take it anymore.

1303
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:11,550
Yeah that second kick looked rough.

1304
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:16,850
That second Thai Kick,

1305
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,850
even the Taiwanese don't really get kicked like that.

1306
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,130
Hey,

1307
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,130
he laughed

1308
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:24,440
Yeah he did.

1309
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,140
Yeah even I could get kicked perhaps

1310
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:29,570
I've came to realize there is no point in scratching at each other...

1311
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:32,970
God I'm a good leader.

1312
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:35,810
Not even a Taiwanese would get that kind of kick huh?

1313
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:38,710
I'm going to open mine.

1314
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:38,710
You will?

1315
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:41,380
Everyone ready?

1316
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,470
You guys were really cold hearted here.

1317
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,040
That was really mean!

1318
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:58,210
That was an incredible hit!

1319
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,150
Soooo good.

1320
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,280
Look at that face!

1321
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:15,050
Quit it with

1322
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,050
this cruelness!

1323
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:18,550
Another great hit!

1324
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:25,190
I'm opening it...

1325
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,210
Go for it.

1326
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,500
Scary!

1327
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,200
Matsumoto-san be careful!

1328
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,430
Woah!!

1329
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,280
Woah! What is it?

1330
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:34,830
Mysterious Panel.

1331
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,200
It's a panel.

1332
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,350
Yes it is.

1333
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,350
Bring it up like this

1334
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,970
Let's take it out and have a look.

1335
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:44,340
Should I just flip it over?

1336
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,030
Let's flip it first then see what else is in there.

1337
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,230
We don't know what else is in there

1338
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,920
Let's get it all out first

1339
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,920
Here I go

1340
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:53,670
It's kinda scary.

1341
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:06,100
Mysterious Medal

1342
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,690
It's for that,

1343
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:02,690
the slot machine!

1344
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,310
So there's one for each of us?

1345
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,350
Huh, one each?

1346
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,180
I'll just put it here.

1347
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:07,950
Yeah.

1348
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:13,400
There was a lot in there huh?

1349
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,400
Yeah, that, and this.

1350
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:16,710
Nothing.

1351
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:19,390
So with this there's two items?

1352
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,510
Ooooh, wait a minute.

1353
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:24,610
Right then,

1354
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,610
the panel?

1355
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:24,960
I am going to flip it over.

1356
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:54,140
"My Family"

1357
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:54,140
By Matsumoto Hitoshi's Beloved Daughter

1358
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:54,140
Title:

1359
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,740
I said to stop that!

1360
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,380
This is Papa, and that's Mama.

1361
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:39,930
It's really good.

1362
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:42,350
It really looks like Papa.

1363
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:48,370
But this is really suspicious,

1364
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,370
a few days ago my wife was laughing...

1365
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:51,270
This picture that my daughter drew...

1366
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:54,140
She put it in my bed room.

1367
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:56,350
She conspired against you!

1368
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,750
Scary!

1369
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,100
Yeah a conspiracy!!

1370
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:03,950
Even my own house

1371
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:03,950
isn't safe

1372
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,950
any more!

1373
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:25,140
"Family" Drawn by

1374
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:25,140
Daughter

1375
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:25,140
Matsumoto Hitoshi's

1376
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:07,510
So this is you?

1377
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:25,140
Dada

1378
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:08,600
And this is Mama?

1379
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:25,140
Mama

1380
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,280
And this... who's this?

1381
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,110
It's like, if I became a mouse or something.

1382
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:25,140
Turned Into a Mouse

1383
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,000
It's pretty good huh?

1384
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,140
"If became a mouse."

1385
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:25,660
"If became a mouse."

1386
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,330
Another great hit.

1387
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,920
You're really

1388
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:32,920
filled with malice today.

1389
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,150
Right, I'll open mine.

1390
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:35,150
Should I go?

1391
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,540
We're going this way though.

1392
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:37,400
This way?

1393
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:40,960
Hey there's something in there!

1394
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,150
What is it?

1395
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,830
2 Mysterious Panels

1396
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,600
Again...?

1397
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,080
Is it the same pattern?

1398
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:50,950
There's nothing in here.

1399
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:55,810
Eh? What is this?

1400
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:57,790
So should I flip it like this?

1401
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,330
Yeah, in front of everyone.

1402
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:02,550
I'll turn it over like this and...

1403
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,550
1 and 2 isn't written there?

1404
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:04,750
1...

1405
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:04,750
2...

1406
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:29,770
"Gorilla Child"

1407
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:29,770
Hamada + Gorilla Photoshop

1408
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,790
What is this...?!

1409
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:18,930
This is amazing.

1410
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:26,800
Wow, I actually saw a normal gorilla for a moment

1411
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:27,800
This is so great!

1412
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:29,770
It doesn't even look odd at all!

1413
01:06:29,770 --> 01:07:02,010
Hamada "Gorilla Child"

1414
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,580
If a gorilla saw this it would laugh too.

1415
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:40,700
YOU were laughing too!

1416
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:51,610
It looks scary.

1417
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:57,030
He doesn't look very happy...

1418
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:57,030
Is he having a nap?

1419
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:02,010
You can't say that....

1420
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:21,060
Hamada "Alpha Gorilla"

1421
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:15,020
What are you?

1422
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:15,020
Seriously?

1423
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:21,470
That is an awesome picture.

1424
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,390
This one's better,

1425
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:24,390
don't you think?

1426
01:07:22,990 --> 01:08:01,500
Hamada "Gorilla Child"

1427
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:24,390
That's right.

1428
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:26,450
Amazing!

1429
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:27,780
This part... look...

1430
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:35,840
Hey this is how he looks when he's watching the VTR in the studio.

1431
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:40,190
"Cocorico Bombers"

1432
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:40,890
Damn it!

1433
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,460
Yeah.

1434
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:51,690
When he wipes

1435
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:51,690
and it gets his face messy he goes like this.

1436
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:59,060
I wanna show this to a gorilla.

1437
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:01,500
I wonder how a gorilla would react?

1438
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,520
Can I turn it over?

1439
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:07,800
Can you just put it here?

1440
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:09,660
That was...

1441
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:12,040
Right then, my turn!

1442
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,130
I wonder if I'll get a photo too?

1443
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:21,300
Oh nothing.

1444
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:35,030
"We know everything."

1445
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:35,030
A Mysterious Envelope

1446
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:30,490
It's scary...

1447
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,480
Scary huh?

1448
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:33,000
Huh what is this?

1449
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:35,550
I have no idea

1450
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,250
What is it?

1451
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:40,300
It's thick!!

1452
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:41,590
Firstly, is there anything else in there Endo?

1453
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:47,860
Endo's secretes are going to get uncovered?

1454
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:48,500
No way, I haven't done anything

1455
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:48,500
Ah you mean that pattern?

1456
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:52,400
There just going to uncover your secretes?

1457
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:56,240
Maybe there's something else in there.

1458
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:56,750
That's true

1459
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:01,440
Ahhh what the fuck is this?

1460
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:04,820
Cause every year something about Endo gets uncovered

1461
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:06,070

1462
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:07,180

1463
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:11,450
It feels kinda like a magazine

1464
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:14,860

01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:17,130

01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:27,770
"Monday"

1473
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:32,250
Taken late at night in Ripongi Kokoriko Endo's deviance still hasn't finished

1474
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,850
What's this?

1475
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:43,090
Isn't this a bit harsh?

1476
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,290
Yeah it is.

1477
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:48,920
This is scary

1478
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:56,300
Endos not laughing hey?

1479
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:56,300
That's true

1480
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,620
Ladies and Gentlemen, do you remember?

1481
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:04,420

Who's hat?

1485
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,620
Who who?

1486
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:22,190
I sort of asked her for her contact details and...

1487
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:28,820
When Endo hitting on the model was exposed!

1488
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:29,530
Endo hitting on the model who appeared on the program




was exposed

1489
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:33,170
..and I sent a really ambitious mail to her.

1490
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,170
Huh?

1491
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,170
No way!

1492
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:44,810
I wonder if i can tame you

1493
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:44,810
Misa-chan, if you have a boyfriend, you can tell me

1494
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:44,810
From: Kokoriko Endo-san

1495
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:44,810
Received mail

1496
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:44,810

1497
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:44,810

01:10:33,690 --> 01:10:35,350

01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:35,920

1501
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,650

1502
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:44,810
I wonder if i can tame you

1503
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:55,560
Endo not having learned his lesson not knowing  the staffs trick  accepted her invitation for a date

1504
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:48,130
Unsurprisingly, endo having not leaned his lesson

1505
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:50,460
Not knowing the staff's trick

1506
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:54,860
accepted her invitation for a date

1507
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:57,630

1509
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:03,130

1510
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,500
I don't get what it means....

1511
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,310

You were tricked?

1551
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:23,950
This is last years...

1552
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:26,130

No, not really but

1555
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,700
After a long time of not hearing anything, I got this message from her

1556
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:34,820
It said something like "what are you up to?"

1557
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:43,600
Endo was tricked by the staff

1558
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:37,610
Then she was like should we go grab something to eat

1559
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:40,620
And I was like sounds good...

1560
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,620
And nothing else happened?

1561
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:43,600
Of course, of course. I just went home after that.

1562
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:48,370
Why did you even meet up with her again?

1563
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:49,140
Well, um....

1564
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,600
Taming?

1565
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:57,740
I wanted to tame her.

1566
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:03,620
"I wanted to tame her"

1567
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:03,620
Taming... that's...

1568
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:06,620
When I say taming, what I mean is...

1569
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,580
Well even I don't really know but...

1570
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:10,610
Owww

1571
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,430
So what do you mean when you keep saying taming?

1572
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:16,710
In side my head.... ummm

1573
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,600
It's like....

1574
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,780
That word, taming....

1575
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:23,870
Like.. something like

1576
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:28,140
If you manage to catch a ball

1577
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:33,050
It's like that but it's more like

1578
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:33,050
Doing taming, receiving taming

1579
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,050
I wanna try it.

1580
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,100
Hahahaha

1581
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,160
Do you get me?

1582
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:41,230
You still don't understand?

1583
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:43,610
I have no idea what your saying

1584
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:43,610
Yeah you don't understand right?

1585
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:46,110
Me as well, I kinda don't get it

1586
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:49,890
NEEDS TO BE TRANSLATED

1587
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:50,960
That's really odd

1588
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:51,900
Yeah

1589
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:56,090
There was a kerfuffle as Endo got his big surprise

1590
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,740
Teaching duties start at 2:30

1591
01:13:56,090 --> 01:14:01,590
However, the search for gags still isn't over

1592
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:05,280
Aaaa I'm already worn out

1593
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:06,070
What is this?

1594
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,510
Why did I get tricked so soon

1595
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:09,320
I'm so tired

1596
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,620
I'm such an moron

1597
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:13,890
Matumoto-san, are you doing to try slot machine?

1598
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,570
Oh yeah!

1599
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,190
Fuffufu

1600
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,290
You just laughed didn't you?

1601
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,580
Yeah he did.

1602
01:14:19,290 --> 01:14:20,930
He just laughed right?

1603
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:20,930
I didn't, I didn't.

1604
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:22,030
Then what did you just do?

1605
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:27,030
What I really did, was say "fuffufu"

1606
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:27,030
Yeah that's laughing

1607
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,030
So you laughed

1608
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:27,030
Hahaha

1609
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,300
Those guys laughed too!

1610
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:35,110
They started laughing and then we all laughed

1611
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:36,410
All 3 of us started laughing

1612
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:38,570
Owwwwww

1613
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:44,550
Huh, so that's not it then

1614
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:46,570
I'm gonna do the slot machine

1615
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:49,990
Using the medal for the slot machine challange

1616
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,090
What's this?

1617
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:55,000
Huh, isn't this kinda kinda strange?

1618
01:14:53,630 --> 01:15:01,600
with 100 medals they'll get the grand prize

1619
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,140
Use one medal and...

1620
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:57,590
I'll do it one time

1621
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:59,570
Cause we can get the grand prize

1622
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:02,070
Cause it was in your desk right?

1623
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:05,270
I'll do it once to start with

1624
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:05,270
I don't think it will be that simple

1625
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,080
Yeah

1626
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,670
Like this right?

1627
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:12,150
Just hit it once

1628
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:16,070
(Everyone) Banana

1629
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:16,150
(Everyone) Banana

1630
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:18,070
It's Hamada-san

1631
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,760
Almost

1632
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,080
Me?

1633
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,260
If you look at it, its Hamada-san, right?

1634
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:28,730
Anyone who looks at this would see Hamada-san

1635
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:30,860
Hey you laughed

1636
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:34,120

No I didn't laugh

1863
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:27,810
I  didn't laugh at the poem

1864
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:31,050
It was when he was like "So good!", his voice

1865
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:33,450
I don't get what your saying, shut up

1866

I can't understand you, so stop it

1868
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:44,520
You say all that and then you start laughing, seriously.

1869
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,500
The way you just stare at someone

1870
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,500

01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,070
I want you to stop staring at people

1872
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:53,700
By the way,

1873
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:57,410
you don't have to put the name of the food into the poem

1874
01:24:57,570 --> 01:25:00,000
I see, I see

1875
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:00,140
Even though he just used "Hamburger", you don't have to

1876
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:03,950
Ok, so then, first is, Tanaka-san

1877
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,010

He was like ummmm

1890
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:24,570
I didn't expect something like "shrimp Chili"

1891
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,500
Waaaa that was scary

1892
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:34,680
"It's so delicious" doesn't add anything

1893
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,680
Yeah everyones going to use it now

1894
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,980
Is "it's so delicious" not allowed?

1895
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,440
Ok, you can't use "It's so delicious" at the end

1896
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:42,720
From now on using "It's so delicious" is forbidden

1897
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:42,720
RULE

1898
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:41,040
It's all going to be tasty so of course "it's so delicious"

1899
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,000
Ok, so that was out

You wern't paying attention at all!

1912
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:06,610
Are you deaf or something?

1913
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:06,940
That's just like "It's so delicious"!

1914
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,680
Just after it was said too

1915
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:11,110
He said "Meaty juices" again too, makes it a bit easy

1916
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:12,860
But his tempo was really good

1917
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:14,510
Yeah at least he didn't say "ummmm"

1918
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:16,490
My judgment is.. safe!

1919
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:18,500
Yeahhh! Thank you!

1920
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:21,520

1929
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:35,510
He said "it's my favorite" twice

1930
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:38,000
What was that, "Because of all the moon viewing

1931
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,000
You got caught up with "It's my favorite"

1932
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:43,000
I really didn't get it

1933
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:44,910
I really wanted to do it quickly

1934
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:48,050
I think I was faster than anyone else

1935
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:50,150
Ok, Hamada-san

"Deep fry it entirely"??

1945
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,010
How many syllables was that in your head? "Deep fry entirely"

1946
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:03,870
Deep fry it is only 3 syllables

1947
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:05,730
He said "Meaty juices" too!

1948
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:11,140
No, if you make me do it so suddenly...

1949
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:14,840

Please don't seat the udon on a plate

1960
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
"Seated on a plate" that's really strange

1961
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:40,170
Ahh this is hard

1962
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:42,010
I would get it if it were "Served on a plate" though

1963
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:44,210
Just a hold on a sec Shinagawa,

1964

None of us can stop laughing

1965
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,000

That one was really horrible

1987
01:28:29,950 --> 01:28:33,050
He was like "The atmosphere of an eel"

1988
01:28:33,150 --> 01:28:36,490
"The atmosphere of an eel, fully mix it around"

1989
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:42,260
It has nothing to do with an eel at all

1990
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:46,530
No way.

1991
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:51,370
It's ok, you don't really have to explain it all

1992
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:51,370
Yeah don't say all that stuff
I get it even with out the explanation

I have no idea what he's saying

2187
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:48,520
No way, they've got to be kidding

2188
01:37:46,530 --> 01:37:51,100
They can't understand almost any of the report

2189
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:53,130
Thats just noise, quit it

2190
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:57,070
Tenryu, please speak a bit more slowly

games that use WIFI, devices with electronic messaging and etc

2196
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,680
are now absolutely banned in school

2197
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:12,560
○△□×☆※…。

2198
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:28,570
Tenryu, can you give a report on the preparations for the school festival?

2199
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:28,600

2203
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:39,920
Enough enough, it's just impossible

2204
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:41,000
Impossible

2205
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:41,200
Impossible

2206
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,170
Impossible

2207
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:47,480
I can't, it hurts so much

2208
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:47,480
enough, this is impossible

2209
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:49,220
Tenryu, please calm down

2210

Also the students are making butler cosplay costumes

01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:55,100
They'll be running something called a butler café

2213
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:57,380
Concerning the cafe...

2214
01:38:57,660 --> 01:38:59,820

He's still doing it, we can see you you know

2219
01:39:18,190 --> 01:39:20,120

Stop!

2229
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,960
What's going on here?

2230
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:33,170
These 2 were fighting behind the gym, I thought I better give them a warning so I bought them here

2231
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:35,170
Goriraimo:

01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:35,170
Oshima Miyuki (Morisanchu)

2233
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:35,720
What's the cause of this fighting then?

2234
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:36,760
Shut up!　Shit head!

2235
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:38,140
Shut your face, fuckwit.

2236
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:41,040
Now then, you can't say stuff like that when teachers are around can you?

2237
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:42,510
Shut up! Shit head!

2238
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:44,350
What gives you the right to say that

2239
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:46,810
Stop saying shit head, shit head!

2240
01:39:46,810 --> 01:39:49,280
I'm not a shit head! I'm a teacher, am I not?

2241
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:54,060
....What the fuck?

2242
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:56,260
What is this?

2243
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:59,450
What's happening?

2244
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:07,030
It's just one after the other

2245
01:40:07,030 --> 01:40:08,500
What the hell, they're really worked up

2246
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:11,540
Oi, you can't talk like that around the teachers

2247
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:12,690
Shut up!! Shit head!!

2248
01:40:12,690 --> 01:40:14,030
Why is that you don't stop saying shit head?

2249
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:16,280
What's up with the "shit head"?

2250
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:15,940
Enough! Everyone calm down.

2251
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:17,670

No way, seriously?

2269
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,420
You two, what's the cause of this fighting?

2270
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:58,590
This asshole was talkin' shit about my man

2271
01:40:58,370 --> 01:40:58,930

I said that he's so gross, what's wrong with that?!

2273
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:02,860

He's fucking really gross

2275
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:05,330
In what way?!

2276
01:41:05,330 --> 01:41:09,460
Stop talking back. Even though his arm hair is so thick

2277
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:12,830
his head is going bald, that's why! He's fucking gross

2278
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:12,780
Shut up!

2279
01:41:12,830 --> 01:41:14,000
Sure when my man

2280
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,670
gets out of the bath his head is so bald it makes me feel ill

2281
01:41:17,670 --> 01:41:19,670
But that's fine by me!

2282
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:23,940

Also I heard this...

2288
01:41:34,050 --> 01:41:37,760
On the sofa in his house
I heard he has this position he uses right?

2289
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:44,060
He just sits there smelling like an ordinary old person

2290
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:44,060
He just stays like that

2291
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:49,280
What is this, enough! What are they talking about?!

2292
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:49,930
Oww!

No, I know that but...

2295
01:41:54,610 --> 01:41:56,910
He's really over reacting

2296
01:41:56,910 --> 01:41:58,280
But that's really cute!

2297
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:00,080
There's no way that can be cute!

2298
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:00,380
It's cute!

2299
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:00,940
Why?

2300
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,940
Hey hey, just hold up

01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,900
Seriously, stop this right now!

2302
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:06,590
You're bad, you're bad too

2316
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:35,180
I think we were really lucky to see that though

2317
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:38,640
It hurts!

2318
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
It hurts!

2319
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:44,360
Ok, so everyone's ok now?

2320
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:46,360

That was so shocking

2329
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:57,100
Miss Suzuki, the final report please

2330
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:59,270
The truth is, in the 3rd year we have the worst problem student

2331
01:42:59,270 --> 01:43:01,740
The truth is, in the 3rd year we have the worst problem student

2332
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:03,510
A rumor has started that that student somehow

2333
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:06,750
has been carrying something like a lethal weapon around at school

2334
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:09,480
So then I think I want to 5 new trainee teachers to

2335
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,990
go and get that weapon off of them

2336
01:43:11,990 --> 01:43:13,350
Understood

2337
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:13,950
We're counting on you

2338
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:14,690
Don't just say "understood"

2339
01:43:14,690 --> 01:43:16,860
You've been given a really great task here

2340
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:18,930
Because you say so?

2341
01:43:17,430 --> 01:43:20,730
Are we really ok with this?

2342
01:43:17,430 --> 01:43:20,730
So that's our job?

2343
01:43:20,730 --> 01:43:26,870
Moving to the problem students class room

2344
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:25,000
That was bad wasn't it Tanaka

2345
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,080
I was really supprised

2346
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,940
Yeah you should be surprised

2347
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:28,060
You didn't know it was going to happen?

2348
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:28,950
No I had no idea at all

2349
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:30,700
Even when she came onto stage?

2350
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:30,950
Of course I still didn't know

2351
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:34,510

We encountered the Pants Hunter

2360
01:43:52,630 --> 01:43:56,500
Are you talking about the famous Pants Hunter from St. Kurobikari School!?

2361
01:43:57,180 --> 01:43:58,280

Problematic student

2365
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:19,920
What is this?

2366
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:25,240
You've got to be kidding me?

2367
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:32,670
Pants Hunter - Matsuko

2368
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:29,060

01:44:32,780 --> 01:44:35,300
We're so sorry!

2373
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:40,210
You guys, this is the problem student from the rumor, Matsuko the Mammoth.

2374
01:44:40,210 --> 01:44:41,810
You guys, this is the problem student from the rumor, Matsuko the Mammoth.

2375
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:50,150
If your not looking, you look

2376
01:44:46,950 --> 01:44:50,150
If your not looking, don't look!!

2377
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:56,750
Yeah ok

2378
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:02,830
I'm looking and not looking

2379
01:45:02,830 --> 01:45:04,400
You guys, this isn't a meager thing

2380
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,130
You're going to do a body check on Matsuko

2381
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:09,500
Hamada

2382
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:09,500
Huh??

2383
01:45:08,070 --> 01:45:09,500
Body check

2384
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:16,140
Checking that Matsuko isn't carrying a weapon

2385
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:13,370
Yeah search her, find it so we don't have to

2386
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:15,850
Yeah we don't want to have to do this too

2387
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:19,980
Your lips are fatter than last year

2388
01:45:21,450 --> 01:45:22,950
Fufufu

2389
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:30,290
Scary!

2390
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:31,200
Hamada looked so small

2391
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:32,620
Ah ow ow ow

2392
01:45:32,330 --> 01:45:35,030
He looked amazingly small

2393
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:36,240
There wasn't anything?

2394
01:45:36,230 --> 01:45:37,230
Was it there?

2395
01:45:37,230 --> 01:45:38,360
No

2396
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:40,600
Ok, Matsumoto

2397
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:41,480

Come closer

2401
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:52,450
Your arm's really muscular

2402
01:45:52,450 --> 01:45:54,910
What's this?

2403
01:45:54,910 --> 01:45:57,820
Woah, amazing

2404
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:57,820
What's it doing?

2405
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:03,070
But she was whispering to me like that...

2406
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:03,600
Yeah she sure was

2407
01:46:03,070 --> 01:46:05,070
She kept saying that stuff

2408
01:46:08,030 --> 01:46:09,060
Matsumoto, did you find it?

2409
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:10,930
No, I didn't

2410
01:46:10,930 --> 01:46:13,300

01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:13,340
Please find it

2412
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:14,480
Um, excuse me...

2413

I'm going to give you a body check

2414
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:17,560
I'm looking for a weapon

2415
01:46:20,410 --> 01:46:22,740
It's down lower

2416
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:22,740
Lower? Lower?

2417
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:26,380
I've got an amazing weapon, it's down lower

2418
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:28,550
LOWER!!!

2419
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:31,550
More towards the center

2420
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:37,990
What is this?

2421
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:44,080
Try not to get to hot there Endo

2422
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:44,460
Sorry

2423
01:46:48,370 --> 01:46:49,770
Did you find a weapon?

2424
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:51,740
No we didn't

2425
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:51,740
That's right

2426
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:53,310
Anyway, who are these guys?

2427
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:54,740
Anyway, who are these guys?

2428
01:46:54,740 --> 01:46:58,140
They're the new crop of teachers starting from today

2429
01:46:58,210 --> 01:47:01,980
So then, wouldn't it be polite to introduce your self first?

2430
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:08,020
Self Introductions to the Problem Student Matsuko

2431
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:03,940
Ok, Mr Lips

2432
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:04,460

Neat with matching dimples and teeth

2440
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:32,010
Like a princess!

2441
01:47:32,010 --> 01:47:36,380
The cosplay I would like her to do is

2442
01:47:34,110 --> 01:47:36,380
a dental hygienist

2443
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:36,380
Nice to meet you

2444
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:38,150

2445
01:47:40,890 --> 01:47:47,360
They'll use Yanki greetings to introduce them selfs

2446
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:43,670
Got it?

2447
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,670
Mr Lips, do it again

2448
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:48,500
Mr Lips is a good name

2449
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:53,930
I'm like the new teacher Hamada

2450
01:47:56,740 --> 01:48:04,440
My type of girl is

2451
01:47:59,810 --> 01:48:04,440
silent, and perverted, and

2452
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:08,480
Hamada, aren't you saying a little too much?

2453
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:11,670
silent and perverted?

2454
01:48:12,950 --> 01:48:14,320
What kinda perve is that?

2455
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:19,790
Ok the next guy is Matsumoto

01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:26,090
Ummmm.....

2458
01:48:26,090 --> 01:48:27,730
My kinda girl is

2459
01:48:27,730 --> 01:48:34,010
someone who, even though she has really big tits

2460
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:34,010
It kinda seems like they don't really and

2461
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:41,680
um, wearing something that looks like a cardian

2462
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:41,680
but a part of me also thinks "is it that good?" and...

2463
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:48,190
This guy talks way to much!

2464
01:48:48,190 --> 01:48:49,600
That was way to much!

2465
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:51,600
So long!

2466
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:51,600
That was really detailed

2467
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:56,020
Is it ok if it's a bit rough?

2468
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:58,360
Please

2469
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:58,360

My type of girl is....

2473
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:12,580
Not so much what's on her front side, but what the back side is like,

2474
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:12,580
accentuating what's on the front...

2475
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:15,010

2476
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:18,840

The kinda girl I like is a girl with short hair

2490
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:07,870
The shorter the better

2491
01:50:07,870 --> 01:50:12,540

2492
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:14,870

Naked all over....

2494
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:20,880
I guess they all have that

2495
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:20,880
Huh, they have that?

2496
01:50:23,150 --> 01:50:24,720
Thanks

2497
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:27,820
These guys are alright

2498
01:50:28,350 --> 01:50:30,990
Till now there's been no one I wanted to consult with about my painful secretes

2499
01:50:30,990 --> 01:50:33,990
But I feel like I could talk to these guys about anything

2500
01:50:33,990 --> 01:50:37,000
Matsuko, give it a go

2501
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:40,730
This is something I wasn't able to tell ayone till now but...

2502
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:48,340
I can't work an ATM machine

2503
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,270
The touchpanel, what should I do?

2504
01:50:45,270 --> 01:50:48,340
The touchpanel, what should I do?

2505
01:50:48,710 --> 01:50:51,580
Well, wouldn't it be best if you lost a bit of weight?

2506
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:55,780
You really think so?

2507
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:55,780
I get that my fat might be getting in the way

2508
01:50:55,780 --> 01:50:57,980
There was no one who would tell me that so clearly before

2509
01:50:57,980 --> 01:50:59,150
Ah, is that so?

2510
01:50:59,150 --> 01:51:00,820
Say something nice

2511
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:00,820
I'm sorry

2512
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:03,120
Try to think about my feelings

2513
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:04,260
Wha?

2514
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:10,530
Prize for resolving her painful secret

2515
01:51:06,570 --> 01:51:08,570
I was like "wha?"

2516
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,900
It was scary wasn't it??

2517
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:19,810
Rice grown by my grandpappy

2518
01:51:19,810 --> 01:51:22,740
Eat some rice balls

2519
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:30,050
The prize is rice balls filled with love

2520
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:33,820
So audacious

2521
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:37,360
It's like squelch, squelch, squelch, squelch

2522
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:39,160
She uses a lot of water huh?

2523
01:51:40,490 --> 01:51:42,490
Eat it

2524
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,570
Um, now?

2525
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:47,830
Eat it!

2526
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:47,520
Ok

2527
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:50,080
It's not in the center?

2528
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:53,870
How is it? Is it good?

2529
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:53,870
Yeah

2530
01:51:53,870 --> 01:51:55,140
It's yummy

2531
01:51:56,180 --> 01:51:57,340
Ok

2532
01:51:57,340 --> 01:51:59,540
I'm gonna make you all eat one

2533
01:51:58,460 --> 01:51:59,540
It's ok, it's ok

2534
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:02,380
No no, she said she's gonna make us all eat one

2535
01:52:02,380 --> 01:52:05,090
Even though Hamada was the one who helped her

2536
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:08,720
For real?

2537
01:52:09,050 --> 01:52:12,960
It's amazing, my grandpappy grew the rice, look.

2538
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:14,050
It's really amazing

2539
01:52:14,430 --> 01:52:17,630
Yeah, it's amazing

2540
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:25,620
Isn't that enough already?

2541
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:30,740
That was a good one

2542
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:34,810
I'm making this one for you (Yamazaki)

2543
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:34,810
Um, that's a bit..

2544
01:52:34,810 --> 01:52:36,550
You don't want it?

2545
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:36,060
No that's not it

2546
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:38,050
You don't want it?!

2547
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:38,560
No I don't not want it

2548
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:49,100
Amazing

2549
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,500
I couldn't breath

2550
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:02,040
He almost died

2551
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:02,040
He really almost died

2552
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:12,580
Who is going to understand my feelings?

2553
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:13,500
Huh?

2554
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:16,000
Do you understand my feelings?

2555
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:19,440
What the hell is this?

2556
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:22,360
What is this?

2557
01:53:22,430 --> 01:53:25,430
Come on... it kinda felt like it that was the end before.

2558
01:53:26,430 --> 01:53:29,430
I really thought it was over

2559
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:37,000
GET THE FUCK OUT OF 'ERE!!

2560
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:38,520
What? We're sorry

2561
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
DON'T FUCK WITH ME!!

2562
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,850
GET THE FUCK OUT!!

2563
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:43,450
Ok ok, got it

2564
01:53:45,450 --> 01:53:48,950
Her mood changes are messed up

2565
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:50,920
I really thought that was over

2566
01:53:49,950 --> 01:53:51,600
It usually finishes with that right?

2567
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:54,190
That really got stranger and stranger

2568
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:56,920
I was so surprised

2569
01:53:58,100 --> 01:53:59,920
5 Hours since they've began

2570
01:54:00,030 --> 01:54:03,030
The new teachers haven't had a break

2571
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:12,980
We're changing clothes.

2572
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:13,500
Changing?

2573
01:54:13,630 --> 01:54:19,150
Um now everyone is going to battle teachers
from another school for this school's honor.

2574
01:54:21,150 --> 01:54:28,000
Competition with the rival school's teachers

2575
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:27,740
But if it is just you guys we'll be worried,
so we invited a powerful helper to come.

2576
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:30,240
Come in!

2577
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:36,500
Gushiken Yoko

2578
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:39,620
This is our charismatic gym teacher Gushiken

2579
01:54:39,730 --> 01:54:41,800
Thank you

2580
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:43,230

2581
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:45,580

2582
01:54:44,810 --> 01:54:46,810
This is our helper?

2583
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:50,300
This is the helper, the charismatic gym teacher Gushiken.

2584
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:50,300
"This"?

2585
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:53,780
Please do your best

2586
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:56,050
You're going to get changed here too?

2587
01:54:55,730 --> 01:54:57,230
Let's all do our best

2588
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:00,560
It's good that Gushiken came to get changed too

2589
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:20,760
Ahh

2590
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:28,220
Ok, if everyone's ready, lets go to the gym.

2591
01:55:27,230 --> 01:55:29,230
Yep

2592
01:55:29,550 --> 01:55:31,550
Is this helper really going to be ok?

2593
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,760
Everything will be fine cause I'm here.

2594
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:35,220
Really?

2595
01:55:35,190 --> 01:55:37,190
Leave it to me

2596
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:44,200
Let the battle begin

2597
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:44,200
The schools honor hangs in the balance

2598
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:49,220
Gym

2599
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:53,720

We didn't know anything about what was happening.

2607
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,430
Continuing on, Felistar Gakuen's entrance

2608
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:25,260

Starting with the arrogant and powerful Nishikino, 6 strong contenders have been gathered.

2619
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:47,310
Now before the game begins, one rule will change...

2620
01:56:47,310 --> 01:56:50,250
During the game laughing is ok,

2621
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:52,500
During the game laughing is OK

2622
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:52,500
Rule

2623
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:52,230
however, you can't lose.

2624
01:56:52,230 --> 01:56:54,230
So then...

2625
01:56:52,230 --> 01:56:54,230
You can't do that

2626
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,200
Haa!!

2627
01:56:56,250 --> 01:56:58,220

01:56:58,220 --> 01:57:01,230
Eeeehhhhh?????

2630
01:57:01,230 --> 01:57:03,190
We said it's ok to laugh but...

2631
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:05,000
He didn't say it's ok to kick!

2632
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:05,800
No we didn't

2633
01:57:06,580 --> 01:57:07,700
What is it? Gushiken-san, what is it?

2634
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:09,900
What is it Gushiken-san?

2635
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:10,330
Excuse me

2636
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,900

2640
01:57:22,770 --> 01:57:25,770

01:57:24,230 --> 01:57:25,730

The battle for honor is about to begin!

2647
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:33,240
Naturally the losing team will receive a harsh punishment

2648
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:40,230
The member of the losing team that screws up the most will receive a Thai-kick

2649
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:41,800
Rule

2650
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:41,800
The member of the losing team that screws up the most will receive a Thai-kick

2651
01:57:42,650 --> 01:57:43,700
are you going to be ok, Gushiken-san?

2652
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,000
My...

2653
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:47,000
ass is weak

2654
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:51,000
I'll say it again

2655
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:53,800
You're saying this when the game it's been decided already.

2656
01:57:53,740 --> 01:57:56,250
That's troubling, really troubling

2657
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:59,230
Everyone ready? We're about to begin the competition

2665
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:14,250

2666
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:16,250
I came to cheer for you

2667
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:16,700

2724
01:59:56,700 --> 01:59:58,740
Ok guys, if your butt touches the vault,

2725
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:02,650
If your bottom hits the box - 0 points

2726
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:02,650
Rule

2727
01:59:58,750 --> 01:59:59,730
your attempt won't count

2728
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,410
No no, I didn't touch it!

2729
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:04,810
OK then let's have a look at the replay shall we?

2730
02:00:05,430 --> 02:00:08,560
Can you see? His right leg kinda caught the edge there

2731
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:10,560
It's OK isn't it?

2732
02:00:11,090 --> 02:00:12,560
Your butt is alright then

2733
02:00:12,980 --> 02:00:14,000
Just his leg!!

2734
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,030
Yep, just his leg!!

2735
02:00:15,030 --> 02:00:17,110
Since his butt wasn't touching it...

2736
02:00:17,110 --> 02:00:18,400
his attempt is a success!!!

2737
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:22,900
5 points

2738
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:22,900
Felistar Gakuen

2739
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:22,900
Tsukaji

2740
02:00:22,950 --> 02:00:25,530
OK then! here comes Kurobikari Gakuen next

2741
02:00:25,530 --> 02:00:26,480
Who's going to go first?

2742
02:00:26,550 --> 02:00:28,000
Me!!

2743
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:29,000
What the hell!?

2744
02:00:29,010 --> 02:00:32,350
Seriously??

2745
02:00:32,350 --> 02:00:34,230
The old ones, you and me, need to do this first

2746
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:34,990
Don't we discuss first!?

2747
02:00:34,990 --> 02:00:36,000
What do mean, "old ones"!?

2748
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:38,100
Seriously, you gotta let us old ones do first

2749
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:40,000
Ok then, Hamada...

2750
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:40,000
Yep

2751
02:00:40,030 --> 02:00:41,360
So, Hamada-san do you want to go first?

2752
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:41,360
Yeah I'll go first

2753
02:00:41,450 --> 02:00:42,850
How many tiers?

2754
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:44,100
Erm, with 5 too...

2755
02:00:44,100 --> 02:00:44,820
5 tiers?

2756
02:00:44,510 --> 02:00:44,820
Yep!

2757
02:00:44,830 --> 02:00:45,960
Go for it!

2758
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:47,700
Hey, what the hell are you laughing at?

2759
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:49,470
Yeah, really.

2760
02:00:49,550 --> 02:00:51,340
Hold on, listen! You guys!

2761
02:00:51,890 --> 02:00:53,800
You guys may already have got used to see Hamada-san like this today

2762
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:56,370
but this is the first time for us - it's hilarious!!

2763
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:58,800
JUST ABOUT though! We BARELY managed it!

2764
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:01,500
It took us a half day to get to this stage

2765
02:01:01,710 --> 02:01:03,520
Has his face always looked THAT hilarious??

2766
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:08,600
Hamada Masatoshi (49 year-old)

2767
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:08,600
Jumping vaulting box challenge!!

2768
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:08,600
Kurobikari Gakuen

2769
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:06,130
Hamada attempts a 5-tiers box...

2770
02:01:06,690 --> 02:01:08,080
How will it go?

2771
02:01:09,590 --> 02:01:10,790
How confident are you?

2772
02:01:11,060 --> 02:01:12,790
Well, I should be fine with that height

2773
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:14,300
Oh, he is quite confident!

2774
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:17,840
OK, now here is Hamada-san's attempt at the 5-tier box

2775
02:01:18,410 --> 02:01:19,200
Ready...!

2776
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:22,520
Go for it

2777
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:23,090
Scary, scary, scary!!!!

2778
02:01:25,850 --> 02:01:31,400
5 points

2779
02:01:25,850 --> 02:01:31,400
Hamada

2780
02:01:25,850 --> 02:01:31,400
Kurobikari Gakuen

2781
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:30,450
You can go for much higher one for sure!

2782
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:33,420
You should have tried higher, don't you think?

2783
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:37,170
You could definitely nail 7 tiers

2784
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:37,310
You think so?

2785
02:01:37,470 --> 02:01:40,420
Just to let you know, if you don't push hard enough and your team loses as a result,

2786
02:01:37,950 --> 02:01:42,900
If your team loses the person who
contributed the least will receive a Thai kick

2787
02:01:37,950 --> 02:01:42,900
Rule:

2788
02:01:40,450 --> 02:01:41,870
you will receive a Thai kick for crappy attempt.

2789
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:42,850
What!? Why!?

2790
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:44,960
Well, Hamada receives a kick one way or the other right?

2791
02:01:44,740 --> 02:01:45,660
Why the hell man!!?

2792
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:51,400
Felistar Gakuen

2793
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:51,400

02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:50,810
Next up: A professional dancer & excellent at sports, KABA.chan's try

2796
02:01:53,020 --> 02:01:54,000
KABA.chan, how many tiers?

2797
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:56,020
Let's try 9 tiers

2798
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:56,710
OK, I'll give it a go

2799
02:01:57,210 --> 02:02:00,500
KABA.chan, attempting 9 tiers!!

2800
02:01:59,120 --> 02:01:59,990
KABA.-chan, 9 tiers?

2801
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:00,600
Let me try

2802
02:02:00,940 --> 02:02:02,440
KABA.chan, if your d*ck pops out

2803
02:02:02,450 --> 02:02:04,580
you'll definitely get a Thai kick, got that?

2804
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:05,280
If the d*ck pops out, yeah

2805
02:02:05,350 --> 02:02:07,780
Your d*ck will get the kick, alright?

2806
02:02:07,780 --> 02:02:11,090
You'll get the kick with the number of occasions you've had your d*ck exposed

2807
02:02:11,100 --> 02:02:13,130
That's harsh!!

2808
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:14,570
OK, you ready?

2809
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:18,960
Here is KABA.chan's attempt at the 9-tier vault

2810
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:21,660
Let's see - ready!

2811
02:02:31,170 --> 02:02:34,210

Felistar Gakuen

2813
02:02:31,170 --> 02:02:34,210
KABA.chan

2814
02:02:31,590 --> 02:02:32,570
That was really good!

2815
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:35,200
No need to check (the replay)??

2816
02:02:35,250 --> 02:02:36,730
Surely not for this one

2817
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:36,730
Are you sure?

2818
02:02:37,150 --> 02:02:40,120
We may detect the d*ck leakage if we check the replay

2819
02:02:40,450 --> 02:02:45,120
Gushiken Yoko (57 years-old)

2820

Gushiken tries 8-tier

2823
02:02:42,630 --> 02:02:44,640
Can he prove what it takes to be a super helper for his team?

2824
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:46,800
Gushiken-san, are you absolutely positive about that???

2825
02:02:47,430 --> 02:02:48,660
He'll be fine - he's not heavy

2826
02:02:48,730 --> 02:02:50,190
Gushiken-san, how old are you this year?

2827
02:02:51,190 --> 02:02:54,200
High, huh?

2828
02:02:52,090 --> 02:02:53,080
Completely ignoring us!!

2829
02:02:54,660 --> 02:02:56,470
Gushiken-san, how old are you now?

2830
02:02:56,630 --> 02:02:58,570
Oh, did I ask for 8 tiers?

2831
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:58,450
That's not what we asked!

2832
02:02:58,930 --> 02:02:59,510
Not that!

2833
02:02:59,510 --> 02:03:00,560
Your age!

2834
02:03:01,150 --> 02:03:02,020
Ready...!

2835
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:05,120
Is he gonna be OK?

2836
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:06,980
You can do it, go go GO GO GO!!!

2837
02:03:08,810 --> 02:03:14,920
8 points

2838
02:03:08,810 --> 02:03:14,920

Takahashi Shigeo (36 years-old)

2844
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:19,000
Next up is Takahashi; having a go at 8-tier vault despite his incompetence in sports

2845
02:03:19,450 --> 02:03:20,380
How will it turn out?

2846
02:03:20,990 --> 02:03:22,620
Jeez it's really high you know

2847
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:23,460
HIGH!

2848
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:27,600
Make sure to use the springboard properly to catapult yourself like "boom"

2849
02:03:27,130 --> 02:03:27,440
OK

2850
02:03:27,530 --> 02:03:30,300
Not that it was something we didn't know...

2851
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:31,530
Yes right

2852
02:03:31,650 --> 02:03:32,710
Let's see how he will do,

2853
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:33,470
ready...!

2854
02:03:35,940 --> 02:03:36,720
Not good, no

2855
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:37,940
Oooh not good

2856
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:43,110
Whoa it was a bit...

2857
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:45,120
OK, now, guys, let's take a look at the replay!!

2858
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:45,880
Let's watch the replay!!

2859
02:03:45,990 --> 02:03:49,990
Even if he managed to do it, it's as good as a failure!

2860
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:49,900
Isn't it though??

2861
02:03:51,150 --> 02:03:52,600
He's walking with his hands!!

2862
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:53,880
Bloody hell, he used his hands twice

2863
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,240
Yeah, twice! Used hands twice!!

2864
02:03:55,130 --> 02:03:55,970
Jeez, awful

2865
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:59,980

Takahashi

2869
02:04:00,730 --> 02:04:02,730
Horrible, we're gonna lose for sure now!

2870
02:04:02,870 --> 02:04:07,540
Jumping vaulting box challenge!!

2871

2874
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:08,680
How many tier is this?

2875
02:04:08,680 --> 02:04:09,180
8

2876
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:10,120
That's an 8-tier vault

2877
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:10,800
Oh, is it 8?

2878
02:04:10,650 --> 02:04:12,880
I'm so sure that I'm not gonna make 8 tiers

2879
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:16,950
Do you really think it's that funny to watch a bunch of old men hopping around??

2880
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:20,620
Come to think of it, yeah.

2881
02:04:18,820 --> 02:04:20,880
It is hilarious

2882
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:23,660
I've already got a bad feeling about this...

2883
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:23,360
Go for it!

2884
02:04:24,370 --> 02:04:25,000
8??

2885
02:04:24,850 --> 02:04:27,860
Attempting a 8 tier!!

2886
02:04:24,930 --> 02:04:26,130
Going for 8-tier, ok?

2887
02:04:25,970 --> 02:04:26,970
You sure?

2888
02:04:28,060 --> 02:04:30,560
You can lower it if you want

2889
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:30,940
It is tier 8 at the moment

2890
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:33,560
Shall we lower it by 1 tier?

2891
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:33,550
Wanna make it 7 then?

2892
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:35,800
So uncool

2893
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:37,200
Are you gonna be a chicken just like that???

2894
02:04:37,230 --> 02:04:39,740
I'm really having a bad feeling about this

2895
02:04:39,740 --> 02:04:41,500
I'm gonna screw it up big time, aren't I!!?

2896
02:04:41,510 --> 02:04:44,310
You can do it, don't worry!!

2897
02:04:42,310 --> 02:04:44,310
It'll be OK, it'll be OK!!

2898
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:48,310
Here comes Mastumoto-san's attempt at the 7-tier vault

2899
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:50,800
Let's get started. Ready...!

2900
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:49,410
You can do it

2901
02:04:49,530 --> 02:04:50,350
Can I really jump that?

2902
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:52,790
My god, it's scary

2903
02:04:52,610 --> 02:04:53,580
Don't get tense!!

2904
02:04:59,260 --> 02:05:03,990
7 points

Matsumoto

2907
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:03,440
It was an easy try wasn't it?

2908
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:04,400
It didn't look if it was pushing him too the limit

2909
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:05,600
It's a bit like, what do I say,

2910
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:09,400
I used something I haven't used for a long, long time

2911
02:05:07,620 --> 02:05:09,400
What the hell are you talking about?

2912
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:12,700
6-tier vault successful

2913
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:12,700

Kinoshita

2915
02:05:10,340 --> 02:05:12,970
Heated competition over the vaulting box among the teachers

2916
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:16,870
7-tier vault successful

2917
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:16,870

Fujimoto

2922
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:19,840
Many of the teachers make successful attempts despite the prior concern,

2923
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:24,630
the battle between two schools over their honor continues...

2924
02:05:23,350 --> 02:05:26,650
9-tier vault successful

2925
02:05:23,350 --> 02:05:26,650
Kurobikari Gakuen

2926
02:05:23,350 --> 02:05:26,650

Kurobikari Gakuen

2929
02:05:26,650 --> 02:05:31,650
points

2930
02:05:26,650 --> 02:05:31,650
points

2931
02:05:26,900 --> 02:05:28,640
With only one competitor remaining from both sides,

2932
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:31,330
Kurobikari has a 7-point lead at this point

2933
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:34,660
Endo plays safe by opting for 8 tiers,

2934
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:36,660
8-tiers vaulting box challenge!!

2935
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:36,660
Endo Shozo (41 years old)

2936
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:36,660
Kurobikari Gakuen

2937
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:36,610
how does his plan turn out?

2938
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:38,040
Here goes the 8-tier attempt,

2939
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:39,040
ready...!

2940
02:05:39,940 --> 02:05:41,940
Here I go

2941
02:05:43,250 --> 02:05:44,920
He's not heavy is he?

2942
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:49,370
His butt touched the vault!!!

2943
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:51,410
We need the referee for this!

2944
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:53,340
Let's look at the slow-mo replay!!

2945
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:56,500
If his butt touched the vault, that will be nil points

2946
02:05:54,710 --> 02:05:56,260
Was it not a successful one??

2947
02:05:57,940 --> 02:05:59,390
Your hand should have been positioned little further

2948
02:05:59,790 --> 02:06:00,730
I just managed to evade it

2949
02:06:00,860 --> 02:06:02,280
Ahhhh!!!

2950
02:06:02,450 --> 02:06:03,460
Your but was touching at the very last!

2951
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:05,390
whaaa..!

2952
02:06:05,490 --> 02:06:07,860
How will this be considered?

2953
02:06:07,970 --> 02:06:08,650
Is it not good?

2954
02:06:08,930 --> 02:06:10,830
His butt was touching

2955
02:06:09,950 --> 02:06:10,640
Suzuki, what did you say?

2956
02:06:10,830 --> 02:06:13,000
Definitely touching

2957
02:06:11,900 --> 02:06:13,000
You think so?

2958
02:06:12,550 --> 02:06:13,000
Yes

2959
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:13,920
What about his friend?

2960
02:06:13,930 --> 02:06:16,330
Most definitely!!

2961
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:17,580
What kind of voice is that?

2962
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:19,810
The friend's opinion will be adopted

2963
02:06:19,660 --> 02:06:20,430
Seriously!!!???

2964
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:20,900
Unsuccessful!!

2965
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,030
What the hell!

2966
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:26,640
0 points

2967
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:26,640
Endo

2968
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:26,640
Kurobikari Gakuen

2969
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:27,060
Now then...

2970
02:06:27,390 --> 02:06:29,690
A 7-tier try is enough to break even

2971
02:06:27,710 --> 02:06:34,650
8-tiers or more qualifies

2972
02:06:27,710 --> 02:06:34,650
Felistar Gakuen

2973
02:06:27,710 --> 02:06:34,650
for victory

2974
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:31,100
Why don't you go for 10 then?

2975
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:32,740
7 tiers will make you even, 8 tiers will make you win

2976
02:06:33,150 --> 02:06:34,680
Er, what is it?

2977
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:34,680
10 tiers??

2978
02:06:34,390 --> 02:06:35,000
10, yeah

2979
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:37,650
Oh my god that's so brave

2980
02:06:37,650 --> 02:06:40,320
Also, just one hand

2981
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:41,190
Huh? ONE HAND??

2982
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:42,730
My hand is not in good shape, that's all

2983
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:42,290
What?

2984
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:44,380
He's got tenosynovitis

2985
02:06:43,590 --> 02:06:47,330
So are you doing 10 tiers with one hand?

2986
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:46,980
That's so cool

2987
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:52,510
Celebrity teacher Nishikino goes for a whopping 10-tier vault with one hand,

2988
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:56,340
10-tiers vaulting box challenge!!

2989
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:56,340
Felistar Gakuen

2990
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:56,340
Nishikino Akira (64 years old)

2991
02:06:52,510 --> 02:06:56,340
if he is successful, Felistar Gakuen will be the winner without a doubt

2992
02:06:56,350 --> 02:06:57,160
Let's get it started

2993
02:06:57,340 --> 02:06:58,060
Ready...!

2994
02:06:57,770 --> 02:06:59,500
How on earth is he gonna manage it...

2995
02:06:59,670 --> 02:07:01,550
I can't watch this, is he sure about this?? It's scary

2996
02:07:01,110 --> 02:07:03,110
it'll be alright, do your best!

2997
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:04,620
Wouldn't it be better with both hands anyway?

2998
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:15,800
Resounding success!!

2999
02:07:14,420 --> 02:07:17,420
10 points

3000
02:07:14,420 --> 02:07:17,420
Felistar Gakuen

3001
02:07:14,420 --> 02:07:17,420
Nishikino

3002
02:07:17,380 --> 02:07:19,340
Felistar Gakuen is the winner!!

3003
02:07:19,830 --> 02:07:25,840
Felistar Gakuen Victory!

3004
02:07:23,850 --> 02:07:24,580
Now then!

3005
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:27,510
From the loser, Kurobikari Gakuen

3006
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:30,080
the most useless teacher among them is...!

3007
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:38,190
I really don't want it!!

3008
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:39,810
Obvious decision you know

3009
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:40,260
Yep, I totally get it

3010
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:43,080
Here he comes, here he comes

3011
02:07:44,210 --> 02:07:45,100
it'll be bloody painful!

3012
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:47,550
Oh man, aaaaaargh don't wanna do it!!

3013
02:07:47,650 --> 02:07:48,370
No compromise, is there?

3014
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:49,460
Ok, let's get this done

3015
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:50,800
I don't like this at all...

3016
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:52,790
Is that position ok?

3017
02:07:52,660 --> 02:07:54,160
Aaaargh seriously... oh wait wait!

3018
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:57,400
This is really scary, really is!!

3019
02:08:02,310 --> 02:08:04,910
I know it's painful from the sound of it

3020
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:07,940
It's the "asshole crusher"

3021
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:09,500
Must be, yeah

3022
02:08:11,430 --> 02:08:12,770
6 hours at work,

3023
02:08:12,430 --> 02:08:16,290
Teacher's duty 6 hours done

3024
02:08:13,390 --> 02:08:16,020
that man does never seem to cease to unleash his "potential"

3025
02:08:19,590 --> 02:08:21,010
We really are getting used to it, aren't we?

3026
02:08:21,010 --> 02:08:22,160
To Hamada's appearance, right?

3027
02:08:22,050 --> 02:08:23,500
At last, yes, I think so

3028
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:24,050
At last indeed

3029
02:08:24,270 --> 02:08:25,600
Well yeah I should hope so

3030
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:26,670
It's been a while...

3031
02:08:27,730 --> 02:08:29,570
Bit jealous...

3032
02:08:29,900 --> 02:08:32,200
Only with that wig, you know

3033
02:08:32,650 --> 02:08:34,480
Why don't you try it then, want me to lend it to you?

3034
02:08:36,210 --> 02:08:38,270
You know what, I'm not gonna look funny at all

3035
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:42,560
Ugh, don't wanna wear this

3036
02:08:42,660 --> 02:08:44,980
I won't be able to make anyone laugh...

3037
02:08:51,050 --> 02:08:52,690
So different.....

3038
02:08:53,870 --> 02:08:55,330
Totally different

3039
02:08:54,420 --> 02:08:56,000
Completely defeated

3040
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:57,590
Why is it so different though?

3041
02:08:58,090 --> 02:09:00,260
Hamada-san, how about this?

3042
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:01,670
Oh, the other way round?

3043
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:01,400
The other way round

3044
02:09:01,620 --> 02:09:02,560
Yeah, you see

3045
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:03,180
Ah alright

3046
02:09:02,570 --> 02:09:03,120
I see

3047
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:05,400
I don't think it will be...

3048
02:09:06,740 --> 02:09:08,740
It's the same as ours

3049
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:07,550
That's right

3050
02:09:07,570 --> 02:09:09,360
the 4 of us have been wearing this today so...

3051
02:09:21,970 --> 02:09:23,950
What is wrong with you!!?

3052
02:09:23,690 --> 02:09:25,210
Yeah, it's too much

3053
02:09:23,830 --> 02:09:25,220
Why me!!??

3054
02:09:26,510 --> 02:09:28,200
What is this, really?

3055
02:09:29,250 --> 02:09:30,830
Seriously!!

3056
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:31,280
Aaaaaargh Hamada-san!!!

3057
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:34,900
It doesn't matter what wig he's wearing

3058
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:35,800
Hamada-san!

3059
02:09:36,090 --> 02:09:36,740
Stop it man

3060
02:09:36,770 --> 02:09:40,440
Incredible, it really is his ammunition to take us down

3061
02:09:40,450 --> 02:09:44,000
Hamada's hair style has become a great threat again

3062
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:43,240
Hilarious

3063
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:43,520
Isn't it?

3064
02:09:51,670 --> 02:09:53,110
Oh jeez

3065
02:09:54,750 --> 02:09:55,280
Ouch!

3066
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:57,280
Argh!

3067
02:09:58,080 --> 02:10:00,590
Half of Hamada-san's face consists of forehead

3068
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:01,950
Yeah I usually hide it with the fringe

3069
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:03,310
I guess so

3070
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:16,100
Of course I can't help it if I get to see myself like that with expectation and all!

3071
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:21,880
He himself can't even stifle a laughter

3072
02:10:26,820 --> 02:10:27,920
That was a good smack

3073
02:10:28,730 --> 02:10:31,170
Aaaaaaaaargh it hurts, ow ow ow....

3074
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:32,820
Jesus, Hamada-san

3075
02:10:32,750 --> 02:10:34,080
Let's not push it any further

3076
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:36,080
Doesn't he need to wear that thing though?

3077
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:38,080
The mask?

3078
02:10:37,690 --> 02:10:41,900
seconds

3079
02:10:37,710 --> 02:10:41,900
The mask explodes in

3080
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:40,160
If you don't mind

3081
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:41,890
What, this thing?

3082
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:42,330
Yes

3083
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:44,300

You gotta be kidding

3086
02:10:56,660 --> 02:10:58,690

3087
02:10:58,160 --> 02:11:00,200

3094
02:11:23,990 --> 02:11:25,910
Anything goes at this stage man

02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:02,470

02:14:02,470 --> 02:14:05,170
Positive, eh? I guess it's very important isn't it?

3181
02:14:22,890 --> 02:14:24,810

I just think these two together will be such a burden for us, eh?

3204
02:15:21,810 --> 02:15:23,030
This combination, yes

3205
02:15:27,900 --> 02:15:28,810
Ah that hurts...

3206
02:15:29,800 --> 02:15:32,000
What's your plan for new year's holiday?

3207
02:15:32,740 --> 02:15:34,550
Well, I

3208
02:15:34,550 --> 02:15:38,250
I would love to go to Hawaii, I think

3209
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,250
Ah that's nice, I like Hawaii too

3210
02:15:38,260 --> 02:15:38,560

3213
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:49,390
gbol, globo, global standard, isn't it?

3214
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:54,040
Jesus does he still struggle with such a simple sentence??

3215
02:15:54,100 --> 02:15:55,470
What the hell happened to Onii?

3216
02:15:55,510 --> 02:15:57,110
Is that still not achievable?

3217
02:15:56,240 --> 02:15:58,480
Is be having a stage freight?

3218
02:15:57,120 --> 02:15:58,180

Uuuuuh it hurts...

3223
02:16:03,330 --> 02:16:06,300
I can sense something out of ordinary

3224
02:16:04,650 --> 02:16:06,080
He's not himself

3225
02:16:06,310 --> 02:16:07,190
Very stiff

3226
02:16:07,080 --> 02:16:07,450
Isn't he?

3227
02:16:07,290 --> 02:16:10,270
The extent of his nervousness is not normal

3228
02:16:08,980 --> 02:16:10,290

02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:14,070

3233
02:16:21,590 --> 02:16:25,620

OK guys

3239
02:16:40,250 --> 02:16:43,880
As teachers, you too should learn a lot about the world you live

3240
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:45,880
Your moobs are sagging like hell you know

3241
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:49,620
We're going to a little school trip!

3247
02:16:57,640 --> 02:17:02,080
Bus...

3248
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:02,080
I'm scared

3249
02:17:02,480 --> 02:17:04,770
Where are the five teachers heading to?

3250
02:17:06,510 --> 02:17:11,870
They will be steeping into the new world of laughter!!

3251
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:19,000
6h 30mins since the start of teaching duty

3252
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:18,650
They leave the school at once and take a ride to the destination

3253
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:22,660
Needless to speak, it will be plenty of obstacles waiting for them during the excursion

3254
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:26,340

Arriving at a bus stop

3258

Eh?

3259
02:17:36,990 --> 02:17:37,670
What is it?

3260
02:17:37,590 --> 02:17:38,130
Hmmm?

3261
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:39,970
Why are we stopping here?

3262
02:17:39,960 --> 02:17:41,240
Is someone getting on again then?

3263
02:17:42,310 --> 02:17:43,590

02:17:51,480 --> 02:17:53,120
I have secured you a role

3268
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:57,100
In a TV dre, dram, eh, 2-hour thr, thriller

3269
02:17:57,150 --> 02:17:59,580
OK, now..."Wednesday thriller drama;"

3270
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:03,960
"Hot springs murder case in Wakkanai; the threat from the past"

3271
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:05,160
I see

3272
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:07,150
You have another script right?

3273
02:18:07,150 --> 02:18:07,460
Yes

3274
02:18:08,050 --> 02:18:10,550
OK, let's do a read-through

3275
02:18:10,640 --> 02:18:11,370
Absolutely

3276
02:18:10,900 --> 02:18:18,500
Read-through of the script

3277
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:13,070
Ready?

3278
02:18:13,510 --> 02:18:15,430
"What made you summon me here?"

3279
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:18,500
"Actually, on that day I saw you in that place by accident"

3280
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:21,200
Hold on a minute

3281
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:21,200
You're not into the role at all!

3282
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:23,810
You have to really, express the feeling, you see?

3283
02:18:24,730 --> 02:18:25,190
Again

3284
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:28,650
"What made you summon me here?"

3285
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:30,760
"Actually, I saw you in that place by...."

3286
02:18:30,770 --> 02:18:35,150
That is RUBBISH

3287
02:18:32,470 --> 02:18:35,150
You're no good for this...OK then

3288
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:35,960
You can go

3289
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:36,730
I'm sorry

3290
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:37,960
What, you going?

3291
02:18:37,340 --> 02:18:37,880
Huh?

3292
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,410
Excuse me

3293
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:42,200
Yes, you. YOU.

3294
02:18:42,340 --> 02:18:43,060
Hey,

3295
02:18:43,860 --> 02:18:45,650
can you do a read-through with me?

3296
02:18:44,750 --> 02:18:51,000
Matsumoto selected as a read-through buddy

3297
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:47,120
Thank you sir

3298
02:18:48,750 --> 02:18:49,160
Ok...

3299
02:18:49,380 --> 02:18:51,150
Your part is the one with the red line, ok?

3300
02:18:51,150 --> 02:18:53,150
Erm, in...this...position...?

3301
02:18:54,850 --> 02:18:55,450
Let's do it...

3302
02:18:55,400 --> 02:18:56,060
Yes, let's do it

3303
02:18:58,310 --> 02:19:00,310
"What made you summon me here?"

3304
02:18:58,310 --> 02:19:00,310
(Kimiko)

3305
02:19:01,180 --> 02:19:02,500
"Actually, on that day..."

3306
02:19:01,180 --> 02:19:04,200
(Man A)

3307
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:04,460
"I saw you at that place by accident"

3308
02:19:04,720 --> 02:19:07,460
"Are you....?

3309
02:19:04,720 --> 02:19:15,300
(Kimiko)

3310
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:07,460
Are you suspicious of me??"

3311
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:11,050
"Just because I was there doesn't mean that I am the murderer!"

3312
02:19:11,130 --> 02:19:14,700
"I went straight to the airport by myself soon after I said good-bye to him"

3313
02:19:16,230 --> 02:19:16,730
YOU

3314
02:19:23,990 --> 02:19:25,380
Aren't you improvising too much!?

3315
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:26,970
I don't get the flow!!

3316
02:19:27,030 --> 02:19:28,970
I can't react to it if you say the phrase like that...

3317
02:19:29,050 --> 02:19:29,930
Oh no no no

3318
02:19:30,860 --> 02:19:32,390
What the hell is "YOU"!!!?

3319
02:19:33,940 --> 02:19:34,580
Ah

3320
02:19:34,890 --> 02:19:35,590
Ouch

3321
02:19:35,690 --> 02:19:38,100
You can't beat her with "getting into the role"

3322
02:19:37,290 --> 02:19:39,790
You're gonna have to up your game, don't you think?

3323
02:19:39,820 --> 02:19:42,200
It's in the script

3324
02:19:41,020 --> 02:19:42,200
Is it not??

3325
02:19:42,340 --> 02:19:43,600
Is it...?

3326
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:44,890
Right after "what made you...?"

3327
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:47,120
Here, look at it

3328
02:19:45,850 --> 02:19:50,200
Matsumoto, skipping the next phrase

3329
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:46,870
There

3330
02:19:47,150 --> 02:19:48,260
Oh, apologies for that

3331
02:19:48,170 --> 02:19:49,820
Shall we do it again then?

3332
02:19:48,700 --> 02:19:50,160
Ok, yes, sorry about that

3333
02:19:50,680 --> 02:19:52,900
"What made you summon me here?"

3334
02:19:50,680 --> 02:19:52,900
(Kimiko)

3335
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:55,520
"Actually, on that day I saw you in that place by accident"

3336
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:55,520
(Man A)

3337
02:19:55,620 --> 02:20:00,990
"are you..., are you suspicious of me!?"

3338
02:19:55,620 --> 02:20:04,300
(Kimiko)

3339
02:19:58,260 --> 02:20:00,990
"Just because I was there doesn't mean that I am the murderer!"

3340
02:20:01,060 --> 02:20:04,260
"I went straight to the airport by myself soon after I said good-bye to him"

3341
02:20:04,330 --> 02:20:07,220
"No, you did not go to the airport on that day!"

3342
02:20:04,330 --> 02:20:07,220
(Man A)

3343
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:11,510
"Don't you accuse me with such rubbish!"

3344
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:14,700
(Kimiko)

3345
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:11,510
"I went to Paris after that"

3346
02:20:11,730 --> 02:20:14,700
"Feel free to take a look at tickets or anything, if you feel so suspicious!"

3347
02:20:14,950 --> 02:20:20,900
"Sister!

3348
02:20:16,560 --> 02:20:20,900
Please stop...

3349
02:20:19,030 --> 02:20:20,900
Let's give it up"

3350
02:20:21,230 --> 02:20:25,250
"We can't defy our destiny even if we run away..."

3351
02:20:21,270 --> 02:20:33,100
*Enjoy the show even though they laughed already*

3352
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:27,840
"Kanae, What are you talking about?"

3353
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:33,120
Little sister Kanae:

3354
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:33,120
Nakayama Shinobu

3355
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:33,070
"We're finally free as birds after that man is gone forever!"

3356
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:39,040
"There is nothing to worry about,"

3357
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:39,650
(Kimiko)

3358
02:20:35,330 --> 02:20:39,040
"we'll live happy ever after, together. OK?"

3359
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:43,500
"Do you really think you can be happy?"

3360
02:20:45,490 --> 02:20:51,600
Prosecutor:

3361
02:20:45,490 --> 02:20:51,600
Toyota Maho

3362
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:51,370
"You are the one who murdered the man, is that right?"

3363
02:20:50,830 --> 02:20:51,700
What the hell is this?

3364
02:20:51,540 --> 02:20:52,860
What the heck is going on??

3365
02:20:51,800 --> 02:21:01,000
More actors join in the read-through

3366
02:20:53,330 --> 02:20:56,860
"I have no idea what you are talking about"

3367
02:20:55,530 --> 02:20:57,830
"At around 13.00 on that day,"

3368
02:20:58,210 --> 02:20:59,870
"You met up with the man in a hotel room"

3369
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:01,840
I can't follow the plot anymore...

3370
02:21:01,850 --> 02:21:05,720
"and you strangled him with the rope while he was having a shower..."

3371
02:21:01,850 --> 02:21:05,720
(Prosecutor)

3372
02:21:05,900 --> 02:21:08,560
"Stop!"

3373
02:21:05,900 --> 02:21:08,560
(Sister: Kanae)

3374
02:21:07,160 --> 02:21:08,560
"I don't want to hear it anymore!"

3375
02:21:08,570 --> 02:21:13,800
"Then you made everything look like he had commit suicide in the room - and you left"

3376
02:21:08,570 --> 02:21:13,800
(Prosecutor)

3377
02:21:13,810 --> 02:21:15,250
"Stop it!!!"

3378
02:21:13,810 --> 02:21:15,250
(Sister: Kanae)

3379
02:21:15,910 --> 02:21:18,240
"Everything started..."

3380
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:23,600
Detective:

3381
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:23,600
Kawahara Sabu

3382
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:23,520
"..with the accident that your father was responsible for, isn't it?"

3383
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:22,860
What a cast

3384
02:21:23,530 --> 02:21:26,690
Well, I mean, good casting but...

3385
02:21:25,030 --> 02:21:26,690
don't you think the outfit is too spot-on for a read-through??

3386
02:21:27,450 --> 02:21:31,940
"He accidentally ran over a person while driving"

3387
02:21:27,450 --> 02:21:36,770
(Detective)

3388
02:21:31,790 --> 02:21:33,240
Why are they doing this here...

3389
02:21:32,970 --> 02:21:36,640
"Since then, the man relatedly pestered you sisters for money"

3390
02:21:36,780 --> 02:21:41,400
"Not just that... he started demanding my body"

3391
02:21:36,780 --> 02:21:41,400
(Sister: Kanae)

3392
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:47,000
"He's not a man... he's a monster!

3393
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:47,000
(Kimiko)

3394
02:21:44,930 --> 02:21:47,000
That's why I killed him!!"

3395
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:47,200
She did it then

3396
02:21:47,010 --> 02:21:50,000
"We could be free at last!"

3397
02:21:47,010 --> 02:21:50,000
(Kimiko)

3398
02:21:50,130 --> 02:21:55,000
"You can never set yourself free by committing a crime!"

3399
02:21:50,130 --> 02:21:59,720
(Prosecutor)

3400
02:21:52,370 --> 02:21:53,610
What is going on here

3401
02:21:54,590 --> 02:21:55,820
What the hell is this complex story?

3402
02:21:55,110 --> 02:21:59,620
"Your conscience will be ch, ch, chained down forever"

3403
02:21:59,670 --> 02:22:09,270
"I... no, we, sisters...

3404
02:21:59,930 --> 02:22:15,340
(Kimiko)

3405
02:22:03,490 --> 02:22:09,370
We would find a quiet corner somewhere and build a small house,"

3406
02:22:09,480 --> 02:22:15,340
"I wouldn't need anything at all, as long as you can stay happy forever...!"

3407
02:22:17,300 --> 02:22:28,200
Anata (You)

3408
02:22:24,380 --> 02:22:25,000
Oh, is this...?

3409
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:40,830
*If I build a house one day*

3410
02:22:33,890 --> 02:22:40,400
Akiko Kosaka

3411
02:22:33,890 --> 02:22:40,400
Singer for the end-roll:

3412
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:41,760
She's having goose bumps

3413
02:22:40,830 --> 02:22:53,200
*It would be a small house I guess*

3414
02:22:51,320 --> 02:22:51,870
Jeez

3415
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:53,200
Oh man...

3416
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:59,750
*With red roses and white pansies*

3417
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:06,850
*By my side,

3418
02:23:03,250 --> 02:23:06,850
right by my side*

3419
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:09,550
*It's you*

3420
02:23:07,190 --> 02:23:21,610
The suspect came clean - 2-hour thriller FIN

3421
02:23:09,630 --> 02:23:12,310
*You*

3422
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:12,690
They are still in their roles

3423
02:23:12,690 --> 02:23:20,700
*I want you to be my side*

3424
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:15,630
Such professionals

3425
02:23:16,890 --> 02:23:18,180
Just wow

3426
02:23:22,190 --> 02:23:24,750
(Detective)

3427
02:23:22,190 --> 02:23:24,750
OK then, let's go

3428
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:24,750
Wait!

3429
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:24,020
What?

3430
02:23:24,770 --> 02:23:28,620
She is not gonna run away anymore

3431
02:23:27,140 --> 02:23:28,620
Handcuff won't be necessary

3432
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:31,920
(Detective)

3433
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:31,920
...Chief inspector!

3434
02:23:29,710 --> 02:23:30,910
Chief inspector!!?

3435
02:23:29,710 --> 02:23:30,910
Chief inspector!!?

3436
02:23:29,710 --> 02:23:30,910
Chief inspector!!?

3437
02:23:31,950 --> 02:23:33,780
You must have been suffering for a long time

3438
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:37,100
I hope you are feeling relieved by confessing it

3439
02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:38,660
Chief inspector

3440
02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:38,660
Fujiwara Hiroshi

3441
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:36,560
What is going on man?

3442
02:23:37,470 --> 02:23:38,060
Take her

3443
02:23:39,190 --> 02:23:42,270
Terrible acting

3444
02:23:43,530 --> 02:23:45,030
Huh?

3445
02:23:51,390 --> 02:23:52,730
What the hell!!??

3446
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:55,070
That was long

3447
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,550
I got totally swept by them

3448
02:23:56,170 --> 02:23:59,320
That is not something you would do on a bus ride...

3449
02:24:01,650 --> 02:24:02,440
Painful

3450
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:03,520
Wakkanai...

3451
02:24:03,870 --> 02:24:05,230
Why Wakkanai...?

3452
02:24:06,420 --> 02:24:10,000
The script was totally blank wasn't it?

3453
02:24:09,970 --> 02:24:10,730
Yes yes yes

3454
02:24:10,020 --> 02:24:14,090
They were improvising right?

3455
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:14,090
Yeah that was a huge surprise

3456
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:17,570
Hey Fujiwara...

3457
02:24:17,570 --> 02:24:19,840
Didn't know that you are the chief inspector!

3458
02:24:18,770 --> 02:24:19,840
Yeah, all of a sudden

3459
02:24:19,980 --> 02:24:23,810
This 2h thriller will get a very high rating for sure!

3460
02:24:26,120 --> 02:24:27,230
Of course we ignore him

3461
02:24:29,270 --> 02:24:32,180
The casting was top-notch

3462
02:24:32,690 --> 02:24:39,350
"Social study excursion" ...

3463
02:24:32,690 --> 02:24:39,350
where are they heading to!?

3464
02:24:33,550 --> 02:24:35,500
"Social study excursion" led by Fujiwara

3465
02:24:35,830 --> 02:24:38,790
Where are they heading to?

3466
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:40,850
Guys,

3467
02:24:41,270 --> 02:24:45,030
We are approaching the destination for this excursion

3468
02:24:45,050 --> 02:24:45,390
Okey

3469
02:24:45,400 --> 02:24:45,610
Yes

3470
02:24:45,620 --> 02:24:47,030
Today's destination is,

3471
02:24:47,330 --> 02:24:48,640
"Edo" period!!

3472
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:53,230
(Edo period: 1603-1868, the last "Samurai -warrior-" era in history)

3473
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:56,880
Edo period

3474
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:56,880
Social study excursion destination:

3475
02:24:50,620 --> 02:24:53,230
We're gonna go back in time to Edo period,

3476
02:24:53,230 --> 02:24:56,880
(Edo: old name for Tokyo)

3477
02:24:53,360 --> 02:24:56,230
and explore the Edo city

3478
02:24:56,900 --> 02:25:01,840
We're going back in time when we press this button

3479
02:25:01,870 --> 02:25:02,520
You ready?

3480
02:25:02,520 --> 02:25:04,820
Wha..?

3481
02:25:02,870 --> 02:25:06,020
Excuse me, I don't get it

3482
02:25:05,150 --> 02:25:05,970
We're going back in time...

3483
02:25:06,180 --> 02:25:08,050
We're going to Edo period.

3484
02:25:08,190 --> 02:25:13,060
We're gonna learn about Edu,

3485
02:25:09,580 --> 02:25:13,060
social stu,

3486
02:25:10,450 --> 02:25:13,060
Em, Edi...

3487
02:25:14,670 --> 02:25:16,230
Let's go back in time

3488
02:25:16,250 --> 02:25:17,630
Kabooooom!!

3489
02:25:17,830 --> 02:25:19,590
Whoa, we're time-slipping!!

3490
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:29,300
Whooa, we're going back in time!

3491
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,070
Whoa, can you feel it happening!!?

3492
02:25:33,010 --> 02:25:34,350
Oooooo, getting close!

3493
02:25:34,910 --> 02:25:35,680
To Edo period?

3494
02:25:35,770 --> 02:25:36,480
To Edo period, yes.

3495
02:25:36,510 --> 02:25:38,080
To Edo Period...

3496
02:25:37,610 --> 02:25:38,040
what?

3497
02:25:38,310 --> 02:25:41,820
Arrived in Edo period

3498
02:25:39,480 --> 02:25:40,250
Finally we're here

3499
02:25:40,550 --> 02:25:41,490
Looks the same

3500
02:25:42,540 --> 02:25:45,190
So it Is Edo period when

3501
02:25:43,210 --> 02:25:45,190
we step out of the bus?

3502
02:25:43,710 --> 02:25:44,980
That's right

3503
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:47,860
So that was the button for time travelling?

3504
02:25:47,860 --> 02:25:49,120
That's right

3505
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:51,950
So we time travelled to get to Edo period

3506
02:25:52,120 --> 02:25:52,940
Heard it million times already

3507
02:25:53,360 --> 02:26:00,340
Hey take a look,

3508
02:25:54,960 --> 02:26:00,340
this is, THE real

3509
02:25:57,530 --> 02:26:00,340
Edo period!

3510
02:25:59,060 --> 02:26:00,500
Oh wow

3511
02:26:00,030 --> 02:26:01,040
Looks awesome

3512
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:02,660
Very nicely built

3513
02:26:02,660 --> 02:26:05,810
The city looks exactly what you see in the history text book, eh?

3514
02:26:07,400 --> 02:26:16,360
Edo period

3515
02:26:07,710 --> 02:26:14,590
They arrived in the Edo period when Tokugawa Dynasty was in absolute power...

3516
02:26:14,810 --> 02:26:26,600
"Alternative Edo period"

3517
02:26:14,810 --> 02:26:26,600
Next stage of batsu game:

3518
02:26:14,810 --> 02:26:26,600
The fight against the new bastu assassins will begin

3519
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:21,450
However, this is a place you wouldn't find in a history book...

3520
02:26:21,480 --> 02:26:26,600
the alternative Edo period, lost in time...

3521
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:28,830
Shall we go then

3522
02:26:28,400 --> 02:26:29,960
What, so, have we had a time travel?

3523
02:26:29,960 --> 02:26:32,770
Absolutely; we have arrived in Edo period for real!

3524
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:37,700
A castle town in Edo

3525
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:33,960
"real" Edo period??

3526
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:36,990
Yep, look at the city - looks exactly like what you would see in text book

3527
02:26:36,430 --> 02:26:38,180
How many times does he say that?

3528
02:26:40,580 --> 02:26:41,810
WHAT

3529
02:26:41,210 --> 02:26:41,820
This way

3530
02:26:42,410 --> 02:26:43,340
What the hell is this...?

3531
02:26:43,890 --> 02:26:46,120
Can you line up in front of the statue here?

3532
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:45,650
Oh here goes again

3533
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:48,000
Would something like this have really existed in the period?

3534
02:26:46,980 --> 02:26:47,340
Whoa

3535
02:26:49,070 --> 02:26:50,980
Hamada, Matsumoto, Yamasaki here...

3536
02:26:51,890 --> 02:26:52,370
Huh?

3537
02:26:52,490 --> 02:26:54,260
Look at the statue

3538
02:26:54,280 --> 02:27:02,400
This is,

3539
02:26:55,580 --> 02:27:02,400
the statue of the 16th Tokugawa Shogun,

3540
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:02,400
Lord Kogemitsu Tokugawa

3541
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:02,400
Did it not end after 15th guy?

3542
02:27:02,420 --> 02:27:04,000
Another one after Yoshinobu (15th Shogun)?

3543
02:27:02,860 --> 02:27:07,540
16th Shogun

3544
02:27:02,860 --> 02:27:07,540
Tokugawa Kogemitsu

3545
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:08,810
By the way,

3546
02:27:05,560 --> 02:27:08,810
you can't wonder around with clothes like that

3547
02:27:08,960 --> 02:27:11,180
otherwise people will be suspicious of you

3548
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:12,580
You guys need change into something, ok?

3549
02:27:12,630 --> 02:27:17,820
Each of you has clothes in cubicles over there

3550
02:27:14,760 --> 02:27:17,820
So please change into Edo period-appropriate outfit!

3551
02:27:17,830 --> 02:27:18,950
OK let's change in something more appropriate

3552
02:27:18,060 --> 02:27:19,130
Oh man...

3553
02:27:19,050 --> 02:27:21,180
Second costume....?

3554
02:27:19,340 --> 02:27:26,630
Changing into more appropriate clothes

3555
02:27:19,340 --> 02:27:26,630
in order to blend in

3556
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:26,290
Everyone changes into something more suitable for this period

3557
02:27:27,950 --> 02:27:30,290
First up is...

3558
02:27:31,250 --> 02:27:36,900
Fujiwara changed into a typical town girl

3559
02:27:33,870 --> 02:27:35,280
Are you all ready??

3560
02:27:35,550 --> 02:27:36,680
Yeah

3561
02:27:35,550 --> 02:27:36,680
Yeah

3562
02:27:35,550 --> 02:27:36,680
Yeah

3563
02:27:35,550 --> 02:27:36,680
Yeah

3564
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:36,780
Yeah

3565
02:27:36,930 --> 02:27:39,040
OK then can you all come out at once?

3566
02:27:39,050 --> 02:27:40,540
Go ahead

3567
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:49,580
The five change into classic traveller's clothes

3568
02:27:43,810 --> 02:27:47,500
You all look good; totally nailing the Edo style

3569
02:27:48,150 --> 02:27:48,580
...Okay...

3570
02:27:48,900 --> 02:27:49,200
Hmm

3571
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:53,810
Yamasaki.

3572
02:27:52,310 --> 02:27:53,810
Can you produce some words of praise?

3573
02:27:54,980 --> 02:27:56,680
What, about you?

3574
02:27:56,720 --> 02:27:58,680
Um, well, eh...pretty...

3575
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:00,090
Pretty kimono you're wearing

3576
02:28:00,120 --> 02:28:01,590
Thank you

3577
02:28:01,610 --> 02:28:03,260
OK let's explore then

3578
02:28:03,420 --> 02:28:06,400
What the hell...?

3579
02:28:06,430 --> 02:28:07,240
Yeah OK

3580
02:28:06,970 --> 02:28:09,460
What does he want from this shitty talk??

3581
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:09,930
Why a town girl costume...?

3582
02:28:09,950 --> 02:28:11,890
He looks like Anmitsu Hime

3583
02:28:09,950 --> 02:28:12,940
(Anmitsu Hime: Heroin in a comedy cartoon popular in 80s)

3584
02:28:10,420 --> 02:28:12,350
Why would you want "words of praise" anyway??

3585
02:28:11,930 --> 02:28:12,950
Anmitsu Hime, right?

3586
02:28:13,460 --> 02:28:17,030
It looks so real - very detailed

3587
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:20,010
You sure that people won't notice that we don't belong here?

3588
02:28:20,040 --> 02:28:24,150
No worries, you guys blend in perfectly

3589
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:24,680
Who are we dressed up as?

3590
02:28:24,940 --> 02:28:28,490
Once we cross this bridge we'll get to the town centre

3591
02:28:28,720 --> 02:28:35,930
Town centre

3592
02:28:28,750 --> 02:28:31,180
Can you form a line here?

3593
02:28:31,010 --> 02:28:31,880
Wow

3594
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:33,160
Wow it looks awesome!

3595
02:28:33,180 --> 02:28:34,160
Gosh it's cold

3596
02:28:33,990 --> 02:28:34,590
Wow

3597
02:28:34,800 --> 02:28:35,590
Impressive

3598
02:28:36,020 --> 02:28:36,730
Where do you want us to line up?

3599
02:28:37,290 --> 02:28:38,400
Facing that way?

3600
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:39,520
Amazing

3601
02:28:39,330 --> 02:28:39,850
Uh huh

3602
02:28:40,930 --> 02:28:43,720
The town centre is just minutes away from here

3603
02:28:43,820 --> 02:28:44,150
Hmm?

3604
02:28:44,640 --> 02:28:45,010
Oh?

3605
02:28:46,090 --> 02:28:49,110
Who are they?

3606
02:28:47,590 --> 02:28:48,250
Look

3607
02:28:54,570 --> 02:28:58,950
"Secret"

3608
02:28:55,160 --> 02:28:58,950
HERE SHE IS!!

3609
02:28:59,700 --> 02:29:00,800
Who are they?

3610
02:29:01,430 --> 02:29:01,830
Look

3611
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:12,260

3612
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:12,260
Shimizu no Jirocho

3613
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:14,720
(Shimizu no Jirocho: Famous mafia member in late Edo period - active around Shimizu area)

3614
02:29:11,590 --> 02:29:16,720
(Endo's name)

3615
02:29:11,590 --> 02:29:16,720
Shozo!

3616
02:29:12,950 --> 02:29:16,720
I didn't know you would be here in Edo town!

3617
02:29:17,270 --> 02:29:18,870
Wasn't expecting him here!!

3618
02:29:19,970 --> 02:29:21,520
Him again?

3619
02:29:21,570 --> 02:29:25,170
You know, I thought he seems someone familiar

3620
02:29:22,140 --> 02:29:22,870
Really?

3621
02:29:24,830 --> 02:29:29,600
Additional rule: The five will be pun

3622
02:29:24,830 --> 02:29:29,600
ished by Ninja squad in Edo period

3623
02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:26,420
This was totally unexpected - ouch

3624
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:26,880
Ah!

3625
02:29:26,880 --> 02:29:27,510
Ouch!!

3626
02:29:27,830 --> 02:29:30,430
Seriously, we didn't think it would be him right?

3627
02:29:28,810 --> 02:29:30,430
I didn't think he would be here

3628
02:29:29,780 --> 02:29:30,430
Ah hurts...

3629
02:29:32,510 --> 02:29:34,890
Greetings!

02:29:41,380 --> 02:29:43,060
given name is Toshihide

3633
02:29:43,060 --> 02:29:45,490
People call me as...

3634
02:29:44,060 --> 02:29:45,490
Shimizu no Jirocho!

3635
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:49,070
Completely different name

3636
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:49,070
Completely different name

3637
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:49,070
Name is different

3638
02:29:47,060 --> 02:29:49,070
Toshihide, isn't it

3639
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:51,500
This one over here is called Ohmasa

3640
02:29:51,530 --> 02:29:52,940
Hey, your turn to greet them

3641
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,040
Would it be...?

3642
02:29:53,810 --> 02:29:55,040
Well, it could well be...

3643
02:29:54,170 --> 02:29:54,960
Definitely is

3644
02:29:55,080 --> 02:29:56,420
It will be...

3645
02:29:55,860 --> 02:29:56,480
Really?

3646
02:29:56,550 --> 02:29:57,310
I'm convinced

3647
02:29:56,740 --> 02:29:59,740
Endo Kiyomi (mother)

3648
02:29:56,740 --> 02:29:59,740
Jirocho Clan, Ohmasa

3649
02:30:01,240 --> 02:30:03,720
What the hell is going on with my family??

3650
02:30:04,300 --> 02:30:05,960
Greetings

3651
02:30:09,360 --> 02:30:11,700
She is incredible...

3652
02:30:11,700 --> 02:30:13,700
She can't get into it

3653
02:30:13,700 --> 02:30:15,700
This is dangerous

3654
02:30:18,020 --> 02:30:20,500
A woman saying that...

3655
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:22,570
She is moving her hand so much

3656
02:30:23,590 --> 02:30:24,740
Greetings

3657
02:30:24,790 --> 02:30:29,170
My family name is Endo,

3658
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:29,170
my given name is Kiyomi

3659
02:30:29,210 --> 02:30:31,800
People call me Ohmasa

3660
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:34,610
My father is..

3661
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:35,950
I am sorry

3662
02:30:37,700 --> 02:30:40,820
It's ok, don't worry

3663
02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:46,680
That kind of act is impossible for my mother

3664
02:30:47,500 --> 02:30:49,720
It's impossible, so...

3665
02:30:53,080 --> 02:30:55,490
It's fine, don't force yourself

3666
02:30:55,560 --> 02:30:58,290
My first kiss was when I was 18

3667
02:31:00,290 --> 02:31:02,240
It was with the boss

3668
02:31:02,260 --> 02:31:06,680
The one who snatched my first kiss,

3669
02:31:04,730 --> 02:31:06,680
was the boss

3670
02:31:06,840 --> 02:31:11,550
But,

3671
02:31:07,540 --> 02:31:11,550
in this society, the boss is a very good person

3672
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:15,950
what does that mean?

3673
02:31:15,740 --> 02:31:17,380
It's enough seriously

3674
02:31:19,740 --> 02:31:22,160
There is still one more person to speak

3675
02:31:25,150 --> 02:31:27,200
That is the end of my introduction

3676
02:31:27,220 --> 02:31:29,630
Nice to meet you

3677
02:31:29,960 --> 02:31:33,070
We can guess who is the last one

3678
02:31:31,490 --> 02:31:33,070
It can't be anybody but him

3679
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:38,240
Endo Junji (little brother)

3680
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:38,240
Jirocho Clan - Komasa

3681
02:31:37,400 --> 02:31:39,100
Greetings

3682
02:31:39,730 --> 02:31:41,010
I...

3683
02:31:41,100 --> 02:31:43,710
people call me

3684
02:31:41,140 --> 02:31:43,710
Komasa

3685
02:31:45,470 --> 02:31:47,920
Recently,

3686
02:31:46,530 --> 02:31:47,920
something shocking happened in our house

3687
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:52,290
Our dog is

3688
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:52,290
pregnant!!

3689
02:31:55,620 --> 02:31:59,020
That's irrelevant, I don't want to know

3690
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:03,070
I don't care about that episode

3691
02:32:03,090 --> 02:32:06,300
Miruku-chan is our dog, and she came back home pregnant

3692
02:32:06,330 --> 02:32:08,510
Her breasts also became bigger

3693
02:32:08,560 --> 02:32:12,610
That's the end,

3694
02:32:10,870 --> 02:32:12,610
nice to meet you

3695
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:17,300
Shozo,

3696
02:32:14,630 --> 02:32:17,300
these are our family members

3697
02:32:17,930 --> 02:32:18,780
I almost forgot

3698
02:32:19,320 --> 02:32:20,280
There is another member

3699
02:32:21,080 --> 02:32:22,680
Oi!! Come here!!

3700
02:32:24,990 --> 02:32:25,920
What?

3701
02:32:25,950 --> 02:32:26,920
Are you kidding me?

3702
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:35,500
Chiaki (Ex-wife)

3703
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:35,500
Mori no Migimatsu

3704
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:35,780
HERE SHE IS!!!

3705
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:38,770
Here she is!!

3706
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:41,570
Onii,

3707
02:32:39,580 --> 02:32:41,570
long time no see

3708
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:48,620
Enough of Chiaki

3709
02:32:47,500 --> 02:32:53,320
His ex-wife and his family - A miraculous performance together

3710
02:32:51,680 --> 02:32:53,300
This is awkward

3711
02:32:53,340 --> 02:32:55,850
Onii, it's been some time

3712
02:32:55,880 --> 02:32:57,490
My given name is Chiaki

3713
02:32:57,520 --> 02:33:00,890
People call me Mori no Migimatsu

3714
02:33:00,910 --> 02:33:02,390
Ten years ago...

3715
02:33:02,440 --> 02:33:07,160
I married 3rd grade comedian Endo Shozo

3716
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:10,530
We had really sweet and loving times

3717
02:33:11,460 --> 02:33:14,340
They are listening

3718
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:22,850
Chiaki, my parents are listening

3719
02:33:22,870 --> 02:33:23,980
His parents are going to hear you

3720
02:33:24,700 --> 02:33:28,090
Moreover,

3721
02:33:25,300 --> 02:33:28,090
there were photos taken while we were drinking once.

3722
02:33:28,110 --> 02:33:31,290
After divorce,

3723
02:33:29,500 --> 02:33:31,290
keep writing your own gags.

3724
02:33:31,480 --> 02:33:36,330
Like right now, here,

3725
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:36,330
in this special show, for the sake of making people laugh,

3726
02:33:36,350 --> 02:33:39,430
you get called to this pstion

3727
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:45,600
Speak properly

3728
02:33:49,900 --> 02:33:54,480
There are so many traps just in this spot...

3729
02:33:54,720 --> 02:33:56,240
We want to do this faster!

3730
02:33:56,440 --> 02:33:59,480
The end, nice to meet you

3731
02:34:00,010 --> 02:34:02,290
Shozo,

3732
02:34:00,870 --> 02:34:02,290
do your best!

3733
02:34:02,310 --> 02:34:04,350
Farewell

3734
02:34:04,380 --> 02:34:06,900
These 4 together is certainly awkward

3735
02:34:06,900 --> 02:34:07,940
Do they meet in private?

3736
02:34:07,940 --> 02:34:09,090
They do not

3737
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:13,260
After the divorce

3738
02:34:09,910 --> 02:34:13,260
this is the first time like this

3739
02:34:13,290 --> 02:34:15,070
It's been 5 years

3740
02:34:16,160 --> 02:34:18,740
Let's move on

3741
02:34:18,760 --> 02:34:21,840
This is an amazing beginning of the edo period for me

3742
02:34:25,970 --> 02:34:28,950
After we enter the district there will be more people

3743
02:34:30,340 --> 02:34:32,920
This is amazing

3744
02:34:33,510 --> 02:34:36,590
Kogemitsu Clan

3745
02:34:33,510 --> 02:34:36,590
Kogemitsu Clan

3746
02:34:38,410 --> 02:34:40,360
What?

3747
02:34:40,380 --> 02:34:41,260
What's wrong?

3748
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:43,260
The Kogemitsu Clan thing...

3749
02:34:43,270 --> 02:34:44,160
You laughed?

3750
02:34:44,180 --> 02:34:46,430
No, I did not laugh at all

3751
02:34:48,040 --> 02:34:49,960
Fujiwara please, scold him about this

3752
02:34:50,020 --> 02:34:55,570
I always hear this by my side:

3753
02:34:51,290 --> 02:34:55,570
Hyuuuuu hyuuuu

3754
02:34:54,560 --> 02:34:55,570
or something like that.

3755
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:57,520
That's wrong you know

3756
02:34:57,660 --> 02:34:58,640
Did I do that?

3757
02:34:58,760 --> 02:35:01,300
"Did I do that?" you ask it again...

3758
02:35:01,540 --> 02:35:04,420
like you want to make me laugh.

3759
02:35:05,800 --> 02:35:08,140
That's not right, that "hyuuu"

3760
02:35:08,980 --> 02:35:12,960
There does not seem to be anyone

3761
02:35:14,900 --> 02:35:16,840
They will appear

3762
02:35:17,850 --> 02:35:21,160
Suddenly, a collision noise

3763
02:35:20,060 --> 02:35:21,100
What's this sound?

3764
02:35:23,090 --> 02:35:25,200
There is smoke over there!!

3765
02:35:25,230 --> 02:35:26,460
Let's go look!

3766
02:35:28,460 --> 02:35:29,130
Fire?

3767
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:30,500
What the hell is that?

3768
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:30,500
Incredible

3769
02:35:31,150 --> 02:35:33,880
Here,

3770
02:35:32,270 --> 02:35:33,880
everyone come here

3771
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:38,750
A place filled with smoke appears

3772
02:35:35,900 --> 02:35:37,600
So much smoke

3773
02:35:37,760 --> 02:35:38,800
What's this?

3774
02:35:44,200 --> 02:35:45,460
What?

3775
02:35:48,420 --> 02:35:52,200
It's a time slip

3776
02:35:48,920 --> 02:35:54,400
Terminator appears in Edo period

3777
02:36:03,100 --> 02:36:07,000
Censured

3778
02:36:09,870 --> 02:36:12,000
Censured

3779
02:36:09,870 --> 02:36:15,790
Itao Itsuji

3780
02:36:09,870 --> 02:36:15,790
Terminator:

3781
02:36:13,910 --> 02:36:16,800
There's no need of that kind of entrance

3782
02:36:22,450 --> 02:36:23,530
What does this mean?

3783
02:36:23,550 --> 02:36:27,300
During his time slip

3784
02:36:25,150 --> 02:36:27,300
did he get the time wrong?

3785
02:36:29,700 --> 02:36:30,540
You are kidding right?

3786
02:36:31,290 --> 02:36:33,540
Why is he not wearing any clothes?

3787
02:36:35,850 --> 02:36:36,610
Hey you

3788
02:36:37,360 --> 02:36:39,580
did you forget to put clothes on this morning?

3789
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:45,350
Terminator VS Group of samurais

3790
02:36:40,200 --> 02:36:42,840
If you do a dogeza (prostrate) we might let you live

3791
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:53,980
Amazing performance

3792
02:36:59,660 --> 02:37:04,200
Terminator's incredible apparition

3793
02:37:01,480 --> 02:37:02,940
We are sorry

3794
02:37:04,590 --> 02:37:08,740
His p*nis... is shrinking by the minute

3795
02:37:09,630 --> 02:37:11,440
I was surprised!

3796
02:37:12,500 --> 02:37:14,860
It was actually longer than this...

3797
02:37:14,860 --> 02:37:16,860
And it was cold

3798
02:37:22,610 --> 02:37:25,120
The shrinking part got me...

3799
02:37:25,610 --> 02:37:30,360
At first I thought he was wearing one of those that look like you're not wearing anything...

3800
02:37:30,380 --> 02:37:34,930
that's why I thought I didn't see anything...

3801
02:37:32,400 --> 02:37:34,930
but it's just that it's shrinking

3802
02:37:34,950 --> 02:37:36,500
There was something there...

3803
02:37:36,660 --> 02:37:38,430
Let's move on

3804
02:37:43,130 --> 02:37:46,680
We are also

3805
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:46,680
on a time slip that is

3806
02:37:45,030 --> 02:37:46,680
different from his

3807
02:37:46,920 --> 02:37:48,800
The generation is...

3808
02:37:51,500 --> 02:37:55,890
Let's board the boat cabin

3809
02:37:54,780 --> 02:37:55,890
Where are we going?

3810
02:37:55,910 --> 02:37:57,470
Is this order ok?

3811
02:37:56,700 --> 02:38:02,700
Trip in a boat cabin to the east of Edo city

3812
02:37:57,480 --> 02:38:00,260
For the 5 to understand the Edo city even more,

3813
02:38:00,540 --> 02:38:03,420
we let them enjoy the boat cabin.

3814
02:38:03,790 --> 02:38:05,420
Look! Koi!

3815
02:38:06,580 --> 02:38:07,740
Amazing

3816
02:38:09,900 --> 02:38:14,360
A peaceful and quiet moment...

3817
02:38:10,780 --> 02:38:14,360
This is supposed to be a relaxed trip for the 5, however...

3818
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:19,510
They can't let their guard down

3819
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:19,510
They can't let their guard down

3820
02:38:29,740 --> 02:38:30,740
It was a little long, wasn't it?

3821
02:38:30,750 --> 02:38:31,750
It was.

3822
02:38:44,690 --> 02:38:46,270
What is this?

3823
02:38:48,490 --> 02:38:50,970
Nothing happened...

3824
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:54,410
Nothing happened and...

3825
02:38:52,500 --> 02:38:54,410
I thought, this is not good...

3826
02:38:55,140 --> 02:38:58,760
Really, we will get sick of this

3827
02:38:58,810 --> 02:39:00,760
Nothing happened at all

3828
02:39:00,760 --> 02:39:05,320
In the end, the trip ends with nothing happening at all

3829
02:39:01,570 --> 02:39:05,150
The trip ends with nothing happening at all

3830
02:39:09,780 --> 02:39:11,960
Once we got out we got punished

3831
02:39:12,520 --> 02:39:13,840
Nothing happened at all

3832
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:17,500
That was long, seriously!

3833
02:39:16,500 --> 02:39:18,200
What the hell?! Ah!!

3834
02:39:18,500 --> 02:39:21,390
I was certain something

3835
02:39:18,500 --> 02:39:21,390
was going to appear from the lake

3836
02:39:22,420 --> 02:39:24,240
That was really funny

3837
02:39:24,430 --> 02:39:27,840
It was something new

3838
02:39:29,070 --> 02:39:32,350
This is your station

3839
02:39:37,380 --> 02:39:40,890
Edo's rookie training room

3840
02:39:39,780 --> 02:39:44,820
Please sit at your own respective seats

3841
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:48,230
Isn't this amazing?

3842
02:39:47,220 --> 02:39:50,300
This is just amazing

3843
02:39:50,360 --> 02:39:52,200
Take a rest

3844
02:39:52,780 --> 02:39:54,300
Just amazing

3845
02:39:54,530 --> 02:39:57,440
Here is our room

3846
02:39:58,680 --> 02:40:03,410
Yes, once again, they'll see what's in the drawers

3847
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:03,410
7:30 minutes since the start

3848
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:03,410
Brief stop of activities

3849
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:06,950
I only took a glance on this but, what is it?

3850
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:09,420
This is a claw crane machine for the figure Tokugawa Kogemitsu

3851
02:40:09,440 --> 02:40:15,960
Tokugawa Kogemitsu giveaways

3852
02:40:10,580 --> 02:40:12,600
I don't want to play it

3853
02:40:12,720 --> 02:40:13,740
What is written?

3854
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:14,700
100 yen?

3855
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:15,800
It's 100 yen

3856
02:40:16,720 --> 02:40:18,590
So it's using cash

3857
02:40:18,880 --> 02:40:21,520
Ah!! maybe it's in the drawers?

3858
02:40:20,700 --> 02:40:21,430
In one of them

3859
02:40:21,440 --> 02:40:27,870
On the lookout for the contents of the drawers

3860
02:40:22,540 --> 02:40:23,360
It's here

3861
02:40:23,360 --> 02:40:24,620
It's here too?

3862
02:40:24,760 --> 02:40:26,620
Maybe it's in the drawer of one of us

3863
02:40:26,620 --> 02:40:29,860
We just arrived and we have to do this again?

3864
02:40:31,620 --> 02:40:33,780
Let's do this then, from here

3865
02:40:33,870 --> 02:40:37,650
First batter: Endo

3866
02:40:35,620 --> 02:40:38,100
Well we don't know yet

3867
02:40:39,720 --> 02:40:40,960
Nothing

3868
02:40:41,810 --> 02:40:43,760
It might be something old too...

3869
02:40:44,660 --> 02:40:46,160
There's something

3870
02:40:46,550 --> 02:40:51,130
Lots of 100 yen coins

3871
02:40:47,660 --> 02:40:50,080
There are a lot of coins

3872
02:40:50,460 --> 02:40:51,800
Open everything

3873
02:40:52,920 --> 02:40:54,350
Waa... again

3874
02:40:54,920 --> 02:40:55,920
It appeared

3875
02:40:57,760 --> 02:41:00,200
Look at this

3876
02:40:57,760 --> 02:41:03,760
Weekly tabloid magazine

3877
02:41:00,230 --> 02:41:03,840
Why are they bringing this here again

3878
02:41:03,860 --> 02:41:05,680
Then it's my turn

3879
02:41:06,200 --> 02:41:07,200
Wa!!

3880
02:41:08,130 --> 02:41:12,110
This is probably the same too

3881
02:41:10,940 --> 02:41:12,110
There is enough 100 yen coin

3882
02:41:12,140 --> 02:41:12,920
There is enough 100 yen coin

3883
02:41:14,600 --> 02:41:16,950
Ramen?

3884
02:41:17,780 --> 02:41:29,000
Black

3885
02:41:17,780 --> 02:41:29,000
Suga Cup

3886
02:41:17,780 --> 02:41:29,000
Tonkatsu with black oil

3887
02:41:17,780 --> 02:41:37,910
Cup ramen

3888
02:41:29,160 --> 02:41:31,420
I should be safe, come on!

3889
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:35,400
Suga-san's face is...

3890
02:41:35,500 --> 02:41:37,980
What the heck

3891
02:41:36,680 --> 02:41:38,140
Suga Cup

3892
02:41:38,140 --> 02:41:39,900
That is all

3893
02:41:40,100 --> 02:41:41,790
I think there's one for each of us

3894
02:41:41,800 --> 02:41:42,420
Gasu?

3895
02:41:43,240 --> 02:41:45,700
These are edible right?

3896
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:48,300
Tonkatsu with black oil

3897
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:48,390
Black

3898
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:48,390
Suga Cup

3899
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:55,200
Cup ramen

3900
02:41:45,900 --> 02:41:47,780
I wonder how does it taste

3901
02:41:48,400 --> 02:41:50,500
Black

3902
02:41:48,400 --> 02:41:50,500
Suga Cup

3903
02:41:50,510 --> 02:41:55,200
1.8 times

3904
02:41:50,510 --> 02:41:55,200
Tonkatsu with black oil

3905
02:41:50,580 --> 02:41:52,420
1.8 times, it says

3906
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:57,590
Let's look at this (the panel)

3907
02:41:58,620 --> 02:42:05,370
Hamada (Baby Gorilla)

3908
02:42:00,350 --> 02:42:02,940
This picture is seriously...

3909
02:42:03,320 --> 02:42:05,500
It shouldn't be allowed

3910
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:07,800
Tanaka, want to go next?

3911
02:42:06,520 --> 02:42:07,800
Yes

3912
02:42:12,730 --> 02:42:13,730
A scroll

3913
02:42:12,730 --> 02:42:16,710
Suspicious scroll

3914
02:42:13,740 --> 02:42:14,740
A scroll

3915
02:42:14,750 --> 02:42:15,650
What could it be?

3916
02:42:15,660 --> 02:42:17,380
Put it away for now

3917
02:42:17,420 --> 02:42:19,380
Isn't it a hanging scroll?

3918
02:42:21,240 --> 02:42:22,100
Nothing here

3919
02:42:22,520 --> 02:42:23,540
Last one

3920
02:42:24,800 --> 02:42:25,760
Nothing

3921
02:42:26,180 --> 02:42:27,760
Then I will go

3922
02:42:28,550 --> 02:42:29,760
next

3923
02:42:31,560 --> 02:42:32,330
Nothing

3924
02:42:34,780 --> 02:42:35,500
There's something there

3925
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:36,500
Ahh what the hell is that?

3926
02:42:39,720 --> 02:42:41,820
Maybe it's full of coins for that

3927
02:42:41,930 --> 02:42:45,310
Suspicious box

3928
02:42:43,800 --> 02:42:45,640
It is for that, right?

3929
02:42:45,800 --> 02:42:48,110
Eh?

3930
02:42:50,200 --> 02:42:52,350
Ticking sound

3931
02:42:53,260 --> 02:42:54,380
Wait a moment

3932
02:42:54,440 --> 02:42:56,920
This seems like a time bomb

3933
02:43:01,150 --> 02:43:03,160
It sounds electronic...

3934
02:43:05,240 --> 02:43:08,360
Scary, I am so alerted

3935
02:43:08,440 --> 02:43:09,830
OH MY GOD

3936
02:43:08,820 --> 02:43:09,830
It's dynamite!

3937
02:43:09,860 --> 02:43:16,140
Money box = time bomb

3938
02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:18,940
We just cut the wire

3939
02:43:20,130 --> 02:43:21,940
Which one should I cut?

3940
02:43:24,040 --> 02:43:26,380
How come we have time bomb in Edo period!!?

3941
02:43:26,400 --> 02:43:27,720
Come here, come - stay with me!!

3942
02:43:27,720 --> 02:43:29,820
Stay with you?

3943
02:43:31,620 --> 02:43:32,760
Seriously come here

3944
02:43:32,760 --> 02:43:34,300
Just do it

3945
02:43:34,850 --> 02:43:36,190
Just one person!!

3946
02:43:36,210 --> 02:43:38,360
Just one person!!!!

3947
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:38,360
Who?

3948
02:43:38,380 --> 02:43:40,160
Tanaka!!

3949
02:43:38,850 --> 02:43:40,160
No~!!

3950
02:43:42,480 --> 02:43:43,980
Just cut it

3951
02:43:44,080 --> 02:43:45,580
Come here

3952
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:48,140
Which one are you going for?

3953
02:43:48,160 --> 02:43:50,210
Red red RED!!!!!

3954
02:43:50,740 --> 02:43:51,560
Stop pulling me!!

3955
02:43:51,560 --> 02:43:52,160
Ready?

3956
02:43:52,400 --> 02:43:53,340
Yes

3957
02:43:53,420 --> 02:43:54,480
I will cut now

3958
02:43:57,540 --> 02:43:58,660
10 seconds left

3959
02:43:59,960 --> 02:44:02,620
Cut!

3960
02:44:03,260 --> 02:44:05,290
It is not stopping at all!!

3961
02:44:16,470 --> 02:44:18,430
Bloody hell man

3962
02:44:19,660 --> 02:44:21,060
This blows!

3963
02:44:21,090 --> 02:44:23,440
What a prank - I'm annoyed now

3964
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:25,860
It's irritating

3965
02:44:27,530 --> 02:44:30,550
What's wrong with you Tanaka

3966
02:44:31,440 --> 02:44:33,650
How delayed was that explosion? Awful

3967
02:44:33,670 --> 02:44:36,790
If the explosion doesn't happen in 0 second

3968
02:44:34,610 --> 02:44:36,790
why would it display the time in the first place, don't you think?

3969
02:44:36,810 --> 02:44:39,690
They are making fun of us

3970
02:44:37,800 --> 02:44:39,690
They are really making fun of us, yeah

3971
02:44:39,710 --> 02:44:42,860
What a waste of energy - totally I'm drained

3972
02:44:42,880 --> 02:44:45,630
My body

3973
02:44:43,820 --> 02:44:45,630
went into defense mode - tightened up

3974
02:44:46,400 --> 02:44:46,880
My turn

3975
02:44:46,940 --> 02:44:48,880
It's very scary

3976
02:44:49,240 --> 02:44:50,020
It's fine

3977
02:44:54,060 --> 02:44:57,070
I'm really not keen on something

3978
02:44:54,060 --> 02:44:57,070
jumping out from the drawer you know

3979
02:44:57,520 --> 02:44:58,980
Maybe it will in Matsumoto drawer

3980
02:45:02,940 --> 02:45:03,840
One more

3981
02:45:03,880 --> 02:45:05,840
It's the last one

3982
02:45:12,610 --> 02:45:14,890
What is this?

3983
02:45:14,910 --> 02:45:16,740
What is this?

3984
02:45:34,220 --> 02:45:36,040
It's him, isn't it?

3985
02:45:37,270 --> 02:45:40,520
It's him in puppet form

3986
02:45:40,540 --> 02:45:47,290
Ventriloquism puppet Hama-chan

3987
02:45:48,450 --> 02:45:50,760
It's DownTown

3988
02:45:54,040 --> 02:45:55,840
It's really well made

3989
02:45:56,940 --> 02:45:58,400
It moves

3990
02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:06,860
I got a bit excited with that

3991
02:46:06,860 --> 02:46:08,560
What the heck

3992
02:46:11,370 --> 02:46:13,920
We all got excited you know

3993
02:46:15,720 --> 02:46:16,580
I am tired

3994
02:46:16,580 --> 02:46:17,980
So tired!

3995
02:46:17,980 --> 02:46:19,740
We'll be chilling a bit so

3996
02:46:19,750 --> 02:46:23,360
go get those Kogemitsu figures with those (100 yen coins) from your drawer

3997
02:46:22,480 --> 02:46:23,360
That's right

3998
02:46:25,360 --> 02:46:28,430
I have never play in a claw crane machine before

3999
02:46:28,450 --> 02:46:31,380
Just try it

4000
02:46:30,920 --> 02:46:32,900
Maybe you will get it

4001
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:41,220
That's good

4002
02:46:46,670 --> 02:46:46,940
Ooh

4003
02:46:46,850 --> 02:46:47,120
Nice one

4004
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:47,680
Here comes

4005
02:46:47,840 --> 02:46:48,480
There we go

4006
02:46:48,480 --> 02:46:48,980
Here comes

4007
02:46:53,110 --> 02:46:54,520
Are you kidding me?

4008
02:46:59,680 --> 02:47:00,580
Pushing it?

4009
02:47:00,580 --> 02:47:02,580
That is not possible

4010
02:47:03,220 --> 02:47:04,580
No way we can get it now man

4011
02:47:07,280 --> 02:47:08,860
So you hit the side

4012
02:47:08,860 --> 02:47:10,860
That's right, so it will be pushed

4013
02:47:14,900 --> 02:47:21,450
Both figure toys successfully obtained at the same time!!

4014
02:47:25,700 --> 02:47:27,660
We were just celebrating weren't we...?

4015
02:47:28,660 --> 02:47:31,560
It's just joy

4016
02:47:34,980 --> 02:47:36,900
That's amazing

4017
02:47:38,290 --> 02:47:40,940
Because it's 2 figure so it stuck inside

4018
02:47:38,290 --> 02:47:42,340
The dispensing hole is clogged up with the boxes

4019
02:47:48,100 --> 02:47:49,280
Hey everyone

4020
02:47:49,870 --> 02:47:52,610
Currently at the courthouse...

4021
02:47:52,640 --> 02:47:55,920
an unforgivable criminal is being judged

4022
02:47:55,940 --> 02:47:56,780
Let's go take a look

4023
02:47:57,210 --> 02:47:59,350
We can look?

4024
02:47:58,680 --> 02:47:59,350
Yes we can

4025
02:48:02,080 --> 02:48:09,450
Observing villains in Edo town

4026
02:48:02,080 --> 02:48:09,450
being tried

4027
02:48:02,080 --> 02:48:09,450
in the courtroom

4028
02:48:03,020 --> 02:48:05,540
They will observe a trial in Edo period court,

4029
02:48:05,820 --> 02:48:09,520
What will the five be witnessing??

4030
02:48:19,630 --> 02:48:21,480
Wow Daimyo Gyoretsu?

4031
02:48:21,620 --> 02:48:22,800
Yep, that's Daimyo Gyoretsu

4032
02:48:21,750 --> 02:48:26,850
Daimyo Gyoretsu

4033
02:48:21,870 --> 02:48:26,850
(The long line of regional governor (Daimyo) and his entourage, typical in Edo period. Town residents must be bowing down while the entire group goes past. Governors were authorised for "instant execution (Mondo Muyo)" of those walking across in front of the line, or not bowing to them)

4034
02:48:23,280 --> 02:48:24,040
That

4035
02:48:24,620 --> 02:48:27,380
Let's go to the side guys

4036
02:48:27,510 --> 02:48:29,380
Yeah you can't cross the street right?

4037
02:48:30,680 --> 02:48:32,490
Where shall we stay?

4038
02:48:31,670 --> 02:48:32,960
Line up here and site down

4039
02:48:34,480 --> 02:48:36,330
Bow down, bow down

4040
02:48:36,350 --> 02:48:43,060
You must not cut across in front of the line

4041
02:48:37,220 --> 02:48:39,320
Bow down, bow down

4042
02:48:40,460 --> 02:48:42,320
Bow down, bow down

4043
02:48:44,320 --> 02:48:47,920
So cold

4044
02:48:51,260 --> 02:48:53,200
You imbecile

4045
02:48:51,900 --> 02:48:57,950
Small girl cuts thought the line

4046
02:48:53,210 --> 02:48:57,950
Girl,

4047
02:48:54,570 --> 02:48:57,950
how dare you

4048
02:48:55,870 --> 02:48:57,950
- you are not respecting the Lord!

4049
02:48:57,970 --> 02:49:01,180
Even if you are a kid,

4050
02:48:59,870 --> 02:49:01,180
it is still unforgivable

4051
02:49:01,210 --> 02:49:03,880
Ohana!!!!!

4052
02:49:03,910 --> 02:49:05,350
Oh no Ohana....

4053
02:49:06,330 --> 02:49:11,490
Girl's father

4054
02:49:06,330 --> 02:49:11,490
Maomasa Musaka (actor)

4055
02:49:07,080 --> 02:49:10,140
Sir, please forgive her

4056
02:49:10,830 --> 02:49:13,830
Since

4057
02:49:11,680 --> 02:49:13,830
my wife passed away 5 years ago,

4058
02:49:13,850 --> 02:49:16,900
I've been taking care of my daughter Ohana on my own

4059
02:49:16,900 --> 02:49:20,630
We've been living strong no matter what we go through - together!

4060
02:49:20,650 --> 02:49:23,400
She is the joy of my life...!

4061
02:49:23,430 --> 02:49:25,170
Silence!!

4062
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:26,870
You need to be taught a lesson!!

4063
02:49:26,900 --> 02:49:28,280
You are unforgivable!!

4064
02:49:29,870 --> 02:49:36,380
Father gets executed on behalf of his daughter

4065
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:39,690
Ohana,

4066
02:49:37,410 --> 02:49:39,690
from now, by yourself

4067
02:49:39,880 --> 02:49:43,060
keep living your life

4068
02:49:43,080 --> 02:49:49,860
Heartbreaking moment - father bades farewell to his daughter

4069
02:49:44,440 --> 02:49:46,520
Father!!

4070
02:49:56,100 --> 02:49:58,810
Let's

4071
02:49:56,860 --> 02:49:58,810
Carnival!!

4072
02:49:58,820 --> 02:50:00,740
It's showtime!!!

4073
02:50:00,760 --> 02:50:05,060
Happy Boy Daimyo

4074
02:50:00,760 --> 02:50:05,060
Okada Keisuke (comedian)

4075
02:50:02,300 --> 02:50:05,040
Here I come! Yeah!!

4076
02:50:06,120 --> 02:50:08,380
It's enough seriously

4077
02:50:09,260 --> 02:50:12,350
Everyone say yeah!!!

4078
02:50:14,100 --> 02:50:17,390
The comedy

4079
02:50:15,010 --> 02:50:17,390
is all about the timing

4080
02:50:17,410 --> 02:50:21,560
Please bear with the drag

4081
02:50:19,420 --> 02:50:21,560
- the machine moving too slowly!

4082
02:50:21,590 --> 02:50:23,200
Everybody!!!

4083
02:50:23,290 --> 02:50:27,360
Happy boys, in business as usual!!!!

4084
02:50:27,610 --> 02:50:29,730
Thank you very much

4085
02:50:30,020 --> 02:50:35,360
Carvinal is passing by! YEAH

02:50:35,370 --> 02:50:36,980
Stop!!

4087
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:38,450
Very well

4088
02:50:39,470 --> 02:50:42,420
Hey, bit

4089
02:50:39,940 --> 02:50:42,420
bit

4090
02:50:40,340 --> 02:50:42,420
bit

4091
02:50:40,700 --> 02:50:42,420
bit

4092
02:50:41,170 --> 02:50:42,420
bit

4093
02:50:41,610 --> 02:50:42,420
OPEN

4094
02:50:43,400 --> 02:50:46,090
WHAOOO!!!!

4095
02:50:46,110 --> 02:50:48,760
I see,

4096
02:50:46,780 --> 02:50:48,760
thank you very much

4097
02:50:52,320 --> 02:50:54,640
Look at these robots everyone

4098
02:50:53,080 --> 02:50:54,620
I just don't get what the hell he is doing

4099
02:50:56,490 --> 02:50:59,580
It's here,

4100
02:50:57,690 --> 02:50:59,580
punishment time

4101
02:50:59,580 --> 02:51:00,470
Ok c'mon!!

4102
02:51:00,490 --> 02:51:01,540
One

4103
02:51:00,790 --> 02:51:01,540
&

4104
02:51:01,130 --> 02:51:01,540
two

4105
02:51:01,560 --> 02:51:03,200
Very good, that's very good

4106
02:51:03,230 --> 02:51:04,640
You're swinging (the bat) from the waist - very good technique

4107
02:51:05,030 --> 02:51:08,140
That aside,

4108
02:51:05,930 --> 02:51:08,140
I am currently on a laughing spree

4109
02:51:08,170 --> 02:51:09,640
Ooh?

4110
02:51:08,700 --> 02:51:09,640
They are not laughing at all??

4111
02:51:09,670 --> 02:51:11,210
Maybe he is dead

4112
02:51:11,240 --> 02:51:17,780
Happy boy attempts resuscitation on the father

4113
02:51:13,280 --> 02:51:16,040
There is no other choice,

4114
02:51:14,040 --> 02:51:16,040
mouth to mouth

4115
02:51:20,040 --> 02:51:21,760
Although the same surname Okada,

4116
02:51:21,800 --> 02:51:24,260
(*Ijillie Okada - comedian, famous for pervert comments. Used to be in a popular porn TV programme in 90s)

4117
02:51:21,800 --> 02:51:24,260
I am now Ijillie Okada

4118
02:51:24,270 --> 02:51:25,830
(Gilgamesh Night - a porn TV programme in which Ijillie Okada used to be a presenter)

4119
02:51:24,270 --> 02:51:25,830
Gilgamesh!

4120
02:51:25,880 --> 02:51:27,280
WOOOOOW!!!!!

4121
02:51:28,250 --> 02:51:30,300
What the hell is wrong with you man!

4122
02:51:31,280 --> 02:51:32,570
No time to wow you know!

4123
02:51:32,120 --> 02:51:34,280
Seriously what a cheap act man!!

4124
02:51:34,400 --> 02:51:36,280
Everyone got it

4125
02:51:36,530 --> 02:51:38,710
A cheap act is my specialty!

4126
02:51:41,600 --> 02:51:42,380
Yeah use your waist (to swing)

4127
02:51:42,400 --> 02:51:43,510
Five,

4128
02:51:42,670 --> 02:51:43,510
five!

4129
02:51:43,510 --> 02:51:45,040
Delayed five!

4130
02:51:44,530 --> 02:51:45,110
Thank you very much

4131
02:51:45,170 --> 02:51:46,850
If it's like this, there's no other choice

4132
02:51:46,870 --> 02:51:48,740
I will use my body heat

4133
02:51:48,740 --> 02:51:51,150
To resurrect your father

4134
02:51:55,850 --> 02:51:58,860
My nipples and his nipples, like magnetic poles

4135
02:51:58,860 --> 02:51:59,990
Combined!

4136
02:52:03,800 --> 02:52:07,200
This guy is an idiot, a real idiot

4137
02:52:08,160 --> 02:52:10,580
What the heck is that

4138
02:52:16,230 --> 02:52:18,180
What is the matter with you

4139
02:52:18,200 --> 02:52:19,880
For me to be in this position

4140
02:52:19,900 --> 02:52:22,080
is a very fruity happy boy's love (fruity gay moment)

4141
02:52:22,100 --> 02:52:23,950
...what am I talking about!!

4142
02:52:23,970 --> 02:52:26,690
Did I work enough to deserve my commission then!?

4143
02:52:26,740 --> 02:52:28,360
See you!!!

4144
02:52:30,610 --> 02:52:32,130
Doesn't he say "wow" for the exit huh?

4145
02:52:34,680 --> 02:52:37,020
He should have said "wow" for one last laugh don't you think?

4146
02:52:38,480 --> 02:52:40,120
Why am I the only one

4147
02:52:40,560 --> 02:52:42,480
At least end it with a "WAW"

4148
02:52:44,190 --> 02:52:46,710
Doesn't these happyboy's robot seems expensive?

4149
02:52:50,400 --> 02:52:52,650
They are seriously using lots of money

4150
02:52:52,670 --> 02:52:53,580
Let's go

4151
02:52:54,040 --> 02:52:56,720
In the end, no one saved him

4152
02:52:56,740 --> 02:52:58,020
Just laying dead

4153
02:52:59,090 --> 02:53:01,930
That girl is a true actor - shedding so much tears for real

4154
02:53:01,930 --> 02:53:04,730
I was this close to start weeping in sympathy

4155
02:53:03,240 --> 02:53:04,730
True that

4156
02:53:03,810 --> 02:53:04,730
Me too

4157
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:06,780
That was really good acting

4158
02:53:06,920 --> 02:53:10,260
Don't you think these robots could have been better-looking?

4159
02:53:08,700 --> 02:53:09,760
Agree

4160
02:53:12,100 --> 02:53:14,240
Look, there is a crowd in the street over there

4161
02:53:14,200 --> 02:53:15,150
What is it now?

4162
02:53:16,070 --> 02:53:17,400
Let's have a closer look, shall we?

4163
02:53:17,970 --> 02:53:18,590
What is it?

4164
02:53:18,650 --> 02:53:22,320
People in town gathering up; what is happening...

4165
02:53:18,700 --> 02:53:20,640
Are we not supposed to be observing a trial?

4166
02:53:19,990 --> 02:53:20,660
That's right

4167
02:53:20,570 --> 02:53:22,780
Can you guys line up here?

4168
02:53:25,510 --> 02:53:27,320
Hey look!

4169
02:53:28,670 --> 02:53:34,530
(*Known for his extravagant style to throw a box full of gold to people in the street)

4170
02:53:28,670 --> 02:53:34,530
Edo's Robin Hood - Nezumi Kozou the chivalrous thief appears

4171
02:53:30,940 --> 02:53:31,520
Whoa

4172
02:53:32,310 --> 02:53:34,100
That's Nezumi Kozou

4173
02:53:33,100 --> 02:53:34,510
Wow

4174
02:53:37,890 --> 02:53:39,200
Oh my goodness

4175
02:53:38,600 --> 02:53:43,870
Henmi Mari (actress)

4176
02:53:38,600 --> 02:53:43,870
Town resident:

4177
02:53:48,040 --> 02:53:53,350
Nezumi Senpai (comedian)

4178
02:53:48,040 --> 02:53:53,350
Town resident:

4179
02:53:48,590 --> 02:53:49,920
That's Nezumi Senpai

4180
02:53:50,900 --> 02:53:51,990
Oh wow

4181
02:53:51,880 --> 02:53:52,450
Oh yes, that's him

4182
02:53:52,370 --> 02:53:52,850
Ah, I see

4183
02:53:52,790 --> 02:53:54,800
Oh I get it - "Nezumi" combination...

4184
02:53:53,360 --> 02:53:58,050
Enjoy the show although the five have laughed already

4185
02:53:54,650 --> 02:53:55,950
Why is he not getting the Nezumi Kozou role?

4186
02:53:56,230 --> 02:53:58,050
Here come the police officers!!

4187
02:53:58,050 --> 02:54:01,050
Nezumi Kozou makes an exit

4188
02:54:04,860 --> 02:54:10,460
Officers in pursuit of Nezumi Kozou

4189
02:54:07,730 --> 02:54:08,840
Oh my goodness

4190
02:54:13,330 --> 02:54:18,610
Egashira 2:50 (comedian)

4191
02:54:13,330 --> 02:54:18,610
Town official:

4192
02:54:13,990 --> 02:54:15,480
There he goes

4193
02:54:16,960 --> 02:54:18,670
YOU IDIOTS!!!!

4194
02:54:21,420 --> 02:54:22,540
Hip Attack!

4195
02:54:22,670 --> 02:54:26,810
Punishment to those who picked up the stoled money

4196
02:54:22,820 --> 02:54:23,660
Are you OK??

4197
02:54:22,920 --> 02:54:24,550
Nezumi Senpai is completely knocked down

4198
02:54:24,180 --> 02:54:25,310
Get out of my way!!!

4199
02:54:27,080 --> 02:54:28,500
Ooooooah here we go!!

4200
02:54:28,580 --> 02:54:34,090
A town resident taken in custody
and transported by wheelbarrow

4201
02:54:29,090 --> 02:54:29,700
Wheelburr...

4202
02:54:31,640 --> 02:54:32,710
Yeah man

4203
02:54:33,210 --> 02:54:34,000
Uuuuuuh

4204
02:54:34,090 --> 02:54:34,870
What the hell...

4205
02:54:35,700 --> 02:54:36,880
Don't do that

4206
02:54:36,870 --> 02:54:37,750
It's cold out here, you know

4207
02:54:44,240 --> 02:54:45,440
OUTTA WAY!!!!

4208
02:54:47,130 --> 02:54:49,670
What the hell man

4209
02:54:49,810 --> 02:54:50,620
Dear me

4210
02:54:51,200 --> 02:54:54,700
He's insane, really

4211
02:54:54,110 --> 02:54:55,970
Goodness me...

4212
02:54:56,030 --> 02:54:56,600
OUCH

4213
02:54:56,480 --> 02:54:56,960
Argh!

4214
02:54:57,470 --> 02:54:58,020
Argh!!

4215
02:54:58,030 --> 02:54:58,780
Ah hurts

4216
02:54:58,720 --> 02:54:59,060
Aw

4217
02:54:59,630 --> 02:55:03,950
Shouldn't Nezumi Senpai play the role of Nezumi Kozou?

4218
02:55:02,120 --> 02:55:03,430
Absolutely

4219
02:55:02,760 --> 02:55:03,950
Why was he butt-attacked instead?

4220
02:55:05,010 --> 02:55:07,060
Shall we make our way to the court?

4221
02:55:06,300 --> 02:55:09,060
Everything is just so unpredictable

4222
02:55:10,860 --> 02:55:14,330
So what was Ega-chan (Egashira 2:50) angry about after all??

4223
02:55:12,780 --> 02:55:13,530
I am not sure

4224
02:55:14,330 --> 02:55:16,100
That was definitely Mari (Henmi) by the way

4225
02:55:16,660 --> 02:55:18,200
What? Who's Mari?

4226
02:55:18,200 --> 02:55:26,610
Noone except Hamada noticed

4227
02:55:18,200 --> 02:55:26,610
Town resident: Mari Henmi

4228
02:55:18,250 --> 02:55:18,940
Henmi Mari

4229
02:55:19,180 --> 02:55:20,900
WHAT, seriously??

4230
02:55:20,900 --> 02:55:21,970
I didn't notice that at all!!

4231
02:55:23,590 --> 02:55:24,680
I didn't either

4232
02:55:25,360 --> 02:55:26,720
I failed to notice too

4233
02:55:27,660 --> 02:55:28,950
We're going to a courtroom now

4234
02:55:31,680 --> 02:55:32,580
Cold

4235
02:55:34,400 --> 02:55:35,360
Let's go inside

4236
02:55:36,620 --> 02:55:37,880
Let's take a seat in the front row

4237
02:55:38,560 --> 02:55:40,760
Looks so cool...

4238
02:55:44,300 --> 02:55:47,250
Chihara Junior

4239
02:55:44,310 --> 02:55:47,250
Magistrate Official: Constable

4240
02:55:48,220 --> 02:55:50,390
I had no idea...

4241
02:55:50,780 --> 02:55:54,930
Kitamachi Magistrate:

4242
02:55:52,680 --> 02:55:54,930
Sir Tohyama Saemonjo

4243
02:55:54,960 --> 02:55:57,660
Approaches!

4244
02:56:11,640 --> 02:56:18,260
Takeuchi Riki (actor)

4245
02:56:11,640 --> 02:56:18,260
Tohyama Saemonjo

4246
02:56:15,380 --> 02:56:18,580
Everyone, raise your head

4247
02:56:19,440 --> 02:56:27,670
We are here today,

4248
02:56:21,750 --> 02:56:27,670
as one man under the title of a doctor,

4249
02:56:24,820 --> 02:56:27,670
has repeatedly groped our daughters

4250
02:56:27,700 --> 02:56:31,490
and we'll examine what this perverted doctor has done.

4251
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:38,280
Habitual Sexual Harassment Doctor

4252
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:38,280
Villains of Edo: The 1st

4253
02:56:31,850 --> 02:56:33,590
Without further ado, sir Tohyama

4254
02:56:33,660 --> 02:56:36,100
Shall we bring the criminals out to the court?

4255
02:56:36,490 --> 02:56:37,790
Bring them out

4256
02:56:37,990 --> 02:56:38,490
Come!

4257
02:56:44,160 --> 02:56:44,830
Sit!

4258
02:56:48,400 --> 02:56:48,950
Come!

4259
02:56:52,140 --> 02:56:55,520
Azuma Mikihisa (Actor)

4260
02:56:52,140 --> 02:56:55,520
Town Doctor

4261
02:56:52,990 --> 02:56:53,350
Sit!

4262
02:56:58,150 --> 02:57:04,110
You are accused of repeated lewd body contact with the oiran

4263
02:56:58,830 --> 02:57:04,690
(Oiran = Predecessors of Geisha restricted to High-Class individuals)

4264
02:57:04,800 --> 02:57:11,310
Perverted Doctor,

4265
02:57:06,020 --> 02:57:11,310
are you not Azuma Mikinohei?

4266
02:57:09,590 --> 02:57:11,310
Yes

4267
02:57:11,900 --> 02:57:19,290
Sir Tohyama,

4268
02:57:12,950 --> 02:57:19,290
the daughters who were groped by this perverted doctor are here...

4269
02:57:17,700 --> 02:57:19,290
shall we call them out here?

4270
02:57:19,540 --> 02:57:20,610
Of course

4271
02:57:21,340 --> 02:57:21,730
Come in!

4272
02:57:25,070 --> 02:57:29,180
Kanou Sisters

4273
02:57:25,070 --> 02:57:29,180
Oiran

4274
02:57:32,080 --> 02:57:36,520
Was this doctor the person who groped you?

4275
02:57:36,720 --> 02:57:37,450
Yes,

4276
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:41,060
We would not forget, ...re certain it is him.

4277
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:41,060
We would not forget, we are certain it is him.

4278
02:57:47,230 --> 02:57:50,210
Is it supposed to be so out of synch?

4279
02:57:53,440 --> 02:57:54,850
These pebbles are something else...

4280
02:57:56,730 --> 02:57:58,210
Azuma Mikinohei,

4281
02:57:58,270 --> 02:57:58,900
Yes

4282
02:57:59,340 --> 02:58:01,390
Do you have any rebuttal?

4283
02:58:01,640 --> 02:58:05,180
I lost sight of myself,

4284
02:58:03,980 --> 02:58:05,180
and committed such conduct

4285
02:58:05,200 --> 02:58:06,320
However, this time!...

4286
02:58:06,700 --> 02:58:09,700
I'd like to express my remorse

4287
02:58:07,900 --> 02:58:09,700
with an apology letter I've written.

4288
02:58:09,710 --> 02:58:12,920
If at all possible, I'd like to convey this remorse,

4289
02:58:11,200 --> 02:58:12,920
is this ok?

4290
02:58:12,930 --> 02:58:14,550
Sir Tohyama, shall we let him?

4291
02:58:16,410 --> 02:58:18,770
You can read it

4292
02:58:17,430 --> 02:58:18,390
Thank you

4293
02:58:18,790 --> 02:58:23,840
Apology Letter

4294
02:58:19,130 --> 02:58:23,840
While I,

4295
02:58:20,250 --> 02:58:23,840
Azuma Mikinohei,

4296
02:58:21,830 --> 02:58:23,840
am currently titled as a doctor...

4297
02:58:23,850 --> 02:58:27,280
To my patients the Kanou sisters,

4298
02:58:25,430 --> 02:58:27,280
I have comitted lewd ac... acts

4299
02:58:27,300 --> 02:58:31,840
with my past conduct,

4300
02:58:27,900 --> 02:58:31,840
and conduct I've gone on to do,

4301
02:58:29,640 --> 02:58:31,840
I offer my sincerest apology.

4302
02:58:37,850 --> 02:58:38,550
He stuttered because it was cold...

4303
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:44,960
I'd like this to go more smoothly

4304
02:58:44,990 --> 02:58:45,730
I offer my sincerest apology.

4305
02:58:46,500 --> 02:58:49,260
However,

4306
02:58:46,820 --> 02:58:49,260
if you allow me to offer an excuse for my actions...

4307
02:58:49,290 --> 02:58:53,800
that would be because the sister's bodies

4308
02:58:51,090 --> 02:58:53,800
are so lustful exactly like American women

4309
02:58:54,430 --> 02:58:56,270
I couldn't care less whether they were Oiran or Inran (slut in Japanese).

4310
02:58:56,670 --> 02:59:00,740
As the sisters were in horny & flirtatious attire,

4311
02:59:04,590 --> 02:59:08,710
I could not help myself but fondle those unnecessarily huge boobs.

4312
02:59:08,780 --> 02:59:13,860
The enormous boobs unable to tell whether fake or not,

4313
02:59:12,010 --> 02:59:13,860
and huge nipples...

4314
02:59:13,870 --> 02:59:16,490
The sisters' huge nipples, and the fact that they are such horny sluts,

4315
02:59:16,530 --> 02:59:21,260
I never dreamed of myself so aroused by the combination.

4316
02:59:21,270 --> 02:59:22,690
What are you talking about?

4317
02:59:25,280 --> 02:59:26,640
What the hell are you on about?

4318
02:59:26,920 --> 02:59:28,200
You aren't apologising are you?

4319
02:59:28,220 --> 02:59:30,160
Apologise to the sisters!

4320
02:59:30,270 --> 02:59:30,970
Ouch...

4321
02:59:33,760 --> 02:59:36,110
Please, I beg your pardon

4322
02:59:36,280 --> 02:59:37,110
Oiran sisters,

4323
02:59:37,480 --> 02:59:39,320
How was his appeal?

4324
02:59:39,330 --> 02:59:42,290
I am so upset how dehumanising he is!

4325
02:59:42,350 --> 02:59:45,260
Sir Touyama,

4326
02:59:43,150 --> 02:59:45,260
please make a judgment on the case.

4327
02:59:47,920 --> 02:59:51,150
Enough of your bloody excuse - I'm sick of listening to you!!

4328
02:59:51,530 --> 02:59:54,370
The sun may shine on you despite your crime,

4329
02:59:54,390 --> 03:00:00,140
but me and my "Tohyama Sakura" won't forgive you for what you did!!!

4330
02:59:54,620 --> 03:00:00,140
(cherry blossom tattoo on his shoulder)

4331
03:00:01,310 --> 03:00:02,000
Sir...!!

4332
03:00:03,380 --> 03:00:09,140
Quack medic,

4333
03:00:05,280 --> 03:00:09,140
Azuma Mikinoppe

4334
03:00:09,150 --> 03:00:11,150
I sentence you to Sanzoku (bandit) Mue Thai kick!!!

4335
03:00:11,710 --> 03:00:19,000
Quack's sentence:

4336
03:00:11,710 --> 03:00:19,000
Sanzoku Mue Thai kick

4337
03:00:12,570 --> 03:00:13,150
What?

4338
03:00:14,240 --> 03:00:15,810
Thai kick???

4339
03:00:16,180 --> 03:00:16,750
Get up!

4340
03:00:16,990 --> 03:00:18,140
Bloody hell, there's no mercy

4341
03:00:18,180 --> 03:00:19,200
Do not move!

4342
03:00:19,210 --> 03:00:19,630
Freeze!

4343
03:00:24,630 --> 03:00:26,720
Be strong, Mikinohei!!

4344
03:00:25,980 --> 03:00:26,640
Mikinohei!

4345
03:00:26,750 --> 03:00:28,320
Mikinohei, it's really, really bad - I tell you

4346
03:00:27,990 --> 03:00:29,500
Don't put your bum up so high man!!

4347
03:00:29,690 --> 03:00:30,450
Lower your bum a bit

4348
03:00:30,780 --> 03:00:31,400
Don't hide your butt!

4349
03:00:31,280 --> 03:00:31,800
Mikinohei...!

4350
03:00:31,840 --> 03:00:33,350
OH MY GOD

4351
03:00:34,750 --> 03:00:35,600
That must hurt...

4352
03:00:40,210 --> 03:00:42,750
That looks SO painful

4353
03:00:42,220 --> 03:00:44,720
That must hurt so bad

4354
03:00:45,340 --> 03:00:46,260
That's painful

4355
03:00:46,300 --> 03:00:48,240
You bet your ass it is

4356
03:00:51,680 --> 03:00:52,710
The pain will last for a while, alright?

4357
03:00:52,840 --> 03:00:53,820
It won't go away...

4358
03:00:54,870 --> 03:00:55,290
Aw

4359
03:00:56,800 --> 03:00:58,870
It will linger for a while

4360
03:01:00,140 --> 03:01:02,330
The pain will go away ...in due course.

4361
03:01:04,420 --> 03:01:07,600
Case closed!!

4362
03:01:06,440 --> 03:01:07,100
Take him away!!

4363
03:01:07,170 --> 03:01:07,600
Get up!!

4364
03:01:07,610 --> 03:01:10,930
Well well... that kick must have been sooo painful

4365
03:01:07,630 --> 03:01:08,560
Move!!

4366
03:01:11,460 --> 03:01:12,260
Oh man....

4367
03:01:12,170 --> 03:01:12,950
He's feeling it

4368
03:01:13,180 --> 03:01:16,150
Sir, please proceed to the next case

4369
03:01:16,600 --> 03:01:18,160
Well then

4370
03:01:18,700 --> 03:01:22,580
Recently people in Edo have been talking about a man,

4371
03:01:22,650 --> 03:01:27,090
(Ikkyu: a monk known for his knowledge and quick wit)

4372
03:01:22,650 --> 03:01:27,090
He is known as "fake Ikkyu" - I would like to put him on trial.

4373
03:01:26,060 --> 03:01:27,050
Bring him in!

4374
03:01:27,420 --> 03:01:35,820
Edo's villain #2

4375
03:01:27,420 --> 03:01:35,820
Fake Ikkyu the trickster

4376
03:01:36,470 --> 03:01:40,750
Fake Ikkyu

4377
03:01:36,470 --> 03:01:40,760
Shin Onii

4378
03:01:41,130 --> 03:01:45,370
He is known as "fake Ikkyu" - I would like to put him on trial.

4379
03:01:44,720 --> 03:01:45,370
Bring him in!

4380
03:01:45,630 --> 03:01:52,770
Edo's villain #2

4381
03:01:45,630 --> 03:01:52,770
Fake Ikkyu the trickster

4382
03:01:53,500 --> 03:01:57,790
Fake Ikkyu

4383
03:01:53,500 --> 03:01:57,790
Shin Onii

4384
03:01:53,760 --> 03:01:57,600
Recently there is a man who claims himself as Ikkyu,

4385
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:01,350
and tricks people in town

4386
03:02:01,510 --> 03:02:04,090
Are you the one?

4387
03:02:04,300 --> 03:02:05,070
I am the real

4388
03:02:05,070 --> 03:02:06,090
I am the real Ikkyu!!!

4389
03:02:06,300 --> 03:02:09,340
Ikkyu is supposedly among the best in town when it comes to quick wit.

4390
03:02:09,410 --> 03:02:11,340
If you insist that you are the real Ikkyu,

4391
03:02:11,340 --> 03:02:13,750
let's see how good you are - it that understood?

4392
03:02:13,910 --> 03:02:15,310
I will have a go!

4393
03:02:13,910 --> 03:02:20,000
Is he the real Ikkyu!?

4394
03:02:13,910 --> 03:02:20,000
Verify his identity with quick wit questions

4395
03:02:15,420 --> 03:02:16,780
Here is the first one

4396
03:02:16,800 --> 03:02:17,680
Bring "it" in!

4397
03:02:17,720 --> 03:02:18,400
Yes sir!

4398
03:02:20,300 --> 03:02:21,190
Tell you what,

4399
03:02:21,740 --> 03:02:23,460
the tiger on this screen,

4400
03:02:23,530 --> 03:02:29,090
keeps Judge Tohyama here awake with its howling every night - he is not able to rest soundly.

4401
03:02:29,160 --> 03:02:33,700
Ikkyu, show us how you capture this tiger on the screen using your wit, in front of us now!

4402
03:02:33,870 --> 03:02:34,500
Ready?

4403
03:02:34,380 --> 03:03:24,880
Catch the tiger drawn on the screen

4404
03:02:38,630 --> 03:02:41,830
As long as this tiger is inside the sc- screen

4405
03:02:41,880 --> 03:02:43,830
I cannot make this beast quiet

4406
03:02:44,150 --> 03:02:45,660
Please make the tiger come out of the screen first.

4407
03:02:45,710 --> 03:02:47,180
After that, I will make this tiger stop howling as you wish

4408
03:02:47,490 --> 03:02:50,860
That's the famous punch line by real Ikkyu that everyone knows

4409
03:02:50,950 --> 03:02:54,250
Use your own wit and come up with something new!

4410
03:02:57,920 --> 03:03:01,030
If you cannot make the beast come out of the screen,

4411
03:03:01,360 --> 03:03:04,710
I...if you get a cage over here

4412
03:03:04,710 --> 03:03:06,710
I will put this screen in the cage

4413
03:03:06,800 --> 03:03:08,710
and let me demonstrate how to get the screen out

4414
03:03:09,370 --> 03:03:10,640
Eh?

4415
03:03:11,090 --> 03:03:11,980
Hmmm....

4416
03:03:11,920 --> 03:03:13,980
Well, we have no cage that we can use!

4417
03:03:14,180 --> 03:03:15,540
Come up with something else without using the cage!!

4418
03:03:18,790 --> 03:03:19,900
W- without the cage,

4419
03:03:20,250 --> 03:03:21,880
it's impossible, right?

4420
03:03:34,950 --> 03:03:36,500
He gave up on it so quickly

4421
03:03:36,600 --> 03:03:38,500
Why is he angry anyway?

4422
03:03:38,390 --> 03:03:39,240
That's enough!

4423
03:03:39,410 --> 03:03:40,000
Ikkyu,

4424
03:03:40,580 --> 03:03:42,660
I hear that real Ikkyu has a passion for acting

4425
03:03:42,660 --> 03:03:47,940
and apparently he excels at reenacting a number of very well known scene from famous soap operas.

4426
03:03:44,500 --> 03:03:50,980
Is he the real Ikkyu!?

4427
03:03:44,500 --> 03:03:50,980
Verify his identity with his acting skills

4428
03:03:48,250 --> 03:03:49,500
Let's see how good you are with acting

4429
03:03:49,780 --> 03:03:50,890
First off is the very famous one;

4430
03:03:51,090 --> 03:03:52,890
Scene in which Inspector Jipan is killed on duty

4431
03:03:53,040 --> 03:03:53,950
Let us see how you handle it

4432
03:03:54,480 --> 03:04:07,610
*From 70s drama "Taiyo ni Hoero" (Howl at the sun) - Inspector Jipan's last words "What the hell is this!!?" while looking at his own blood after getting shot by suspect during pursuit)

4433
03:03:54,480 --> 03:04:07,610
Scene in which Inspector Jipan is killed on duty

4434
03:03:54,480 --> 03:04:07,610
Taiyo ni hoero!

4435
03:03:58,880 --> 03:04:00,060
I cannot do that!!

4436
03:04:00,580 --> 03:04:02,260
> What? Why can't you do it?

4437
03:04:03,550 --> 03:04:06,040
I don- don't know that sc- sc- scene

4438
03:04:08,600 --> 03:04:09,740
What a firm rejection

4439
03:04:10,580 --> 03:04:12,200
The reason of rejection is unbelievable

4440
03:04:11,780 --> 03:04:13,000
What the hell...?

4441
03:04:14,050 --> 03:04:14,700
Aaw!

4442
03:04:14,970 --> 03:04:15,780
Uuuuuh

4443
03:04:15,860 --> 03:04:16,350
Oh that hurts!

4444
03:04:17,080 --> 03:04:19,040
Then he is not a real Ikkyu is he?

4445
03:04:19,120 --> 03:04:21,040
He has tried so many things and accomplished a lot before

4446
03:04:20,550 --> 03:04:21,030
That's right huh?

4447
03:04:21,730 --> 03:04:23,920
You are supposed to be the real Ikkyu

4448
03:04:24,480 --> 03:04:24,890
Is that right?

4449
03:04:25,190 --> 03:04:26,190
Y, ye, yes...

4450
03:04:25,830 --> 03:04:27,410
Then you must be good at acting!

4451
03:04:27,560 --> 03:04:28,000
Right then,

4452
03:04:28,100 --> 03:04:31,090
the scene from "Kita no kinu kara" where the family is at a ramen restaurant

4453
03:04:31,100 --> 03:04:31,380
Mmm

4454
03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:32,890
Yep - in which Kuniei Tanaka (actor)

4455
03:04:33,310 --> 03:04:34,890
snaps at the waitress.

4456
03:04:35,410 --> 03:04:37,150
Let us see that famous phrase

4457
03:04:37,660 --> 03:04:54,590
"Kita no kuni kara (From the Northern Country)"

4458
03:04:37,660 --> 03:04:54,590
*Actor Kuniei Tanaka yells "can't you see my kids are still eating!?" at waitress who tries to take the unfinished plate away from his kids as the restaurant is closing for the day

4459
03:04:37,660 --> 03:04:54,590
Famous phrase at the ramen restaurant

4460
03:04:41,120 --> 03:04:42,280
With the cold weather like this,

4461
03:04:42,780 --> 03:04:44,480
ramen tastes so good!

4462
03:04:45,180 --> 03:04:48,320
The cold weather and the warmth from the ramen...

4463
03:04:48,670 --> 03:04:51,610
Ramen tastes so GOD DAMN DELICIOUS WHEN IT IS SO BLOODY COLD OUT THERE!!!

4464
03:04:55,310 --> 03:04:56,160
He's just angry - not acting!

4465
03:04:59,000 --> 03:04:59,800
Just angry

4466
03:05:01,560 --> 03:05:04,000
"Ramen tastes so good when it's cold out there!" he said...

4467
03:05:04,670 --> 03:05:05,460
So painful

4468
03:05:05,910 --> 03:05:06,550
OK next

4469
03:05:06,550 --> 03:05:08,550
from "The 101st Proposal",

4470
03:05:08,550 --> 03:05:13,960
you know the scene where Tetsuya Takeda (actor) shouts the famous phrase when he bolts out in front of an incoming lorry, don't you?

4471
03:05:14,050 --> 03:05:16,000
Let us see how you reenact the scene

4472
03:05:16,960 --> 03:05:23,850
"The 101st Proposal"

4473
03:05:16,960 --> 03:05:23,850
*Tetsuya Takeda shouts "I will not die! Because I love you!!"

4474
03:05:16,960 --> 03:05:23,850
Famous phrase after jumping in front of the lorry while the heroine watches him in terror

4475
03:05:19,830 --> 03:05:20,900
Oh careful, careful!!!

4476
03:05:21,420 --> 03:05:23,790
It's the 101st proposal!!

4477
03:05:27,160 --> 03:05:28,360
He just shouted the drama series's title

4478
03:05:28,420 --> 03:05:30,360
What the hell

4479
03:05:29,360 --> 03:05:30,510
Just shouting the title

4480
03:05:30,710 --> 03:05:32,630
Shin Onii doesn't know any of these famous drama series at all, does he?

4481
03:05:32,670 --> 03:05:33,090
Indeed

4482
03:05:33,770 --> 03:05:35,310
I just don't understand why though

4483
03:05:35,340 --> 03:05:37,310
"101st proposal!!!!"

4484
03:05:36,990 --> 03:05:39,560
He doesn't even try to impersonate the actors at all

4485
03:05:39,680 --> 03:05:40,600
Enough!

4486
03:05:41,360 --> 03:05:42,600
You are not a real Ikkyu!!

4487
03:05:43,540 --> 03:05:44,600
Your Honour,

4488
03:05:44,600 --> 03:05:45,760
please pass the judgement

4489
03:05:46,020 --> 03:05:47,760
Oi, you!

4490
03:05:47,760 --> 03:05:50,770
Enough of your bloody excuse - I'm sick of listening to you!!

4491
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:52,870
The sun may shine on you despite your crime,

4492
03:05:53,600 --> 03:05:57,550
but me and my "Tohyama Sakura" won't forgive you for what you did!!!

4493
03:05:59,300 --> 03:06:00,020
Fake Ikkyu!!

4494
03:06:01,010 --> 03:06:01,780
You are sentenced to

4495
03:06:02,760 --> 03:06:06,800
public humiliation, then death penalty by decapitation!!

4496
03:06:07,800 --> 03:06:16,140
Public humiliation & death penalty by decapitation

4497
03:06:07,800 --> 03:06:16,140
Sentence to the fake Ikkyu

4498
03:06:10,600 --> 03:06:11,940
Harsh punishment...

4499
03:06:12,220 --> 03:06:12,870
Stand up!!

4500
03:06:12,980 --> 03:06:13,360
Quick!

4501
03:06:14,620 --> 03:06:15,850
Do you want to leave us the last word before the execution?

4502
03:06:16,490 --> 03:06:18,580
Toam- toa-, it's--...

4503
03:06:19,400 --> 03:06:23,270
It is such an honour to be given the sentence by Sir Judge Tohyama

4504
03:06:23,270 --> 03:06:26,440
I can, erm, I can die with real fun now

4505
03:06:31,230 --> 03:06:32,400
What a joke!!

4506
03:06:32,980 --> 03:06:33,830
I can't handle him - too funny

4507
03:06:36,920 --> 03:06:38,930
What the hell is "I can die with real fun"?

4508
03:06:38,930 --> 03:06:39,950
Oh bloody hell...

4509
03:06:40,070 --> 03:06:41,070
Too much, too much to handle

4510
03:06:41,120 --> 03:06:42,100
Your Honour.

4511
03:06:42,520 --> 03:06:43,720
Shall we move on to the next case?

4512
03:06:43,950 --> 03:06:44,280
Sure

4513
03:06:44,870 --> 03:06:45,860
Next up is...

4514
03:06:47,170 --> 03:06:50,300
a man who seduces innocent girls by flirtatious texts

4515
03:06:51,230 --> 03:06:56,550
An outrageous pervert will be put on trial.

4516
03:06:56,960 --> 03:06:57,860
Your Honour,

4517
03:06:57,150 --> 03:07:06,390
Edo's villain #3

4518
03:06:57,150 --> 03:07:06,390
Flirtatious pervert

4519
03:06:58,270 --> 03:07:01,660
Would you allow me to bring the accused into the court?

4520
03:07:01,660 --> 03:07:02,900
Yes - bring him in!

4521
03:07:03,200 --> 03:07:04,330
Yes sir!

4522
03:07:07,640 --> 03:07:08,080
Whoa

4523
03:07:07,690 --> 03:07:08,130
Stand up!!

4524
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:08,390
What?

4525
03:07:08,390 --> 03:07:08,880
Stand up!!

4526
03:07:09,060 --> 03:07:17,070
Endo is put on trial

4527
03:07:09,410 --> 03:07:09,930
Move!!

4528
03:07:10,290 --> 03:07:10,860
Shake your legs!!

4529
03:07:11,010 --> 03:07:12,090
Come on!!

4530
03:07:12,720 --> 03:07:13,380
Sit down!!

4531
03:07:13,520 --> 03:07:14,410
Wha...what???

4532
03:07:14,950 --> 03:07:15,750
Sit down!!

4533
03:07:15,790 --> 03:07:16,080
Huh???

4534
03:07:16,180 --> 03:07:16,620
Sit down!!

4535
03:07:16,490 --> 03:07:16,930
Eh???

4536
03:07:17,360 --> 03:07:17,970
Well then,

4537
03:07:18,480 --> 03:07:22,800
bring his family in too!

4538
03:07:21,250 --> 03:07:21,690
WHAT

4539
03:07:21,690 --> 03:07:23,690
Huh?

4540
03:07:21,690 --> 03:07:23,690
Huh?

4541
03:07:23,240 --> 03:07:24,220
Kidding, right?

4542
03:07:26,790 --> 03:07:31,100
The Endos are also brought into the courtroom

4543
03:07:27,240 --> 03:07:27,920
What the hell...?

4544
03:07:28,900 --> 03:07:29,390
Chiaki too?

4545
03:07:29,780 --> 03:07:30,640
Bloody hell man...

4546
03:07:32,370 --> 03:07:34,400
So she is still considered as his family huh?

4547
03:07:34,620 --> 03:07:35,680
What the hell is the "Endos"...

4548
03:07:37,820 --> 03:07:40,920
Your name is Endo Shozo - is that correct?

4549
03:07:41,190 --> 03:07:41,560
Yes

4550
03:07:42,870 --> 03:07:45,550
The reason why you are put on trial...

4551
03:07:45,860 --> 03:07:47,000
do you know what it is?

4552
03:07:47,140 --> 03:07:48,490
Well - to be honest,

4553
03:07:48,490 --> 03:07:50,000
nothing at all

4554
03:07:50,300 --> 03:07:51,790
"Nothing at all"?

4555
03:07:51,610 --> 03:07:52,000
Yes

4556
03:07:53,490 --> 03:07:54,610
Let me ask you something then

4557
03:07:54,760 --> 03:08:00,650
Your inappropriate photos were up in a tabloid paper in the past- is that right?

4558
03:07:59,340 --> 03:08:09,720
Is he cheating!?

4559
03:07:59,340 --> 03:08:09,720
Photo taken by TV crew

4560
03:07:59,340 --> 03:08:09,720
Scoop! Cocorico's Endo & a pretty girl from
Gaki TV crew goes on a date in Roppongi

4561
03:08:00,940 --> 03:08:03,400
Ahem - yes, that is correct, however,

4562
03:08:03,760 --> 03:08:05,710
Erm....

4563
03:08:06,290 --> 03:08:07,710
To be honest with you,

4564
03:08:07,710 --> 03:08:09,160
I believe I was framed by the crew

4565
03:08:09,380 --> 03:08:10,300
You are right about that

4566
03:08:10,680 --> 03:08:14,400
As you said, this article was based on TV crews' conspiracy to frame you

4567
03:08:13,530 --> 03:08:14,220
Yes that's right

4568
03:08:14,800 --> 03:08:18,390
However - what lies beneath is that, with this girl, Misa,

4569
03:08:18,510 --> 03:08:22,640
you are still in touch with her via texts according to our intelligence.

4570
03:08:23,310 --> 03:08:24,120
Your Honour,

4571
03:08:25,260 --> 03:08:30,950
I would like to show you some of the texts Endo sent to the girl - is that OK with you?

4572
03:08:30,990 --> 03:08:32,600
Very well - let's have a look!!

4573
03:08:34,450 --> 03:08:42,000
Disclosing the content of Endo's texts

4574
03:08:34,450 --> 03:08:42,000
Is Endo a flirtatious pervert!?

4575
03:08:34,600 --> 03:08:35,060
Seriously?

4576
03:08:35,290 --> 03:08:37,060
Hey Endo, are you alright??

4577
03:08:39,710 --> 03:08:40,400
Hang in there buddy

4578
03:08:46,830 --> 03:08:47,200
Oh?

4579
03:08:47,580 --> 03:08:48,900
What's the matter Endo?

4580
03:08:49,920 --> 03:08:50,290
Please sir...

4581
03:08:50,290 --> 03:08:50,950
Endo!!

4582
03:08:50,810 --> 03:08:52,480
Please, I beg you for your mercy...

4583
03:08:52,180 --> 03:08:53,730
Step back!!!

4584
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:54,720
Step back!!!

4585
03:08:54,640 --> 03:08:55,460
Well...

4586
03:08:55,610 --> 03:08:57,510
My own parents and brother are here...

4587
03:08:57,610 --> 03:08:59,590
And my ex-wife is here too...

4588
03:09:00,800 --> 03:09:01,930
Seriously please...

4589
03:09:02,100 --> 03:09:02,710
Ah man

4590
03:09:02,710 --> 03:09:05,310
Hold on man, it's just some texts right?

4591
03:09:05,540 --> 03:09:07,040
Is that THAT bad??

4592
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:07,750
Texts... hmmm....

4593
03:09:07,770 --> 03:09:09,120
Are your texts so bad then??

4594
03:09:11,360 --> 03:09:11,870
Aw that hurts

4595
03:09:12,800 --> 03:09:16,960
I'm not sure which part of the texts you will be showing so...

4596
03:09:17,060 --> 03:09:19,810
It all started 2 years ago,

4597
03:09:18,220 --> 03:09:28,500
Endo flirted with Misa who used to work as an extra in this program

4598
03:09:18,220 --> 03:09:28,500
Misa-san

4599
03:09:20,280 --> 03:09:24,160
when Endo eyed up on Misa, who worked as an extra in Gaki episodes,

4600
03:09:24,340 --> 03:09:28,000
and started flirting with her after work, while no one took notice of his behaviour.

4601
03:09:28,100 --> 03:09:31,430
This incident came under scrutiny during the Gaki's "absolutely no laughing" episode a few years ago,

4602
03:09:29,280 --> 03:09:38,010
Disclosed text message

4603
03:09:29,280 --> 03:09:38,010
From: Cocorico Endo "Good work today!
Misa chan, be honest with me if you have
BF already. From the look, I see you are
definitely M (sexually submissive)!
Shall I teach you a lot of "lessons"??? :-D"

4604
03:09:31,430 --> 03:09:35,120
Since then, his attempt to play around with her has ceased.

4605
03:09:35,240 --> 03:09:36,240
However!

4606
03:09:36,540 --> 03:09:37,240
HOWEVER!

4607
03:09:38,290 --> 03:09:40,960
Last year, in December 2011,

4608
03:09:40,990 --> 03:09:43,000
after a year without any apparent activity,

4609
03:09:43,440 --> 03:09:47,240
Misa got a text from Endo!

4610
03:09:47,240 --> 03:09:47,880
Sorry...

4611
03:09:48,040 --> 03:09:49,910
You brewed it for a year, didn't you?

4612
03:09:49,880 --> 03:09:51,180
Please, I beg you...

4613
03:09:51,190 --> 03:09:53,290
Here is the text he sent her!!

4614
03:09:54,050 --> 03:09:57,090
Endo

4615
03:09:54,050 --> 03:09:57,090
Misa-san

4616
03:09:54,050 --> 03:09:57,090
Secret

4617
03:09:54,050 --> 03:09:57,090
sent

4618
03:09:54,420 --> 03:09:55,190
Definitely this time,

4619
03:09:55,300 --> 03:09:57,000
@$&)*^%$!@$

4620
03:10:03,440 --> 03:10:05,700
Last year, in December 2011,

4621
03:10:05,940 --> 03:10:08,240
after a year without any apparent activity,

4622
03:10:08,440 --> 03:10:12,280
Misa got a text from Endo!

4623
03:10:13,120 --> 03:10:14,880
You brewed it for a year, didn't you?

4624
03:10:14,890 --> 03:10:15,920
Please, I beg you...

4625
03:10:15,930 --> 03:10:19,400
Here is the text he sent her!!

4626
03:10:19,410 --> 03:10:28,320
Endo

4627
03:10:19,410 --> 03:10:28,320
From: Cocorico Endo

4628
03:10:19,410 --> 03:10:28,320
How have you been?

4629
03:10:19,410 --> 03:10:28,320
I want to see yooou Misa ^_^

4630
03:10:19,410 --> 03:10:28,320
It's been a year ;-)

4631
03:10:19,410 --> 03:10:28,320
Misa-san

4632
03:10:19,410 --> 03:10:28,320
Next time we meet up,

4633
03:10:19,410 --> 03:10:28,320
sent

4634
03:10:19,410 --> 03:10:28,320
shall I give you a "lesson" then? LOL!

4635
03:10:19,880 --> 03:10:20,950
"it's been a year"

4636
03:10:21,420 --> 03:10:22,420
"how have you been?"

4637
03:10:22,520 --> 03:10:24,690
"I want to see you Misa"

4638
03:10:24,790 --> 03:10:29,900
"Next time we meet up, shall I give you a "lesson" then? LOL!"

4639
03:10:30,210 --> 03:10:31,780
What the hell were you doing man!!?

4640
03:10:34,170 --> 03:10:36,250
What a bombshell that was

4641
03:10:36,690 --> 03:10:39,620
Couldn't we have not aired this?

4642
03:10:37,510 --> 03:10:38,080
Ouch!!

4643
03:10:38,880 --> 03:10:40,750
We didn't know what the TV crew was up to either you know

4644
03:10:40,810 --> 03:10:41,810
Sit down Endo!

4645
03:10:41,950 --> 03:10:44,620
My parents are here...

4646
03:10:47,210 --> 03:10:48,700
Look behind you Endo

4647
03:10:48,130 --> 03:10:50,790
How can I look at them!!??

4648
03:10:49,480 --> 03:10:50,180
Well well well

4649
03:10:50,180 --> 03:10:50,790
You know what,

4650
03:10:50,790 --> 03:10:53,530
not just your parents - look at the one on the right!!

4651
03:10:55,640 --> 03:10:56,480
Jeez, scary

4652
03:10:56,750 --> 03:10:58,480
Oh my god...

4653
03:10:58,580 --> 03:10:59,520
Well?

4654
03:10:59,460 --> 03:11:00,470
What do I do now...?

4655
03:11:00,560 --> 03:11:01,380
And then,

4656
03:11:01,490 --> 03:11:02,540
Have you got more??

4657
03:11:02,420 --> 03:11:03,050
Of course

4658
03:11:04,410 --> 03:11:09,280
Since the message was sent to Misa, he started flirting with her

4659
03:11:09,330 --> 03:11:10,500
And in this occasion,

4660
03:11:11,120 --> 03:11:14,300
what did you ask her to do - eh?

4661
03:11:14,790 --> 03:11:15,330
Endo!

4662
03:11:15,370 --> 03:11:15,740
Yes

4663
03:11:15,980 --> 03:11:17,740
What did you ask her?

4664
03:11:16,260 --> 03:11:19,230
He hasn't heard anything - nothing

4665
03:11:17,060 --> 03:11:18,060
I don't know anything either

4666
03:11:17,660 --> 03:11:19,570
Erm, well, I'm not really...

4667
03:11:19,680 --> 03:11:20,840
To be honest

4668
03:11:21,090 --> 03:11:23,660
I don't remember very clearly so... you know...

4669
03:11:23,660 --> 03:11:25,300
You must remember - are you sure you don't?

4670
03:11:24,850 --> 03:11:27,030
I really don't - honestly

4671
03:11:25,300 --> 03:11:25,920
Sure?

4672
03:11:27,030 --> 03:11:31,300
Endo started asking her to send him a mobile photo of her

4673
03:11:31,300 --> 03:11:32,360
Here is the text message by him:

4674
03:11:32,310 --> 03:11:48,350
"Awwww! Your photo pweeeese!"

4675
03:11:32,310 --> 03:11:48,350
"Hey, I want your photo just for me, pweeese!
Can you send me a recent photo of you??"

4676
03:11:32,310 --> 03:11:48,350
"I'll be waiting for it! I want something
a little naughty pweeese! Hurry uuuup"

4677
03:11:32,310 --> 03:11:48,350
Endo

4678
03:11:32,310 --> 03:11:48,350
From: Cocorico Endo

4679
03:11:32,310 --> 03:11:48,350

"Hey, I want your photo just for me, pweeese (please)"

4682
03:11:36,130 --> 03:11:38,980
"Can you send me the recent photo of you??"

4683
03:11:39,420 --> 03:11:42,780
Next one is "Awwww! Your photo pweeeese!"

4684
03:11:40,560 --> 03:11:43,420
Dear me - Shozo!!!

4685
03:11:43,530 --> 03:11:48,860
"I'll be waiting for it! I want something a little naughty pweeese! Hurry uuuup"

4686
03:11:50,060 --> 03:11:51,000
Shozo!!!

4687
03:11:51,120 --> 03:11:52,720

03:11:53,450 --> 03:11:55,030
You...!

4689
03:11:55,210 --> 03:11:55,990
Endo!!

4690
03:11:56,040 --> 03:11:56,580
Endo!

4691
03:11:56,330 --> 03:11:57,360
How come we don't know this man!!?

4692
03:11:58,120 --> 03:11:59,050
Shozo!!

4693
03:11:59,430 --> 03:12:03,330
Please sentence me to death right now

4694
03:12:00,020 --> 03:12:00,620

Well done you!

4698
03:12:02,600 --> 03:12:04,880
What a lady killer!! Come on!!

4699
03:12:03,690 --> 03:12:04,400
Come on Endo

4700
03:12:05,440 --> 03:12:06,150
Shozo!

4701
03:12:06,190 --> 03:12:06,850
You! Seriously!

4702
03:12:06,850 --> 03:12:07,460
Man up!!

4703
03:12:07,460 --> 03:12:13,410
"Awwww! Your photo pweeeese!"

4704
03:12:07,460 --> 03:12:13,410
"Hey, I want your photo just for me, pweeese!

4705
03:12:07,470 --> 03:12:13,410

"Pweeese", "Pweeese", and "Pweeese" again,

4710
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:13,000
what the hell is wrong with you?

4711
03:12:14,750 --> 03:12:16,510
Hey (Endo's) mother! Why are you laughing!?

4712
03:12:19,040 --> 03:12:23,450
And the last texts he sent out to her,

4713
03:12:23,450 --> 03:12:24,790
let's have a look

4714
03:12:24,790 --> 03:12:33,730
"When we meet up next time,

do you want a "lesson" from me?

03:12:44,480 --> 03:12:47,520
"Pweeese"... the word doesn't even exist in this world you know

4731
03:12:45,740 --> 03:12:47,910
What the hell are you trying to achieve by asking her like a quiz?

4732
03:12:49,260 --> 03:12:50,120
Huh?

4733
03:12:50,310 --> 03:12:50,650
Yes...

4734
03:12:50,450 --> 03:12:50,960
So bad

4735
03:12:51,120 --> 03:12:52,150
Your Honour,

4736
03:12:52,260 --> 03:12:53,050
This Endo guy

4737
03:12:53,170 --> 03:12:54,680
What would like to do with him?

4738
03:12:54,680 --> 03:12:58,890
Well, I kind of understand where he is coming from, as a man, hmm

4739
03:12:58,890 --> 03:13:00,190
This is a difficult case...

4740
03:13:00,180 --> 03:13:02,790
Mmm?

4741
03:13:00,860 --> 03:13:02,790
Huh?

4742
03:13:02,010 --> 03:13:02,800
Your Honour,

4743
03:13:03,040 --> 03:13:05,530
I am actually able to present you

4744
03:13:05,550 --> 03:13:08,060
another case against this man

4745
03:13:07,620 --> 03:13:09,060
WHAT?

4746
03:13:08,060 --> 03:13:14,740
There are still other crimes Endo has commited!!

4747
03:13:08,280 --> 03:13:11,580
You're kidding right? What the hell? What the hell?

4748
03:13:11,570 --> 03:13:14,740
During the exact same time

4749
03:13:15,250 --> 03:13:19,340
Endo tried to get in with another woman at the same time.

4750
03:13:19,640 --> 03:13:26,350
He was trying it on another woman at the same time!

4751
03:13:19,640 --> 03:13:26,350
Is Endo a complete pervert?!

4752
03:13:22,420 --> 03:13:25,100
Wait, what is it? You're kidding me right?

4753
03:13:25,340 --> 03:13:26,350
Ehh, wait a minute!

4754
03:13:26,350 --> 03:13:34,690
Even more surprising is that she is

4755
03:13:29,520 --> 03:13:34,690
also a comedian

4756
03:13:34,990 --> 03:13:38,730
You've been REALLY pushing it on her

4757
03:13:36,290 --> 03:13:38,730
haven't you!?

4758
03:13:37,560 --> 03:13:40,730
EHHHHH, what what what what?!

4759
03:13:41,460 --> 03:13:44,470
Is it ok if we call her in?

4760
03:13:42,960 --> 03:13:45,400
Wait, wait, what, seriously what?!

4761
03:13:45,440 --> 03:13:47,140
Bring her in

4762
03:13:47,340 --> 03:13:48,670
Enter!

4763
03:13:48,180 --> 03:13:52,060
No seriously, who is it? Who?

4764
03:13:57,280 --> 03:14:00,650
After the break

4765
03:13:57,280 --> 03:14:00,650
Her identity is revealed!!

4766
03:13:57,280 --> 03:14:00,650
Mystery Talent

4767
03:14:01,050 --> 03:14:02,390
ENTER!

4768
03:14:02,390 --> 03:14:05,720
Seriously what? Who is it?

4769
03:14:11,180 --> 03:14:14,040
I'm sure everyone here knows who she is

4770
03:14:12,430 --> 03:14:19,140
Food researcher

4771
03:14:12,430 --> 03:14:19,140
Morizaki Yuki

4772
03:14:14,030 --> 03:14:19,140
She is from the Food research show, Morizaki Yuki.

4773
03:14:22,210 --> 03:14:24,910
So Morizuki san, if I may ask

4774
03:14:24,910 --> 03:14:29,610
Has Endo tried to

4775
03:14:28,110 --> 03:14:29,610
seduce you?

4776
03:14:29,610 --> 03:14:33,950
Yes, no question about it.

4777
03:14:39,180 --> 03:14:42,760
How much shit do people have on you!?

4778
03:14:45,620 --> 03:14:49,580
Ye and we're getting hit because of you!

4779
03:14:45,630 --> 03:14:49,000
Why then do we have to sit here and listen to this because of you?

4780
03:14:50,020 --> 03:14:52,340
Wait, look, he can't move or say anything at all!

4781
03:14:52,340 --> 03:14:55,080
You're right, he's hardly moving at all.

4782
03:14:56,240 --> 03:14:58,420
Anyway, the whole thing started..

4783
03:14:58,440 --> 03:15:06,250
All started on Cocorico's program

4784
03:14:58,680 --> 03:15:03,060
It all started on the famous Cocorico's show

4785
03:15:03,680 --> 03:15:06,460
where Morizaki-san was starring as a guest.

4786
03:15:06,460 --> 03:15:08,250
At one point, Morizaki san

4787
03:15:08,250 --> 03:15:11,250
went to check everything was okay in one of the scenes she had just done on film

4788
03:15:11,250 --> 03:15:13,020
and so went to the studio.

4789
03:15:13,020 --> 03:15:16,530
And the person who was there

4790
03:15:14,790 --> 03:15:16,530
was Endo Shouzou.

4791
03:15:16,690 --> 03:15:19,530
He liked Morizaki so much

4792
03:15:17,760 --> 03:15:19,530
after one look

4793
03:15:19,530 --> 03:15:24,070
that he did something unbelievable after the recordings had finished

4794
03:15:24,070 --> 03:15:27,900
He went to one of his juniors, who was good friends with Morizaki

4795
03:15:27,900 --> 03:15:30,180
and asked Tano Shingo

4796
03:15:27,900 --> 03:15:35,510
Tano Shingo

4797
03:15:30,170 --> 03:15:35,510
and forcifully got Morizaki's

4798
03:15:31,610 --> 03:15:35,510
email adress and phone number.

4799
03:15:34,620 --> 03:15:36,020
Why are you standing?

4800
03:15:35,810 --> 03:15:37,150
OOOOIIIII!

4801
03:15:37,150 --> 03:15:39,520
Don't run away.

4802
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:42,890
Pwease sit down properly.

4803
03:15:43,190 --> 03:15:49,560
Forced contact details off a junior.

4804
03:15:43,190 --> 03:15:49,560
Is Endo a complete pervert?!

4805
03:15:43,480 --> 03:15:47,280
So he got the email adress and the phone number.

4806
03:15:47,280 --> 03:15:50,140
And then he straight away went and

4807
03:15:50,160 --> 03:15:51,690
called her, didn't you

4808
03:15:51,690 --> 03:15:55,660
And according to Morizakisan's records, the phone conversation was as follows:

4809
03:15:54,330 --> 03:16:02,100
Endo's phone call

4810
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:59,870
Oh hello, do you know who this is? It's Cocorico Endo.

4811
03:15:59,870 --> 03:16:02,910
I just wanted to thank you for working so hard on my show last time

4812
03:16:03,070 --> 03:16:06,410
The TV ratings were so great and I'm so grateful

4813
03:16:06,410 --> 03:16:11,580
that I want to thank you, so let's go out with Tano Shingo sometime, what do you say?

4814
03:16:12,160 --> 03:16:14,740
However

4815
03:16:13,340 --> 03:16:14,740
this

4816
03:16:13,920 --> 03:16:14,740
dinner

4817
03:16:14,740 --> 03:16:16,740
Due to unfortunate scheduling differences,

4818
03:16:17,390 --> 03:16:23,860
Due to scheduling, didn't happen

4819
03:16:17,400 --> 03:16:19,500
they never got a chance to go to dinner.

4820
03:16:19,500 --> 03:16:21,500
Aaah, that's good!

4821
03:16:21,180 --> 03:16:23,500
So then Endo..

4822
03:16:23,860 --> 03:16:26,260
I guess he just couldn't wait any longer

4823
03:16:26,260 --> 03:16:29,100
He abused his powers as a comedian

4824
03:16:29,100 --> 03:16:31,000
He contacted one of the production companies and asked

4825
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:34,870
Can I not do a show with Morizaki san?

4826
03:16:33,740 --> 03:16:34,870
and tried to sort something out with them

4827
03:16:35,240 --> 03:16:42,780
Tries to force getting closer to Morizaki-san

4828
03:16:35,240 --> 03:16:42,780
Is Endo a total pervert?

4829
03:16:39,560 --> 03:16:42,780
And just really coincidentally, really coincidentally,

4830
03:16:42,780 --> 03:16:45,380
there was a food show which was being planned out

4831
03:16:45,380 --> 03:16:49,890
and the only person who had been casted

4832
03:16:46,250 --> 03:16:49,890
was in fact

4833
03:16:47,780 --> 03:16:49,890
Morizaki-san

4834
03:16:51,020 --> 03:16:56,530
and so reluctantly, they mentioned Endo's name

4835
03:16:54,090 --> 03:16:56,530
and he was booked to come onto the show.

4836
03:16:56,530 --> 03:16:58,160
And he was made one of the co-stars

4837
03:16:58,160 --> 03:17:00,700
That did happen!

4838
03:16:58,160 --> 03:17:08,040
A cooking Gran Prix show

4839
03:16:58,160 --> 03:17:08,040
Morizaki

4840
03:16:59,060 --> 03:17:01,100
It did, didn't it Endo-kun!

4841
03:17:01,100 --> 03:17:01,930
I remember..

4842
03:17:01,930 --> 03:17:04,700
Of course, you're the one who made it happen.

4843
03:17:05,580 --> 03:17:07,320
So, whilst filming

4844
03:17:07,320 --> 03:17:08,870
The show itself was good but

4845
03:17:08,870 --> 03:17:11,640
Endo wasn't experienced in

4846
03:17:09,810 --> 03:17:11,640
cooking programs and

4847
03:17:11,640 --> 03:17:13,780
whatever nice food he ate, he shouted

4848
03:17:13,780 --> 03:17:17,010
'That's SHOOO NIIIICEEE!!'

4849
03:17:15,440 --> 03:17:17,010
and he would just shout that

4850
03:17:17,010 --> 03:17:21,150
time after time again.

4851
03:17:22,250 --> 03:17:24,250
what the hell does that mean?

4852
03:17:25,300 --> 03:17:27,900
You don't really do that on a cooking program..

4853
03:17:27,600 --> 03:17:29,900
What the hell is that man..

4854
03:17:28,660 --> 03:17:29,900
Seriously man..

4855
03:17:34,400 --> 03:17:36,370
That's like a different kind of punishment

4856
03:17:36,370 --> 03:17:41,970
On this night

4857
03:17:40,340 --> 03:17:41,970
Endo sent this kind of email to her.

4858
03:17:41,970 --> 03:17:51,380
Endo

4859
03:17:41,970 --> 03:17:51,380
Thanks so much for making me food today.
It was so nice that when I return to Tokyo,
I would love looooove it if you could
make me some for myself, pwease?

4860
03:17:41,970 --> 03:17:51,380
Morizaki

4861
03:17:41,970 --> 03:17:51,380
sent to

4862
03:17:42,880 --> 03:17:45,760
Thanks so much for making me the food today.

4863
03:17:45,760 --> 03:17:50,250
It was so delicious

4864
03:17:47,500 --> 03:17:50,250
that when I return to Tokyo,

4865
03:17:50,260 --> 03:17:53,080
can you make some just for me, pwease?

4866
03:17:51,680 --> 03:17:59,720
Always say 'Hochii (Pwease)'

4867
03:17:51,680 --> 03:17:59,720
Is Endo a complete pervert?!

4868
03:17:58,740 --> 03:18:00,020
This isn't the truth, right?!

4869
03:18:00,020 --> 03:18:02,690
This is all fake right?

4870
03:18:02,930 --> 03:18:07,330
It is all.. True.

4871
03:18:16,620 --> 03:18:18,280
I feel so weak right now

4872
03:18:20,680 --> 03:18:26,150
Please

4873
03:18:21,910 --> 03:18:26,150
punish this

4874
03:18:22,750 --> 03:18:26,150
complete pervert

4875
03:18:24,160 --> 03:18:26,460
You're right, I can't let him off.

4876
03:18:26,460 --> 03:18:28,460
To the guys that have been listening the whole time,

4877
03:18:28,550 --> 03:18:32,990
Endo family,

4878
03:18:30,820 --> 03:18:32,990
as his family members, do you have anything to say to defend him?

4879
03:18:33,920 --> 03:18:35,720
Toyama-sama

4880
03:18:35,720 --> 03:18:38,490
Can I make a statement to defend him?

4881
03:18:38,720 --> 03:18:40,940
Who are you?

4882
03:18:38,730 --> 03:18:46,570
defends her ex husband

4883
03:18:38,730 --> 03:18:46,570
The ex wife

4884
03:18:40,940 --> 03:18:42,680
I am his ex wife

4885
03:18:42,680 --> 03:18:45,200
What does the ex wife have to say for him?

4886
03:18:45,200 --> 03:18:46,840
Go on then

4887
03:18:46,840 --> 03:18:53,440
Toyamasama, you may not know something.

4888
03:18:46,940 --> 03:18:55,700
Ex wife - Chiaki's statement

4889
03:18:50,510 --> 03:18:53,440
Endo is really stupid

4890
03:18:53,440 --> 03:18:56,350
but he is a very kind and cute person.

4891
03:18:56,710 --> 03:19:03,950
Even coming into 2012,

4892
03:18:58,780 --> 03:19:03,950
even though he has a girlfriend

4893
03:19:01,150 --> 03:19:03,950
he was cheating on her with another woman

4894
03:19:03,950 --> 03:19:08,490
that was exposed

4895
03:19:05,590 --> 03:19:08,490
and nearly made the news as a huge scandal

4896
03:19:08,490 --> 03:19:13,760
At that time

4897
03:19:11,260 --> 03:19:13,760
Endo called me, his ex wife

4898
03:19:13,760 --> 03:19:19,740
and asked me to do something about that newspaper article.

4899
03:19:17,230 --> 03:19:19,740
and he begged me

4900
03:19:19,740 --> 03:19:22,400
Why would you ask her!?

4901
03:19:29,200 --> 03:19:31,500
What the hell?

4902
03:19:32,580 --> 03:19:37,120
I just don't get this world..

4903
03:19:37,120 --> 03:19:38,420
And one more thing..

4904
03:19:38,420 --> 03:19:40,890
It's a completely different story to the one just now

4905
03:19:38,790 --> 03:19:46,090
Ex wife - Chiaki's statement

4906
03:19:41,300 --> 03:19:48,130
but a few months ago,

4907
03:19:43,260 --> 03:19:48,130
he told me he was really after this woman

4908
03:19:45,260 --> 03:19:48,130
and he was close to getting her where he wanted her

4909
03:19:48,130 --> 03:19:51,370
and he called me, his ex wife to tell me this!

4910
03:19:54,970 --> 03:19:56,340
What's wrong with you, seriously?

4911
03:20:04,060 --> 03:20:07,480
So Toyama-sama, please forgive him.

4912
03:20:08,680 --> 03:20:12,220
It's just been affairs

4913
03:20:10,120 --> 03:20:12,220
after affairs with you.

4914
03:20:12,220 --> 03:20:14,690
Even if the god of the sun forgave you

4915
03:20:14,690 --> 03:20:16,930
I,

4916
03:20:18,390 --> 03:20:22,460
and the blowing cherry blossoms

4917
03:20:19,830 --> 03:20:22,460
will not forgive you!!

4918
03:20:22,600 --> 03:20:23,960
You will

4919
03:20:23,960 --> 03:20:26,640
Face the ass cannon as punishment!!

4920
03:20:26,170 --> 03:20:33,140
Ass Cannon Punisment

4921
03:20:26,170 --> 03:20:33,140
Total Pervert's punishment

4922
03:20:29,740 --> 03:20:31,960
Hurry up and do it

4923
03:20:36,310 --> 03:20:40,020
Egashira 2:50

4924
03:20:36,310 --> 03:20:40,020
The cannon itself

4925
03:20:51,460 --> 03:20:53,430
Today there is going to be a revolution!

4926
03:20:53,430 --> 03:20:56,100
I'm going to make it happen in the Edo times!!

4927
03:20:56,100 --> 03:20:57,920
Here it comes!!

4928
03:21:08,860 --> 03:21:12,000
This is way too much. I wouldn't be able to take it

4929
03:21:21,260 --> 03:21:22,460
This is just ridiculous

4930
03:21:22,460 --> 03:21:25,960
Now the punishments have been handed out

4931
03:21:27,380 --> 03:21:30,040
Just amazing.. No one is laughing even..

4932
03:21:34,770 --> 03:21:35,340
Shall we head back?

4933
03:21:35,340 --> 03:21:39,470
Yes please

4934
03:21:36,840 --> 03:21:39,470
Let's go right now.

4935
03:21:39,470 --> 03:21:41,470
Endo, let's go

4936
03:21:40,560 --> 03:21:42,480
We're leaving.

4937
03:21:41,120 --> 03:21:44,550
We're leaving.

4938
03:21:41,940 --> 03:21:44,550
We're leaving.

4939
03:21:42,560 --> 03:21:44,550
Seriously man...

4940
03:21:45,010 --> 03:21:47,350
That was just amazing.

4941
03:21:47,580 --> 03:21:50,520
I know, I never expected it to become something this big..

4942
03:21:51,080 --> 03:21:52,780
Wow man...

4943
03:21:53,890 --> 03:21:56,390
Can they really show this on TV?

4944
03:21:54,260 --> 03:21:57,490
It'll be ok

4945
03:21:55,100 --> 03:21:57,780
They can, it's fine

4946
03:21:58,260 --> 03:22:01,040
Wow, if it was me, I don't think I would let them.

4947
03:21:59,920 --> 03:22:02,960
ENDO? ENDO? ENDO?

4948
03:22:03,260 --> 03:22:05,780
Let's recover. Come on.

4949
03:22:07,900 --> 03:22:09,770
Get a hold of yourself man.

4950
03:22:11,440 --> 03:22:17,480
The Edo Times are a laughing hell

4951
03:22:11,440 --> 03:22:17,480
To the bum and the heart

4952
03:22:11,440 --> 03:22:17,480
a huge scar is left!!

4953
03:22:12,140 --> 03:22:17,480
Even in the Edo times, there is a ton of traps for them.

4954
03:22:18,310 --> 03:22:23,590
will continue to haunt the 5!!

4955
03:22:18,310 --> 03:22:23,590
And after this, there will be even worse yet to come.

4956
03:22:18,310 --> 03:22:23,590
Even worse things and laughter traps

4957
03:22:25,820 --> 03:22:28,660
Right then,

4958
03:22:27,320 --> 03:22:28,660
the last part was just so ridiculous that..

4959
03:22:29,260 --> 03:22:30,540
I know right..

4960
03:22:30,540 --> 03:22:32,290
It makes the whole of the first half look kind of like....

4961
03:22:32,290 --> 03:22:34,500
If there's one thing that I can say right now

4962
03:22:34,500 --> 03:22:39,070
don't air that part on TV...

4963
03:22:35,530 --> 03:22:39,070

4964
03:22:38,760 --> 03:22:40,760

Brave..

4966
03:22:42,120 --> 03:22:44,120
I think everyone feels for you and you have more fans now.

4967
03:22:45,740 --> 03:22:49,520
Seriously, yes, you were able to take that much..

4968
03:22:49,720 --> 03:22:51,520
Yes, you should just use it from now on every time you get yourself into shit.

4969
03:22:51,680 --> 03:22:56,420
I'm going to try make this a famous catch phrase. I will.

4970
03:22:56,420 --> 03:22:58,820
Ah... I'm so tired.. So so tired..

4971
03:22:59,240 --> 03:23:00,600
They really got me good...

4972
03:23:00,470 --> 03:23:01,980
Please initiate the next segment

4973
03:23:01,980 --> 03:23:03,300
I want the next video,

4974
03:23:03,530 --> 03:23:08,570
Please~!

4975
03:23:11,010 --> 03:23:15,010
9:00 P.M., and the injuries from the verdict still have not healed.

4976
03:23:17,490 --> 03:23:20,260
Seriously...

4977
03:23:19,530 --> 03:23:23,150
That was powder from Ega-chan.

4978
03:23:21,080 --> 03:23:23,150
Yes it was.

4979
03:23:21,950 --> 03:23:24,950
I wasn't expecting that stuff when we were told "Let's go see an Edo trial"...

4980
03:23:25,020 --> 03:23:27,560
I have too many eccentricities...

4981
03:23:26,530 --> 03:23:27,530
Yeah...

4982
03:23:27,990 --> 03:23:30,460
Tanaka, can't you stop him?

4983
03:23:30,710 --> 03:23:33,030
His eccentricities...?

4984
03:23:31,300 --> 03:23:33,030
Why don't we live together?

4985
03:23:34,730 --> 03:23:37,870
I'm sorry... that's impossible.

4986
03:23:38,270 --> 03:23:40,140
As your eldest son? Is that impossible?

4987
03:23:40,140 --> 03:23:41,710
But the best option would be...

4988
03:23:41,720 --> 03:23:45,840
to be under Hamada's jurisdiction, don't you think?

4989
03:23:44,310 --> 03:23:46,310
I was thinking that too.

4990
03:23:45,850 --> 03:23:47,810
What do you mean? Why?

4991
03:23:46,710 --> 03:23:51,480
I think it's best if he became Hamada-san's adopted child...

4992
03:23:50,110 --> 03:23:51,810
Yeah, the younger one...

4993
03:23:52,220 --> 03:23:53,620
Father...

4994
03:23:53,890 --> 03:23:57,390
Hama-father...

4995
03:23:58,750 --> 03:24:01,430
Hama-father...

4996
03:24:01,430 --> 03:24:03,790
What the hell are you saying?

4997
03:24:10,330 --> 03:24:13,140
What about injecting female hormones?

4998
03:24:18,940 --> 03:24:20,810
What do you mean?

4999
03:24:21,150 --> 03:24:23,650
Apparently you'll calm down if you take female hormones...

5000
03:24:23,880 --> 03:24:26,850
In the end it's just that your male hormones are too strong...

5001
03:24:26,850 --> 03:24:30,190
It's not good to say this myself, but it worries me...

5002
03:24:31,830 --> 03:24:34,960
This is a church built by a foreign missionary,

5003
03:24:33,660 --> 03:24:37,690
Where You Can Tell Your Secrets

5004

5008
03:24:39,200 --> 03:24:45,600

He sure has an incredible face.

5013
03:24:59,770 --> 03:25:05,200
We livdgin....live in Edo and we've decided to get married.

5014

Congratulations.

5015
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:08,090
Thank you.

5016
03:25:08,090 --> 03:25:13,060
I've heard that you provide marriages of your country's style, Ohnishi Xavier-san.

5017
03:25:13,530 --> 03:25:19,530
(The character is based on Francisco Xavier, a famous christian missionary who came to Japan.)

Right, please go home. It's not good anymore.

5089
03:29:18,240 --> 03:29:23,240
Ohnishi Xavier Continues To Save Many People

5090
03:29:18,450 --> 03:29:23,240
Ohnishi Xavier now continues to lend a helping hand to many people.

5091
03:29:24,450 --> 03:29:25,450
Finally!

5092
03:29:26,140 --> 03:29:28,750
That's a relief.

5093
03:29:29,100 --> 03:29:33,460
He's even here in the Edo period.

5094
03:29:30,380 --> 03:29:32,420
-- Yeah he is.

5095
03:29:34,280 --> 03:29:35,880
Everybody, there's trouble!

5096
03:29:36,170 --> 03:29:40,080
The two fire fighting squads of Edo city are disputing over territory!

5097
03:29:41,860 --> 03:29:44,500
Come before it gets too serious!

5098
03:29:43,200 --> 03:29:44,950
-- Oh forgot about those guys...

5099
03:29:44,480 --> 03:29:47,970
Can you go and mediate, since you're teachers.

5100
03:29:49,410 --> 03:30:00,410
A fire fighting territory feud erupts

5101
03:29:49,410 --> 03:30:00,410
The 5 go to mediate as teachers

5102
03:29:49,730 --> 03:29:53,490
A feud erupts between two fire fighting groups.

5103
03:29:53,490 --> 03:29:57,170
Being teachers, the five hurry to mediate.

5104
03:29:57,170 --> 03:30:00,490
They seem to have somewhat realised,

5105
03:30:00,490 --> 03:30:03,930
but just what is awaiting them there?

5106
03:30:01,650 --> 03:30:04,650
What is awaiting them there!?

5107
03:30:05,770 --> 03:30:08,100
Edo city is beautiful at night too, isn't it?

5108
03:30:07,630 --> 03:30:08,650
Huh?

5109
03:30:08,430 --> 03:30:10,830
I thought that Edo city is beautiful at night too.

5110
03:30:10,990 --> 03:30:12,820
Sorry.

5111
03:30:12,830 --> 03:30:16,130
Assembly Hall

5112
03:30:13,840 --> 03:30:15,390
I'm coming in.

5113
03:30:17,730 --> 03:30:20,730
We came to stop the fire cuz you guys took so long!

5114
03:30:20,750 --> 03:30:22,620
Woah!

5115
03:30:22,680 --> 03:30:26,440
Explosive Mood

5116
03:30:23,470 --> 03:30:26,440
It's an explosive atmosphere.

5117
03:30:26,440 --> 03:30:29,750
The place where you guys came to extinguish a fire

5118
03:30:29,880 --> 03:30:32,720
was the territory of the Degawa Group!

5119
03:30:33,910 --> 03:30:36,420
Don't just leave a fire burning, ya idiots!!

5120
03:30:37,520 --> 03:30:39,320
I'll leave the rest to you!!

5121

Fine then asshole!

5124
03:30:45,240 --> 03:30:48,060
We'll put our bodies on the line and battle then!

5125
03:30:48,900 --> 03:30:50,900
Let's go you dogs!

5126
03:30:51,530 --> 03:30:56,720
Negotiations Breakdown Settle it with a body risking battle!!

5127
03:30:54,670 --> 03:30:56,670
Maaan, they're really angry.

5128
03:30:58,710 --> 03:31:00,710
We're gonna mess you up!

5129
03:31:00,890 --> 03:31:03,390
We, the Ueshima group are gonna...

5130

Ueshima Group Boss


Ueshima Ryuhei

5136
03:31:15,410 --> 03:31:18,160
...isn't scared of jumping into fire!

5137
03:31:18,160 --> 03:31:19,980
Right boss?

5138
03:31:18,600 --> 03:31:19,980
Yeah, that's for sure.

5139
03:31:20,200 --> 03:31:21,660
Don't push yourself!

5140
03:31:21,760 --> 03:31:25,890
From now, the boss will extinguish this fire...

5141
03:31:25,890 --> 03:31:28,400
with his ass.

5142
03:31:26,770 --> 03:31:28,720
Alrighty!

5143
03:31:29,420 --> 03:31:30,830
I won't even leave a trace!

5144
03:31:31,840 --> 03:31:37,840
Extinguish the candle fire with his ass within 1 minute

5145
03:31:31,840 --> 03:31:37,840
Ueshima Group's Will

5146
03:31:33,010 --> 03:31:35,010
1 minute is enough, right?

5147
03:31:34,810 --> 03:31:36,810
Yeah, 1 minute is fine.

5148
03:31:35,360 --> 03:31:38,880
Ok, in 1 minute....put that fire out!

5149
03:31:39,220 --> 03:31:40,450
Come on boss!

5150
03:31:45,690 --> 03:31:47,900
You can do it boss!

5151
03:31:59,900 --> 03:32:00,900
Wow.

5152
03:32:03,660 --> 03:32:05,810
Did ya see that, bastards!?

5153
03:32:06,740 --> 03:32:10,880
That took you more than 20 seconds, ya wuss!

5154
03:32:09,420 --> 03:32:11,440
That was nothin'!

5155
03:32:10,880 --> 03:32:14,120
Degawa Group

Hosshan.

5156
03:32:11,030 --> 03:32:14,210
We got a guy that can do it in under 20 seconds!

5157
03:32:14,920 --> 03:32:16,920
Stop lying, jackass!

5158
03:32:15,850 --> 03:32:16,850
-- S

5159
03:32:17,020 --> 03:32:19,020

Degawa Group

Haranishi Kouki

5161
03:32:20,220 --> 03:32:22,220
Let's do this!

5162
03:32:22,360 --> 03:32:24,160
Check out the thickness of this candle!

5163
03:32:24,790 --> 03:32:30,400
Degawa Group's Will

5164
03:32:24,790 --> 03:32:30,400
Will extinguish fire with the ass on a thicker candle than before

5165
03:32:25,490 --> 03:32:27,820
It's more than twice the thickness!

5166
03:32:28,120 --> 03:32:30,180
Not my problem if you get hurt!

5167
03:32:30,600 --> 03:32:33,130
How many seconds will ya take?

5168
03:32:31,780 --> 03:32:33,130
10 seconds!

5169
03:32:33,230 --> 03:32:34,470
You ok?

5170
03:32:33,780 --> 03:32:34,790
I'M FINE!

5171
03:32:34,470 --> 03:32:36,590
Ready...start!

5172
03:32:34,790 --> 03:32:35,590
YEAAHH!

5173
03:32:35,690 --> 03:32:36,590
YEAAHH!

5174
03:32:44,460 --> 03:32:47,490
See what we can do?

5175
03:32:53,920 --> 03:32:55,890
You did better than we expected.

5176
03:32:55,890 --> 03:32:58,150
Well done Haranishi!

5177
03:32:58,150 --> 03:33:00,330
This is standard! This is standard!

5178
03:33:00,330 --> 03:33:04,740
What do we fire fighters put out fires with? Water of course!

5179
03:33:05,240 --> 03:33:07,300
We also need this. Hey bring it out!

5180
03:33:08,670 --> 03:33:09,700
Woah!

5181
03:33:09,870 --> 03:33:12,280
Have you heard of goldfish scooping?

5182
03:33:13,010 --> 03:33:14,580
Of course I have.

5183
03:33:16,820 --> 03:33:21,520
I'll put this tube on my head,

5184
03:33:19,570 --> 03:33:21,520
they'll then pour goldfish inside it

5185
03:33:21,520 --> 03:33:23,550
and I'll catch all of them with my mouth!

5186
03:33:24,220 --> 03:33:31,190
Ueshima-Group's Will

5187
03:33:24,220 --> 03:33:31,190
Wear a special water tank, put lots of goldfish inside and catch with mouth

5188
03:33:25,940 --> 03:33:27,360
Are you serious...?

5189
03:33:28,090 --> 03:33:30,090
Wonder if you can do it?

5190
03:33:31,630 --> 03:33:34,540
Can you handle such a tight thing?

5191
03:33:34,600 --> 03:33:36,770
Is he okay?

5192
03:33:36,770 --> 03:33:39,820
This is dangerous.

5193
03:33:37,370 --> 03:33:39,820
You're gonna die!

5194
03:33:38,350 --> 03:33:39,820
-Yeah maybe if I was one of you!

5195
03:33:51,600 --> 03:33:53,280
ARE YOU STUPID!?

5196
03:33:55,760 --> 03:33:58,200
What was he trying to show us?

5197
03:33:58,200 --> 03:33:59,700
What the hell is this?

5198
03:34:00,400 --> 03:34:03,930
What the hell is this thing you suggested?

5199
03:34:04,310 --> 03:34:06,620
What the hell was that supposed to be!?

5200
03:34:06,770 --> 03:34:09,200
I applaud your commitment but I don't understand.

5201
03:34:09,220 --> 03:34:12,770
I'll show you how to actually catch them!

5202
03:34:14,560 --> 03:34:17,420
Shall I show you how?

5203
03:34:15,300 --> 03:34:18,270
Degawa Group Boss

Degawa Testuro

5204
03:34:16,900 --> 03:34:19,550
You can get them all, right boss?

5205
03:34:18,300 --> 03:34:19,550
Of course!

5206
03:34:20,630 --> 03:34:23,910
Look at the quality of these goldfish!

5207
03:34:24,510 --> 03:34:26,540
They are huge!

5208
03:34:27,750 --> 03:34:33,960
Degawa Group's Will

5209
03:34:27,750 --> 03:34:33,960
Wear a special water tank, put bigger goldfish inside and catch with mouth

5210
03:34:31,680 --> 03:34:34,250
Pour the water in up to here.

5211
03:34:34,260 --> 03:34:37,040
Okay, so I'll fill it to half way.

5212
03:34:35,460 --> 03:34:37,040
Yeah.

5213
03:34:37,790 --> 03:34:39,950
All at once won't be a good idea.

5214
03:34:39,450 --> 03:34:41,850
Oh, sorry!! My bad, my bad.

5215
03:34:40,200 --> 03:34:41,850
Huh, what's wrong?

5216
03:34:43,180 --> 03:34:44,610
I'm seriously sorry.

5217
03:34:44,610 --> 03:34:48,420
I forgot to take off my contact lenses!

5218
03:34:48,650 --> 03:34:51,550
You wrecked the tense atmosphere!

5219
03:34:56,270 --> 03:34:58,670
We don't care about stuff like that!

5220
03:34:58,720 --> 03:35:00,550
-- Don't look this way!

5221
03:35:02,730 --> 03:35:05,210
I had been asked to take it off!

5222
03:35:05,460 --> 03:35:07,870
Contact lenses in the Edo period...?

5223
03:35:08,120 --> 03:35:10,520
Please put it up to here to start with.

5224
03:35:10,850 --> 03:35:13,110
Why is he speaking with honorifics?

5225
03:35:14,790 --> 03:35:15,810
You ok?

5226
03:35:20,020 --> 03:35:22,430
What the hell are they showing us?

5227
03:35:22,430 --> 03:35:24,740
He's in trouble.

5228
03:35:25,490 --> 03:35:27,690
Hurry up and do it!!

5229
03:35:27,690 --> 03:35:30,150
No! I'm preparing myself!

5230
03:35:31,200 --> 03:35:33,410
You're not prepared!?

5231
03:35:33,660 --> 03:35:35,690
What the heck is this!

5232
03:35:36,340 --> 03:35:39,200
What the heck is this!

5233
03:35:37,990 --> 03:35:39,200
I'm sorry.

5234
03:35:39,390 --> 03:35:41,390
I'll prepare myself.

5235
03:35:43,160 --> 03:35:45,840
Shouldn't you have come after preparing yourself?

5236
03:35:45,790 --> 03:35:47,800
Prepared yet!?

5237
03:35:49,020 --> 03:35:51,280
Ok.

5238
03:35:49,650 --> 03:35:51,280
Here I go.

5239
03:35:55,890 --> 03:35:57,440
Go!

5240
03:35:58,750 --> 03:36:01,000
Get them!

5241
03:36:08,390 --> 03:36:10,410
How do you succeed at this?

5242
03:36:10,880 --> 03:36:13,920
This is friggin' crazy!

5243
03:36:14,280 --> 03:36:18,600
All goldfish are collected into the pool.

5244
03:36:15,820 --> 03:36:18,520
I at least got one in my mouth, didn't I!

5245
03:36:18,820 --> 03:36:21,100
Then bring "that" out!

5246
03:36:20,920 --> 03:36:22,800
We'll finish this fight right now.

5247
03:36:25,030 --> 03:36:27,840
This cushion we just place in the middle is

5248
03:36:27,860 --> 03:36:29,940
an odd one that suddenly explodes.

5249
03:36:30,310 --> 03:36:32,170
Huh?

5250
03:36:32,130 --> 03:36:35,130
On top of this explosive cushion...

5251
03:36:35,130 --> 03:36:37,840
our man Wakky will...

5252
03:36:37,480 --> 03:36:40,580
Ueshima Group

Wakky

5253
03:36:37,860 --> 03:36:39,930
finish eating a bowl of udon.

5254
03:36:40,900 --> 03:36:42,630
What does he mean?

5255
03:36:43,280 --> 03:36:45,380
Are you ready Wakky!?

5256
03:36:43,590 --> 03:36:50,090
Finish eating hot udon while on a cushion that suddenly explodes

5257
03:36:43,590 --> 03:36:50,090
Ueshima Group's Will

5258
03:36:43,800 --> 03:36:45,380
YEAAAHH!

5259
03:36:45,410 --> 03:36:48,570
Wakky has changed his look a lot recently.

5260
03:36:45,480 --> 03:36:47,770
And he won't even feel the heat!

5261
03:36:52,100 --> 03:36:55,360
This looks pretty dangerous.

5262
03:36:56,110 --> 03:36:57,990
This is really scary.

5263
03:36:57,710 --> 03:36:59,730
What the heck is this?

5264
03:36:59,320 --> 03:37:02,060
Alright, do your best!

5265
03:37:02,090 --> 03:37:04,700
Ready...GO!

5266
03:37:08,220 --> 03:37:10,720
Come on, you can do it!

5267
03:37:11,220 --> 03:37:12,850
He's having no problems.

5268
03:37:14,150 --> 03:37:16,230
He's just eating normally.

5269
03:37:16,230 --> 03:37:19,570
What the hell is this?

5270
03:37:17,170 --> 03:37:20,460
Seconds

5271
03:37:17,170 --> 03:37:20,460
Until the explosion

5272
03:37:17,290 --> 03:37:19,570
What the hell is this?

5273
03:37:27,790 --> 03:37:29,590
Crap that scared me!

5274
03:37:34,280 --> 03:37:36,490
HOW'S THAT!?

5275
03:37:39,290 --> 03:37:41,800
Is it ok to laugh at this?

5276
03:37:40,240 --> 03:37:42,270
That scared the crap out of me

5277
03:37:43,680 --> 03:37:45,180
That wasn't hot at all!

5278
03:37:45,180 --> 03:37:47,720
Man, you guys are SOFT!

5279
03:37:48,890 --> 03:37:52,800
If it was us, we'd eat nabeyaki udon on there!

5280
03:37:48,890 --> 03:37:52,800
Nabeyaki Udon: Udon served in a steaming pot.

5281
03:37:53,560 --> 03:37:59,590
Degawa Group's Will

5282
03:37:53,560 --> 03:37:59,590
Finish eating hot udon while on a cushion that suddenly explodes

5283
03:37:56,240 --> 03:37:58,640
Can you handle that!?

5284
03:37:59,930 --> 03:38:02,700
Our Hosshan can eat something waaay hotter!

5285
03:38:01,850 --> 03:38:03,180
Hell yeaah!

5286
03:38:03,330 --> 03:38:05,030
Who's that?

5287
03:38:05,360 --> 03:38:08,040
Was there ever a guy like that?

5288
03:38:08,990 --> 03:38:10,670
Who is he? Seriously.

5289
03:38:18,250 --> 03:38:20,820
He's our boss!

5290
03:38:21,050 --> 03:38:23,620
Since when did your boss look like that?

5291
03:38:23,820 --> 03:38:26,350
Show 'em, Hosshan!

5292
03:38:26,640 --> 03:38:27,640
Here I go!

5293
03:38:27,890 --> 03:38:30,810
That would be hot for sure.

5294
03:38:29,220 --> 03:38:30,810
Yeah.

5295
03:38:32,850 --> 03:38:34,580
Hurry up and eat!

5296
03:38:34,960 --> 03:38:36,610
Nice work! Nice work!

5297
03:38:36,710 --> 03:38:39,290
That looks really hot.

5298
03:38:37,610 --> 03:38:39,290
Isn't he having trouble eating?

5299
03:38:40,470 --> 03:38:44,140
Seconds

5300
03:38:40,470 --> 03:38:44,140
Until the explosion

5301
03:38:42,270 --> 03:38:44,480
Go! Go!

5302
03:39:00,140 --> 03:39:04,090
Keep laughin'! Keep laughin' Hosshan!

5303
03:39:05,080 --> 03:39:07,100
No problem at all!

5304
03:39:07,100 --> 03:39:08,640
You didn't even eat it!

5305
03:39:08,830 --> 03:39:12,000
He ate it AND he's laughing too!

5306
03:39:12,000 --> 03:39:14,200
To be honest, the Degawa Group is winning.

5307
03:39:14,200 --> 03:39:15,220
Yeah.

5308
03:39:18,570 --> 03:39:20,640
Bring "that" over here!!

5309
03:39:21,180 --> 03:39:23,380
You shouldn't try so hard!

5310
03:39:23,900 --> 03:39:29,570
What they brought were electric eels over 1 metre in length.

5311
03:39:30,020 --> 03:39:32,620
Surely this ain't okay.

5312
03:39:33,450 --> 03:39:40,230
Electricity emitted from it's body can make cows unconscious!?

5313
03:39:33,610 --> 03:39:37,210
The electric current they emit to catch prey

5314
03:39:37,210 --> 03:39:40,720
may be strong enough to bring down a cow.

5315
03:39:40,720 --> 03:39:43,330
They will move this dangerous creature

5316
03:39:40,730 --> 03:39:46,170
Move the electric eel to a different tank with bare hand in 1 minute

5317
03:39:40,730 --> 03:39:46,170
Ueshima Group's Will

5318
03:39:43,330 --> 03:39:45,760
to another tank with their bare hands, within a minute.

5319
03:39:46,170 --> 03:39:48,770
They get agitated if you make loud noises.

5320
03:39:48,770 --> 03:39:51,040
So let's do this quietly.

5321
03:39:51,670 --> 03:39:53,630
Sure, whatever.

5322
03:39:53,630 --> 03:39:56,740
Go Iwao.

5323
03:39:56,250 --> 03:39:58,750
Looks like he doesn't wanna.

5324
03:39:57,000 --> 03:39:59,980
Ueshima-Group

Iwao Noboru

5325
03:40:00,720 --> 03:40:03,150
Can you do it? Can you do it?

5326
03:40:03,320 --> 03:40:05,830
He's stronger than a cow. GO!

5327
03:40:05,830 --> 03:40:07,440
Seriously?

5328
03:40:08,340 --> 03:40:10,090
I don't get this.

5329
03:40:10,580 --> 03:40:12,970
Don't push yourself.

5330
03:40:12,170 --> 03:40:14,900
Be careful!

5331
03:40:20,040 --> 03:40:21,840
Are you scared?

5332
03:40:23,850 --> 03:40:25,210
NOOOOOO!!!

5333
03:40:36,030 --> 03:40:38,850
He said that from the pit of his stomach.

5334
03:40:39,890 --> 03:40:43,120
Are you gonna challenge this? You decide.

5335
03:40:43,120 --> 03:40:47,200
Please let me quit.

5336
03:40:53,120 --> 03:40:57,740
We are actually using eels with a low electric charge.

5337
03:40:55,530 --> 03:40:57,790
Well, these eels can make knock out cows!

5338
03:40:58,040 --> 03:41:02,720
Next, a leg strength training machine called the "Room Runner" is brought in.

5339
03:40:59,410 --> 03:41:03,540
Leg Strength Trainer

Room Runner

5340
03:41:03,870 --> 03:41:11,790
Degawa Group's Will

5341
03:41:03,870 --> 03:41:11,790
While running backwards

5342
03:41:03,870 --> 03:41:11,790
dips noodles in the hot soup and eat it.

5343
03:41:04,140 --> 03:41:07,990
They must dip noodles into the hot soup on the ground

5344
03:41:07,990 --> 03:41:11,370
and then eat it, all while running backwards.

5345
03:41:11,790 --> 03:41:15,490
Degawa Group

5346
03:41:11,790 --> 03:41:15,490
Kojima Kazuya (Unjash)

5347
03:41:12,020 --> 03:41:15,610
Degawa Group's Kojima decides to do this challenge.

5348
03:41:16,580 --> 03:41:17,880
This is a tough one right here.

5349
03:41:19,630 --> 03:41:21,360
Keep your eyes on me!

5350
03:41:23,350 --> 03:41:25,850
START

5351
03:41:25,850 --> 03:41:27,990
You can do it! Okay, now dip it.

5352
03:41:27,990 --> 03:41:29,790
Nicely done, nicely done.

5353
03:41:31,420 --> 03:41:34,050
You're still fine! Okay, okay!

5354
03:41:36,730 --> 03:41:38,730
You can do it!

5355
03:41:52,980 --> 03:41:55,250
What kind of situation is this?

5356
03:41:55,280 --> 03:41:58,290
It's exactly what you see!!

5357
03:42:01,720 --> 03:42:05,680
It was clearly less entertaining than the others

5358
03:42:04,910 --> 03:42:06,610
Seriously, what is this?

5359
03:42:10,710 --> 03:42:12,510
He totally ate that.

5360
03:42:12,710 --> 03:42:15,050
Bring "that" in!

5361
03:42:17,820 --> 03:42:22,010
Let us

5362
03:42:18,720 --> 03:42:22,010
show you just how

5363
03:42:19,810 --> 03:42:22,010
strong our guys are here!

5364
03:42:22,000 --> 03:42:23,880
Show 'em Tanaka!

5365
03:42:22,190 --> 03:42:25,890
Degawa Group

5366
03:42:22,190 --> 03:42:25,890
Tanaka Takushi (Ungirls)

5367
03:42:25,910 --> 03:42:27,910
I'll show you!

5368
03:42:28,430 --> 03:42:30,030
Now...

5369
03:42:30,070 --> 03:42:33,430
This macho guy's gonna give him a Romero Special!

5370
03:42:33,430 --> 03:42:37,170
And during that, he won't react at all

5371
03:42:37,170 --> 03:42:40,150
to being slapped in the crotch with this rope!

5372
03:42:37,300 --> 03:42:44,910
Degawa Group's Will

5373
03:42:37,300 --> 03:42:44,910
Withstand being hit in the crotch with a rope, while held in a Romero Special.

5374
03:42:42,820 --> 03:42:45,330
A Romero Special will be tough. Owww.

5375
03:42:45,660 --> 03:42:48,020
This won't be nice.

5376
03:42:48,570 --> 03:42:51,580
It looks like his arms will snap.

5377
03:42:51,490 --> 03:42:56,390
Haranishi will hit the crotch with a rope

5378
03:42:52,420 --> 03:42:54,670
Hit him really hard!

5379
03:42:58,170 --> 03:43:01,400
Ready....start!

5380
03:43:18,250 --> 03:43:21,230
What the hell!? Who benefits from this!?

5381
03:43:21,930 --> 03:43:25,400
Awesome as expected!

5382
03:43:27,160 --> 03:43:28,910
That was crazy right there.

5383
03:43:29,010 --> 03:43:31,010
Well done man.

5384
03:43:31,010 --> 03:43:32,800
I hit him pretty hard!

5385
03:43:32,900 --> 03:43:36,740
The Degawa Group is a bit in front now.

5386
03:43:38,110 --> 03:43:39,210
How'd ya like that!?

5387
03:43:39,240 --> 03:43:42,510
Our Yoshinobu can be hit twice as much!

5388
03:43:44,540 --> 03:43:47,910
Nakamura Yoshinobu (Producer)

5389
03:43:44,540 --> 03:43:47,910
Ueshima Group

5390
03:43:48,280 --> 03:43:50,480
Yoshinobu-san can't handle this, right?

5391
03:43:50,480 --> 03:43:55,250
Wakky will hit the crotch with the rope

5392
03:43:52,320 --> 03:43:55,280
With twice the strength as well.

5393
03:43:55,840 --> 03:43:57,060
Here we go.

5394
03:43:58,510 --> 03:44:00,670
Hit him twice as much!

5395
03:44:02,260 --> 03:44:03,690
But he's an amateur!

5396
03:44:04,550 --> 03:44:06,080
Twice as much!

5397
03:44:22,600 --> 03:44:24,250
This is hell!

5398
03:44:28,000 --> 03:44:31,580
People buy tickets for this stuff.

5399
03:44:32,200 --> 03:44:36,280
Brought in next was a boiling pot full of clothes.

5400
03:44:34,450 --> 03:44:41,260
Degawa Group's Will

5401
03:44:34,450 --> 03:44:41,260
Take out and wear a shirt, slacks and necktie from a pot with boiling water.

5402
03:44:36,540 --> 03:44:41,090
Inside are a collared shirt, slacks and a necktie.

5403
03:44:41,930 --> 03:44:46,630
Wear all the clothes within 1 minute!!

5404
03:44:41,930 --> 03:44:46,730
Haranishi says that he'll wear all of these within a minute.

5405
03:44:46,740 --> 03:44:48,740
Don't do it, jeeez.

5406
03:44:48,930 --> 03:44:51,440
Just don't do it...

5407
03:44:51,440 --> 03:44:54,320
Seriously, don't do it.

5408
03:44:51,720 --> 03:44:53,850
Ready...START!

5409
03:44:58,200 --> 03:45:00,020
Necktie first.

5410
03:45:04,530 --> 03:45:06,790
Come on! Come on!

5411
03:45:12,530 --> 03:45:16,000
He's friggin' saying that it's "hot".

5412
03:45:29,210 --> 03:45:32,210
See! He wore the necktie!

5413
03:45:35,610 --> 03:45:40,540
Next, a tank full of honey was brought in.

5414
03:45:40,540 --> 03:45:44,300
Degawa Group's boss sees how long he can

5415
03:45:41,470 --> 03:45:47,190
Degawa Group's Will

5416
03:45:41,470 --> 03:45:47,190
Put his head inside the tank and see how long he can hold his breath

5417
03:45:44,300 --> 03:45:47,560
hold his breath after dunking his head inside.

5418
03:45:49,080 --> 03:45:51,770
He takes time to prepare doesn't he?

5419
03:45:52,140 --> 03:45:53,950
When you're ready...

5420
03:45:53,950 --> 03:45:55,040
Hurry up!

5421
03:45:55,040 --> 03:46:02,710
He's preparing himself.

5422
03:46:01,010 --> 03:46:03,010
Hurry up!

5423
03:46:03,010 --> 03:46:05,900
I'm preparing myself right now

5424
03:46:10,740 --> 03:46:13,660
He put his arms inside too.

5425
03:46:14,970 --> 03:46:17,450
Why did he put his arms in first?

5426
03:46:16,460 --> 03:46:20,010
His head's not even in now!

5427
03:46:33,570 --> 03:46:35,410
So sweet!

5428
03:46:35,480 --> 03:46:37,640
Why did you put your arms in?

5429
03:46:40,570 --> 03:46:41,580
Sweet!

5430
03:46:41,580 --> 03:46:43,250
He thought there'd be more space.

5431
03:46:43,250 --> 03:46:45,750
It was like he dived in.

5432
03:46:46,120 --> 03:46:48,090
Stop being chicken!

5433
03:46:48,500 --> 03:46:52,690
There's no choice. Let's put an end to this!

5434
03:46:52,690 --> 03:46:54,030
Bring "that" in!

5435
03:46:56,000 --> 03:47:00,370
It's what the Edo fire fighters do when they wanna settle a battle.

5436
03:47:01,170 --> 03:47:03,600
We'll challenge you to an arm wrestle!

5437
03:47:03,600 --> 03:47:05,900
But not ordinary arm wrestling!

5438
03:47:05,900 --> 03:47:08,970
See this can of oxygen?

5439
03:47:09,140 --> 03:47:13,010
We'll shove this up our asses...

5440
03:47:13,010 --> 03:47:17,020
and the first to fart loses.

5441
03:47:17,020 --> 03:47:19,650
That's just damn crazy.

5442
03:47:23,080 --> 03:47:25,080
What is this?

5443
03:47:27,080 --> 03:47:29,080
Well then boss...

5444
03:47:29,080 --> 03:47:32,120
That old man there is in a mess.

5445
03:47:31,090 --> 03:47:33,670
We smashed you at this last year!

5446
03:47:34,360 --> 03:47:35,650
Are you sure about this?

5447
03:47:41,270 --> 03:47:44,410
Your leader's looking a bit weird.

5448
03:47:45,510 --> 03:47:49,980
Sorry, can I just have one more towel?

5449
03:47:49,980 --> 03:47:52,720
It gets in my eye and I can't do anything!

5450
03:47:56,120 --> 03:47:58,560
It's like a guy that stayed in the sauna too long.

5451
03:48:07,510 --> 03:48:09,900
Thanks.

5452
03:48:10,500 --> 03:48:12,840
OK, I'm fine.

5453
03:48:12,840 --> 03:48:14,640
Let's do this!

5454
03:48:15,040 --> 03:48:18,240
Arm wrestling competition

5455
03:48:15,680 --> 03:48:18,240
Tanaka Takushi

5456
03:48:15,680 --> 03:48:18,240
Team Degawa

5457
03:48:15,680 --> 03:48:18,240
Team Ueshima

5458
03:48:15,680 --> 03:48:18,240
Ueshima Ryuhei

5459
03:48:18,480 --> 03:48:20,880
I'll put lotion on you.

5460
03:48:21,180 --> 03:48:25,620
Ueshima's ass had growths on it last year and it wouldn't go in.

5461
03:48:23,980 --> 03:48:25,590
SHUT THE FUCK UP!

5462
03:48:25,590 --> 03:48:29,590
STOP TALKING ABOUT GROWTHS ON MY ASS, STUPID IDIOT!

5463
03:48:32,500 --> 03:48:35,070
He's totally pissed.

5464
03:48:35,070 --> 03:48:37,610
It's a delicate subject for him.

5465
03:48:38,830 --> 03:48:41,830
Never speak again about growths on my ass, you dickhead!

5466
03:48:44,800 --> 03:48:46,990
Ready, set...

5467
03:48:45,300 --> 03:48:50,240
Both insert oxygen at the same time

5468
03:48:46,990 --> 03:48:49,880
Relax your muscles!

5469
03:49:01,220 --> 03:49:03,550
OK!

5470
03:49:01,550 --> 03:49:06,190
Oxygen Injection Complete

5471
03:49:03,550 --> 03:49:06,730
OK, get on standby!

5472
03:49:06,730 --> 03:49:08,730
READY!

5473
03:49:08,730 --> 03:49:10,730
GO!

5474
03:49:09,120 --> 03:49:10,610
Bfft!

5475
03:49:11,220 --> 03:49:12,820
Bfft!

5476
03:49:13,290 --> 03:49:16,940
I'm sorry.

5477
03:49:20,340 --> 03:49:22,780
What's wrong with you?

5478
03:49:27,430 --> 03:49:30,080
Do it again!

5479
03:49:28,210 --> 03:49:32,150
Reorganize and start again

5480
03:49:30,080 --> 03:49:32,150
Well, it was my first time ever so...

5481
03:49:32,150 --> 03:49:35,040
"Ready, go" isn't the signal to fart.

5482
03:49:40,840 --> 03:49:42,840
Man, this is scary.

5483
03:49:43,290 --> 03:49:45,270
It's scary, I'm telling ya.

5484
03:49:46,530 --> 03:49:48,330
Put in more for me.

5485
03:49:48,530 --> 03:49:49,970
Alright.

5486
03:49:52,070 --> 03:49:54,610
Ready

5487
03:49:54,610 --> 03:49:56,940
GO!

5488
03:50:02,450 --> 03:50:04,120
Pfft

5489
03:50:02,820 --> 03:50:04,120
Brp

5490
03:50:04,120 --> 03:50:05,800
Pfft

5491
03:50:04,480 --> 03:50:05,800
Brp

5492
03:50:11,280 --> 03:50:13,700
That's enough!

5493
03:50:13,700 --> 03:50:16,270
Of course this'll happen!

5494
03:50:16,500 --> 03:50:18,360
Of course this'll happen.

5495
03:50:21,030 --> 03:50:23,340
I gotta praise you despite being an enemy.

5496
03:50:23,340 --> 03:50:25,710
We're sorry too.

5497
03:50:23,770 --> 03:50:28,740
Ends in peace

5498
03:50:28,920 --> 03:50:31,200
Well, let's go then.

5499
03:50:35,780 --> 03:50:38,780
It was amazing again this year.

5500
03:50:45,100 --> 03:50:47,700
It's good we've become friend, huh?

5501
03:50:50,200 --> 03:50:52,240
Huh?

5502
03:50:52,240 --> 03:50:55,980
Isn't that the Terminator?

5503
03:50:56,480 --> 03:51:00,820
Terminator appears

5504
03:50:58,420 --> 03:51:00,550
Isn't that Mr. Terminator?

5505
03:51:01,280 --> 03:51:03,520
Oh, he stole some clothes.

5506
03:51:03,520 --> 03:51:07,860
Searching for someone?

5507
03:51:25,440 --> 03:51:28,610
Terminator checks the five

5508
03:51:32,770 --> 03:51:36,290
Mr. Terminator, are you looking for someone?

5509
03:51:44,600 --> 03:51:51,070
Mr. Terminator, where did you get those clothes?

5510
03:51:51,070 --> 03:51:55,840
Mr. Terminator.

5511
03:51:55,840 --> 03:51:59,180
Mr. Terminator.

5512
03:51:59,180 --> 03:52:01,510
What's your reason for coming to Edo?

5513
03:52:08,860 --> 03:52:11,460
Jeez, come on....

5514
03:52:14,020 --> 03:52:18,930
He doesn't understand the meaning of the words.

5515
03:52:20,610 --> 03:52:23,090
Hey! Wasn't she a person picking up coins?

5516
03:52:21,400 --> 03:52:26,340
Henmi Mari

5517
03:52:21,400 --> 03:52:26,340
Villager

5518
03:52:24,660 --> 03:52:26,660
A person that picked up coins!

5519
03:52:38,510 --> 03:52:44,050
Pursues Henmi and fires gun randomly

5520
03:52:38,860 --> 03:52:41,280
His shooting majorly sucks.

5521
03:52:45,920 --> 03:52:48,190
He's shooting somewhere completely different.

5522
03:52:51,790 --> 03:52:53,560
Time it properly!

5523
03:52:53,560 --> 03:52:55,750
It's not hitting at all!

5524
03:52:56,880 --> 03:52:58,780
Damn, he sucks at shooting.

5525
03:53:01,190 --> 03:53:03,170
He really sucks.

5526
03:53:02,090 --> 03:53:04,700
What the hell, man?!

5527
03:53:09,900 --> 03:53:14,270
I'm guessing Terminator

5528
03:53:10,840 --> 03:53:14,270
came back from the future just to find her, huh?

5529
03:53:14,410 --> 03:53:17,050
I guess that's how it was..

5530
03:53:15,940 --> 03:53:17,710
I hope she was able to run away successfully.

5531
03:53:18,290 --> 03:53:19,170
Let's go

5532
03:53:20,050 --> 03:53:24,450
I have no idea

5533
03:53:20,610 --> 03:53:24,450
What's going to happen next..

5534
03:53:21,650 --> 03:53:23,270
You're right there..

5535
03:53:25,270 --> 03:53:27,570
10:30 in the evening.

5536
03:53:27,580 --> 03:53:30,760
They start to play with the thing they were curious about.

5537
03:53:31,460 --> 03:53:33,790
It's just so cute.

5538
03:53:33,790 --> 03:53:34,930
That's so cute.

5539
03:53:34,770 --> 03:53:36,650
You really like it don't you Housei-san?

5540
03:53:36,710 --> 03:53:37,770
Particularly the lips.

5541
03:53:37,200 --> 03:53:40,370
Ventriloquist puppet 'Hama-chan'

5542
03:53:37,630 --> 03:53:39,290
Play with it.

5543
03:53:39,430 --> 03:53:40,210
For real?

5544
03:53:41,030 --> 03:53:42,370
How old are you?

5545
03:53:42,730 --> 03:53:44,840
I'm 45 years old.

5546
03:53:47,630 --> 03:53:50,150
Hey. You're not even trying

5547
03:53:50,950 --> 03:53:52,870
You're not even try to use ventriloquism

5548
03:53:53,450 --> 03:53:54,570
Why me as well?

5549
03:53:55,410 --> 03:53:56,570
Who?

5550
03:53:55,670 --> 03:53:56,550
Who, me?

5551
03:53:58,850 --> 03:54:00,990
I really wasn't laughing though..

5552
03:54:08,710 --> 03:54:09,870
You're so dirty man...

5553
03:54:09,650 --> 03:54:10,790
What the hell...

5554
03:54:22,430 --> 03:54:23,270
Right there..

5555
03:54:23,350 --> 03:54:25,390
There it is, there it is.

5556
03:54:25,910 --> 03:54:31,550
I wonder if

5557
03:54:27,210 --> 03:54:31,550
they might try and sell this

5558
03:54:27,710 --> 03:54:31,550
they might sell it again?

5559
03:54:29,050 --> 03:54:31,550
What the hell is the point in selling something like that?

5560
03:54:39,650 --> 03:54:40,790
Again.

5561
03:54:41,570 --> 03:54:42,650
Shit man.

5562
03:54:42,270 --> 03:54:43,370
That is scary.

5563
03:54:44,330 --> 03:54:47,000
Isn't the back of the head just normal?

5564
03:54:45,970 --> 03:54:47,690
No, well it's...

5565
03:54:47,510 --> 03:54:49,030
What, what? I'm scared.

5566
03:54:49,230 --> 03:54:52,040
There's like a part you shouldn't see

5567
03:54:50,070 --> 03:54:52,040
like on a backstage.

5568
03:54:52,170 --> 03:54:54,590
Like the thing you should never see in the backstages..

5569
03:54:56,350 --> 03:54:57,150
Shit man.

5570
03:54:57,970 --> 03:54:58,710
That's amazing

5571
03:54:58,480 --> 03:55:00,980
It's not cute even in the slightest.

5572
03:55:00,590 --> 03:55:02,140
Do you hate it now?

5573
03:55:01,790 --> 03:55:04,590
I don't like it, it's creepy and weird.

5574
03:55:07,200 --> 03:55:08,450
Play with it Endo.

5575
03:55:08,470 --> 03:55:10,720
Let's find out who's the best at it.

5576
03:55:09,800 --> 03:55:10,720
Ok.

5577
03:55:10,740 --> 03:55:13,280
Hama-chan is a fine name.

5578
03:55:12,260 --> 03:55:13,280
Ok then.

5579
03:55:13,310 --> 03:55:15,590
Actually, Koma-chan

5580
03:55:14,110 --> 03:55:15,590
Koma-chan?

5581
03:55:15,980 --> 03:55:17,590
It's better if you fiddle and get used to it a bit.

5582
03:55:19,350 --> 03:55:20,100
Ok.

5583
03:55:20,110 --> 03:55:21,160
Ok, go.

5584
03:55:21,720 --> 03:55:23,700
Oh, you're going to hide your face?

5585
03:55:24,390 --> 03:55:28,400
No, you're meant to hold it next to your face.

5586
03:55:32,460 --> 03:55:35,960
Endo, you really know nothing, huh?

5587
03:55:39,100 --> 03:55:40,260
Please.

5588
03:55:40,470 --> 03:55:44,320
I'm guessing the staff really wanted us to do this though

5589
03:55:43,100 --> 03:55:44,030
Ah, I get it.

5590
03:55:44,540 --> 03:55:47,320
Man, so tired today, huh?

5591
03:55:48,510 --> 03:55:49,650
@($£$£(@)@$?!

5592
03:55:49,680 --> 03:55:53,120
Yes, I'm fine. How many hours do you think I work?

5593
03:55:53,150 --> 03:55:54,460
@($£$£(@)@$...

5594
03:55:56,880 --> 03:55:57,930
That is just fascinating.

5595
03:55:58,190 --> 03:56:00,830
I have no idea in hell what Koma-chan is trying to say.

5596
03:55:59,090 --> 03:56:02,860
We can't understand a thing, not even a word.

5597
03:56:02,560 --> 03:56:04,440
Just like 'mogo mogo, mogo mogo'

5598
03:56:07,360 --> 03:56:10,810
You're not meant to move your own mouth, so you try and hide your lip movements.

5599
03:56:10,830 --> 03:56:13,510
It's like a retired person.

5600
03:56:13,530 --> 03:56:18,920
If you're trying to do it properly, that's what it's going to be like.

5601
03:56:17,570 --> 03:56:18,920
Wow, this is nostalgic.

5602
03:56:18,940 --> 03:56:21,390
It's really properly made so it's heavy.

5603
03:56:22,910 --> 03:56:25,160
Koma-chan

5604
03:56:25,180 --> 03:56:27,120
What were you doing?

5605
03:56:27,180 --> 03:56:29,460
@($£$£...

5606
03:56:29,480 --> 03:56:31,930
I have no idea what you're saying.

5607
03:56:31,950 --> 03:56:35,430
It's so hard... Impossible!

5608
03:56:36,590 --> 03:56:38,340
No, no, it's so hard to do this..

5609
03:56:38,390 --> 03:56:41,540
The whole balance of the situation just gets weird.

5610
03:56:44,010 --> 03:56:46,870
Oh, so you begin to wonder how the pros do it.

5611
03:56:45,770 --> 03:56:47,940
Yes, and then you begin to lose yourself.

5612
03:56:48,300 --> 03:56:50,280
Housei-san looks like he would be good at this.

5613
03:56:50,910 --> 03:56:54,050
Hey, Koma-chan? What's wrong?

5614
03:56:54,080 --> 03:56:56,720
What's wrong Koma-chan?

5615
03:56:56,780 --> 03:57:00,660
I'm a little tired~~~

5616
03:57:02,480 --> 03:57:04,500
You're talking normally!

5617
03:57:10,160 --> 03:57:12,440
The subject of the conversation is just so boring.

5618
03:57:12,770 --> 03:57:14,670
You guys are so pathetic because

5619
03:57:14,700 --> 03:57:17,340
It's just not dynamic at all

5620
03:57:18,830 --> 03:57:19,180
Oh I see

5621
03:57:19,200 --> 03:57:20,880
You can ask me anything

5622
03:57:21,840 --> 03:57:23,010
How old are you?

5623
03:57:23,140 --> 03:57:25,380
Shut up, you bastard!!

5624
03:57:25,410 --> 03:57:26,820
Where did you come from?

5625
03:57:26,840 --> 03:57:28,050
Shit!!

5626
03:57:28,940 --> 03:57:29,920
You're so cute, huh?

5627
03:57:29,940 --> 03:57:31,590

03:57:38,490 --> 03:57:42,200
So scary man.. All the kids would cry

5633
03:57:40,090 --> 03:57:42,200
All the kids would cry.

5634
03:57:42,220 --> 03:57:44,270
He's not loving in the slightest.

Next, they will go and see what Edo men love to see, a Courtesan's dance.

5638
03:57:56,070 --> 03:58:05,890
"Courtesans dance"

5639
03:57:56,070 --> 03:58:05,890
is what they'll see next!!

5640
03:57:56,070 --> 03:58:05,890
It attracts a lot of the Edo times men

5641
03:58:02,040 --> 03:58:05,890
Between the 5, there is a strange feeling about this next event.

Red Light District

5643
03:58:07,970 --> 03:58:09,580

Oi, you Edo Bastards

5675
04:00:19,080 --> 04:00:20,720
I've got good news for you today.

5676
04:00:20,950 --> 04:00:25,360
In this room, there is a huge burglar

5677
04:00:25,420 --> 04:00:27,030
Nezumi Kozou

5678
04:00:27,650 --> 04:00:33,200
Burglar - Nezumi Kozou

5679
04:00:27,650 --> 04:00:33,200
within the crowd!!

5680
04:00:28,490 --> 04:00:33,200
Today, I am going to capture him.

5681
04:00:33,590 --> 04:00:36,710
Anyone have any idea?

5682
04:00:37,290 --> 04:00:40,190
Any information is good.

5683
04:00:42,200 --> 04:00:44,720
I have solid proof today you know?

5684
04:00:44,740 --> 04:00:45,150
Oi!!

5685
04:00:46,110 --> 04:00:47,150
Here it is.

5686
04:00:47,210 --> 04:00:49,890
Secret Agent

5687
04:00:47,210 --> 04:00:49,890
Nezumi Sempai

5688
04:00:47,470 --> 04:00:49,890
This is my secret agent, Nezumi.

5689
04:00:51,710 --> 04:00:53,190
This is a really good portrait of him

5690
04:00:53,580 --> 04:01:00,230
. The 'solid proof' is

5691
04:00:53,730 --> 04:01:00,230
a drawing of Nezumi Kozou!!

5692
04:00:54,010 --> 04:00:56,490
So he's in this room somewhere, right?

5693
04:00:55,580 --> 04:00:56,490
Yes, correct.

5694
04:00:57,580 --> 04:01:00,230
You're not going to own up then?

5695
04:01:00,990 --> 04:01:02,500
You sure you're ok with that?

5696
04:01:03,910 --> 04:01:05,610
Fine then, I have no choice..

5697
04:01:15,840 --> 04:01:18,010
Seriously?

5698
04:01:16,870 --> 04:01:18,010
No way, no way...

5699
04:01:17,790 --> 04:01:19,870
It can ONLY be Yama-chan

5700
04:01:23,960 --> 04:01:26,020
Seriously?

5701
04:01:29,320 --> 04:01:32,700
Anyone have any idea of this man?

5702
04:01:32,720 --> 04:01:34,600
I'm correct in thinking no one does, right?

5703
04:01:35,290 --> 04:01:37,570
Ok fine... then one by one...

5704
04:01:38,020 --> 04:01:40,100
you'll put this little hood on your head.

5705
04:01:40,630 --> 04:01:46,040
Find the thief by making them

5706
04:01:40,790 --> 04:01:46,040
put the hood on their head!!

5707
04:01:41,860 --> 04:01:42,970
I guess we have no choice.

5708
04:01:52,340 --> 04:01:55,020
Hold this for a second

5709
04:01:57,140 --> 04:01:59,590
Right, let's start with you

5710
04:01:59,610 --> 04:02:02,560
Right, wear this.

5711
04:02:01,250 --> 04:02:02,560
Ok

5712
04:02:02,880 --> 04:02:04,960
Put the wear on like this

5713
04:02:04,080 --> 04:02:04,960
Ok

5714
04:02:08,820 --> 04:02:11,370
Are you a man?

5715
04:02:11,420 --> 04:02:14,870
I'm a woman.

5716
04:02:14,030 --> 04:02:15,330
No, it's not you.

5717
04:02:15,430 --> 04:02:16,240
Ok, next.

5718
04:02:16,060 --> 04:02:16,400
Ok

5719
04:02:16,960 --> 04:02:19,410
I am a woman...

5720
04:02:22,200 --> 04:02:25,020
It's not you either.

5721
04:02:28,540 --> 04:02:29,850
No, it's not you.

5722
04:02:33,180 --> 04:02:34,960
Oi, just hurry up and own up already!!

5723
04:02:34,980 --> 04:02:37,690
You're being a nuisance to everyone!!

5724
04:02:40,950 --> 04:02:43,370
You're ugly but it's not you

5725
04:02:44,590 --> 04:02:46,200
Phew

5726
04:02:44,590 --> 04:02:46,200
Phew

5727
04:02:49,400 --> 04:02:50,270
No, it's not you.

5728
04:02:50,300 --> 04:02:54,010
Ok, you do it!

5729
04:03:12,290 --> 04:03:16,630
Yamazaki, just stop.

5730
04:03:15,120 --> 04:03:16,630
Just stop it already.

5731
04:03:16,990 --> 04:03:19,840
Just put it on normally!

5732
04:03:18,020 --> 04:03:19,840
It's just ridiculous

5733
04:03:19,530 --> 04:03:21,530
This is just all so ridiculous.

5734
04:03:20,390 --> 04:03:23,100
Just put it on normally
for crying out loud.

5735
04:03:23,460 --> 04:03:26,430
Look closely, can you see?

5736
04:03:26,900 --> 04:03:29,980
Nezumi Kozou. Isn't that you?

5737
04:03:30,000 --> 04:03:30,550
It's not me.

5738
04:03:30,770 --> 04:03:32,750
Ok fine, then stand up once.

5739
04:03:33,350 --> 04:03:37,290
Stand up once and show your face to everyone.

5740
04:03:42,250 --> 04:03:44,690
What is with your face.

5741
04:03:44,720 --> 04:03:47,730
Is that your face when you took the photo?

5742
04:03:47,750 --> 04:03:49,130
What kind of face do you have?

5743
04:03:50,590 --> 04:03:52,440
It's the same!!

5744
04:03:52,960 --> 04:03:55,410
You knew from the start, huh?

5745
04:03:56,160 --> 04:03:58,880
We will meet in any era... you get it?

5746
04:03:59,530 --> 04:04:01,430
Any era?

5747
04:04:02,770 --> 04:04:04,350
Get up on the stage!!

5748
04:04:04,370 --> 04:04:05,950
Wait, please..

5749
04:04:05,970 --> 04:04:09,120
Seriously, but these are my friends

5750
04:04:09,840 --> 04:04:11,120
They know that I am not Nezumi Kozou...

5751
04:04:11,140 --> 04:04:13,420
Are you saying that

5752
04:04:12,080 --> 04:04:13,420
that they knew and protected you?

5753
04:04:13,290 --> 04:04:14,590
Yes

5754
04:04:14,980 --> 04:04:16,490
If they did, they are just as guilty as you, you know?!

5755
04:04:16,520 --> 04:04:18,460
Yes.

5756
04:04:18,480 --> 04:04:20,200
Please clarify with them that it's not me.

5757
04:04:21,850 --> 04:04:23,870
Oi, did you know about this?

5758
04:04:23,890 --> 04:04:26,700
No, we had no idea at all.

5759
04:04:25,090 --> 04:04:26,700
See, they don't.

5760
04:04:26,730 --> 04:04:28,300
But they didn't know, so...

5761
04:04:28,330 --> 04:04:30,610
Surely that proves that I'm not Nezumi Kozou.

5762
04:04:28,900 --> 04:04:31,130
Just get on the stage once.

5763
04:04:32,000 --> 04:04:34,470
Wait a second, wait a second!

5764
04:04:32,900 --> 04:04:36,510
A really hard slap!!

5765
04:04:32,900 --> 04:04:36,510
Punishment for Nezumi Kozou

5766
04:04:35,440 --> 04:04:36,510
What should I do?

5767
04:04:37,140 --> 04:04:38,610
Just the same as usual.

5768
04:04:41,710 --> 04:04:43,890
I'll give you one chance to redeem yourself.

5769
04:04:42,680 --> 04:04:43,890
Yes, yes.

5770
04:04:45,340 --> 04:04:46,720
You have 1 minute.

5771
04:04:46,750 --> 04:04:48,360
1 minute?

5772
04:04:47,310 --> 04:04:48,360
Yes, 1 minute.

5773
04:04:48,380 --> 04:04:51,830
Make everyone... laugh.

5774
04:04:52,690 --> 04:04:56,770
Make everyone laugh and

5775
04:04:52,690 --> 04:04:56,770
there will be no slap!!

5776
04:04:54,720 --> 04:04:57,390
Including me, everyone has to laugh.

5777
04:04:58,190 --> 04:04:59,060
Get it?

5778
04:05:00,160 --> 04:05:02,170
Get set... Go!!

5779
04:05:03,100 --> 04:05:06,360
Please look at this stick...

5780
04:05:04,200 --> 04:05:09,180
Tries with the stick that was coincidentally on the floor

5781
04:05:06,400 --> 04:05:07,870
Please look at it closely!!!!

5782
04:05:07,900 --> 04:05:09,940
This stick!!!

5783
04:05:15,370 --> 04:05:17,440
Oh man, this is the most humiliating thing ever...

5784
04:05:24,650 --> 04:05:26,090
You did try though..

5785
04:05:26,150 --> 04:05:28,630
What the hell is this!!

5786
04:05:26,690 --> 04:05:28,630
It's just messed up.

5787
04:05:30,790 --> 04:05:34,240
You were never going to do it with such a stupid joke!!

5788
04:05:34,260 --> 04:05:37,210
Oi, is that insult aimed at me?

5789
04:05:35,930 --> 04:05:37,130
No, not at all.

5790
04:05:37,230 --> 04:05:38,540
Chouno-san.

5791
04:05:37,970 --> 04:05:38,540
What?

5792
04:05:39,630 --> 04:05:41,880
Chouno-san.

5793
04:05:46,140 --> 04:05:47,210
Chouno-san, please.

5794
04:05:48,170 --> 04:05:49,750
Just get it over with

5795
04:05:49,840 --> 04:05:52,560
I will, I will.

5796
04:05:56,380 --> 04:05:58,820
Ok, I get it. I'm going to get it anyway.

5797
04:05:59,020 --> 04:06:01,390
I will take it. There's no point...

5798
04:06:01,450 --> 04:06:02,770
Good good good...

5799
04:06:01,810 --> 04:06:02,770
Yep...

5800
04:06:11,030 --> 04:06:12,430
Right, here we go...

5801
04:06:13,530 --> 04:06:17,110
Say 'I am Nezumi Kozou and I am sorry'!!!

5802
04:06:21,010 --> 04:06:22,920
Hurry, say it!

5803
04:06:23,440 --> 04:06:25,440
Don't move around.

5804
04:06:23,680 --> 04:06:25,690
Just wait a second, please.

5805
04:06:26,080 --> 04:06:26,890
What now

5806
04:06:26,480 --> 04:06:28,260
Please get your foot off!!

5807
04:06:33,120 --> 04:06:36,270
Wait, ow!!

5808
04:06:38,590 --> 04:06:40,030
What happened?

5809
04:06:40,060 --> 04:06:42,200
My thigh hurts!!

5810
04:06:42,900 --> 04:06:45,210
My thigh!!

5811
04:06:45,560 --> 04:06:46,740
Hurry up and stand up!

5812
04:06:46,770 --> 04:06:48,680
The joint in my hip seriously just ripped!!

5813
04:06:48,700 --> 04:06:50,110
The joint! Ow!!

5814
04:06:50,770 --> 04:06:52,850
You can't stand up?

5815
04:06:51,370 --> 04:06:52,850
No I can't!

5816
04:06:52,870 --> 04:06:55,350
Don't lie man!

5817
04:07:01,580 --> 04:07:04,360
Please, let go!!

5818
04:07:04,380 --> 04:07:06,900
The joint in my hip ripped!

5819
04:07:05,990 --> 04:07:08,350
Come on, just stand up

5820
04:07:08,820 --> 04:07:11,120
Come on, come on.

5821
04:07:11,160 --> 04:07:12,600
See, he stood up fine.

5822
04:07:11,420 --> 04:07:13,140
Just come here.

5823
04:07:12,630 --> 04:07:15,770
Oh my god, he was lying so bad...

5824
04:07:16,130 --> 04:07:19,240
Everyone's waiting you know?

5825
04:07:17,200 --> 04:07:19,240
Ok, ok, ok, I get it.

5826
04:07:19,270 --> 04:07:21,880
Everyone is waiting for you, you're being a nuisance.

5827
04:07:20,070 --> 04:07:21,880
Ok I get it..

5828
04:07:23,770 --> 04:07:24,900
Ok I will do it, I will do it.

5829
04:07:25,040 --> 04:07:26,920
Wait, just this, this this...

5830
04:07:27,110 --> 04:07:28,670
Please just stop this, ow!

5831
04:07:28,970 --> 04:07:30,420
Your thumb is hurting me

5832
04:07:34,810 --> 04:07:39,620
OW OW OW OW OW OW

5833
04:07:43,260 --> 04:07:44,420
That would hurt..

5834
04:07:44,960 --> 04:07:45,700
Seriously, that's enough.

5835
04:07:46,760 --> 04:07:50,710
I'm still shocked he lied so much about his hip joint.

5836
04:07:52,730 --> 04:07:55,080
I'm liking the scared face on you right now.

5837
04:07:55,330 --> 04:07:57,170
No, seriously, please, just this.

5838
04:07:57,070 --> 04:07:58,300
You'll run away otherwise.

5839
04:07:58,310 --> 04:08:01,370
I won't run away, so please, just this.

5840
04:08:02,940 --> 04:08:05,320
OW OW OW OW OW, THIS REALLY HURTS.

5841
04:08:05,340 --> 04:08:08,520
I can't take this, please please please wait a second.

5842
04:08:20,660 --> 04:08:22,970
What was that about...

5843
04:08:23,830 --> 04:08:27,500
Ok I'm going now, seriously, I will do it.

5844
04:08:24,400 --> 04:08:26,700
Here I go, ok, you ready?

5845
04:08:27,890 --> 04:08:28,710
OK!

5846
04:08:28,770 --> 04:08:29,470
Ready?!

5847
04:08:29,070 --> 04:08:29,470
Yes.

5848
04:08:29,670 --> 04:08:30,260
Sure?!

5849
04:08:30,040 --> 04:08:30,500
Yes

5850
04:08:33,260 --> 04:08:34,010
Here I come.

5851
04:08:34,040 --> 04:08:34,740
Yes!

5852
04:08:42,100 --> 04:08:49,030
Punishment Slap

5853
04:08:42,100 --> 04:08:49,030
Success!!

5854
04:08:53,590 --> 04:08:55,370
Goddamn!!

5855
04:08:58,300 --> 04:09:00,440
Oi!! Take this home with you!!

5856
04:09:00,930 --> 04:09:02,370
It's a souvenir!

5857
04:09:08,670 --> 04:09:10,420
Let'sh go.

5858
04:09:29,960 --> 04:09:33,240
Let's go and regain our focus.

5859
04:09:35,260 --> 04:09:37,900
16 hours from the start.

5860
04:09:38,100 --> 04:09:42,780
The long school trip is finally...

5861
04:09:43,180 --> 04:09:44,140
Wow

5862
04:09:44,260 --> 04:09:45,390
Everyone.

5863
04:09:45,410 --> 04:09:50,660
Our trip is now finished. We're saying goodbye to the people of the Edo times.

5864
04:09:48,110 --> 04:09:48,910
Time to head back huh?

5865
04:09:50,680 --> 04:09:53,060
Ok everyone, let's change to our normal clothes.

5866
04:09:53,090 --> 04:09:57,570
We can come back from present time to the Edo times that easily, huh?

5867
04:09:58,560 --> 04:10:00,400
He just ignored me

5868
04:10:00,430 --> 04:10:02,930
This is yours I think...

5869
04:10:03,860 --> 04:10:11,050
Changing back to their normal clothes

5870
04:10:03,860 --> 04:10:11,050
The trip is finished

5871
04:10:04,130 --> 04:10:07,000
Now the school tour is over.

5872
04:10:07,430 --> 04:10:12,290
They get dressed back into their teachers outfits, and say their byes to the Edo town.

5873
04:10:11,710 --> 04:10:17,650
Get on the bus

5874
04:10:11,710 --> 04:10:17,650
and time slip back to the future

5875
04:10:12,300 --> 04:10:16,640
It's only been a little while since we got off the bus...

5876
04:10:12,870 --> 04:10:17,450
They get on the bus, and time slip to the present.

5877
04:10:17,210 --> 04:10:18,080
Again the bus.

5878
04:10:18,140 --> 04:10:20,760
Again the bus, it doesn't stop.

5879
04:10:21,550 --> 04:10:23,790
There's no end to the enthusiastic teacher life.

5880
04:10:21,570 --> 04:10:28,250
Even if they get back to the school

5881
04:10:21,570 --> 04:10:28,250
their ordeal continues

5882
04:10:21,570 --> 04:10:28,250
There's no end to the enthusiastic teacher life

5883
04:10:23,800 --> 04:10:28,250
The ordeal for the 5 of them will continue even once when they get back to the school.

5884
04:10:29,350 --> 04:10:30,720
1:00 in the morning.

5885
04:10:31,220 --> 04:10:34,400
The staff members are having a meeting.

5886
04:10:34,430 --> 04:10:36,360
We're going in guys.

5887
04:10:34,430 --> 04:10:37,670
Conference room

5888
04:10:37,700 --> 04:10:41,270
Just sit where your names are located.

5889
04:10:52,560 --> 04:10:56,080
Right, we are starting the PTA meeting now.

5890
04:10:55,990 --> 04:10:57,920
Ok, let's go guys.

5891
04:10:58,090 --> 04:11:02,920
Well, this school accepts drama students, so...

5892
04:11:02,950 --> 04:11:07,200
If there are comedians who are a bad influence on our students...

5893
04:11:03,360 --> 04:11:09,640
Comedians who are a bad influence

5894
04:11:03,360 --> 04:11:09,640
to the students, are put on a black list

5895
04:11:03,360 --> 04:11:09,640
PTA information meeting

5896
04:11:07,490 --> 04:11:09,640
I would like you to report them in this meeting.

5897
04:11:09,730 --> 04:11:11,960
Yes, can I go?

5898
04:11:11,500 --> 04:11:11,960
Yes.

5899
04:11:12,930 --> 04:11:15,200
Yamazaki Housei

5900
04:11:14,090 --> 04:11:46,990
He doesn't get how TV works...

5901
04:11:14,090 --> 04:11:46,990
Yamazaki Housei's secret information

5902
04:11:16,940 --> 04:11:19,400
There was a special Sanma-san progam.

5903
04:11:19,140 --> 04:11:19,460
Yes.

5904
04:11:19,690 --> 04:11:21,420
And in that program,

5905
04:11:21,540 --> 04:11:24,190
there were two groups of famous people.

5906
04:11:24,210 --> 04:11:27,190
One would tell the truth, one would lie.

5907
04:11:27,210 --> 04:11:30,550
You have to tell which one is lying. You guys took part in it too, right?

5908
04:11:30,420 --> 04:11:31,460
Yep, we did.

5909
04:11:31,620 --> 04:11:35,920
So as the program continued, there was a 'reaction battle' game

5910
04:11:35,450 --> 04:11:36,170
Yes

5911
04:11:36,350 --> 04:11:39,890
They said 'Ryuhei's team and Yamazaki's team'...

5912
04:11:40,190 --> 04:11:43,400
'Please come out to the front'

5913
04:11:43,430 --> 04:11:44,970
Yamazaki then said with a really loud voice

5914
04:11:45,000 --> 04:11:47,580
I'm so going to trick you lot!!

5915
04:11:55,970 --> 04:11:56,610
You're right.

5916
04:11:57,110 --> 04:11:57,840
That was just.

5917
04:11:57,940 --> 04:11:58,840
Yep, I remember that well.

5918
04:11:58,380 --> 04:11:59,920
Me too.

5919
04:12:05,420 --> 04:12:10,660
So there were 2 teams, and on the outside 2 rooms.

5920
04:12:05,420 --> 04:12:30,190
He doesn't get how TV works...

5921
04:12:05,420 --> 04:12:30,190
Yamazaki Housei's secret information

5922
04:12:10,700 --> 04:12:13,470
In one room, there would be a really bad smell

5923
04:12:13,490 --> 04:12:16,170
In the other one, there would be a scent of flowers

5924
04:12:16,590 --> 04:12:17,660
So they get in, right?

5925
04:12:17,730 --> 04:12:17,970
Yes.

5926
04:12:18,130 --> 04:12:20,380
So they get in, and Yamazaki Housei alone started shouting

5927
04:12:20,530 --> 04:12:23,460
It stinks, it stinks!!

5928
04:12:23,390 --> 04:12:23,970
Yes.

5929
04:12:23,860 --> 04:12:25,640
Then Joshihara said.

5930
04:12:25,770 --> 04:12:30,590
Now the balloon in the room will inflate

5931
04:12:28,240 --> 04:12:30,590
and when it breaks, a smelly gas will come out.

5932
04:12:36,480 --> 04:12:38,180
That is shocking...

5933
04:12:38,550 --> 04:12:40,360
Even though I've been in showbiz for 25 years...

5934
04:12:45,260 --> 04:12:49,140
It really screwed up the game in the latter half.

5935
04:12:51,230 --> 04:12:54,070
This is quite a small thing...

5936
04:12:54,270 --> 04:12:58,190
Iwahashi of Plus-Minus told me this.

5937
04:12:55,930 --> 04:13:01,550
Secret info received from

5938
04:12:55,930 --> 04:13:01,550
(Plus Minus)

5939
04:12:55,930 --> 04:13:01,550
Iwahashi Yoshimasa

5940
04:12:56,490 --> 04:13:05,990
'Airhead' story... (1)

5941
04:12:56,490 --> 04:13:05,990
Hamada Masatoshi's secret information

5942
04:12:58,200 --> 04:13:01,250
While in the karaoke, Hamada said...

5943
04:13:01,260 --> 04:13:04,820
'Iwahashi, change this straw, it's clogged!!'

5944
04:13:04,840 --> 04:13:06,520
while he was sucking a muddler.

5945
04:13:04,840 --> 04:13:11,190
(A muddler is a pestle for cocktails.)

5946
04:13:14,310 --> 04:13:16,750
He was sucking a muddler?

5947
04:13:21,260 --> 04:13:24,710
That's just a plastic stick basically...

5948
04:13:24,630 --> 04:13:25,430
Ok I have one

5949
04:13:26,430 --> 04:13:30,840
I heard this from Higashino Kouji

5950
04:13:26,430 --> 04:13:31,190
'Airhead' story... (2)

5951
04:13:26,430 --> 04:13:31,190
Hamada Masatoshi's secret information

5952
04:13:33,390 --> 04:13:37,410
I heard this from Higashino Kouji

5953
04:13:33,390 --> 04:14:10,890
'Airhead' story... (2)

5954
04:13:33,390 --> 04:14:10,890
Hamada Masatoshi's secret information

5955
04:13:37,440 --> 04:13:42,860
Higashino Kouji

5956
04:13:37,440 --> 04:13:42,860
Secret info from

5957
04:13:37,440 --> 04:13:44,420
Right now, Hamada and Higashino are doing a program in Osaka called Gobu Gobu.

5958
04:13:41,280 --> 04:13:43,480
A regular show, right? Yes, yes.

5959
04:13:44,620 --> 04:13:46,230
They were recording in town, but...

5960
04:13:46,250 --> 04:13:49,590
Hamada was being immature saying

5961
04:13:47,690 --> 04:13:49,590
"I don't want to walk around too much"

5962
04:13:49,720 --> 04:13:51,520
So the staff thought of an idea

5963
04:13:51,560 --> 04:13:55,300
Until the opening, they would carry him by a wagon

5964
04:13:55,330 --> 04:13:58,940
Then open the door, he would jump out and they would start recording

5965
04:13:58,960 --> 04:14:01,740
So when the recording finished, Hamada would just get onto the wagon

5966
04:14:01,770 --> 04:14:04,580
So they can go to the next point, then Hamada can just get off

5967
04:14:04,600 --> 04:14:06,980
So the staff made this system for him

5968
04:14:07,210 --> 04:14:11,220
Every single time he got on and off the wagon

5969
04:14:09,990 --> 04:14:11,220
he hit his head.

5970
04:14:21,250 --> 04:14:22,800
I see.

5971
04:14:22,820 --> 04:14:26,300
I guess he just doesn't have any sense of distance anymore.

5972
04:14:26,490 --> 04:14:27,570
Anymore information on anyone?

5973
04:14:27,590 --> 04:14:29,690
Ok, then I have one...

5974
04:14:29,300 --> 04:14:30,090
Ok sure

5975
04:14:31,370 --> 04:14:33,470
It's about Mimata Matazou.

5976
04:14:33,790 --> 04:15:00,790
Rip-off Bar... (1)

5977
04:14:33,790 --> 04:15:00,790
Mimata Matazou's secret information

5978
04:14:35,570 --> 04:14:38,610
You know he has the worst personality, right?

5979
04:14:37,830 --> 04:14:38,610
Yes I have heard..

5980
04:14:38,840 --> 04:14:43,490
Until last year, he owned a rip-off bar in Roppongi...

5981
04:14:42,690 --> 04:14:46,040
Only to get in you had to pay 1,700 Yen, it was unbelievable

5982
04:14:46,410 --> 04:14:49,110
But that shop was closed down anyway.

5983
04:14:49,350 --> 04:14:53,560
Lately, he opened another bar up.

5984
04:14:53,800 --> 04:14:56,530
And he said to me 'I've opened a new bar and'

5985
04:14:56,550 --> 04:14:59,070
I won't rip you off again so please come over sometime.

5986
04:14:59,090 --> 04:15:01,090
So he basically recognized that he ripped me off before.

5987
04:15:10,760 --> 04:15:12,540
Man my jaw hurts

5988
04:15:15,260 --> 04:15:18,990
I guess it's just the kind of guy he is, he just wants to rip people off

5989
04:15:19,000 --> 04:15:20,340
Anyway, I went there

5990
04:15:19,690 --> 04:16:34,990
Rip-off Bar... (1)

5991
04:15:19,690 --> 04:16:34,990
Mimata Matazou's secret information

5992
04:15:20,440 --> 04:15:24,360
And it's a really lovely shop and...

5993
04:15:24,380 --> 04:15:27,220
The atmosphere is really nice and the alcohol tastes really good

5994
04:15:27,520 --> 04:15:30,490
And I went once and there is basically this system

5995
04:15:30,520 --> 04:15:33,990
To get in the bar and have a sit, there's a fee you have to pay...

5996
04:15:34,090 --> 04:15:37,510
You have to pay 2000 Yen just for that alone.

5997
04:15:38,230 --> 04:15:40,720
But from the prestige of the bar, that's acceptable

5998
04:15:40,730 --> 04:15:42,470
Well I guess, it's a high class bar, right?

5999
04:15:42,480 --> 04:15:43,580
But there are private rooms

6000
04:15:43,600 --> 04:15:46,440
and these private rooms have karaoke

6001
04:15:46,970 --> 04:15:52,790
The charge for one hour is 5000 Yen per person.

6002
04:15:53,080 --> 04:15:58,850
It's a seriously hefty price and so me and loads of other comedians keep getting calls from him...

6003
04:15:59,080 --> 04:16:04,530
and he says 'If you know anyone who is like a manager,

6004
04:16:00,990 --> 04:16:04,530
can you bring them to my place?'

6005
04:16:04,560 --> 04:16:08,300
And he called my junior called Harro Ueda and...

6006
04:16:08,560 --> 04:16:11,040
said it so many times to him,

6007
04:16:09,690 --> 04:16:11,040
that he eventually took his boss to the bar.

6008
04:16:11,540 --> 04:16:14,580
Then Mimata said 'Director, shall we go to the private rooms?'

6009
04:16:14,600 --> 04:16:17,270
He was really pushing him to go to the private rooms

6010
04:16:17,300 --> 04:16:21,440
Even when the manager was saying 'It's fine, I like it here, I don't even like Karaoke.'

6011
04:16:21,610 --> 04:16:27,140
He kept giving him drinks and he got so drunk he started to fall asleep.

6012
04:16:27,480 --> 04:16:30,460
Then Mimata said 'Manager, let's sleep in the private rooms'

6013
04:16:30,480 --> 04:16:35,390
So he took the sleeping manager into the private room

6014
04:16:33,490 --> 04:16:35,390
and then charged him for the hours he slept in there.

6015
04:16:37,010 --> 04:16:38,650
You're the worst!!

6016
04:16:43,560 --> 04:16:45,510
Why do I get hit for something that's got nothing to do with me!

6017
04:16:46,660 --> 04:16:49,810
That is horrible. I went to that shop lately as well

6018
04:16:47,990 --> 04:16:56,790
Rip-off Bar... (2)

6019
04:16:47,990 --> 04:16:56,790
Mimata Matazou's secret information

6020
04:16:49,080 --> 04:16:49,810
Yes

6021
04:16:49,830 --> 04:16:51,340
I can actually drink quite a lot but

6022
04:16:51,570 --> 04:16:54,650
after drinking 3 bottles of beer, Mimata said to me

6023
04:16:54,670 --> 04:16:56,950
Miyasako, aren't you sleepy?

6024
04:16:59,410 --> 04:17:00,950
Unbelievable

6025
04:17:02,880 --> 04:17:05,990
He's so dirty!

6026
04:17:06,020 --> 04:17:07,220
You can't do that man...

6027
04:17:07,320 --> 04:17:10,090
I didn't know there were other stories like that...

6028
04:17:16,330 --> 04:17:19,010
No seriously, I'm getting hit way too much.

6029
04:17:18,100 --> 04:17:19,460
He's such a liar...

6030
04:17:19,030 --> 04:17:20,810
Seriously, sort it out..

6031
04:17:22,230 --> 04:17:24,180
It's about Mimata again...

6032
04:17:24,490 --> 04:18:17,390
In a club one night...

6033
04:17:24,490 --> 04:18:17,390
Mimata Matazou's secret information

6034
04:17:25,440 --> 04:17:28,780
I got this from Author Sada-san.

6035
04:17:29,070 --> 04:17:33,240
Sada-san and Mimata-san went to a sushi bar together,

6036
04:17:33,280 --> 04:17:36,120
and Sada-san said 'Oh man, I haven't had a girlfriend in years'

6037
04:17:36,150 --> 04:17:38,460
And he was looking for a shoulder to lean on

6038
04:17:38,480 --> 04:17:41,760
And Mimata, who was drinking loads and loads at the time

6039
04:17:41,790 --> 04:17:43,520
kind of started to act arrogant and said:

6040
04:17:43,890 --> 04:17:48,690
'Oi Sada, I'll take you somewhere real good then'

6041
04:17:48,770 --> 04:17:53,030
So he took him to this 'gentlemen's club'

6042
04:17:53,160 --> 04:17:57,440
Well Sada-san didn't want his or Mimata's face to be recognised

6043
04:17:57,470 --> 04:18:04,350
so he got a mask and a hat for Mimata to camouflage him.

6044
04:18:04,380 --> 04:18:09,790
But when they were in the club choosing which girl they wanted,

6045
04:18:09,810 --> 04:18:14,660
when the owner of the shop saw Mimata disguised,

6046
04:18:15,090 --> 04:18:17,990
said 'Mimata-san, you are still

6047
04:18:16,090 --> 04:18:17,990
banned here so please leave'...

6048
04:18:23,890 --> 04:18:25,230
Banned?!

6049
04:18:26,510 --> 04:18:28,110
What could he have possibly done which was that bad?!

6050
04:18:27,930 --> 04:18:28,800
What did he do!?

6051
04:18:28,470 --> 04:18:29,730
Yes, why?

6052
04:18:29,360 --> 04:18:32,480
What could it have been?

6053
04:18:30,200 --> 04:18:32,480
For a comedian to be banned...

6054
04:18:33,600 --> 04:18:36,750
I guess he tried to force something on them..

6055
04:18:36,760 --> 04:18:37,810
Any others then?

6056
04:18:37,940 --> 04:18:38,840
Ok you.

6057
04:18:39,340 --> 04:18:42,020
It's about Matsumoto-san

6058
04:18:42,050 --> 04:18:45,960
When he wears an Adidas watch,

6059
04:18:42,490 --> 04:19:09,790
The watch talk...

6060
04:18:42,490 --> 04:19:09,790
Matsumoto Hitoshi's secret information

6061
04:18:45,980 --> 04:18:48,630
He says 'This is really good' even though he hardly ever wears it

6062
04:18:48,650 --> 04:18:53,960
And he started getting more interested in watches or something...

6063
04:18:54,330 --> 04:19:00,040
and eventually he bought a really expensive and prestigious watch.

6064
04:19:00,260 --> 04:19:05,000
And even though he always wears this watch when he's with his juniors...

6065
04:19:05,270 --> 04:19:07,980
When he's with the 'watch obsessed' Miyasako

6066
04:19:08,010 --> 04:19:10,490
I guess he feels inferior, cause he definitely won't wear that watch.

6067
04:19:12,360 --> 04:19:13,760
He definitely won't wear it.

6068
04:19:13,770 --> 04:19:15,050
I've never seen it!

6069
04:19:15,710 --> 04:19:17,290
You haven't seen it!

6070
04:19:18,260 --> 04:19:19,630
I do want to see it...

6071
04:19:19,880 --> 04:19:21,440
I wonder why..

6072
04:19:20,920 --> 04:19:21,850
So strange..

6073
04:19:21,410 --> 04:19:23,930
Hopefully he will soon..

6074
04:19:24,390 --> 04:19:26,210
This is also about Matsumoto-san.

6075
04:19:26,220 --> 04:19:29,540
He was in Okinawa and

6076
04:19:26,220 --> 04:20:06,090
Dinner party with the family...

6077
04:19:26,220 --> 04:20:06,090
Matsumoto Hitoshi's secret information

6078
04:19:30,190 --> 04:19:33,960
Matsumoto-san, his wife and child

6079
04:19:34,700 --> 04:19:39,480
and my family were eating Yakiniku.

6080
04:19:39,500 --> 04:19:43,180
Matsumoto's wife's iPhone case is...

6081
04:19:43,210 --> 04:19:45,590
that one with the rabbit ears,

6082
04:19:45,840 --> 04:19:47,790
and he said 'Check this out!'

6083
04:19:47,810 --> 04:19:50,860
'It basically means that everyone can hear your conversation.'

6084
04:19:51,110 --> 04:19:53,230
Everyone was laughing at his little joke

6085
04:19:53,660 --> 04:19:55,150
And then his wife said...

6086
04:19:55,320 --> 04:19:58,990
'Ah... You make that joke all the time...'

6087
04:20:02,730 --> 04:20:04,190
'I don't say it often.'

6088
04:20:12,440 --> 04:20:13,900
I see.

6089
04:20:14,340 --> 04:20:16,050
He said 'I don't say it often.'

6090
04:20:15,890 --> 04:20:27,890
Dinner party with the family...

6091
04:20:15,890 --> 04:20:27,890
Matsumoto Hitoshi's secret information

6092
04:20:16,070 --> 04:20:20,880
The wife said 'The last time we went out, and the time before...'

6093
04:20:18,780 --> 04:20:20,880
Matsumoto 'No no, I've said it maximum, twice...'

6094
04:20:21,080 --> 04:20:24,060
(Wife) 'I think there's been more than twice...'

6095
04:20:23,090 --> 04:20:24,060
(Matsumoto) 'No way, no way, no way.'

6096
04:20:24,080 --> 04:20:28,260
7 minutes. They were debating about it for a total of 7 minutes.

6097
04:20:33,290 --> 04:20:36,240
Wow, that's a seriously long debate.

6098
04:20:38,330 --> 04:20:39,310
I see...

6099
04:20:39,600 --> 04:20:41,270
Anybody else...

6100
04:20:40,480 --> 04:20:40,900
Go ahead.

6101
04:20:40,930 --> 04:20:43,810
Then I have something...

6102
04:20:42,230 --> 04:20:42,800
Go ahead.

6103
04:20:44,670 --> 04:20:50,450
There's somebody who usually has no stories,

6104
04:20:47,990 --> 04:20:50,450
somebody who is called the king of peculiar personalities...

6105
04:20:50,670 --> 04:20:52,920
called Tanaka Naoki-san.

6106
04:20:53,050 --> 04:20:55,610
We rarely hear any stories about him!

6107
04:20:53,190 --> 04:21:27,690
Talk about his high spirits...

6108
04:20:53,190 --> 04:21:27,690
Tanaka Naoki's secret information

6109
04:20:54,410 --> 04:20:55,680
That's right, ehm...

6110
04:20:55,980 --> 04:20:59,190
The thing is that we couldn't get any information from his long time friends, so...

6111
04:20:59,220 --> 04:21:02,650
so we asked his wife about it.

6112
04:21:01,890 --> 04:21:07,170
(Tanaka Naoki's wife)

6113
04:21:01,890 --> 04:21:07,170
Kohinata Shie

6114
04:21:01,890 --> 04:21:07,170
Secret info from

6115
04:21:04,420 --> 04:21:07,700
Even when he's in his house his spirits aren't particularly high...

6116
04:21:07,720 --> 04:21:09,800
that's how Mr. Tanaka Naoki is, right?

6117
04:21:09,830 --> 04:21:14,840
One specific day, his spirits were so high...

6118
04:21:14,870 --> 04:21:16,680
when he came back home...

6119
04:21:16,900 --> 04:21:19,680
that when all the family was eating together...

6120
04:21:20,300 --> 04:21:24,720
he said "Look at this photo!!!" and the photo he showed...

6121
04:21:24,740 --> 04:21:27,790
was an expanded photo of a tick.

6122
04:21:27,380 --> 04:21:27,790
Eh?

6123
04:21:29,780 --> 04:21:32,120
A photo of a tick?

6124
04:21:32,700 --> 04:21:33,530
Amazing...

6125
04:21:33,750 --> 04:21:36,120
It was very rare...

6126
04:21:37,220 --> 04:21:38,300
And he showed that to his wife.

6127
04:21:38,390 --> 04:22:02,890
In a TV show, his wife...

6128
04:21:38,390 --> 04:22:02,890
Tanaka Naoki's secret information

6129
04:21:38,960 --> 04:21:42,730
Some time ago, in a special television show, the duo Ameagari Keshitai...

6130
04:21:43,030 --> 04:21:45,840
gathered a lot of wives from famous people,

6131
04:21:45,860 --> 04:21:50,640
to talk about funny stories about their husbands.

6132
04:21:50,670 --> 04:21:52,910
That time we asked Tanaka Naoki's wife too.

6133
04:21:53,240 --> 04:21:55,890
She's not a person who usually appears on TV, so...

6134
04:21:55,970 --> 04:21:59,720
she tried really hard and told like 7~8 episodes about his husband.

6135
04:21:59,740 --> 04:22:01,590
She talked a lot.

6136
04:22:01,680 --> 04:22:03,910
None of them were funny.

6137
04:22:12,560 --> 04:22:14,300
Nobody laughed.

6138
04:22:17,030 --> 04:22:17,970
The quantity was right though...

6139
04:22:17,590 --> 04:22:19,160
There was quantity...

6140
04:22:18,600 --> 04:22:19,700
She tried hard.

6141
04:22:19,430 --> 04:22:19,700
Yes.

6142
04:22:19,730 --> 04:22:21,200
It's not his wife's fault.

6143
04:22:20,300 --> 04:22:23,310
It's not his wife's fault. It's just that his stories aren't funny.

6144
04:22:24,070 --> 04:22:25,300
Can I have a go?

6145
04:22:25,440 --> 04:22:30,710
Well, this is about Tanaka-san's partner, Endo Shouzou...

6146
04:22:28,390 --> 04:22:40,990
A phone call late at night...

6147
04:22:28,390 --> 04:22:40,990
Endo Shouzou's secret information

6148
04:22:30,810 --> 04:22:33,120
This is a very recent story.

6149
04:22:33,180 --> 04:22:35,880
I received a call from Endo-san very late at night.

6150
04:22:36,310 --> 04:22:38,960
I really want a ****** from Shinjuku.

6151
04:22:38,980 --> 04:22:42,730
can you come with me to buy it?

6152
04:22:48,630 --> 04:22:50,330
A man in his 40...

6153
04:22:50,630 --> 04:22:52,360
Disgusting!

6154
04:22:55,430 --> 04:22:57,030
There's even more...

6155
04:22:55,490 --> 04:23:01,990
A phone call late at night...

6156
04:22:55,490 --> 04:23:01,990
Endo Shouzou's secret information

6157
04:22:56,330 --> 04:22:57,340
Oh, there's more!

6158
04:22:59,040 --> 04:23:02,420
It was a second-hand one.

6159
04:23:02,010 --> 04:23:04,000
Eh??

6160
04:23:05,230 --> 04:23:07,730
I eventually stopped doing that. I stopped.

6161
04:23:09,400 --> 04:23:09,860
Ow!

6162
04:23:10,020 --> 04:23:11,840
So you don't do that anymore?

6163
04:23:11,560 --> 04:23:12,460
I stopped it in the end.

6164
04:23:12,780 --> 04:23:14,320
Is there anything else?

6165
04:23:14,840 --> 04:23:16,280
Well then, shall I?

6166
04:23:16,190 --> 04:23:18,080
Er..

6167
04:23:18,760 --> 04:23:22,070
The Katsura Group... as it were has many rules.

6168
04:23:20,460 --> 04:23:35,010
Although he's an apprentice... (1)

6169
04:23:20,460 --> 04:23:35,010
Katsura Sando's secret information

6170
04:23:22,070 --> 04:23:26,240
The Katsura Group... as it were has many rules.

6171
04:23:26,540 --> 04:23:28,440
Though smoking is not permitted

6172
04:23:28,440 --> 04:23:29,310
Katsura Sando is a chain smoker.

6173
04:23:29,310 --> 04:23:31,340
Katsura Sando is a chain smoker.

6174
04:23:30,700 --> 04:23:32,690
You can't do that!

6175
04:23:33,440 --> 04:23:35,700
That's a total act of betrayal.

6176
04:23:35,760 --> 04:23:36,900
I've got one too.

6177
04:23:36,520 --> 04:23:37,120
Ah, please, if you would.

6178
04:23:37,190 --> 04:23:39,060
I heard this from Sando...

6179
04:23:39,350 --> 04:23:46,060
Although he's an apprentice... (2)

6180
04:23:39,350 --> 04:23:46,060
Katsura Sando's secret information

6181
04:23:39,580 --> 04:23:41,250
As a promise to his master

6182
04:23:41,250 --> 04:23:44,090
Katsura would not drink alcohol for 3 years.

6183
04:23:44,090 --> 04:23:46,360
I've heard he's been drinking every day.

6184
04:23:50,690 --> 04:23:52,740
This is getting serious now.

6185
04:23:53,320 --> 04:23:54,300
Wha~?

6186
04:23:53,690 --> 04:23:56,690
No question, some people just love a drink!

6187
04:23:55,560 --> 04:23:56,700
You're kidding me!

6188
04:23:58,740 --> 04:24:00,060
If there's anything else...

6189
04:24:00,760 --> 04:24:02,480
May I speak for a moment? Is it alright?

6190
04:24:02,480 --> 04:24:02,880
Yes.

6191
04:24:03,500 --> 04:24:05,600
This is about Matsumoto Hitoshi.

6192
04:24:06,410 --> 04:24:10,880
This story is

6193
04:24:06,440 --> 04:25:02,800
In the middle of town...

6194
04:24:06,440 --> 04:25:02,800
Matsumoto Hitoshi's secret information

6195
04:24:08,550 --> 04:24:10,880
about a walk

6196
04:24:09,150 --> 04:24:10,880
Matsumoto Hitoshi went on one day

6197
04:24:10,960 --> 04:24:13,120
About 4 or 5 office ladies. Young ones.

6198
04:24:13,550 --> 04:24:17,650
"Ah! It's Ma-chan!"

6199
04:24:15,350 --> 04:24:17,650
they said, approaching him.

6200
04:24:16,760 --> 04:24:19,340
Well, I think this is a good a time as any...

6201
04:24:19,360 --> 04:24:21,000
One of the women says,

6202
04:24:21,460 --> 04:24:24,130
"Mastumoto-san,

6203
04:24:22,390 --> 04:24:24,130
you've got an amazing body!"

6204
04:24:24,120 --> 04:24:28,080
Wearing a summer t-shirt, well, he had everyone's attention.

6205
04:24:28,160 --> 04:24:31,120
A terrific, finely tuned body.

6206
04:24:31,200 --> 04:24:35,310
The same woman

6207
04:24:33,170 --> 04:24:35,310
reaches out to touch him.

6208
04:24:35,320 --> 04:24:37,600
Two other women join in and start touching him.

6209
04:24:37,640 --> 04:24:39,670
I'm thinking "This is bad..."

6210
04:24:39,670 --> 04:24:42,670
"Ah-! Wait.. If I were to do such a thing with women like these... "

6211
04:24:42,780 --> 04:24:46,000
From Matsumoto's point of view,  he was coerced.

6212
04:24:46,050 --> 04:24:49,090
With a hesitant attitude,

6213
04:24:49,090 --> 04:24:53,960
He lets them

6214
04:24:50,390 --> 04:24:53,960
grope him all over.

6215
04:24:54,120 --> 04:24:58,560
Finally, his pecs

6216
04:24:55,790 --> 04:24:58,560
begin to twitch.

6217
04:24:58,560 --> 04:25:03,070
He starts feeling pretty good...

6218
04:25:00,700 --> 04:25:03,070
and that's it...

6219
04:25:03,070 --> 04:25:06,860
Geez.. amazing.. I..

6220
04:25:07,000 --> 04:25:08,000
That's uhm..

6221
04:25:08,180 --> 04:25:08,600
Yes.

6222
04:25:09,740 --> 04:25:12,140
You're

6223
04:25:10,410 --> 04:25:12,140
not very good at telling stories, are you?

6224
04:25:19,660 --> 04:25:20,620
Gaaah.

6225
04:25:21,190 --> 04:25:23,190
Mimata-san!

6226
04:25:25,220 --> 04:25:26,000
Ow!

6227
04:25:26,360 --> 04:25:26,920
Ouch!

6228
04:25:28,630 --> 04:25:29,990
For this to be the last story is a bit of a disappointment, isn't it?

6229
04:25:29,990 --> 04:25:31,830
For this to be the last story is a bit of a disappointment, isn't it?

6230
04:25:31,830 --> 04:25:34,030
The story we had originally planned...

6231
04:25:34,030 --> 04:25:36,900
This guy decided to go off on his own, leading us to this result.

6232
04:25:36,900 --> 04:25:38,470
This guy decided to go off on his own, leading us to this result.

6233
04:25:38,470 --> 04:25:40,970
There's nothing we can do to get out of it now.

6234
04:25:42,970 --> 04:25:46,980
Teaching Duty: 18 hours elapsed

6235
04:25:44,560 --> 04:25:46,700
They come here to face that man.

6236
04:25:51,110 --> 04:25:53,820
Asamade Current Events Discussion!

6237
04:25:51,110 --> 04:25:53,820
~Has the sun not yet risen in Japan?~

6238
04:25:54,380 --> 04:25:57,500
Good evening. I'm Tahara Soichiro, the journalist.

6239
04:25:55,490 --> 04:26:04,930
Journalist

6240
04:25:55,490 --> 04:26:04,930
Tahara Soichiro

6241
04:25:58,120 --> 04:26:01,700
This is Asamade Current Event Discussion 2012.

6242
04:26:01,700 --> 04:26:04,700
This year, too, we've been witness to many events.

6243
04:26:04,700 --> 04:26:08,690
The American presidential election.
The succession and replacement of high-ranking Chinese officials.

6244
04:26:08,690 --> 04:26:11,820
To look back on such issues,

6245
04:26:11,800 --> 04:26:14,370
I'd like to speak with an international journalist.

6246
04:26:14,370 --> 04:26:15,300
I'd like to speak with an international journalist.

6247
04:26:15,300 --> 04:26:16,340
I'd like to speak with an international journalist.

6248
04:26:16,730 --> 04:26:17,820
Please, come in.

6249
04:26:25,600 --> 04:26:26,660
Good evening.

6250
04:26:25,720 --> 04:26:26,690
Good evening. Welcome.

6251
04:26:26,690 --> 04:26:28,700
It's a pleasure to meet you.

6252
04:26:26,690 --> 04:26:28,700
It's a pleasure to meet you.

6253
04:26:28,700 --> 04:26:29,540
Have a seat over here.

6254
04:26:29,600 --> 04:26:30,920
Thank you very much.

6255
04:26:34,760 --> 04:26:36,200
Thank you for coming to the show.

6256
04:26:34,790 --> 04:26:38,060
International Journalist

6257
04:26:34,790 --> 04:26:38,060
Mr. Oonishi Hideaki

6258
04:26:35,220 --> 04:26:36,200
Thank you for having me.

6259
04:26:36,200 --> 04:26:37,640
Firstly,

6260
04:26:38,060 --> 04:26:39,500
It's being said Noda-san has put his political career on the line.

6261
04:26:39,500 --> 04:26:42,330
It's being said Noda-san has put his political career on the line.

6262
04:26:42,570 --> 04:26:44,130
He says there will be an increase in taxes.

6263
04:26:44,130 --> 04:26:46,900
He says there will be an increase in taxes.

6264
04:26:45,200 --> 04:26:46,700
Yes.

6265
04:26:46,940 --> 04:26:48,280
On that topic, what percentage is the tax currently?

6266
04:26:48,280 --> 04:26:48,740
Yes.

6267
04:26:48,290 --> 04:26:50,610
On that topic, what percentage is the tax currently?

6268
04:26:50,680 --> 04:26:52,180
Yes.

6269
04:26:59,210 --> 04:27:01,710
He doesn't hold back at all, does he?

6270
04:27:02,780 --> 04:27:06,200
Without hesitation, he says 20%.

6271
04:27:03,580 --> 04:27:06,200
”Yes. 20%", he says.

6272
04:27:05,120 --> 04:27:07,820
You don't have

6273
04:27:05,860 --> 04:27:07,820
even a bit of restraint, do you?

6274
04:27:06,200 --> 04:27:08,700
We're getting it non-stop.

6275
04:27:08,140 --> 04:27:08,780
Ow!

6276
04:27:08,800 --> 04:27:09,360
Ouch!

6277
04:27:13,830 --> 04:27:16,170
They really put their all into it.

6278
04:27:16,430 --> 04:27:18,070
The truth is many countries in Europe have a tax rate of about 20%.

6279
04:27:18,070 --> 04:27:19,570
The truth is many countries in Europe have a tax rate of about 20%.

6280
04:27:19,570 --> 04:27:22,040
The truth is many countries in Europe have a tax rate of about 20%.

6281
04:27:22,040 --> 04:27:24,070
The truth is many countries in Europe have a tax rate of about 20%.

6282
04:27:22,770 --> 04:27:24,770
Hm...

6283
04:27:24,070 --> 04:27:25,810
In Japan, it's less expensive. I wonder how much less.

6284
04:27:25,810 --> 04:27:27,410
In Japan, it's less expensive. I wonder how much less.

6285
04:27:27,410 --> 04:27:28,580
In Japan, it's less expensive. I wonder how much less.

6286
04:27:39,200 --> 04:27:41,700
There's no way he meant that low when he said "less expensive".

6287
04:27:41,760 --> 04:27:44,090
That's over the top, right?

6288
04:27:45,800 --> 04:27:48,130
Alright.

6289
04:27:46,220 --> 04:27:47,980
Uh! Ow, ow, ow.

6290
04:27:52,800 --> 04:27:53,680
0.5?

6291
04:27:58,170 --> 04:28:00,710
Higher than that.

6292
04:27:59,900 --> 04:28:01,190
Okay.

6293
04:28:18,200 --> 04:28:21,690
Hamada-san is stone-faced.

6294
04:28:21,030 --> 04:28:23,700
You're amazing, Hamada-san.

6295
04:28:22,300 --> 04:28:23,940
That's it for me..

6296
04:28:24,080 --> 04:28:25,690
"0.10"!

6297
04:28:27,580 --> 04:28:30,300
It's no use. 0.10 is amazing.

6298
04:28:30,840 --> 04:28:32,040
You see the tax rate is actually 5%.

6299
04:28:32,040 --> 04:28:34,210
You see the tax rate is actually 5%.

6300
04:28:34,210 --> 04:28:36,110
You see the tax rate is actually 5%.

6301
04:28:36,750 --> 04:28:38,180
Whooaaaaa.

6302
04:28:38,220 --> 04:28:39,670
Let's move on, shall we?

6303
04:28:39,920 --> 04:28:40,950
This person here. Do you know his name?

6304
04:28:40,950 --> 04:28:41,420
This person here. Do you know his name?

6305
04:28:41,420 --> 04:28:42,080
This person here. Do you know his name?

6306
04:28:42,400 --> 04:28:42,900
Yes.

6307
04:28:43,340 --> 04:28:44,400
Who is he?

6308
04:28:45,500 --> 04:28:46,700
Er..

6309
04:28:47,220 --> 04:28:47,920

Se.. Seko the athlete.

6314
04:28:52,260 --> 04:28:56,700
Se.. Seko the athlete.

6315
04:28:57,680 --> 04:28:59,180
You're kidding me!

6316
04:28:59,440 --> 04:29:01,180
They do kinda look the same.

6317
04:29:01,500 --> 04:29:04,610
They do look alike though.

6318
04:29:03,440 --> 04:29:04,700
Seko the athlete.

6319
04:29:04,700 --> 04:29:05,600
Urg!

6320
04:29:05,600 --> 04:29:06,520
Augh!

6321
04:29:06,520 --> 04:29:07,320
Ouch!

6322
04:29:07,320 --> 04:29:08,320
Ah! Ow!

6323
04:29:08,520 --> 04:29:10,170
That's it for me.

6324
04:29:09,480 --> 04:29:10,600
Seko the athlete.

6325
04:29:10,910 --> 04:29:11,980

This person here. Do you know his name?

04:29:12,450 --> 04:29:13,040
This person here. Do you know his name?

6328
04:29:13,420 --> 04:29:15,900
Yes, er...

6329
04:29:16,120 --> 04:29:16,890
Se.. Seko the athlete.

6330
04:29:16,890 --> 04:29:20,720
Se.. Seko the athlete.

...his um, son?

6335
04:29:28,640 --> 04:29:30,400
I'm done for. This is too much.

6336
04:29:29,690 --> 04:29:31,190
We've got to persevere.

6337
04:29:30,370 --> 04:29:33,140
Seko's son?

6338
04:29:33,480 --> 04:29:34,960
Ow!

6339
04:29:35,470 --> 04:29:37,810
Well done!!

6340
04:29:36,600 --> 04:29:37,600
Did he hit your thigh?

6341
04:29:37,600 --> 04:29:38,200
Yes.

6342
04:29:38,250 --> 04:29:40,600
Your bum hurts?

iPS cells.

6349
04:29:51,480 --> 04:29:52,310
These, well..

6350
04:29:52,320 --> 04:29:54,260
With artificial cells from all over

6351
04:29:54,260 --> 04:29:56,130
With artificial cells from all over

6352
04:29:56,130 --> 04:29:57,860
With artificial cells from all over

6353
04:29:57,860 --> 04:29:59,600
If this was implemented we may be able to go as far as making a human.

6354
04:29:59,600 --> 04:30:01,230
If this was implemented we may be able to go as far as making a human.

6355
04:30:01,230 --> 04:30:03,670
If this was implemented we may be able to go as far as making a human.

6356
04:30:03,240 --> 04:30:05,240
Wow!

6357
04:30:04,930 --> 04:30:07,400
Someone who looked like you, Oonishi-san, 2,  3, even 5 of them could be created.

6358
04:30:07,400 --> 04:30:08,100
Someone who looked like you, Oonishi-san, 2,  3, even 5 of them could be created.

6359
04:30:08,100 --> 04:30:08,770
Someone who looked like you, Oonishi-san, 2,  3, even 5 of them could be created.

6360
04:30:08,770 --> 04:30:10,270
Someone who looked like you, Oonichi-san, 2,  3, even 5 of them could be created.

6361
04:30:10,680 --> 04:30:12,680
What should be done?

6362
04:30:11,110 --> 04:30:12,410
That's a bit of a problem.

6363
04:30:12,410 --> 04:30:13,710
That's a bit of a problem.

6364
04:30:13,810 --> 04:30:14,910
My wife's body would be worn out.

6365
04:30:14,910 --> 04:30:16,910
My wife's body would be worn out.

6366
04:30:21,050 --> 04:30:21,550
My wife will probably end up getting destroyed.

6367
04:30:21,550 --> 04:30:22,550
My wife will probably end up getting destroyed.

6368
04:30:22,550 --> 04:30:23,550
My wife will probably end up getting destroyed.

6369
04:30:23,550 --> 04:30:25,250
My wife will probably end up getting destroyed.

6370
04:30:25,200 --> 04:30:27,230
You're talking about sex, is that right?

6371
04:30:29,790 --> 04:30:31,690
You're talking about sex, is that right?

6372
04:30:36,560 --> 04:30:37,900
He just out and says it that way.

6373
04:30:38,380 --> 04:30:40,180
Geez!

6374
04:30:40,640 --> 04:30:43,310
How blunt!

6375
04:30:45,190 --> 04:30:46,260
It's no use.

6376
04:30:46,900 --> 04:30:48,240
Ahh....

6377
04:30:48,240 --> 04:30:49,960
It's the two of them in combination that's sorta..

6378
04:30:49,960 --> 04:30:51,450
It might be that, too.

6379
04:30:51,450 --> 04:30:51,910
My wife will probably end up getting destroyed.

6380
04:30:51,910 --> 04:30:52,880
My wife will probably end up getting destroyed.

6381
04:30:52,880 --> 04:30:53,880
My wife will probably end up getting destroyed.

6382
04:30:53,880 --> 04:30:55,580
My wife will probably end up getting destroyed.

6383
04:30:56,240 --> 04:30:57,700
You're talking about sex?

6384
04:30:57,890 --> 04:30:58,390
Yes, of course that's the case.

6385
04:30:58,390 --> 04:31:01,390
Yes, of course that's the case.

6386
04:31:01,390 --> 04:31:02,090
I see. I understand well.

6387
04:31:02,090 --> 04:31:03,190
I see. I understand well.

6388
04:31:03,190 --> 04:31:04,960
Thank you.

6389
04:31:03,200 --> 04:31:05,190
Thank you very much.

6390
04:31:05,130 --> 04:31:08,560
Asamade Current Events Discussion!

6391
04:31:05,130 --> 04:31:08,560
End

6392
04:31:05,130 --> 04:31:08,560
~Has the sun not yet risen in Japan?~

6393
04:31:15,470 --> 04:31:18,870
They really got us that time.

6394
04:31:24,480 --> 04:31:26,110
It's me, Fujiwara!

6395
04:31:24,480 --> 04:31:55,180
School P.A. Broadcast

6396
04:31:26,110 --> 04:31:27,680
It's me, Fujiwara!

6397
04:31:27,880 --> 04:31:28,980
The thing is, while I was walking in the hallway a rather large,

6398
04:31:28,980 --> 04:31:30,690
The thing is, while I was walking in the hallway a rather large,

6399
04:31:30,690 --> 04:31:35,360
The thing is, while I was walking in the hallway a rather large,

6400
04:31:32,220 --> 04:31:33,420
long-haired woman kidnapped me.

6401
04:31:33,420 --> 04:31:35,360
long-haired woman kidnapped me.

6402
04:31:35,420 --> 04:31:38,030
I've been locked away in a cage.

6403
04:31:36,740 --> 04:31:38,240
Wha..?

6404
04:31:38,160 --> 04:31:42,830
It seems that the key to the cabin

6405
04:31:39,760 --> 04:31:42,830
Is in the security room on the 2nd floor

6406
04:31:41,190 --> 04:31:43,710
Here it is.

6407
04:31:42,930 --> 04:31:47,540
Will you get the key and bring it to me?

6408
04:31:44,520 --> 04:31:46,200
Here we go.

6409
04:31:47,570 --> 04:31:49,100
Also, from here onward you're allowed to laugh, but

6410
04:31:49,100 --> 04:31:49,640
Also, from here onward you're allowed to laugh, but

6411
04:31:49,640 --> 04:31:55,180
Also, from here onward you're allowed to laugh, but

6412
04:31:51,140 --> 04:31:55,180
If you're surprised it seems you'll be OUT.

6413
04:31:52,200 --> 04:31:54,700
Geez!

6414
04:31:55,340 --> 04:31:57,780
What was up with that? The way he recited that story. It sounded like Kawashima Eigo.

6415
04:31:57,780 --> 04:32:00,680
What was up with that? The way he recited that story. It sounded like Kawashima Eigo.

6416
04:32:01,250 --> 04:32:07,060
Late Night - Special Rules

6417
04:32:03,290 --> 04:32:07,060
Must Not Get Surprised

6418
04:32:03,290 --> 04:32:07,060
Enthusiastic Teachers

6419
04:32:07,200 --> 04:32:15,860
And so, the three of them head off to the second floor to retrieve the key needed to release Fujiwara.

6420
04:32:07,390 --> 04:32:16,030
Yamazaki and Cocorico

6421
04:32:07,390 --> 04:32:16,030
head to the second floor

6422
04:32:07,390 --> 04:32:16,030
to get the key!!

6423
04:32:16,030 --> 04:32:17,200
Here I go.

6424
04:32:17,200 --> 04:32:18,180
Are you coming?

6425
04:32:17,620 --> 04:32:18,180
Yes!

6426
04:32:18,180 --> 04:32:20,180
Ok, off we go.

6427
04:32:19,140 --> 04:32:19,820
Be right back!

6428
04:32:20,180 --> 04:32:23,180
Let's go.

6429
04:32:20,340 --> 04:32:21,170
As usual Downtown is left behind.

6430
04:32:21,170 --> 04:32:23,510
As usual Downtown is left behind.

6431
04:32:21,480 --> 04:32:23,100
This is scary!

6432
04:32:25,810 --> 04:32:27,140
Eek!

6433
04:32:26,690 --> 04:32:29,690
Wow, it's unsettling in there, isn't it?

6434
04:32:27,640 --> 04:32:31,610
The lighting has changed inside the school

6435
04:32:33,680 --> 04:32:36,180
No running around or freaking out, ok?

6436
04:32:39,490 --> 04:32:41,160
Us 3, Let's stick close together and go, ok?

6437
04:32:39,680 --> 04:32:42,680
Yes, let's be sure to do that, please.

6438
04:32:41,490 --> 04:32:45,930
CO2 Gas Spray in...

6439
04:32:41,490 --> 04:32:45,930
Seconds

6440
04:32:43,800 --> 04:32:46,500
And, with really loud noises, we should...

6441
04:32:46,620 --> 04:32:47,690
Whoa!!

6442
04:32:48,220 --> 04:32:49,190
Whoa!!

6443
04:32:49,930 --> 04:32:52,000
Look like this!

6444
04:32:50,430 --> 04:32:52,000
This

6445
04:32:50,570 --> 04:32:52,000
This

6446
04:32:50,700 --> 04:32:52,000
This

6447
04:32:50,830 --> 04:32:52,000
This

6448
04:32:50,970 --> 04:32:52,000
This!!

6449
04:32:52,000 --> 04:32:55,170
It'd be better if Tanaka went ahead a bit

6450
04:32:55,540 --> 04:32:58,010
Let's stay together, please

6451
04:32:58,010 --> 04:32:59,340
Of course, we're partners in this

6452
04:33:02,040 --> 04:33:03,480
Eh? What's this?

6453
04:33:03,750 --> 04:33:08,480
The surprise "Magical Banana" commences.

6454
04:33:03,770 --> 04:33:07,720
From here onward, the surprise "Magical Banana" commences.

6455
04:33:08,480 --> 04:33:11,850

04:33:32,470 --> 04:33:32,510
Winding?

6521
04:33:32,510 --> 04:33:32,540
Winding?

6522
04:33:32,540 --> 04:33:32,570
Winding?

6523
04:33:32,570 --> 04:33:33,170
Winding?

6524
04:33:32,700 --> 04:33:35,190
You scared the crap out of me!

6525
04:33:33,170 --> 04:33:37,750
Comedy Duo, Hi-Hi - Prime Joke Material

6526
04:33:36,760 --> 04:33:37,740
What the heck is "winding?"

6527
04:33:37,820 --> 04:33:41,670
Meanwhile, as for Downtown...

6528
04:33:37,850 --> 04:33:40,680
The two lone members of Downtown

6529
04:33:42,220 --> 04:33:44,250
Where are you going for New Year's?

6530
04:33:45,190 --> 04:33:47,090
Hm?

6531
04:33:48,390 --> 04:33:49,520
It's a common question to ask. I don't care if it airs or not.

6532
04:33:49,520 --> 04:33:52,230
It's a common question to ask. I don't care if it airs or not.

6533
04:33:50,400 --> 04:33:52,120
No, geez. I don't want to do this.

6534
04:33:52,230 --> 04:33:53,230
Even when they tell us it's OK to laugh,

6535
04:33:53,230 --> 04:33:54,360
Even when they tell us it's OK to laugh,

6536
04:33:54,360 --> 04:33:55,730
To have a regular conversation with you, with no rules in place. It's pointless and nerve-wracking.

6537
04:33:55,730 --> 04:33:57,430
To have a regular conversation with you, with no rules in place. It's pointless and nerve-wracking.

6538
04:33:57,430 --> 04:33:59,130
To have a regular conversation with you, with no rules in place. It's pointless and nerve-wracking.

6539
04:33:59,130 --> 04:34:01,570
To have a regular conversation with you, with no rules in place. It's pointless and nerve-wracking.

6540
04:34:02,370 --> 04:34:04,770
You're laughing way too much about this!!

6541
04:34:04,770 --> 04:34:07,180
That's because it's not a big deal.

6542
04:34:06,690 --> 04:34:08,690
No, I.. ugh.

6543
04:34:08,340 --> 04:34:09,410
This is absolutely the worst moment of the year.

6544
04:34:09,410 --> 04:34:09,680
This is absolutely the worst moment of the year.

6545
04:34:09,680 --> 04:34:12,750
This is absolutely the worst moment of the year.

6546
04:34:12,750 --> 04:34:13,750
This situation is just so depressing!!

6547
04:34:13,750 --> 04:34:15,350
This situation is just so depressing!!

6548
04:34:15,520 --> 04:34:18,780
Ah, there's the security room!

6549
04:34:15,680 --> 04:34:20,320
In front of Security Personnel
Room 2F

6550
04:34:19,190 --> 04:34:22,860

6553
04:34:19,680 --> 04:34:22,200
Oh my god..

6554
04:34:19,890 --> 04:34:22,860
Key

6555
04:34:20,690 --> 04:34:22,860
Key

6556
04:34:22,200 --> 04:34:26,200
Hey, there are some pen lights here. Three of them.

6557
04:34:24,030 --> 04:34:31,000
Pen Light

6558
04:34:26,230 --> 04:34:31,000
Electric Shock in:

6559
04:34:26,230 --> 04:34:31,000
Seconds

6560
04:34:27,690 --> 04:34:30,190
I wonder if we have to bother signing this sheet.

6561
04:34:31,190 --> 04:34:32,680
Ahh!

6562
04:34:31,700 --> 04:34:31,730
Zap!

6563
04:34:31,730 --> 04:34:31,770
Zap!

6564
04:34:31,770 --> 04:34:31,800
Zap!

6565
04:34:31,800 --> 04:34:33,070
Zap!

6566
04:34:32,460 --> 04:34:33,180
Wha??

6567
04:34:33,280 --> 04:34:34,680
Ahh!

6568
04:34:33,800 --> 04:34:34,580
Wha??

6569
04:34:34,570 --> 04:34:37,570
It shocked me!

6570
04:34:39,440 --> 04:34:40,340
Scary!

6571
04:34:40,070 --> 04:34:42,880
Are these shock pens?

6572
04:34:41,700 --> 04:34:45,200
Don't do it.

6573
04:34:44,180 --> 04:34:46,380
Does the zap come out from here?

6574
04:34:45,200 --> 04:34:46,950
But mine might be the only one that works.

6575
04:34:46,950 --> 04:34:49,820
Why did only my pen went off?

6576
04:34:48,700 --> 04:34:50,200
Huh, that's weird.

6577
04:34:51,250 --> 04:34:52,250
Wait a minute, my zapper

6578
04:34:52,250 --> 04:34:53,350
Wait a minute, my zapper

6579
04:34:53,350 --> 04:34:54,760
Er, I mean my pen light is..

6580
04:34:54,760 --> 04:34:58,160
Wait a moment.

6581
04:34:58,290 --> 04:35:00,690
Wait up.

6582
04:34:58,490 --> 04:35:03,600
Security Personnel Room

6583
04:34:59,590 --> 04:35:02,600
I don't understand why
my penlight went off..

6584
04:35:00,690 --> 04:35:02,690
We're here, we're here.

6585
04:35:02,600 --> 04:35:03,600
The key's inside this room.

6586
04:35:04,200 --> 04:35:06,000
But there are a lot of them!!

6587
04:35:05,240 --> 04:35:06,080
Eh?

6588
04:35:05,460 --> 04:35:06,210
Eh?

6589
04:35:07,640 --> 04:35:09,240
Something's written here!

6590
04:35:08,870 --> 04:35:12,710
Seconds

6591
04:35:08,870 --> 04:35:12,710
Secret Prank in..

6592
04:35:09,300 --> 04:35:11,200
Just this one here.

6593
04:35:11,200 --> 04:35:13,200
Oh man, oh geez...

6594
04:35:15,240 --> 04:35:17,080
Aaaaaah!

6595
04:35:15,240 --> 04:35:17,240
Waaaaah!

6596
04:35:15,240 --> 04:35:17,580
Ah!

6597
04:35:15,410 --> 04:35:17,580
Ah!

6598
04:35:15,580 --> 04:35:17,580
Ah!

6599
04:35:15,910 --> 04:35:17,580
Ah!

6600
04:35:16,240 --> 04:35:17,580
Ah!

6601
04:35:16,640 --> 04:35:17,580
Ah!

6602
04:35:17,010 --> 04:35:17,580
Ah!

6603
04:35:17,280 --> 04:35:17,580
Ah!

6604
04:35:17,760 --> 04:35:19,690
Ah!

6605
04:35:19,180 --> 04:35:25,790
The Room Suddenly Blacked Out

6606
04:35:19,690 --> 04:35:19,690
Aaaaah!

6607
04:35:26,120 --> 04:35:34,030
Yamazaki, Tanaka and Endo have only their penlights for illumination (The bright light you see is an infrared light.)

6608
04:35:29,060 --> 04:35:29,520
No!

6609
04:35:29,360 --> 04:35:30,730
Wah!

6610
04:35:29,520 --> 04:35:29,990
No!

6611
04:35:29,760 --> 04:35:30,730
No, I'm scared!

6612
04:35:29,990 --> 04:35:30,730
No!

6613
04:35:31,200 --> 04:35:32,700
Bad..

6614
04:35:31,230 --> 04:35:33,230
What's that over there?

6615
04:35:33,230 --> 04:35:34,030
This is bad

6616
04:35:33,690 --> 04:35:35,690
Oh no, oh no...

6617
04:35:35,260 --> 04:35:42,070
Ijirii Okada (comedian) wearing a speedo

6618
04:35:37,780 --> 04:35:39,780
Who's that? Who's there?

6619
04:35:42,180 --> 04:35:44,680
Ah, it's Ijirii-san.

6620
04:35:44,140 --> 04:35:45,840
Greetings.

6621
04:35:46,200 --> 04:35:47,900
Is he giving us some sort of a clue?

6622
04:35:47,880 --> 04:35:49,460
Housei-san, why are you pointing your light at his crotch?

6623
04:35:48,720 --> 04:35:49,200
Eh?

6624
04:35:49,710 --> 04:35:52,050
Only pointing it at his crotch..

6625
04:35:58,220 --> 04:35:58,850
Wha..?

6626
04:36:01,560 --> 04:36:04,890
The lights have been turned back on

6627
04:36:01,680 --> 04:36:03,190
Aah!

6628
04:36:04,180 --> 04:36:04,940
Look at this.

6629
04:36:05,190 --> 04:36:08,530
The key has been obtained

6630
04:36:05,700 --> 04:36:08,100
The three of them safely retrieve the key.

6631
04:36:12,030 --> 04:36:13,130
Why am I the topic of conversation, here?

6632
04:36:13,130 --> 04:36:14,300
Why am I the topic of conversation, here?

6633
04:36:15,140 --> 04:36:16,970
I'm just asking.

6634
04:36:17,810 --> 04:36:18,410
I'll be going to a resort this summer

6635
04:36:18,410 --> 04:36:19,070
I'll be going to a resort this summer

6636
04:36:19,070 --> 04:36:20,580
I'll be going to a resort this summer

6637
04:36:20,670 --> 04:36:23,670
Whereas this winter it's already a little..

6638
04:36:22,920 --> 04:36:23,740
Ah, I see.

6639
04:36:24,250 --> 04:36:26,580
Where will you be going? This summer.

6640
04:36:29,280 --> 04:36:30,890
Guam, or somewhere like that?

6641
04:36:31,220 --> 04:36:35,060
I've always wanted to tell you this.

6642
04:36:32,200 --> 04:36:33,700
Yes, yes.

6643
04:36:35,060 --> 04:36:37,190
Stop calling it Gamu.

6644
04:36:37,530 --> 04:36:39,830
It's Guam.

6645
04:36:39,080 --> 04:36:39,960
What the hell is that?

6646
04:36:39,830 --> 04:36:40,700
I can't stand that. Calling it "Gamu".

6647
04:36:40,690 --> 04:36:42,690
What the hell...

6648
04:36:40,700 --> 04:36:42,730
I can't stand that. Calling it "Gamu".

6649
04:36:42,730 --> 04:36:43,500
The only people who call it Gamu is you and, you know...

6650
04:36:43,500 --> 04:36:45,100
The only people who call it Gamu is you and, you know...

6651
04:36:45,300 --> 04:36:48,140
Shinsuke-niiyan...

6652
04:36:50,420 --> 04:36:53,080
Meanwhile, after getting the key, Cocorico and Yamazaki are..

6653
04:36:51,940 --> 04:36:55,740
Seconds

6654
04:36:51,940 --> 04:36:55,740
Secret Prank in..

6655
04:36:53,100 --> 04:36:53,960
Let's go back, seriously.

6656
04:36:53,980 --> 04:36:55,260
There are markers pointing the way.

6657
04:37:00,880 --> 04:37:04,820

6658
04:37:06,620 --> 04:37:06,650
Eeek! I just pressed the button on my penlight again!

6659
04:37:07,090 --> 04:37:09,890

Waaaaaah!!

6664
04:37:14,670 --> 04:37:17,710
No more, no more! Wait!

6665
04:37:17,710 --> 04:37:19,710
I hate this. Hate this!!

6666
04:37:19,470 --> 04:37:25,170
Handcuffed and Restrained

6667
04:37:23,440 --> 04:37:24,240
Ah, ow ow ow.

6668
04:37:25,360 --> 04:37:27,520
What're we gonna do?

6669
04:37:27,500 --> 04:37:27,840
It's no use.

6670
04:37:30,910 --> 04:37:35,220

What? Wait..

6678
04:37:40,680 --> 04:37:42,180
Whoa!

6679
04:37:42,060 --> 04:37:42,090

It Went Off in the Training Room Too!

I'm so pissed off

6686
04:37:59,690 --> 04:38:03,190
”I'm so pissed off".. Hahaha.

6687
04:38:00,680 --> 04:38:03,740
What was the point of doing that?

6688
04:38:04,000 --> 04:38:06,710

04:38:35,680 --> 04:38:37,880
I've seen that

6709
04:38:36,580 --> 04:38:37,880
the other day on "King's Brunch" (the TV show).

6710
04:38:37,880 --> 04:38:40,210
Please don't say that.

6711
04:38:40,380 --> 04:38:44,000
And while Yagi continues with his Special Quiz...

6712
04:38:44,440 --> 04:38:45,480
But to properly do it...

6713
04:38:45,490 --> 04:38:47,820
You have to

6714
04:38:46,190 --> 04:38:47,820
use the correct words.

6715
04:38:48,360 --> 04:38:51,090
But it's just with Guam so...

6716
04:38:49,180 --> 04:38:50,440
Other words, not particularly...

6717
04:38:51,120 --> 04:38:52,480
Um...

6718
04:38:52,690 --> 04:38:54,700

Geez, that's not right.

6722
04:38:59,170 --> 04:39:01,670
The way you say it is totally wrong.

6723
04:39:00,340 --> 04:39:01,620
What? What are you on about?

6724
04:39:01,670 --> 04:39:01,970
It's washing machine.

6725
04:39:01,970 --> 04:39:02,300

That's so...

6728
04:39:05,580 --> 04:39:06,140
It's normal..

6729
04:39:06,810 --> 04:39:07,780

I think I say it in a good way.

6751
04:39:42,580 --> 04:39:45,310
I think I say it in a good way.

6752
04:39:43,210 --> 04:39:45,310
You've gotta be kidding me!!

6753
04:39:46,850 --> 04:39:48,350
It's out now.

6754
04:39:48,350 --> 04:39:50,020
A typical response, "You've gotta be kidding me!!".

6755
04:39:50,020 --> 04:39:53,550
A typical response, "You've gotta be kidding me!!".

6756
04:39:53,920 --> 04:39:54,490
That's enough, seriously. This is so irritating right now!!

This place is hell.

6768

As for these three, who savor this hell...

6769
04:40:48,380 --> 04:40:53,550
With their mouths gagged, they're completely confined.

6770
04:40:48,800 --> 04:40:52,500
they're completely confined.

6771

Mikitty!!

6805
04:41:58,240 --> 04:42:02,320

You scared the hell out of me!

6956
04:44:16,950 --> 04:44:20,390
The Lights Come Back On

6957
04:44:21,290 --> 04:44:23,960
Gross!

6958
04:44:24,690 --> 04:44:27,690
Wh-what the..?

6959
04:44:27,690 --> 04:44:30,210
Man, I'm really freaked out right now.

6960
04:44:29,730 --> 04:44:30,230
Huh? It won't open.

6961
04:44:30,210 --> 04:44:31,710
What?

6962
04:44:30,230 --> 04:44:32,370
Huh? It won't open.

6963
04:44:33,930 --> 04:44:33,970
Whoa!

6964
04:44:33,970 --> 04:44:34,000

04:44:34,000 --> 04:44:34,030
Whoa!

6968
04:44:34,030 --> 04:44:35,670
Whoa!

6969
04:44:34,300 --> 04:44:35,800
What is it?

6970
04:44:35,670 --> 04:44:37,670
Mikitty...

6971
04:44:38,200 --> 04:44:43,510
He Can't Find Mikitty

6972
04:44:40,690 --> 04:44:43,690
Man, enough already! Seriously!

6973
04:44:47,190 --> 04:44:49,680
Give it up, man.

6974
04:44:49,680 --> 04:44:51,700
I'm afraid.

6975
04:44:49,720 --> 04:44:53,650
Jason Voorhees Attack in...

6976
04:44:49,720 --> 04:44:53,650
Seconds

6977
04:44:51,700 --> 04:44:54,180
Ah, man, I'm so freaked out.

6978
04:44:54,180 --> 04:44:55,680
Uwaa!

6979
04:45:01,670 --> 04:45:04,190
No! No!

6980
04:45:07,770 --> 04:45:10,800
Downtown Passes The Confinement Room

6981
04:45:11,870 --> 04:45:13,040
Eh?  Over here?

6982
04:45:13,040 --> 04:45:13,870
Eh? Over here?

6983
04:45:14,440 --> 04:45:16,710
What's wrong with you guys?

6984
04:45:16,880 --> 04:45:20,380
Downtown safely rescue the three of them

6985
04:45:20,780 --> 04:45:22,190
And then...

6986
04:45:23,050 --> 04:45:30,720
School Public Address

6987
04:45:26,190 --> 04:45:30,720
We have received information which states that Fujiwara Sensei is being held

6988
04:45:27,250 --> 04:45:30,720
We have received information which states that Fujiwara Sensei is being held

6989
04:45:28,290 --> 04:45:30,720
in a storehouse near the school grounds.

6990
04:45:31,090 --> 04:45:35,190
Rookie teachers. All of you,

6991
04:45:32,860 --> 04:45:35,190
Make your way to the school grounds immediately, please.

6992
04:45:33,190 --> 04:45:35,190
Make your way to the school grounds immediately, please.

6993
04:45:35,360 --> 04:45:43,940
Head to the

storehouse

6996
04:45:36,180 --> 04:45:41,700
The 5 of leave for the storehouse to save Fujiwara without delay.

6997
04:45:41,700 --> 04:45:43,680
What's happened? Geez.

6998
04:45:43,680 --> 04:45:46,200
The five are just about to leave for their destination.

6999
04:45:43,940 --> 04:45:50,880
A barrage of terrifying  attacks while en route to the storehouse:

7000
04:45:44,340 --> 04:45:50,880
Sudden Wall Explosion

7001
04:45:44,640 --> 04:45:50,880
Jason Voorhees Raid

7002
04:45:44,900 --> 04:45:50,880
Flying Missiles

7003
04:45:46,200 --> 04:45:48,190
From here onward,

7004
04:45:48,190 --> 04:45:50,740
three terrifying pranks, one after another!

7005
04:45:50,740 --> 04:45:53,790
What the? We used to always have to save Heipo.

7006
04:45:50,940 --> 04:45:55,750
1F  Hallway

7007
04:45:53,790 --> 04:45:55,680
We did, didn't we?

7008
04:45:55,680 --> 04:45:58,680
I've gotta take a piss.

7009
04:45:58,680 --> 04:46:01,200
What's this?

7010
04:46:01,950 --> 04:46:06,660
The Wall Explodes

7011
04:46:05,700 --> 04:46:08,710
Definitely distressing.

7012
04:46:12,100 --> 04:46:15,900
Group of Jasons + A Missile

7013
04:46:15,700 --> 04:46:18,180
No, no! It's hopeless!

7014
04:46:18,180 --> 04:46:20,680
Huh? What?

7015
04:46:18,840 --> 04:46:22,240
Everyone

7016
04:46:18,840 --> 04:46:22,240
Go To The Storehouse!!

7017
04:46:18,840 --> 04:46:22,240
Ride The Motorcycles and

7018
04:46:20,680 --> 04:46:22,680
Are we all supposed to get on?

7019
04:46:23,380 --> 04:46:26,110
(The motorcycles)

7020
04:46:23,380 --> 04:46:26,110
Hey, they're connected together.

7021
04:46:23,710 --> 04:46:27,180
Ah! They're all attached to each other.

7022
04:46:27,180 --> 04:46:29,180
Ready?

7023
04:46:29,180 --> 04:46:30,850
Yes.

7024
04:46:30,850 --> 04:46:30,850
Ready.

7025
04:46:30,850 --> 04:46:34,650
Seconds

7026
04:46:30,850 --> 04:46:34,650
Secret Prank in..

7027
04:46:32,770 --> 04:46:35,770
The pedals are moving too fast!

7028
04:46:39,690 --> 04:46:43,210
Tadaa~! Long time, no see.

7029
04:46:40,660 --> 04:46:45,360
Yuutarou Appears From Beneath The Ground

7030
04:46:43,210 --> 04:46:44,620
Yuutarou.

7031
04:46:45,600 --> 04:46:48,270
It's been 2 years, you know.

7032
04:46:46,210 --> 04:46:48,700
You weren't here last year, were you?

7033
04:46:48,700 --> 04:46:51,700
That's right, isn't it Yuutarou-san?

7034
04:46:50,740 --> 04:46:51,900
He's soaking wet!

7035
04:46:51,700 --> 04:46:54,720
I'm quite saturated, aren't I?

7036
04:46:54,310 --> 04:46:57,310
As usual, he's got some wine poured!!

7037
04:46:54,720 --> 04:46:59,220
Yes, he does but this is going a bit far!

7038
04:46:59,010 --> 04:47:01,010
Let's go already!!

7039
04:47:01,040 --> 04:47:01,840
I'll be back.

7040
04:47:01,880 --> 04:47:02,800
Ok, I guess.

7041
04:47:08,700 --> 04:47:10,700
The directions are pointing left.

7042
04:47:08,720 --> 04:47:14,590
School Grounds

7043
04:47:12,590 --> 04:47:14,590
There's the storehouse.

7044
04:47:13,170 --> 04:47:14,670
Oh, it's here?

7045
04:47:15,030 --> 04:47:20,900
The Storehouse Is Surrounded By A Cemetery

7046
04:47:15,720 --> 04:47:19,180
Alright. Is this going to be OK?

7047
04:47:19,180 --> 04:47:19,180
I'm afraid.

7048
04:47:19,780 --> 04:47:21,080
We've made it here safely.

7049
04:47:21,100 --> 04:47:22,620
I've been holding onto the key, here.

7050
04:47:24,300 --> 04:47:26,040
Oh, did it just open?

7051
04:47:25,180 --> 04:47:28,680
Phew! That scared me.

7052
04:47:27,680 --> 04:47:29,240
The ground's all muddy, isn't it?

7053
04:47:29,240 --> 04:47:29,480
He's here.

7054
04:47:29,480 --> 04:47:29,710
He's here.

7055
04:47:29,710 --> 04:47:31,190
Oh! Fujiwara.

7056
04:47:29,710 --> 04:47:31,510
He's here.

7057
04:47:32,000 --> 04:47:33,120
Are you alright?

7058
04:47:32,680 --> 04:47:36,580
I knew you'd save me!!

7059
04:47:34,230 --> 04:47:35,730
What the hell is all that?

7060
04:47:37,980 --> 04:47:44,760
They Escape With Fujiwara Riding In A Baby Carriage

7061
04:47:38,180 --> 04:47:41,180
They safely release Fujiwara.

7062
04:47:41,180 --> 04:47:44,700
Without delay, they leave the storehouse and make their escape.

7063
04:47:44,920 --> 04:47:46,100
We're leaving now, Fujiwara.

7064
04:47:46,120 --> 04:47:47,400
Please be careful.

7065
04:47:50,640 --> 04:47:52,860
Ahh.. everyone. I'm not safe yet.

Right now, all the Ninomiya Kinjiro's bronze statues are gone,

7138
04:50:52,500 --> 04:50:56,700
the poses were of me reading a book, falling and hurting myself

7139
04:50:56,700 --> 04:51:00,400
so the new pose is going to be... wait...

7140
04:51:02,000 --> 04:51:04,000
The statue will be like this

7141
04:51:04,960 --> 04:51:06,420
That's what I suggested.

7142
04:51:06,690 --> 04:51:09,260
They told me "That's just somebody relaxing!"

7143
04:51:09,260 --> 04:51:11,260
So, for that reason...

7144
04:51:11,260 --> 04:51:13,430
So, for that reason...

7145
04:51:19,340 --> 04:51:21,270
That's pointless spank...

7146
04:51:21,300 --> 04:51:22,650
Pointless!

04:56:40,730 --> 04:56:51,200
Friday, January 8th "24 No Laughing Enthusiastic Teachers!!"

7245
04:56:40,730 --> 04:56:51,200
We will be airing a 2 hour special of never seen before footage!

7246
04:56:42,980 --> 04:56:44,290
Ahh, most definitely.

7247
04:56:44,520 --> 04:56:47,500
At least half of our audience is crying.

7248
04:56:49,140 --> 04:56:51,730
They're crying?

7249
04:56:50,480 --> 04:56:51,540
It was a moving performance.

7250
04:56:51,730 --> 04:56:52,800
I don't see anything at all.

7251
04:56:55,200 --> 04:56:58,000
Uh, look.. When everyone is watching like this

7252
04:56:58,460 --> 04:57:02,230
would you stop farting in my direction?

7253
04:57:02,230 --> 04:57:08,270
My reaction won't get filmed... and I can only
remain calm and smell it while you're farting away...

7254
04:57:08,280 --> 04:57:09,730
I know, right?

7255
04:57:09,730 --> 04:57:13,720
But if you think about it, it's hitting you two and us two.

7256
04:57:13,720 --> 04:57:16,720
It's being spread around evenly.

7257
04:57:16,720 --> 04:57:19,210
If you think about it, the last round (of farts)...

7258
04:57:19,210 --> 04:57:22,210
was exactly when we hit 12:00, new year...

7259
04:57:22,210 --> 04:57:24,710
Amazing, isn't it?

7260
04:57:28,720 --> 04:57:32,220
Everyone, Gaki no Tsukai thanks you for this year, as always!
