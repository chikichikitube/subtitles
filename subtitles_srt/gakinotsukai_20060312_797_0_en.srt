00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,240
When you buy it, you will be happy

118
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,350
On the other hand it's not something fun

119
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,400
No.. this is .. Tasty!

120
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,330

122
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,050
Tanaka's dish is not bad

123
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,380

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,360
Confident?

133
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,680
Why you didn't eat what you make?

134
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,470

If you try to improve the sauce, the flavor will be better

168
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,140
Right, the volume is enough

169
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,720
What happen if it's tartar?

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,140
I don't really think much about it but i am shocked

198
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,830
I see

199
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,000
Next dish is this

200
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,000
What's this

201
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,880
Yes, it's tea bag

202
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,540
Tea?

203
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,620
Tea, i don't really drink it but i will explain later

204
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,200
Well, this is a try

205
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,650
Where is frisk?

206
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,330
This time i think i must stop it

207
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,210
It looks so cheap

208
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,550
You still a celebrity?

209
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,580
I am ~~~

210
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,630
The poor man style, dried kelp flavor, how will it fare?

211
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,270
Tea bag is not edible, just like this

212
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,510
Round it and round it

213
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,370
The entire thing?

214
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,160
For real?

215
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,140
The entire thing

216
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,800
What the hell

217
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,980
You are an idiot

218
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:06,910
The taste will spread in the takoyaki and then we will eat it

219
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,370
Imagining takoyaki with the taste of tea, how will it fare?

220
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,820
Endo first dish salted kelp, how will it taste?

221
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,460
It's something interesting

222
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,180
Eat just like usual?

223
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,560
Just like usual

224
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,890
The taste is all over

225
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,890
The plate?

226
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,080
Bring it

227
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,640
Bring it

228
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,980
Faster

229
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,220
Don't show your chest

230
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,920
Faster, faster we don't have enough time

231
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,360
Downtown must be first

232
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,490
The first is Tanaka

233
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,810
Honestly you look awesome

234
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,810
He is getting proud

235
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,540
This is good

236
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,540
Itadakimas

237
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,550
It smells nice

238
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,700
Tasty

239
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,380
Delicious

240
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:17,880
How is it?

241
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,520
Delicious

242
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:21,860
Tasty

243
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,800
This go well with beer

244
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,360
Yeah

245
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,090
It does go well

246
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,500
Delicious

247
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,510
This is a delight for 40 years above

248
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,420
It suits us all

249
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,870
8 point

250
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,670
This is seriously angel mark

251
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,530
For real?

252
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,950
First is the economical cost, then

253
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,500
The taste blend well, really well

254
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,910
It is angel for me

255
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,280
Despite Yamazaki judgment, the dried kelp takoyaki receive 8 point

256
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,970
Next is Endo 2nd ingredient, tea bag

257
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,210
Don't show your chest

258
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,590
don't show it

259
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,990
The appearance is not bad

260
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,020
You did it

261
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,440
This situation fit the kid's enjoyment

262
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,260
That's right, eat like this

263
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,910
Eating like this is not my style

264
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,440
Hot

265
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,130
It is difficult to eat

266
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,570
What the heck is this

267
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,490
Right

268
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,130
The taste?

269
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,190
There is no taste

270
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,400
There is no taste ... Bitter

271
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,460
The tea flavor didn't come out

272
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,930
There is no taste

273
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,540
How many point, yama-chan

274
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,840
This one...

275
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,470
6 point

276
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,200
So high!

277
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,630
Too high!

278
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,400
1 point

279
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,000
It's 6 though

280
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,970
But the taste

281
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,680
Thats right

282
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,930
Based on what we eat is 1 point

283
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,120
There is no taste

284
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,840
So close, i think it's not 1 too

285
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,950
It's not ~~~

286
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,740
Because it's Endo

287
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,640
Why so lenient

288
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,730
Previous episode he also keep on saying Endo, Endo

289
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,620
That's right

290
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,440
Hard to eat and tasteless tea bag Takoyaki, 1 Point

291
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:32,310
Next is the sweets lover Yamazaki

292
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:32,950
First

293
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,330
First is this

294
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,520
Please Yama-chan

295
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,400
What's this

296
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,910
Peanut butter

297
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,100
I hate it

298
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,230
I decline this

299
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,690
I hate it, It's sweet I don't understand

300
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,690
Don't understand? It's peanut butter

301
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,380
I can't take this

302
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,340
You are saying you hate it before i make it

303
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,400
It's like child saying cannot play at my house

304
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,880
It's tasty though

305
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,270
Foreigner like it though

306
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,960
Yamazaki first ingredient peanut butter

307
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:10,970
2nd dish vegetable juice, turmeric tea, tomato juice

308
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,480
For finishing touch i will put it on a stick and it will look like dango

309
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,920
Why do i feel he is speaking impolitely to me?

310
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,660
Looks like 3 color dango

311
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,190
You are putting that much?

312
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,030
This much

313
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,750
Fifth episode using peanut butter

314
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,910
So it's like that

315
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,100
Cool

316
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,070
Just that?

317
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,700
The flavor is there

318
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,660
This is all

319
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,080
He is impolite again

320
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,440
You must stop it

321
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:07,080
Yamazaki 2nd dish is no filling, varied color and healthy dish

322
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,700
Yamazaki 1st ingredient peanut butter

323
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,480
Peanut butter

324
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,750
Matsumoto, this is delicious right?

325
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,480
First glance it's just usual takoyaki

326
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,300
Toughness is just right

327
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,100
Let's eat

328
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,260
It smells nice

329
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:30,120
Hot

330
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,120
Tasty

331
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,110
Don't keep on saying delicious

332
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,110
There is no sweetness

333
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,930
He is right, no hint at all

334
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,380
Because it's too warm, the sweetness just fade

335
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,210
Because of the heat the sweetness disappear.

336
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,050
That's right

337
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,820
*10 to the power of -9  or the value 0.000000001

338
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,820
This one didn't even worth 1 nano*

339
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,310
Nano? That's all my effort worth?

340
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:03,000
1 nano peanut butter, obviously 1 point

341
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,570
Next is Yamazaki, first glance healthy 3 color food

342
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,230
This

343
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,760
I see

344
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,490
First..

345
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,490
Appearance

346
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,750
Look at it

347
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,480
Never seen this before

348
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,420
Never right?

349
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,500
Vegetable juice, turmeric..

350
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,350
Tomato juice

351
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,930
Vegetable juice

352
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,030
Horrible

353
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,100
The turmeric

354
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,150
The turmeric is amazing

355
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,620
Seriously?

356
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,470
Last is tomato juice

357
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,590
I ate 2

358
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,610
It's 3 times as bad

359
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,730
This is very

360
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,530
Eat all your food

361
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,860
This guy really

362
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,360
Even Suga is laughing

363
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,360
Black-faced wagyu

364
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,110
First look at the edge of betrayal, 3 healthy diet, 1 point

365
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,950
Next is the highly anticipated Hamada turn

366
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,410
First ingredient

367
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,740
What the heck!

368
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,000
What?

369
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,890
Let it not be black-faced wagyu

370
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,750
Don't say that

371
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,310
Squid ink

372
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,680
Squid ink

373
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,110
I mix in the body

374
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,870
Squid is already in takoyaki, so..

375
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,870
Takoyaki is squid ball, so Hamada improvise with squid ink

376
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,500
2nd dish

377
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,950
This is the usual octopus

378
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,430
There is seaweed and rice, why?

379
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,960
Hamada 2nd recipe, Normal takoyaki is made into rolled sushi

380
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,930
Put this in

381
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,610
This is again..

382
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,510
Daring

383
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,920
It's black

384
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,700
If this is sell at a stall, the reaction will be what the heck

385
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,540
That's true

386
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,820
The squid too

387
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,650
Then squid ring too

388
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,250
Takoyaki is also using rice powder

389
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,880
That's true

390
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,770
I see

391
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,340
Each person get one

392
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,960
First is squid ink, how will it fare?

393
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,200
Here it is

394
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,240
This is evil

395
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,910
The shape of evil

396
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,210
It's bomb, bomb

397
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,750
It's grotesque

398
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,740
When i saw it,

399
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,020
I am shocked

400
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,150
So it turn out like this

401
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,150
Let's eat

402
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,580
Tasty

403
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,760
Again

404
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,120
This is very tasty

405
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,140
Squid ink taste like this

406
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,630
Anyone seen this before?

407
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,810
The squid is nice too

408
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,740
The squid is big

409
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,650
Even though it's good

410
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,410
Not bad

411
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,150
If there is crunchy taste it will be better

412
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:15,960
It's 6

413
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,430
The top is 8 so 6 is okay

414
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,230
It's 6

415
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,860
Seriously?

416
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,390
Then 6, thanks

417
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,910
Taste not bad, squid ink takoyaki 6

418
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,320
Next is Kansai-nara combination takoyaki rolled

419
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,160
It looks good

420
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,840
Looks good

421
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,720
It's setsubun

422
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,510
I see

423
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,500
Rolled yaki

424
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,260
From any angle

425
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,350
Done it during setsubun?

426
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,510
Never..

427
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,540
Let's do it

428
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,730
It's like something mother will do

429
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,780
True

430
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,410
Let's eat

431
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,330
Nothing special

432
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,610
I get the feeling if there is something to dip with

433
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,580
I see

434
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,020
It's close but..

435
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:19,950
I see

436
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,740
Do this with the sauce

437
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,870
Mayonnaise

438
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,530
Absolutely

439
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,320
It's hard

440
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,730
That is good

441
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,590
How is it?

442
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,380
It's better

443
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,260
For real?

444
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,250
Seriously?

445
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,720
There is a taste

446
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,280
How many point?

447
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,000
With or without sauce 4 or 5

448
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,160
Seriously?

449
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,100
What?

450
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,480
I think it's higher

451
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,620
What point?

452
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,080
I think it's 5 or 6

453
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:10,410
True, Hamada being senior need to receive better treatment

454
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,850
Is it because of the Nakayama muscles? It's 2 right?

455
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,390
The betrayal rolled sushi, 4 point

456
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,620
Last challenger Matsumoto

457
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,280
What is his wanted to try

458
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,580
This creative, first time ever appear now

459
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,740
First is this

460
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,210
Fruits takoyaki

461
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,650
After making the takoyaki

462
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,650
Then dip it into the chocolate

463
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,220
Then we freeze it

464
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,380
Freezed takoyaki

465
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,110
Freezed?!

466
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,290
I always have 3rd ingredient

467
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:00,620
I need to stop those, i can't play with food

468
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,180
They are not edible

469
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,290
Next is my 2nd dish, it's this

470
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,280
It's seal testicle

471
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,070
Testicle?

472
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,770
The whole thing?

473
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,130
Yes?

474
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,240
I am thinking of using this part

475
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,150
That part is good for health

476
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,670
This is from the same water family

477
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,570
Amazing

478
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,010
First is Strawberry, banana, orange made into takoyaki

479
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,370
And then

480
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,470
Put it in here

481
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,410
Until the last part it's delicious

482
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,260
Cover it with chocolate

483
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,940
Then put this in freezer

484
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,790
For 2 hour

485
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,280
That's quite long

486
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,750
Let's break up first

487
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,160
It's bad

488
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,800
Gaki staff is not afraid of that

489
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,490
They are

490
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,110
The seal testicle have a special way to prepare

491
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,190
The piece is amazing

492
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,430
The pieces are amazing

493
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,090
This is a delicacy

494
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,470
Never heard that before

495
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,140
Shut up

496
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,920
Shut up

497
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,700
Shut up

498
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,320
Shut up

499
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,090
This looks extremely delicious

500
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,100
Looks like pino*

501
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,080
Guessing it's a choco ball

502
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,100
Yeah looks like pino*

503
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,110
I put in different fruit, so i don't know which is what

504
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,560
Let's eat

505
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,690
This is not takoyaki

506
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,750
It's not

507
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,180
It's not

508
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,180
It's dessert

509
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,370
Orange

510
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,430
Orange is bad

511
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,440
Orange is bad

512
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,390
It's still edible

513
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,320
Evil?

514
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,810
Evil is common now, skull is not

515
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,150
What's with the evil

516
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,910
Labeled with skull, the takoyaki 1 point

517
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,130
Next is the scary one, the testicle takoyaki

518
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,600
Normal jumbo takoyaki

519
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,590
First look to it

520
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:26,800
I see

521
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,250
Disgusting

522
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,670
Imagine what is inside

523
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:36,180
The testicle and another one cost 20,000 yen

524
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,710
So it is something to try

525
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,520
This is amazing

526
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,310
The thing inside is impossible

527
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,620
Oh, sorry

528
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,230
The smell

529
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,040
Impossible

530
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:58,870
The smell of ammonia make my nose run away

531
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,450
Heipo

532
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,930
Heipo~

533
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,330
Master Heipo

534
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,960
He save us during these time

535
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,480
Please eat it

536
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,000
Takoyaki is delicious

537
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,330
Eat the main

538
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,460
Everything

539
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,530
What happen master

540
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,080
