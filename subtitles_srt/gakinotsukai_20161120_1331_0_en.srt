1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,850
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,130
"Let's ask the best 5 of a town we've never been to"!!

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,250
So Matsumoto, This time we will be

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,160
The 5 members will go to a town they've never been to

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,160
Today's plan

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,160
and they will ask the locals for info

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,160
to determine that town's best 5

8
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,860
Going to a town we don't know and ask

9
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,110
Its best 5 to the people living there

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,320
That's the plan

11
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,230
Matsumoto Hitoshi, Hamada Masatoshi, Tsukitei Hosei, Endo Shozo, Tanaka Naoki

12
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,520
Ok, now Hosei takes the lead

13
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,640
Counting on you

14
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,000
That's a first one

15
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,950
Do I have to explain it?

16
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,250
Honestly, I'd love to listen instead

17
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,040
Look, this is the Kanto region

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,480
This is the map

19
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,920
First off we pick a prefecture

20
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:45,480
Rules - they'll choose one prefecture from the Kanto region, then they randomly pick a paper containing the name of a train station from inside it

21
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,560
Can we decide which one to pick?

22
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,500
Sure, but when we pick a paper next

23
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,640
If there's even a single person who have been there before

24
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,770
We just scrap that away and pick another one

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,430
Rules - If even a single one of them has been to the town they get, it's not valid

26
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,370
We can pick one of these, right?
- Yes

27
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,520
I think we all know Tokyo very well

28
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,890
Yeah, we can't do Tokyo

29
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,910
We would end up walking around somewhere we know

30
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,100
You're right
- Those are names of stations, right?

31
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,190
I know those of Tokyo

32
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,970
For example, let's see what happens

33
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,910
This is Tokyo's

34
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,880
Oh man, I don't think I've ever been to...

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,470
For example, I could be wrong, but...

36
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,810
We're gonna scrap this one later

37
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,980
See?

38
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,400
Senju-Ohashi

39
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,880
Where the hell is this?!

40
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,400
I've never heard it before

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,510
Never been there

42
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,640
It's in Adachi

43
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:35,970
Tokyo's prefecture, Adachi ward // Keisei Electric Railway - Senju-Ohashi station

44
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,760
I have no clue

45
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,000
I've heard "Senjuu" alone, like in North Senjuu's station

46
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,400
But this-- alright, let's scrap it

47
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,460
That can happen

48
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,420
Now I see

49
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,700
Let's choose who gets to choose

50
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,790
Ah, like this?

51
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,530
Shozo, then

52
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,440
Eh? Can I?

53
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,550
Sure, whatever

54
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,180
It's an important task

55
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,630
Well, if I have to choose...

56
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,880
It's fine

57
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,640
What about Kanagawa?

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,770
There's not many inside, but I haven't been there that much

59
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,090
Yeah, same here

60
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,720
Right, huh?

61
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,860
This should do it
- Kanagawa

62
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,080
We're doing Kanagawa!!

63
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,830
Remember, if you've been there already just say it

64
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,580
Let's go

65
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,050
My feet already hurt
- This one

66
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,560
Please, reveal it

67
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,800
No tricks or gimmicks here

68
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,110
I've only been in Yokohama

69
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,480
I wonder if I can read it...

70
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,610
That's an issue too

71
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,450
No way!!

72
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,620
No way we got this one!!

73
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,830
I wonder how...

74
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,260
It's Yokohama

75
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,240
I've been there before

76
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,010
Getting Yokohama... out of all of these?!

77
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,450
Not Yokohama, everybody has been there before right?

78
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,110
I have

79
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,110
I have

80
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,110
I have

81
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,300
If we were to choose its best 5

82
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,300
we would just loiter around its Chinatown

83
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,700
We can't do this one
- Right

84
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,560
What should we do? We can pick another one too

85
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
Oh, I see

86
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,220
We can move to Chiba too, or a different one

87
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,060
Let's stick to this

88
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,260
Alright then, let's see

89
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,680
This should be new

90
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,080
Yeah, I wonder...

91
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,440
Where?
- It's Shonan

92
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,240
Shounan-Fukasawa

93
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,560
That's famous too

94
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:19,240
Kanagawa's prefecture, Kamakura city // Shounan Monorail - Shounan-Fukasawa station

95
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,680
I mean, it's Shounan

96
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,020
I'm sure I've been there

97
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,260
Definitely

98
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,580
No doubts about it, you see

99
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,230
We also filmed Gaki in Shounan, once

100
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,530
You're right

101
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,470
Yeah, it's a famous spot

102
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,260
Whatever man, let's do this

103
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,430
It's here

104
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,240
I see

105
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,630
Are we doing this? Oh, look

106
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,170
We're mixing everything up?

107
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,730
Yeah, let's just do this

108
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,620
I think that's the best solution

109
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,080
It's best like this, we don't want this to look staged

110
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,550
Alright, let's do this

111
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,080
Now all the prefectures are mixed together

112
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,630
You go now, Hamada

113
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,080
Yes, it's Hamada's turn

114
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,290
Please

115
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,560
We're counting on you

116
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,560
Here's one from the center...

117
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,060
I wonder which prefecture it's gonna be

118
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,970
Right

119
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,490
Probably we wouldn't even know

120
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,300
Eh? Where is this?

121
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,360
"Shizu"

122
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,980
Is it in Chiba?

123
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,520
Is it read as "Shizu"?

124
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,960
staff) It's in Sakura town in Chiba

125
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,960
Sakura...

126
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,470
Sakura town in Chiba?

127
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,750
Never been there before

128
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,690
Me too, never

129
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,760
Which railway is it?

130
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,810
It's above Yuukari-ga-Oka station

131
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,200
Yuukari-ga-oka...?

132
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,200
I have no clue!

133
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,780
Alright, we're going here?

134
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,080
We have it

135
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,780
Let's go to Shizu!

136
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,540
Let's go and ask the best 5!

137
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,770
What are we supposed to do now?

138
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,190
1 week later

139
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,590
Alright guys

140
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,250
This is nice

141
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,360
We're in Shizu, Keisei line

142
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,600
Which is close to Sakura town in Chiba

143
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,300
That's where it is

144
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,200
This is nice

145
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:08,280
Keisei Electric Railway - Shizu Station (Chiba Prefecture, Sakura Town, North Shizu)
It's around 1 hour from Tokyo, and there's a lot of people who commute from here for work or school

146
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,550
I didn't want to say this, but...

147
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,550
You all have this dumb half-smile

148
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,670
No way

149
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,210
You're the one saying "this is nice" all the time, dude

150
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,110
But I mean it as "This town is nice, I like it" in a good way

151
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,560
But it feels like you're looking down on it

152
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,320
That's not true, it's 'cause it's sunny

153
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,220
At least try

154
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
It's not about trying

155
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,630
Today we're gonna ask the locals about this town

156
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,270
We're going to find out the best 5 of this place

157
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,150
Let's see what they'll recommend

158
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,620
We don't know anything

159
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,810
In order to know the 5th best recommendation, they're gonna start an interview before the station

160
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,960
It's time to ask the locals what Shizu has to offer

161
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,850
Let's see what's is on the 5th place

162
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,700
We can just ask anyone, right?

163
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,790
Oh, excuse me!

164
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,070
No, that's--- it's our staff

165
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,820
General manager - Suga Kenji

166
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,680
He's not a local

167
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,570
My mistake

168
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,270
He got embarrassed

169
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,270
his face was red all over!!

170
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,120
I wanted to see more

171
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,210
Are you a local?

172
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,380
He's not used to TV

173
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:11,890

174
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:18,460
Today our members are headed to Shizu in Chiba prefecture

175
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,840
To ask around the locals about the best 5 things in this city

176
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,240
First off, let's see what the locals

177
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,920
Suggest as the 5th best thing of Shizu

178
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,430
Should we ask those kids?

179
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,320
Definitely

180
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,630
Oh, here they are! Hi!

181
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,840
Can we ask you something?

182
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,330
Are you from the New York Yankees?

183
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,720
Are you locals?

184
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,690
Which base are you protecting?

185
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,690
Shut your trap

186
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,040
Are you students?

187
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,070
We are

188
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,580
What were you doing here?

189
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,880
We heard a rumor...

190
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,400
Mh?

191
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,400
Which rumor?

192
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,450
Like, someone was filming here

193
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,610
Oh? They all already knew it?

194
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,970
I wanted to meet you guys

195
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,190
So you came here to meet us?

196
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,010
My, thank you~

197
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,810
I see your nipples wanted to meet us too, they're standing for us

198
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,060
That's nice of them

199
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,060
Let's ask them first

200
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,340
So, we wanted to ask you recommendations about this town

201
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,790
We wanted to know what you think

202
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,750
We're looking for the 5th best thing

203
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,710
It's number 5

204
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,200
We want you to let us know the 5th best thing about this town

205
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,430
Number 5 is pretty hard

206
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,560
Yeah, 'cause there's a lot on top of it

207
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,560
You gotta calculate it

208
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,370
Just get a general idea of it

209
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,630
He was so quick to write, are you sure?

210
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,850
Yeah, I think so

211
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,560
Do we have our five?

212
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,550
Alright, let us see it

213
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,550
It's the curry shop

214
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,360
The curry shop is this town's 5th!

215
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,560
Why this generic answer---

216
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
I mean, there are surely loads of those

217
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,240
Like, the shop's name?

218
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,620
It's called Sathi

219
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,760
It's close, over there

220
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,760
It's run by a foreigner

221
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,640
So it's the real deal

222
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,450
He makes a naan

223
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,450
Like, this huge

224
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,330
Which curry is the best one?

225
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,510
Chicken curry

226
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,750
What about you?

227
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,050
My favorite is the shrimp curry

228
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,010
Shrimp curry

229
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,070
Very nice, don't you think guys?

230
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,760
Well, we just have to go

231
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,360
Are we going?

232
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,620
It's worth trying, isn't it?

233
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,450
Can you please lower that thing a bit?

234
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,220
Oh hey, it's the nipples...

235
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,170
Enough already!

236
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,510
That's enough

237
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,640
Thanks

238
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,800
We're going, then

239
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Thanks a bunch

240
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,470
And so they're heading to the recommended curry shop

241
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,710
There it is

242
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,860
Already?
- Yep, that's "Sathi"

243
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,560
Go ahead, Tanaka
- Sure

244
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,520
I'm gonna ask if it's ok to film

245
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:59,580
Cocorico goes inside to ask about the filming permission

246
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,430
First off, cocorico gets in to ask the owner for the shooting permission

247
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:06,890
Rules - if they won't get the filming permission, they'll have to ask someone else"

248
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,480
In case they won't be able to get it

249
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,370
They'll have to change their plans back from scratch

250
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,620
It's ok, yes
- Why are you saying it like that?

251
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,620
We can get in, it's fine

252
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,320
'Cause I was shocked

253
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,680
He said OK in a flash

254
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,600
Permission granted: time to get inside

255
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,580
Filming permission granted, it's time to get inside

256
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,890
Thanks for having us

257
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,160
They speak japanese just fine

258
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,960
Before making an order, they'll ask about the shop

259
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Can I ask your name, sir?

260
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,990
My name is Gimire Ganesh

261
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,000
Such an easy name to remember!!

262
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,100
Not at all

263
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,220
It's difficult

264
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,080
What's the meaning of this restaurant's name...?

265
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,730
The word "sathi" means "friend"

266
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,060
"Friend", huh...

267
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,680
I see, so it's "friends"...

268
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,160
Must have been hard currying  on the shop, yes?

269
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,470
It's not curry, it's carry

270
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,640
We're in a curry shop, you know

271
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,000
Ohh, is that so...

272
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,480
He has no idea what you're talking about

273
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,800
Have you ever been on TV before?

274
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,920
It's my first time

275
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,500
For how long have you been here in Japan?

276
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,440
I've been here for 7 years

277
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
And this shop is 5 years old

278
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,250
Oh, I see

279
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,760
So you've worked hard for 2 years to arrange this shop?

280
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,760
That's right

281
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
That's impressive

282
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,400
So, what are we taking?

283
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,670
Chicken curry

284
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,360
Yes

285
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,970
What did they tell us?
- It was...

286
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,360
Shrimp?

287
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,360
Shrimp?

288
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,970
Shrimp curry, chicken curry...

289
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,570
One of each please

290
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,590
Check this out, isn't this amazing?

291
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,430
That's made of spinach

292
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,330
That's why it's green

293
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,540
Yeah but those guys said shrimp curry, so...

294
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Why don't you wanna eat the recommended one?

295
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,470
He's right, stick to the plan

296
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,680
Those two for now

297
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
I agree with that

298
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,580
Right?

299
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,630
That's right

300
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,190
What can I say, I'm really enjoying this fuss we're making

301
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,580
You're having fun, aren't you?

302
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,560
That's not it

303
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,980
We gotta stick to our recommendations

304
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,570
Alright, shrimp curry was it?

305
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,780
And a chicken curry

306
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,670
We all wanna eat the chicken one, right?

307
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,650
Alright, thanks so much

308
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,430
Thanks

309
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,950
While they wait for the curry, Matsumoto talks about something...

310
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,290
As they wait for their order, Matsumoto tells us something...

311
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,800
If I'd be walking around Amagasaki (birthplace)...

312
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,550
And suddenly a TV celebrity would come

313
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,680
And ask me what's the 5th best thing here it'd be hard

314
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,670
What about the beef shop?

315
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,240
Ah, you mean Yamazato Hormon?

316
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:46,840
A shop run by a Downtown's former classmate - "YAMAZATO HORMON"

317
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,440
I think that's... 12th in rank

318
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,090
Make it fifth at least!

319
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,240
I don't know about that

320
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,320
There's a lot of exhaust gas in that shop

321
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,680
You even said its name

322
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,700
Just make it fifth and we're good

323
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,740
It uses gas to grill meat, it's dangerous

324
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,000
That's why

325
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,440
Thanks for waiting, here's the shrimp curry

326
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,340
That's so big

327
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,080
That's a huge naan!

328
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,350
They said it was

329
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,320
Look at that naan

330
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:02,800
Shrimp Curry - 700 yen (plus tax)

331
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,120
It looks really tasty...

332
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,180
That's incredible

333
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,730
This is...?
- The shrimp one

334
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,200
You go first, Hamada

335
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,190
What the-

336
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,350
Why me?

337
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,010
It's fine, just go

338
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,590
He's right

339
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,660
That's hot!!

340
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,810
Of course it is

341
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,810
Why shouldn't it be?

342
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,810
I can't eat this now!

343
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,850
I think it's not as hot on this side

344
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,030
You sure?

345
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,270
Well, it's not as crispy here

346
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,040
Shoot, it's hot, it's hot all over

347
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,660
How about this part?

348
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,640
You mean here?

349
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,640
It's hot!!

350
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,590
Everywhere I touch it's hot

351
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,600
I think this one's cold though

352
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,830
No way this is cold--

353
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,340
Hot!!

354
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,400
He completely fell for it

355
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,970
Thanks for the show

356
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,280
Thanks

357
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,120
It's freshly made

358
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,660
Of course it is

359
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,800
Let's eat

360
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,120
Let's slip the naan

361
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,020
It's sweet

362
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,020
Sweet?

363
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,920
I can feel it

364
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,440
It's so good

365
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,120
You're right, it's really good

366
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:10,230
second suggestion
Shrimp Curry - 700 yen (plus tax)

367
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,570
And here's their second suggestion

368
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,880
The chicken curry

369
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,040
I like this

370
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,370
Do you want one more wet towel?

371
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,970
Which one is better?

372
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,900
It's really good!

373
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,950
It's not even that spicy

374
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,670
It's good, isn't it?

375
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,350
I think it's delicious

376
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,860
Yeah, just barely spicy

377
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,240
It's not one of those which make you sweat

378
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,180
I think this one is way better

379
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,070
That's what that kid told us, go for the chicken

380
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,400
He was right
- So good!

381
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,680
That was really good

382
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,650
It's unfair to put this only at 5th place

383
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,770
I agree

384
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,770
You're right

385
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,130
This could have been higher to me

386
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,500
But yeah, we were looking for the 5th place...

387
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,660
Right, we can't only rely on food

388
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,790
That's the problem, yeah

389
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,850
We should think about who to ask next

390
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,320
Right

391
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,000
Isn't there, like... a sort of spot for tourists?

392
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,600
Like, a place someone would say "you have to go there"?

393
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,880
I mean...
- Something like that

394
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,940
1st place should be a hot spring or such

395
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,940
Sounds nice

396
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,940
Is there a hot spring in here?

397
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,670
I bet there is

398
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,890
We're in Japan, they're everywhere

399
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,010
Everywhere?

400
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,310
Are you sure?

401
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,470
We'd be screwed if they would be everywhere!!

402
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,520
That's not normal

403
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,730
It's fine, trust me

404
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,280
I wonder if there is one

405
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,990
They were all satisfied about the curry's taste

406
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,680
Thanks for the meal, mr. Sathi!

407
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,580
And so, the 5th best recommended place of Shizu is confirmed to be Sathi

408
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,530
And now they're back at asking the locals to find out the 4th place

409
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,480
Excuse me, good morning

410
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,670
Good morning

411
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,750
Are you from Shizu?

412
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,620
I'm from the next town!

413
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,040
Ah, is that so?

414
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,280
It's fine

415
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,770
What were you doing here?

416
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,290
There's a market beyond the station

417
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,080
There?

418
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,280
Yes, it's mostly for handmade stuff

419
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,880
It's held once every month

420
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,940
Is that fried tofu?

421
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,490
Fried tofu?

422
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,490
On your mouth...

423
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,290
It's a mask

424
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,620
Sorry about him

425
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,370
Sorry, I didn't get it at first!

426
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,800
It kinda looks like it

427
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,850
I see

428
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,640
Tanaka, please

429
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,680
Alright, so...

430
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,050
We're currently looking for

431
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,880
The best 5 things in Shizu, by asking the locals

432
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,240
We were wondering if you could tell us the 4th best one

433
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,280
Not the 5th, 3rd, 2nd or 1st...

434
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,170
Like, some place you would enjoy going to or such

435
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,820
Leaving aside the rest of them...

436
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,950
Not the others?

437
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,290
Like, if you came to Shizu there would be this, this and this...

438
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,080
If you came to Shizu...

439
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,290
One thing, let's try not to include restaurants or such

440
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,290
Something like a park or such...

441
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,590
A park?

442
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,830
Yeah, like a place you can go to

443
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,640
A giraffe...

444
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,130
There's a park with a lion in it, right?

445
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,930
Sounds nice

446
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,200
Really?

447
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,910
Where is it?

448
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,020
Not a real one, right?

449
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,170
No, it's not real

450
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,130
Alright, let's go then

451
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,680
Where is it?

452
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,860
Where can we find it?

453
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,620
It's called Southern Shizu Park? Maybe?

454
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,890
Can we reach it by walk?

455
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,480
It's really close by car

456
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,440
It's on the other side

457
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,540
Of Dotonbori, the okonomiyaki shop

458
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,160
I remembered, it's Southern Yukari Park

459
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,160
But that's part of Yukari-ga-Oka...

460
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,410
Oh no, it's fine

461
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,190
Eh? In Shizu?

462
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,520
But it's fine

463
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,820
Do you have any idea?

464
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,040
Oh, it's fine, don't worry

465
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,060
It's good

466
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,400
Thanks so much

467
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,980
And so, they get in the car

468
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,430
To reach their 4th best place: Yukari Southern Park

469
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,670
They said there's a giraffe here

470
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,360
I wonder how it is...

471
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,800
So, it's a park in Yukari-ga-Oka

472
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,600
It's incredible we got away from its station only at number 4

473
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:09,940
How about we go back and do the same thing again?

474
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,250
One more time?

475
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,520
That's not the plan

476
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:17,980
broadcast of 10/23/2016
Can we shoot the same footage 3 times!?

477
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,860
That's another episode

478
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,250
That's impossible

479
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,090
No thanks

480
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,800
That was exhausting

481
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,250
But that was hella fun, wasn't it?

482
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,770
It was

483
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,280
No one ever told me it was, though

484
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,680
Really? It was fun...

485
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,980
I think so too, but no one seems to agree

486
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,910
Not even a single soul

487
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,610
Told me they had fun watching it

488
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,030
Really?

489
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,410
Well, yeah, sadly...

490
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,020
It didn't work out, I guess

491
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:49,810
broadcast of 10/03/2016
Hot Blooded! Hamada's Cram School 4

492
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,720
Can't say the same for Tanaka's performance on Hamada's cram school

493
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,640
Look at that new building

494
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,820
Looks so out of place
- Yeah...

495
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,490
It's all empty around it!!

496
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,490
Is it?

497
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,560
Oh, he's right

498
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,490
There's nothing around
- Told you

499
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,880
Maybe this town is gonna prosper more in the future

500
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,170
It's called Yukari-ga-Oka, huh?

501
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,770
Places named Something-ga-Oka are always like this

502
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,090
Can you name another place with that name?

503
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,210
Huh?

504
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,910
Shut the fuck up, Endo!!

505
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,060
He's in such a bad mood

506
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,470
He got so angry in a blink of an eye

507
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,460
He totally snapped

508
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,070
Yeah but

509
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,410
I only wanted to know more, that's it

510
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,110
This guy is crazy

511
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,810
I always wanted to do the "shut up" thing

512
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,460
It's pretty far

513
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,330
Yeah, I thought it'd be closer

514
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,440
I think we're close

515
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,500
Are we sure the giraffe and lion are worth all of this?

516
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,050
I was wondering what the giraffe and lion actually are

517
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,330
What do you mean?

518
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,590
I mean, they could be an animal-shaped slide...

519
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,880
Or? What else?

520
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,800
Enough of those---

521
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,130
There are also jungle gyms, aren't they?

522
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,810
Giraffe-shaped jungle gyms

523
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,500
A giraffe jungle gym?

524
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,330
What do you think, Tanaka?

525
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,390
I don't think that's the case

526
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,020
I'm asking for your opinion

527
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,970
He's getting hard to approach

528
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,200
Okonomiyaki shop
"Dotonbori"

529
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,790
She said it was outside Dotonbori

530
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,250
The okonomiyaki shop

531
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,050
It's way bigger...

532
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,420
...Than expected

533
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,410
Oh! I see the lion!

534
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,800
Coming next - they just found the recommended lion?!

535
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,060
It's already here?

536
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,790
I can see the giraffe and lion!

537
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,360
They start moving to the next place

538
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,790
The suggested 4th position

539
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,870
The park with the lion and giraffe!

540
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,490
Is it going to be worth of place number 4?

541
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,190
Okonomiyaki shop
"Dotonbori"

542
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,790
She said it was outside Dotonbori

543
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,230
The okonomiyaki shop

544
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,030
It's way bigger...

545
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
...Than expected

546
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,400
Oh! I see the lion!

547
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,390
It's already here?

548
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,770
The giraffe too!

549
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,620
And here we are

550
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,930
It's just as they said

551
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,450
They quickly head towards the lion object

552
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,550
Here it is

553
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,560
This is impressive

554
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,610
It's a female

555
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,490
A lioness, huh

556
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,600
Isn't it great?

557
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,580
It's a female, right Tanaka?

558
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,630
Yes, and it's well done

559
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,810
They also take a look at the giraffe

560
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,120
And they're having more fun than expected

561
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,530
And so, the fourth best place of Shizu

562
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,430
Is confirmed to be Yuukari-ga-Oka's animal park

563
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,640
Here in Yuukari-ga-Oka's southern park

564
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,720
There are roughly 2.1 hectares of field

565
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,670
And there are lots of games and lawns inside it

566
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,140
It's a popular park between the locals

567
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,710
And now, they venture again inside the park

568
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,670
To ask about the third best place

569
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,680
Maybe we should ask a young woman? Like the one we asked before

570
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,010
How about a dad?

571
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,780
How about asking a kid?

572
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,480
Nice

573
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,680
How about them?

574
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,280
I think we should try to

575
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,070
Grade schoolers?

576
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,250
Hey, hello!

577
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,710
Hi! Can we ask something?

578
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,820
We can...
- Can we?

579
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,380
We can have Tanaka

580
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,730
Deal with them

581
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,150
Countin' on ya

582
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,450
How old are you?

583
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,440
10 years old

584
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,160
10? So you're a fourth grader?

585
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,530
Ohh

586
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,420
Where do you leave?

587
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,520
Over there

588
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,920
There?

589
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,940
Say, can I borrow this helmet for a while?

590
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,960
What were you doing--

591
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,240
What are you doing?

592
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,860
You took it already!

593
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,030
That's not good

594
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,710
Alright, we're currently asking the locals

595
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,650
About the best places of this town, Shizu

596
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,820
And now we've already asked the 5th and 4th best place

597
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,090
What's the next place if we go higher?

598
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,680
We're looking for the third best place

599
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,520
Even a thing kids love is fine

600
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,010
But first, can I borrow this thermos for a while?

601
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,600
This guy is an hassle, isn't him?

602
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,880
His face says "piss off"

603
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,240
Well, he deserves it

604
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,480
Now they hate you

605
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,770
You made two enemies

606
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,460
They're like "what's his deal?"

607
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,130
Alright, I admit my defeat

608
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,340
Anything's fine, really

609
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,200
Like, places you visited with your parents...

610
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,840
That's right

611
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,750
With your mom and dad

612
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,790
How about you tell me the code number for this?

613
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,790
Nope, right?

614
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,630
That's a key, it's important

615
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,760
Ignore him

616
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,850
They hate you

617
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,980
Are we gonna--

618
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,360
Oh, what is it?

619
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,650
Aqua

620
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,060
What is this "aqua"?

621
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:27,220
It's a place with a pool, and a public bath...

622
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,220
that's it

623
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,330
A place with a pool and a public bath?

624
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,010
Aqua, right?

625
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,330
Is that so? Is it close?

626
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,650
Is it near the bowling alley we just passed?

627
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,750
Yes, it is

628
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,890
Is it here?

629
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,680
That means it's close

630
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,770
We should try to go there

631
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,200
Sorry for this, thank you!

632
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,360
Keep your eyes open

633
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,700
They move back to the car

634
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,000
So they can head to the third place

635
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,980
A place with a bath and a pool as suggested by the kids

636
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,830
As soon as we got in the car, they followed us

637
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,240
They must be scared of you, Hamada

638
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,450
No way

639
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,060
I think if I was a grade schooler

640
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,060
And I'd saw your face I'd be traumatized

641
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,920
Why the hell?!

642
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,210
I didn't do anything

643
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,520
That's the scary part

644
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:18,750
The fact you say "I didn't do anything"

645
00:23:18,750 --> 00:24:09,780
