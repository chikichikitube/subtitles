00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,880
Any words?

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,010
Right

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,480
Yeah I thought about it and there is actually one

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,730
Yamazaki Housei

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:24,750
For real?

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,580
Yeah, in the end it was

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,550
"Cutlet Curry" (katsu karee)

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,290
KATSU KAREE
(cutlet curry)

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,290
Limit Series 4th Episode:

14
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,520
This summer curry was like a trend,

15
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,580
you know that uhhh... stamina

16
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,970
Yeah yeah, I got your point

17
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,290
you know, that thing

18
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,890
We can't afford not to do this, right?

19
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,460
Exactly

20
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,730
The first challenge was Ice Coffee

21
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,070
They accepted the challenge to order it by changing the order's name to "Ouyan Fifi"

22
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,070
I'm ordering an Ouyan Fifi

23
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,730
...Excuse me?

24
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,040
Ah, an Ouyan Fifi, please

25
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
An Ouyan Iced Coffee

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,340
An ice..?

27
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,840
Is an ice coffee okay?

28
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,110
Yeah

29
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,980
Following this, they faced the challenge to order Chilled Chinese Noodles by saying "Suzuki Kyouka"

30
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,480
Uhm...

31
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,650
A Suzuki Kyouka

32
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,020
"Sui"...?

33
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,990
Suzuki Kyouka

34
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,990
Steamed buns (sui gyouza), right?

35
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,490
Then, Steamed buns (sui gyouza)

36
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,000
You just ordered steamed buns!

37
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,770
And as the third round, they tried to order a pack of Mild Seven by saying "Micheal Tomioka" instead

38
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,600
Do you sell cigarettes in here?

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,410
Yes, which do you want?

40
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,510
A pack of Micheal Tomioka

41
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,710
Are there some Micheal Tomiokas?

42
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,980
There aren't

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,420
Episode 4
Getting closer to the limits of "Katsu Karee"

44
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,320
This time round they'll test out the limits of "katsu karee" (Cutlet Curry)

46
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,000
The challenge has come yet again!

47
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,030
Cocorico
Endo Shouzo Tanaka Naoki

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,200
Yeah it did

49
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,370
Let's take a look

50
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,570
I really have a bad feeling about this

51
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,770
Well, let's take a look at them, shall we?

52
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,070
"Well done!" (otsukare)

53
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,310
Yeah, this could work, it sound close to the actual word

54
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,310
Here's the second one

55
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,310
"I'll kick your butt!" (ketsu kere)

56
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,550
Shouldn't it be "ketsu keré"?

57
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:10,480
＊Hamada is pointing out that Matsumoto said "ketsu kere" stretching the last "e" (a short vowel) to make it sound like the "e" in "katsu karee" (a long vowel)

58
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,280
"I'll kick your buuutt!" (ketsu keree)

59
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,690
You know, a way of saying it as if shouting it

60
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,790
It's just a different way of saying it

61
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,620
Like "I'll kick yourr butt!!" with a short vowel won't just work

62
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,590
Got it

63
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,590
"I'll kick your buuutt!"

64
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,290
With that being said, the next one is uh...

65
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,290
"Katsushin"

66
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,290
＊It may refer to a samurai portrayed in many books / novels

67
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,310
It's a bit different, right?

68
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,310
I think this one is a bit though

69
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,930
Definitely a though one

70
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,760
Next one is...

71
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,760
Kangaroo (kangaruu)

72
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,740
I'm guessing this was kind of forced in

73
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,610
Well, that's because from this point it gets hard

74
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,180
Makes sense

75
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,480
Then we have "Kahimi Karie"

76
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,480
＊A famous japanese singer

77
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,180
It's not even close!

78
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,480
Kahimi Karie...

79
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,290
The next one is

80
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,730
"Fried pig thing with indian spices"

81
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,360
This one is a bit different

82
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,280
But I think the meaning will be conveyed enough

83
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,400
Ohh, yeah, that could do

84
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,910
And then our last one

85
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,100
Otsuka Nene

86
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,100
＊A japanese actress & photographer

87
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,670
So that's all

88
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,340
Ok
Ok

89
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:01,840
Dismissed!

90
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
Ok, we're going

91
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,610
How far

92
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,420
Is a katsu karee (cutlet curry) a katsu karee?

93
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,540
Let's go find out!

94
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,350
Katsu Karee's Limits

95
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,350
~study results~

96
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,880
OTSUKARE

"Well done!"

97
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,720
Uhm... I'll have

98
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,960
An OTSUKARE ("Well done!")

99
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,890
A katsu karee cutlet curry)?

100
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,360
Yes, please

101
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,150
Apparently "otsukare" ("Well done!")
works fine!

102
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,990
Right!

103
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,230
OTSUKARE = OK

104
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,720
KETSU KERE

"I'll kick your butt"

105
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,230
Uhm...

106
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,600
I'll have a ketsu kere ("I'll kick your butt")

107
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,430
Come again?

108
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,940
He straight up said "ketsu keré" (long vowel)

109
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,680
Sir!? Did you say "katsu karee" (cutlet curry)?

110
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,300
Sir!? Did you say "katsu karee" (cutlet curry)?

111
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:34,910
I'll have a ketsu kere ("I'll kick your butt")

112
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,910
Okay, one katsu karee (cutlet curry)!!

113
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,580
KETSU KERE = OK

114
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,810
Awesome!
It works fine!

115
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,060
KAKU-GARI

"Crew cut"

116
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,880
Excuse me

117
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,680
Can I have a large serving of kaku-gari (crew cut)

118
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,620
Sure                              Ok

119
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,380
"gari" and "karii"
sounds alike

120
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,690
Then a large serving, please

121
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,890
It's going so well!

122
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,990
It was no
problem at all!

123
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,590
This kaku-gari (crew cut) is delicious!

124
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,660
Is it?

125
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,530
Thanks a lot

126
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,680
KAKU-GARI = OK

127
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,180
KATSU-SHIN

128
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,180
I'll going with a...

129
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,980
Katsu-Shin

130
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,640
Uh?

131
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,080
a Katsu-Shin!

132
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,510
"Katsu-shin"
is just...

133
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,860
Uhh?

134
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,640
I'll have a ketsu kere ("I'll kick your butt")

135
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,380
A ketsu-keree ("I'll kick your butt") please

136
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,180
A katsu-karee (cutlet curry)!

137
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,680
KATSU-SHIN = FAIL


KETSU KEREE = OK

138
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,210
He just fixed
it anew!

139
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,210
KANE KASE

"Lend me some money"

140
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,420
Uhm...

141
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,900
kane kase ("lend me some money")

142
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,050
...Sorry?!

143
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,190
Okay so uhm...

144
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,700
kane kure ("give me some money")

145
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,830
Uh!?

146
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,340
You mean katsu kare...?

147
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,100
Kane kure ("give me some money")

148
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,630
Is katsu karee okay?

149
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,240
KANE KASE = FAIL


KANE KURE = OK

150
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,010
He changed to
"kane kure" which sounds closer

151
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,340
Ah! Now I get it!

152
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,800
HAIGO-REI

"A ghost behind you"

153
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,440
I'll have a...

154
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,440
Haigo-rei (a ghost behind you)

155
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,050
A wakadori curry?

156
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,450
＊A variety of curry with chicken cutlet

157
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,950
He heard "wakadori"

158
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,950
A haigo-rei (a ghost behind you)

159
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,850
One of it, please

160
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,550
A wakadori, was it?

161
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,050
HAIGO-REI = FAIL

162
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,510
KANGAROO

163
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,900
Then I'll have a kangaroo!

164
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,900
What?

165
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,760
Well, it's not on our menu

166
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,580
For real?!

167
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,470
Just choose what you want by pointing at it with your finger

168
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,440
Then I'll have a small serving

169
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,180
So, is a small serving of beef curry okay to you?

170
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,180
No, no, you got it wrong

171
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,480
A kangaroo

172
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,730
Which one is it?

173
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,150
They must have
thought he's a
complete idiot

174
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,150
This one!

175
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,380
Yamazaki points it on the menu

176
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,990
Cutlet Curry (katsu karee), Okay!

177
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,080
KANGAROO = FAIL

178
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,560
KAHIMI KARIE

179
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,930
One serving of Kahimi Karie...

180
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,890
Uh...

181
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,160
Wait a moment, please

182
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:42,670
Sure

183
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,670
KAHIMI KARIE = FAIL

184
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,280
Second Challenge!!

185
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,810
I'll have a  Kahimi Karie...

186
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,380
Please, choose from the menu

187
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,880
Okay

188
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,750
This one's a no, uh
Looks like it

189
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,280
Once you're done just let me know!

190
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:55,980
Got it

191
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,250
KAHIMI KARIE = DOUBLE FAIL

192
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,780
BUTA-AGE INDO KARA-MESHI

"Fried pig thing with indian spices"

193
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,480
I'll have...

194
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,120
A fried pig thing with indian spices

195
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,520
Mhh!?

196
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,720
He said it
so clearly!

197
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,150
Fried pig thing with indian spices

198
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,260
The employee laughs as he's confused

199
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,880
Fried pig thing with indian spices!

200
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,580
Fried pig thing with indian spices!

201
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,580
Fried indian pig...

202
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,340
Fried pig thing with indian spices = FAIL

203
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,860
OTSUKA NENE

204
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,980
I'll have a Otsuka Nene

205
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,480
What?

206
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,910
Otsuka Nene

207
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,820
Uh? Which one is it?

208
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,180
Otsuka Nene.

209
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,490
There's no such curry in here, sir...

210
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,530
Otsuka Nene.

211
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,760
His voice is
getting softer

212
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,830
I'm really sorry, can you please point that out on our menu?

213
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,860
See, it comes to this
if it's not clear enough
Yeah...

214
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,200
He straight up
refused to point it
out on the menu!

215
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,240
Oh, he's leaving

216
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,470
What the hell!

217
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,940
I just wanted
to get out!

218
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,480
It was so long
I started feeling nervous!

219
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,750
Now the poor
employee will
think he made
a customer mad!

220
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,630
OTSUKA NENE = FAIL

221
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,150
Though this one was close enough (kane kase), its sorrounding didn't make it, like this "katsu-shin"

222
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,290
Yeah, "Katsu-shin" was nowhere close to it

223
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,550
Well, is that

224
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,990
The "katsu" part is ok, but "karee" and "shin" are absolutely different, aren't them?

225
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,460
Yeah, you're right

226
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,760
You can't possibly deceive someone with it!

227
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,500
I was positive that "Otsuka Nene" would make it, though

228
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,180
But there were only three words that worked perfectly

229
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,770
Yeah
3 of them
Yup

230
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,340
Okay so, moving on

231
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,120
Uhh... starting from now

232
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,640
Hamada-san

233
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,010
Yeah

234
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:35,880
Let's go

235
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,210
Good luck!
Please!
Good luck!

236
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,150
What are we using?

237
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,150
Let's aim even higher

238
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,150
It's this one, uh...

239
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,760
"Totsuka yotto sukuuru" (Totsuka Yacht School)

240
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,760
＊As the name suggests, it's a famous japanese Yacht School

241
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,620
No way, that's impossible!

242
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,560
Yeah, he's right!

243
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,990
No way it's gonna work!

244
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,930
That's a little too harsh!

245
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,430
This one can do the trick

246
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,430
I really think this one is going to work

247
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,900
The "TotsuKA" section is like a rougher version of "Katsu"

248
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,530
No way, no way

249
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,140
You know, "totsu-KA" - "Katsu KA"

250
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,640
See?

251
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,640
I really doubt it though...

252
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,410
And so, Downtown are now moving towards a curry shop

253
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,180
Will they be able to order a Cutlet Curry (katsu karee) by saying "Totsuka Yotto Sukuuru" (Totsuka Yacht School)?

254
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,220
I'll have a beef curry

255
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,530
Is everyone ordering a beef curry?

256
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,190
Uhm...

257
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,990
Ok, I'm going for the beef curry too

258
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,280
Excuse me, I'll have a...

259
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,730
Totsuka Yottsu ka~re~ (totsuka yacht cu~rry~)

260
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:33,480
＊Matsumoto nervously changes "yatsu sukuuru" to "yatsu karee". Also, from this point onwards he starts stuttering his order / speaking in a weird accent

261
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,200
A Totsuka Yo---

262
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,540
A Tots-

263
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,680
A Totsuka yotto sukareeru (Totsuka Yacht Schurry)

264
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,680
What is he sayin'?

265
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,080
Excuse me, can I order?

266
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,880
Sure

267
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,880
I'd like

268
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,060
A Totsuka yottsu karee (Totsuka Yotts Curry)

269
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,480
An employee stares oddly at Matsumoto

270
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,230
Oh, is it forbidden to smoke in here?

271
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,870
Is it forbidden to smoke in here?

272
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,900
No, it's okay

273
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,900
Then I'll have a Totsuka yotto sukaree (Totsuka Yacht Schoorr)

274
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,610
A Totsuka yottsu karee (Totsuka Yotts Curry)

275
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,610
＊Matsumoto is speaking in a foreign accent for some reasons

276
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,610
No one is playing along with Matsumoto

277
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,380
A Totsuka yottsu karee (Totsuka Yotts Curry)

278
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,810
He has completely switched to "curry"

279
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,650
Totsuka Tsuyotto Sukaruu Karee (???)

280
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,430
Enough!

281
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,230
He just left

282
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,230
TOTSUKA YOTTO SUKUURU = FAIL

283
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,360
What the hell!

284
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,870
Enough!

285
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,100
But why?

286
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,810
I didn't like this outcome!

287
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,740
How was it?
Was it good?

288
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,000
Come on, man!
That was fast!

289
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,880
It didn't work at all!

290
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,480
The mood wasn't okay!

291
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,510
What happened?
What was it?

292
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,510
No one dared to play along with me!

293
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,810
At least you were able to say it?

294
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,610
Of course I did, countless times!

295
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,190
They just ignored my messages

296
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,450
But I think that it MAY actually could have done it

297
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,960
Because you know I made lots of words that worked fine

298
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,190
As if they did!

299
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,390
All I did was being left here waiting!

300
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,990
That's 'cause it wasn't working!

301
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,730
The mood was off!

302
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,030
That's exactly why

303
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,470
What the hell, man

304
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,100
We'll uhhh

305
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,370
Just say that it was a failure!

306
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,940
No, don't just say "failure"

307
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,940
There's no reason to say it was a failure

308
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,070
But you didn't succeed!

309
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,800
Just don't say "failure"

310
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,010
Don't say it anymore

311
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,010
Woah, ok, I won't say it

312
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,880
We'll have this fixing our outcome

313
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,780
Yeah

314
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,780
CHAGE & ASKA

315
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,850
＊A popular J-pop duo

316
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,220
This one starts already weird with that "CHA"

317
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,520
I think this one may get the shop manager pissed off

318
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,590
This one

319
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,490
Is up to you!

320
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,490
What the hell!

321
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,190
I've always being the main supporter of all of this

322
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,190
Why me?

323
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,130
Now I'm just sick of it!

324
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,280
So they move to yet another restaurant

325
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,000
And this time Matsumoto, Cocorico and Yamazaki will support Hamada

326
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,310
Will Hamada be able to order a Cutlet Curry (katsu karee) by saying "CHAGE & ASKA?"

327
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,810
Let's see...

328
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,410
I'll have a CHAGE & ASKA

329
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,410
＊Hamada isn't pronouncing it right on purpose in order to (try to) make it sound closer to "katsu karee"

330
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,410
What!?

331
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,280
Uhmm... uh..

332
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,180
Wait a moment, please

333
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,320
Come on, just order something

334
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,450
Ok, ok

335
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,120
Uhmm, ok, Lady!

336
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,660
A CHAGE & ASKAre

337
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,660
＊Hamada adds "re" to make "ASKA" sound closer to "KARE"

338
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,130
What is he saying!?

339
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,160
Wha-

340
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,490
Excuse me!

341
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,030
What is it?

342
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,600
CHAGE & ASKAre

343
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,900
Rice Curry!? No, it's not it, right?

344
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,330
Rice Curry!? No, it's not it, right?

345
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,100
Right, no

346
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,700
Is it dry curry?

347
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,100
CHAGE & ASKAre!

348
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,380
I can't understand what you're saying!

349
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,380
Can you pronounce it more clearly?

350
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,010
Oh, I'm sorry

351
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,880
What's that!

352
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,250
CHAGE & ASSKASSKAREE!

353
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,910
That's what I don't understand!

354
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,880
Say it clearly!

355
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,390
Is it rice curry?

356
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,160
You know, this guy wants that...

357
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,960
CHAGE & ASSKATSU-KAREE

358
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:58,070
