1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,330
You've accepted your role as Mr. Meat!

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,360
Food Marathon #4
Yakiniku Toraji 25 Store Challenge

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,860
They choose one item from a menu of 25 at each store

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,150
There's a 100,000 yen prize waiting if they finish

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,300
If anyone gives up though, they have pay for all the food eaten thus fart

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,460
Starting in Ginza 8-chome, they've cleared 10 stores

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,460
Just 15 stores remain

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,670
Will they be able to finish this time?
The second part starts now!

9
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:53,490
Typset by GakiDave
Translation by senor_wristband

10
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,790
There's 15 stores left

11
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,020
Can you guys bring in a substitute?

12
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,640
A substitute?

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,870
You could ask "Garage Sale"

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,870
Garage Sale?

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,570
Garage, or NEGO6,

16
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:22,260
Garage Sale

17
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:22,260
NEGO6

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,570
What can NEGO6 do?

19
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,460
Someone like Hello Keisuke

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:22,260
Hello Keisuke

21
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,260
Why did you include Garage Sale with those guys?

22
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,500
Shall we decide the item for the next store?

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,860
Let's try the Specialty Salted Tongue

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,990
Let's cross that one off

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,340
Part 2 starts with the New Employee Store in Ikebukoru

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,200
They still aim to clear 25 stores

27
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,340
It's hella spacious.

28
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,680
Ikebukoru is hella spacious

29
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,080
Natural light is nice

30
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,080
Very nice

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,640
Have you decided on the specialty Salted Tongue?

32
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:08,700
It's the most popular dish here

33
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,700
This is number 1?

34
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,020
Your Salted Tongue is here

35
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,820
Toraji Specialty, Salted Tongue
Season with salt and cumin, an explosion of umami

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,320
Someone needs to eat the extra one

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,970
Let's do Rock Paper Scissors

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,100
Rock, Paper, Scissors ...

39
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,000
Ahh that was close

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No, it's just you two

41
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,550
We all put out a rock

42
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,150
That makes no sense, that's dumb,

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,920
Then I win cause I have scissors

44
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,900
Now that makes no sense

45
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,900
Do it again

46
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,780
So it's Matsumoto-san then

47
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,430
This is the most popular one right?

48
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,690
The most popular indeed

49
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,100
Up until now, everyone has eaten 13 pieces
They still find it easy

50
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,710
Hamada-san, how is your stomach doing?

51
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,410
Well, for now, I'll stay with you

52
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:16,020
TN: Unclear about this line

53
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,020
Are you some lead actor who found a new love?!

54
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,890
"I'll stay with you for now"

55
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,040
Tongue is pretty small

56
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,600
Finished!

57
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,800
Let's move on

58
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,740
They get to rest on the drive there,

59
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,280
However, for one man this is not enough...

60
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,080
Digging in to that Reimen there ...

61
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,280
It was like I was a big league person

62
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,400
I was slurping them down, right?

63
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,900
And Endo's white rice, I think that was bold

64
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,900
Thanks.

65
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,300
"This kid's got moxxy"

66
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,760
"He just doesn't have any presence"

67
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,080
In response to Matsumoto's challenge,

68
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,410
One man rises to the occasion

69
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,460
Anyone ordering from the side menu?

70
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,320
I'll have the galbi gukbap.

71
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,320
Galbi gukbap!

72
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,230
Let's succeed here

73
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,230
Very nice

74
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,280
Pork Jowl and Galbi Gukbap please!

75
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,610
He's a Tough Guy

76
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,380
This is the Iberian pork jowl, seasoned with lemon and a side of wasabi

77
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,760
Iberian Pig  Pork Jowl
An exquisite combination of meat and fat

78
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,660
Who will eat the extra here?

79
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,660
I'll do it

80
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:09,170
If you can make it past this, you'll get a Lipotovan D advertisement deal

81
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:09,170
TN: Lipotovan D is an energy drink

82
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,170
For real?

83
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,780
His "Tough Guy" image is too strong

84
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,780
It's just too strong

85
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,300
The fatty pork jowl is a real burden to their stomachs

86
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,300
And then...

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,850
This is tough

88
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,890
Tough?

89
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,000
You said it very clearly

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,800
He did just say it
"This is tough"

91
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,160
No no no
I mean the wasabi, putting too much makes it a challenge to eat

92
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,900
I was just taken aback

93
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,380
Can we see the difficulty start to show?

94
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,320
However...

95
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,760
Here it is, Kalbi Gukbap

96
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,980
Kalbi Gukbap here

97
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,750
This looks amazing.

98
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,050
You'll get the lead role in "Ore No Sora"

99
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,050
You're kidding me!

100
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,620
A regular Yasuda Ippei

101
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,520
Yama-san, do you wanna help him out?

102
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,780
I don't

103
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,720
Mr. MeatLover then

104
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,720
I'll have a little then

105
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,420
Then I'll have some too then

106
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,420
Let's all finish this

107
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,580
I think I'll have some too

108
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,700
The second half has started it seem

109
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,120
Like "let's work together"

110
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,630
Is this much OK?

111
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah no need to hold back

112
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,570
The spiciness is perfect

113
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,400
What about you Zaki-san?

114
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,760
I'm good

115
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:47,540
When Tanaka put this in it broke my heart

116
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,540
Huge!

117
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,340
Such a massive piece

118
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,400
But still, the members eat with vigor

119
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,840
Finished!

120
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,700
However, a dark cloud looms over this challenge...

121
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,800
Actually, how are you guys feeling?

122
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,400
In terms of the broadcast

123
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,010
We need to figure out how to end this

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,010
Just the ending

125
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,240
Maybe one of us can pretend to collapse

126
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,550
But that might be a bother for Toraji,

127
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,290
I guess a sprain is our best option

128
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,530
As soon as you get off the car, go like "OW!"

129
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:42,080
It just depends if anyone will fall for this shitty acting

130
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,900
I think Endo can do it

131
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,530
You did say he doesn't have any presence in his works

132
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,580
Finally, he has a chance to shine

133
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,400
You never know what chance will come...

134
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,640
I might stand out this time

135
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,080
Putting aside the Food Marathon, Endo takes on a new challenge

136
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,320
The car reaches the 13th store in Shinjiku

137
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,020
How will Endo's acting turn out?

138
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,980
Alright!

139
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,980
Let's go,  Shinjiku

140
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,160
Ow ow ow ow ow!

141
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:31,790
Sprain, I sprained it

142
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,980
Why? All of a sudden

143
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:40,050
I used to... I used to play baseball

144
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,460
I think I twisted something from then

145
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,460
Seriously?

146
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,090
I think it's dislocated

147
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,300
C'mon Endo-kun, let's go.

148
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,840
Alright, we're going.

149
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,840
You're ready to eat?

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,260
Yeah I'm good.

151
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:04,620
Just like Endo's health, their appetite is just fine

152
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,880
This is what everyone's eaten so far,

153
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,760
Matsumoto's side dishes stand out

154
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Just 10 stores left

155
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,580
The goal is in sight now

156
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,360
You know,

157
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,400
I wonder if we can allow some people to rest instead of eat

158
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,400
I see

159
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,300
But we need one person to volunteer to eat 3 pieces,

160
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,080
We need a "New Age" to dawn on us

161
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,080
Exactly, we need that to happen

162
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:47,470
Matsumoto-san, Dr. Meat, and I, we're all pretty old

163
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,470
That's true

164
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,660
We need the youth

165
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,420
The Fresh and Vigorous

166
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,420
The Fresh and Vigorous

167
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,260
We're in our 40s you know

168
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,060
There's no young people on Gaki

169
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,720
No young people on Gaki

170
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,720
Alright I got it, next time,

171
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,720
We'll decide, with cards

172
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,300
We'll flip the cards and see who gets to rest

173
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,140
Up until now, they've eaten together,
But now they begin the resting plan

174
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,140
Will this be a blessing? Or a burden?

175
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,960
Let's see

176
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,720
From now on, they will move mountains

177
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,900
These are the cards

178
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,000
This is an amazing game

179
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,410
Let's decide who rests first

180
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,410
Decide who doesn't eat

181
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,700
A battle of luck; Who will get to rest?

182
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,440
Alright, I got it

183
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,020
The answer...

184
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,440
Ready...set... flip!

185
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,830
Matsumoto-san doesn't have to eat!

186
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,820
I'm so glad!

187
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,820
Very lucky

188
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,260
What the hell

189
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,160
Next, they decide who must eat 3 pieces

190
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,500
Please go ahead

191
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,960
I really wanna avoid this one

192
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,520
This is definitely not good, I don't want to get it

193
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,860
Decide on who shall eat 3 pieces, please!

194
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,290
Ready, set... flip!

195
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,180
It's Endo-san!

196
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
Alright!

197
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Well alright then, let's eat

198
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,640
For the 16th store, they decide on Harami (Skirt Steak)

199
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,260
With less fat, a light item

200
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,720
Very nice

201
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,810
It's light

202
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,240
Endo should be the one to find this difficult,

203
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,820
But then,

204
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:12,320
What is this, "Look how hard I'm working"

205
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,320
You barely ate!

206
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,880
He puts the last piece in his mouth

207
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,800
He did it

208
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,800
Finished!

209
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,520
Let's continue

210
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,540
Can I see the menu?

211
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,900
What should we do?

212
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,420
We have 3 more stores here?

213
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,420
Yes, in Ebisu

214
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,760
We have 3 in Ebisu

215
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,790
The largest hurdle, Ebisu

216
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:54,040
There are 3 stores within 10 minutes of each other
Falling behind here is unnacceptable

217
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Let's do this!

218
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,120
They've cleared 16 stores thus far

219
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,380
The meat and grease tortures their stomachs

220
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,550
Seeing the word "Toraji" is starting to piss me off

221
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,620
Even these stairs are a pain

222
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,560
Even before they eat, the stairs take their toll on the members

223
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,520
Shall we do pork?

224
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,520
The short rib?

225
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,920
Yes, then we'll be done with pork dishes

226
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,720
Let's see what the cards decide then

227
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,240
The cards will decide who eats the short rib

228
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,120
I'm definitely not gonna lose!

229
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,040
The second card draw; There is a large penalty this time

230
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,140
And... flip!

231
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,140
Really?!

232
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,800
He got them in a row

233
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,560
After Matsumoto's double breaks, who will eat 3 pieces?

234
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,320
Here we go, Tanaka open

235
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,140
Alright, just 1 piece

236
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,480
Meat Lover, open

237
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,820
NO, PLEASE

238
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,060
The 17th item, pork short rib

239
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,980
A reasonable portion, and a very popular item

240
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,060
They're all the same

241
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,890
This one looks good

242
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,840
I've already decided on my 3 pieces

243
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,900
Look at him, eating like a Big Leaguer

244
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,890
Are you chewing tobacco?

245
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,560
OK!

246
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,320
He's definitely not gonna finish

247
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,920
Yamasaki has given up the most in the past
But unexpectedly, he finishes!

248
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,060
Finished!

249
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,040
He's crying

250
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,860
Can we go to the head store?

251
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,800
Let's go.

252
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,700
Alright, let's go!

253
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,240
8 hours since the start,

254
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,580
They are no doubt feeling very full

255
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,010
My steps are so heavy

256
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,020
There it is.

257
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,020
We're here.

258
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,840
This way

259
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,920
Next up, the 40th Toraji store in Japan, Toraji Head Store

260
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,740
Like their appetites, their stamina is at the limit

261
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,060
Since this is the head store, we gotta get the specialty short rib

262
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,060
Whoever gets the Skull must eat 2 pieces

263
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,000
That's hot man! Right above the stove

264
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,000
Your way of getting it was weird

265
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,620
If you get the skull you have to eat 2

266
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,020
Let's do it on go
Ready, set,

267
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,700
Alright, Thank god!

268
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,860
Specialty Short Rib

269
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,860
Thank you for waiting

270
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,420
King Of Yakiniku - Specialty Short Rib

271
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,480
Taste, and volume, fit for a king

272
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,340
The head store...

273
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,180
This is some good looking short rib

274
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,360
Yakiniku is just right for now

275
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,290
For now I like this

276
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
Here I go

277
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:30,860
The taste is of course fantastic, however the fattiness is really getting to them

278
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,600
I'm really, I'm really working hard here

279
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
We wanna see you doing that

280
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,220
Matsumoto shoves down the second piece

281
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,880
Finished!

282
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,500
Let's head to the next store

283
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,540
The last store in Ebisu

284
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,340
This time it's Seafood, to change things up

285
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,340
They decide on Squid

286
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:12,660
Tana-chi, give me a small piece

287
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,660
Me too, Tana-chi

288
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,380
A break from the greasy meat,

289
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,280
Their chopsticks keep moving

290
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,200
Squid will never let you down

291
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,780
I don't think squid has let anyone down

292
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,420
Hmm?

293
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,400
That piece is way smaller than mine

294
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,060
That's definitely smaller!

295
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,060
When I was cutting them,

296
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,380
you said you liked squid,

297
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,810
So of course,

298
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,620
I want to give more to those who like it

299
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,850
If you tell me some trivia about squid I'll forgive you

300
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:52,840
Octopus have legs, but Squid have arms

301
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,060
That's actually amazing,

302
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:01,680
Why didn't you tell me this amazing fact before

303
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,680
Where would it come up?

304
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,120
Finished!

305
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,920
Next store!

306
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,780
This is no good

307
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,340
No more, I can't

308
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,800
NO MORE!!!!

309
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,500
That counts as giving up

310
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,620
You totally just gave up

311
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,860
That scared me!

312
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,660
I don't want to end by the roadside like this

313
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,920
That's what ******* was also thinking

314
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,920
"I don't wanna end by the roadside"

315
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,960
Yakiniku Toraji Marathon - Just 6 stores left

316
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,240
A long battle

317
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,920
Their stamina has long passed the limit

318
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,030
If it was something else could you eat?

319
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,970
A different food?

320
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,640
I can't swallow anything

321
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,340
If it was a crepe?

322
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,720
If it was a crepe, maybe I could swallow it

323
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,980
After that, Yamasaki...

324
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,740
The 20th store

325
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,390
I'm actually in trouble here

326
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,920
What happened?

327
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,200
It seems he can't walk

328
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,580
That doesn't just happen all of a sudden

329
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,460
Yamasaki limps into the 20th store, in Aoyama

330
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,380
He's burping a ton

331
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,380
Really?

332
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,000
I think we should cross off the Specialty Skirt Steak

333
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,490
It's lean meat

334
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,000
Are we doing the 1 person eats 2 rule?

335
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,220
The 1 person rests rule is needed right now

336
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,530
They want to relieve their stomachs

337
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,160
One man really wishes it is him

338
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,860
Ready... flip!

339
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,740
Endo is safe!

340
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,000
Shozo you ate a lot before

341
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,000
This is the deciding point!

342
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,600
Ready, set, flip!

343
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,460
You're too loud!

344
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,600
He's crying!

345
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,940
Just a bit, for now

346
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,480
C'mon man

347
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,460
You're overreacting

348
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,040
Wait a minute!!! Really?!?!

349
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:57,640
Specialty Harami - Will they be able to make it past this?

350
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,200
What's with this greasy shine?

351
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,370
This greasy shine is the origin of Yakiniku

352
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,340
I've never seen such greasiness

353
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,020
That looks cooked doesn't it?

354
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,260
Give Yama-chan the 3 best ones

355
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,780
Please enjoy these

356
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,420
They aim to finish the challenge,

357
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,540
They ignore their suffering, and swallow their food

358
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,650
Just Hosei-san's 3 pieces left

359
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,520
Next store is Nishiazabu

360
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,950
Let's get there

361
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,330
He's slowly picking up his chopsticks...

362
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,440
He just can't raise them

363
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,200
Alright.

364
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,570
I give up!

365
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,820
He didn't eat a single bite

366
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,480
Giving up without eating

367
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,430
You can't lift your chopsticks?

368
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,580
I just can't, I was amazed,

369
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,400
Something that heavy is impossible

370
