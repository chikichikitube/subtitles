1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,640
Searching for the legendary "Marine Serow",

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,400
It is our hunter's 14th day
in the Savanna without encountering it.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,410
The serow is still nowhere to be seen.

4
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,980
Bro.

5
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:54,660
Yo Bro.

6
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,870
Whaddaya doin'?

7
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,120
Eh?

8
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,700
Ah, hunting.

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,410
Aah of course, in such an area.

10
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,020
Yo whaddaya huntin'?

11
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,840
Yes?

12
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,840
Whaddaya huntin'?

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,840
A serow.

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,750
A serow?

15
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,960
Aa, I don't think
there are any here, you know.

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,600
What do you do for work?

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,090
Bro?

18
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,000
What kinda work do you do?

19
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, it varies.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,910
I can't directly say "this" is my job.

21
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,820
Oh! Now this sounds interesting...

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,830
I see..!

23
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:32,830
Well..

24
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,740
I, what do you think I do?

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,770
Elephant, you're an elephant.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,770
Well yea I'm an elephant, but my occupation?

27
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,180
What is my, you know, occupation?

28
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,590
I don't know really...

29
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,630
You don't?

30
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,630
I don't. Sorry.

31
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,040
Oh...
Yeah.

32
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,540
Hmm, you know...

33
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,460
Don't you feel
a little disgusted by me?

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
No no no.

35
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,970
Like "Aah, some weird guy came around!",
didn't you think that?

36
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,780
No no, not at all.

37
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,280
You can say it, it happens a lot.

38
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,490
It's ok.

39
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,990
It really-

40
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,990
No it's ok.

41
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,530
For real tho...

42
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,320
You know..

43
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,520
Yes?

44
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,100
My friends...

45
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,040
...they say...

46
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,550
that I'm pretty weird and...

47
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,610
This is just between us, but...

48
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,720
I'm a little...

49
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,730
I'm sort of a masochist, you know?

50
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,380
Y'know?

51
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,750
Me?

52
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,930
Oh...

53
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,640
Like.. uh..

54
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,040
I wanna get shot, kinda

55
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,590
By somebody

56
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,740
You know?

57
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,770
Yea...

58
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,980
Could you... would you mind?

59
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,690
Would you mind?

60
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,900
Mind what?

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,810
Shooting me.

62
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,160
I'm... hunting a serow, you know.

63
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,010
I understand but, just... just a lil.. you know.

64
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,620
When I get shot.

65
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,630
I might react like "Uwaa, I got shot!"
and get a freaking fluffy feeling.

66
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,860
Like "I got shot woaaah" and like, you know,
feel an excitement I never felt before.

67
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,410
Would you mind?

68
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,320
I'm hunting a serow and... you know, I'm kinda short on ammunition.

69
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,940
Yea, I'm sorry.

70
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,350
Aa, well...

71
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,000
Your wordplay is also ok for me, but...

72
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,650
Could you go more like
"Fuck off you Indian elephant!"?

73
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,950
And I'm not an Indian elephant, so...

74
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,370
I'll probably be like "hyaaaa!!"

75
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,590
Do you feel me?

76
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,790
Ah, kinda.

77
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,900
Aaah let's already do it!

78
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,110
Say "Fuck off you dirty little Indian elephant!"

79
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,560
and when I'm about to run away,
you shoot me from behind like "pam!"

80
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,770
Aaa.. I could get in trouble for this you know!..

81
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,390
Could you not just g away?
The serow won't come else..

82
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,500
Again, there's word play in your sentence.

83
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,700
There is no word play!..

84
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,220
And just add "Fuck off,
you dirt Indian elephant!", please?

85
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,350
But I won't say it.

86
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,560
You play around with the words again.

87
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,770
I don't!

88
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,680
Aaa, so that's how it is.
There's no helping it I guess!

89
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,000
Aaa, he's not shooting, eeh.

90
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,750
Man hurry up!

91
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,060
No it's a waste.

92
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,370
You're embarrassing me.

93
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,080
I beg you, please shoot?

94
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,090
Just... it's ok, please?

95
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,230
Ok?

96
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,140
Hmm, where should I aim at?

97
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,050
Eh?! Where would be good..

98
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,770
Ass! And..

99
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,180
at last my face!

100
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,380
Face?

101
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,040
Shooting the face is, you know,
too problematic.

102
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,350
It's too dangerous!

103
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,950
Ah you may be right.

104
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,460
But I could be like "hyaaaa!" you know.

105
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,380
I really can't shoot the face. Sorry.

106
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,580
Then my ass?

107
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,720
Your behind?

108
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,370
Say "Ah!, fuck off you dirty Indian elephant!"
please?

109
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,570
Understood.

110
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,550
Thank you, I mean it.

111
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,910
"Fuck off, you dirty Indian elephant!"

112
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,320
Ah! What is happening!?

113
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,740
Hmm, maybe I'm not a masochist after all?

114
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,960
It didn't feel good at all.

115
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,070
I can imagine.

116
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,280
Ouch!

117
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,480
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!!

118
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,600
It's bad!

119
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,310
I feel dizzy all the sudden!

120
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,520
What should I do?

121
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,720
Don't ask me man.

122
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,930
I'm hella scared!

123
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,330
Don't tell me.

124
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,070
I feel dizzy!

125
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,910
I don't care!

126
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,980
What should I say to my wife?

127
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,290
How would I know?!

128
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,300
She'll say "Dear, what did you do again!?"

129
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,190
You asked me to shoot you
although I was just here hunting for a serow.

130
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,540
I didn't think you'd actually shoot.

131
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,460
But you begged for it
so I thought it can't be helped!

132
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,370
And you were also disturbing my hunt.

133
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,880
What!? I didn't do anything!

134
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,190
Maybe I'm a sadist?!

135
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,190
'the fuck do I know!

136
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,380
I'm going elsewhere now!

137
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,180
Dark! It's getting dark!

138
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,210
This is bad bad bad, ouch ouch ouch.
It hurts super bad.

139
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,410
My body's tingling.

140
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,360
My tongue feels funny.

141
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,410
It's tingling now. It's tin-

142
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,730
I'm scared. My tongue is ting-

143
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,730
What is with you?

144
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,370
It's weird!

145
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,370
It hurts!

146
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,040
Ouch ouch ouch ouch.

147
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,350
My wife will get angry.

148
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,300
She'll know that I did it again!

149
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,980
Again? How many times did you pull that off?

150
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,790
Why is it only now tha-

151
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,710
Why aren't you saying anything?
