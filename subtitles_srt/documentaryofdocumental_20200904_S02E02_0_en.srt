00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:20,930
Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!

2
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,690
To put it simply, we got...

3
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,850
into a bit of trouble.

4
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,220
Trouble?

5
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,000
In any case, it was vulgar.

6
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,630
That's not
the first time, though.

7
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,100
We used to think that Amazon

8
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,400
was this bottomless pit,

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,670
and everything went.

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,610
We don't know either,

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,280
so we want to find out today

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,210
what went wrong with you guys.

13
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,590
You're the worst, man.

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,240
Here we go!

15
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,810
I was cleaning up
and found this porno.

16
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:26,910
Show me!

17
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,110
It's one of these mags

18
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,420
That's nostalgic!

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,880
From long ago

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,590
And there's this older girl

21
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,020
She's an old hag!

22
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,260
Naoka...

23
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,920
Jimmy-san!

24
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,530
You like it?

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,670
That's quite...

26
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,400
Quite mature!

27
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,640
She's in her 50's.

28
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,610
Just perfect!

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,710
She's pissing?

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,740
Outside, right?

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,280
Seems like she's taking a big piss.

32
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,610
I mean, you like who you like.

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,920
I love this!

34
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,850
I'm crazy for her!

35
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,290
You like it...?

36
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,520
Is it wrong
if I like this?

37
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,520
She's thick.

38
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,660
This is good!

39
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,030
She's too hairy

40
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,900
It suited people back then.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,730
—Take a look
I'm doing that.

42
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,540
She's stepping all over
her own piss, man.

43
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,310
But old pictures are good.

44
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,440
It's nice that girls back then
were thick and hot.

45
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,680
Way better.

46
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,650
Can you step aside?

47
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,280
You're pretty direct.

48
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,250
You've been all serious
for a while.

49
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,820
No, I just
respect my elders.

50
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,590
That's why you were
acting all formal?

51
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,690
That's enough.

52
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,660
You're too good.
Your humor's too good.

53
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,530
For real, you're brilliant.

54
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,930
Wanna team up?

55
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,370
Team up?
What about Rossy?

56
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,900
There you go again, man.

57
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,740
Can I show something to you guys?

58
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,080
It's one picture.

59
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,220
I got a small envelope in the mail.

60
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,890
My real name is Sasaki, right?

61
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,990
—My address was at the top.
—You're Sasaki?

62
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,320
Then what's Nadal?

63
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,830
—I'm Nadal.
—I'm talking about me.

64
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,690
Sorry.

65
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,430
Aiura...

66
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,770
Don't say my name out loud
what if I have a kid eventually?

67
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,200
Well... let's look at the picture then.

68
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,940
Can-can you
drop the glasses already?

69
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,010
What?

70
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,280
They distract me.

71
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,380
Are these weird?

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,710
I always have these on.

73
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,050
I showed them to you,
didn't I?

74
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,380
I had them on for sure.

75
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,750
What do you mean?

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,290
What do you think?

77
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,790
They look like a mosaic!

78
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,020
A mosaic?

79
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,430
Not at all.

80
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,030
He always looks like this.

81
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,730
Sorry...

82
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,730
Take a good look.

83
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,170
You're looking at me!

84
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,240
I'm looking at him!

85
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,540
Look at him.

86
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,740
I am!

87
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,870
Look at his mouth as well.

88
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,740
What?

89
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,840
What's wrong,
Jimmy-san?

90
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,080
Look at his teeth now.

91
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,390
He laughed.

92
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,090
What's going on?

93
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,660
Why did you do that then?

94
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,530
You turned it on me!

95
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,600
Even though
there were other funnier moments!

96
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,930
What the hell?

97
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,900
What are you doing?

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,580
There were funnier moments.
What made you laugh?

99
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,040
When he told me to see his teeth.

100
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,150
I looked at them .

101
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,010
So of course I laughed!

102
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,850
Of course not!
You don't laugh with just some teeth!

103
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,990
He was like "look at my teeth"!

104
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,890
So Matsumoto-san,
maybe you already noticed,

105
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,290
he laughed with that
the other time as well.

106
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,730
For real?!
You suck at this!

107
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,700
Let's put some pubes around the mouth.

108
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,900
Who put
these pubes here?

109
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,900
This is bad. Who was it?

110
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,370
It's pretty bad, man!

111
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,570
You can't put pubes
around your master's mouth!

112
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,940
This is definitely
unacceptable, for sure!

113
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,710
Huh? Kubota...

114
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,810
Ready?
I wonder if I can

115
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,450
do something like this
with Amazon?

116
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,130
That's definitely
Matsuda Seiko!

117
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,730
That's Matsuda Seiko!

118
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,600
Besides, Kubota has
always had those glasses!

119
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,300
These.

120
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,300
Sometimes stuff backfires

121
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,970
and I think I screwed up.

122
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,170
I don't care...

123
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,140
You're looking at me!

124
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
I'm looking at him!

125
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,680
I am!

126
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,950
Look at his mouth as well.

127
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,720
What?

128
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,820
What's wrong, Jimmy-san?

129
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,190
Look at his teeth.

130
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,490
He laughed.

131
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,530
You were smiling all along.

132
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,700
I was thinking that
I should press the button anyway.

133
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,730
Damn

134
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,100
I'm starting to feel
bad as well.

135
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,110
—That's too quick!
—That's too harsh!

136
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,550
Alright, alright

137
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,690
But you were smiling
at any random crap, man!

138
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,160
I thought it was funny!

139
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,420
So that's one point for Kubota.

140
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,830
Alright, yellow.

141
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,530
Kubota
hasn't done anything.

142
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,930
I looked at his teeth!

143
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,130
Teeth are normal!

144
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,230
You have a gap.

145
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,000
So when he first
showed them to me

146
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,570
See? It's funny!

147
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,970
What's funny about that?

148
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,040
This isn't even the main act.

149
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
The picture...

150
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,690
I want to see!

151
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,130
So I got a small envelope
with my address on it.

152
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,160
And then

153
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,700
What?

154
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,830
Huh? Huh?

155
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,270
Whoa!

156
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,740
For real?!

157
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,870
That's creepy!

158
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,470
I wanted the Special Defense Force to
open it for me.

159
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,370
You haven't opened it?

160
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,210
I did, eventually...

161
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,880
So what was inside?

162
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,810
Two thick books.

163
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,020
Huh? Books?

164
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,420
I can't say.

165
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,650
Why?

166
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,990
You read Pro Golfer Monkey recently?

167
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,920
Where?

168
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,330
In the streets

169
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,560
The streets?

170
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,100
You like golf, right?

171
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,600
You just burped, Inada?

172
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,070
I did.

173
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,340
Sorry, it's just that...

174
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,840
Inada has been looking
out of it.

175
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,410
Are you okay?

176
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,880
I'm nervous, so I have some
phlegm in my throat.

177
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,420
It's been stuck there
all this time.

178
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,950
Why don't you
just let it all out?

179
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,660
It's all stuck there
at the back like...

180
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,390
What?
What was that, Koumoto-san?

181
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,600
It's stuck at the back
so it won't just come out!

182
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,770
Inada didn't say that.
What are you gonna do?

183
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,810
What's that? Inada?

184
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,480
For real?

185
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,540
I didn't say that.

186
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,280
Uh, yeah, sorry

187
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,580
I got a new manager

188
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,150
A guy named Maki from Yoshimoto.

189
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,020
I know him, I know him!

190
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,550
From Yuriyan...
Yeah, exactly!

191
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,130
And Honoka-chan from a call-girl service. (Sex service)

192
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,330
Huh? What?

193
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,960
Honoka-chan from a call-girl service.

194
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,200
Honoka-chan from a call-girl service.

195
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,500
Honoka-chan?
I know her.

196
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,900
She's that M girl, right?

197
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

198
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
How long does she take?

199
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,670
90 minutes.

200
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,240
How many orgasms?

201
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,110
Around three or so.

202
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,640
That's a lot, huh?

203
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,540
One every 30 minutes?

204
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,510
That's serious...

205
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,880
Mine is also 90 minutes.

206
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,420
How many times?

207
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,920
Around 25.

208
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,550
25?

209
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,090
That's so much bullshit.

210
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,220
You got the number wrong.

211
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,990
Stop... lying, man.

212
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,590
I'm sure it's just once.

213
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,300
For real how many times?

214
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,730
Just one.

215
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,940
Don't order 90 minutes, okay?

216
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,870
So the three times...

217
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,340
The three times is for real.

218
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,410
So she wrote a message.

219
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,810
Yeah, right here.

220
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,350
Onishi-san
thank you for today.

221
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,850
It was really fun.

222
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,990
Let's play together again.
I'm here on the weekends.

223
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,590
She liked you?

224
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,220
You hit it off?

225
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,420
She means "play"
in private, right?

226
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,460
No, she didn't give me
her number.

227
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,290
There it is!

228
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,430
This is just
the store's number.

229
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,200
- Why don't you call?
- It's the store's number.

230
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,300
Let's call right now.

231
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,130
No, no!
That's the store's number!

232
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,140
I haven't called yet!

233
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,740
No, no, no!

234
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,610
You should call.

235
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,040
Uh... next is Shimbashi.

236
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,350
Hayama-san.

237
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,320
Hayama-san.

238
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,990
Look! It's Hayama-san!

239
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,520
Hayama-san from Shimbashi.

240
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
That's a last name?

241
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,890
Hayama-san from Shimbashi.

242
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,830
That's a name?

243
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,430
For real!
This is Hayama-san from Shimbashi.

244
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,170
You used it?

245
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,210
You used it right?
You did?

246
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,010
You used the coupon?
I'm asking if you did.

247
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,250
Did you use it, man?!

248
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,750
What are you talking about?

249
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,110
You used it, right?

250
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,580
You used it?

251
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,950
See?!

252
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,060
What was that?

253
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,560
I don't get this.

254
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,200
This sucks.

255
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,170
You shouldn't say that!

256
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,400
What happened?

257
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,210
You were so close.

258
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,410
That was a long time ago
I was told to use it.

259
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,580
It was a used discount coupon
that he gave to me...

260
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,680
You have it here?

261
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,690
You promised you wouldn't tell!

262
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,520
You used the coupon?
I'm asking if you did.

263
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,290
Did you use it, man?!

264
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,330
What are you talking about?

265
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,730
You used it, right?

266
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,360
You used it?

267
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,470
See?!

268
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,140
You were too close though,
for real.

269
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,610
Like Sigourney Weaver
with the alien.

270
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,110
Too close!

271
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,750
Breathing on his nose.

272
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,850
Well, Koumoto did try
to hold it in.

273
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,620
This is a yellow.

274
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,850
That's rough!

275
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,720
And a point for Jimmy-chan.

276
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,860
He's pretty scary.
He came in strong today.

277
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,260
He did.

278
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,900
Also, what was that
30 minute thing, Nadal?

279
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,100
For real...
I'm working on it.

280
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,470
I've been failing
pretty hard so far.

281
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,610
Hate to admit it, though.

282
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,270
That hurts to say.

283
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,840
You didn't have to!

284
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,420
Here we go!

285
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,650
That was close!

286
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,820
It worked out.

287
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,620
So was it an accident?

288
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,830
You didn't know Koumoto-san was here
so it was by chance...

289
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,200
I had it with me by chance.

290
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,500
Because Jimmy didn't know
Koumoto would be here.

291
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,470
- I think I got lucky today.
- You're good Jimmy-san.

292
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,940
Not to mention he had
one and then another.

293
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,770
And he called me over
right this way for it.

294
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,210
I knew I had it with me,
I knew I did.

295
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,610
Still talking about that?

296
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,180
So wanna play the
tofu woodblock...

297
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,650
The tofu woodblock game?

298
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Tofu woodblock game?

299
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,750
What's that?

300
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,020
You stack up tofu like this!

301
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,660
Get a dish!

302
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,090
It's already on the table!

303
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,730
Are we gonna eat these later?

304
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,390
I'll prepare miso later.

305
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,860
Liar!

306
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,760
I'll get some more.

307
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,770
More tofu?

308
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,500
It's not just this.

309
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,700
Cut it
cut it in half, okay?

310
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,410
- You have bad manners.
- The table's getting dirty!

311
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,410
What manners?

312
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,840
- What?
- No, no, no...

313
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,310
- What's wrong?
- No, no, no... it's okay

314
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,910
- Where are you going?
- Bad manners...

315
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,520
The table's all sticky,
are there any wipes?

316
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,750
What's wrong?

317
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,490
The world is
all out of tapioca!

318
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,560
The world is
all out of tapioca!

319
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,230
Out of tapioca
over the world!

320
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,640
The world is out of

321
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,570
The world is
all out of tapioca!

322
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,140
There's no more tapioca
no more, oh no!

323
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,080
The world is
all out of tapioca!

324
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,210
Tapioca still exists...

325
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,950
The world is
all out of tapioca

326
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,290
We need tapioca.

327
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,660
The world is all out of tapioca!
We're out of tapioca!

328
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,560
We need tapioca!

329
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,360
What's with those glasses?

330
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,860
He's allergic?

331
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,430
What do we do?

332
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,300
I have withdrawal syndrome.

333
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,800
You want to eat some?

334
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,110
I can't stand it anymore!
I need stuff running up the straw!

335
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,940
Bear with it!

336
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,750
I can't stand it
if no balls are going up this straw!

337
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,820
Withdrawal!

338
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,520
We're out
we're out of tapioca!

339
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,190
Wait, wait

340
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,390
Does this work?

341
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,030
As long as it goes up the straw.

342
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,690
It won't though.

343
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,900
The size is all wrong.

344
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,030
It's soft.

345
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,870
With a tapioca straw?

346
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,770
There it is!
It's working?

347
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,840
Ouch!

348
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,640
Whoa... that's something!

349
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,880
Ouch!

350
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,120
It won't go up the straw!
I need something bouncy!

351
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,020
We're out of tapioca!

352
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,550
We're out of tapioca!

353
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,760
What-what what about this?

354
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,830
I think we...
we had some tapioca!

355
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,360
You have tapioca?
I need something bouncy!

356
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,660
Anything works,
if it goes up the straw.

357
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,270
Here you go.

358
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,800
You're hairy.

359
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,370
I have some tapioca.

360
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,900
Thank you so much.

361
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,650
That stinks!

362
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,510
What's wrong?
It stinks!

363
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
The tapioca?

364
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,150
It stinks!

365
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,450
It stinks, yeah.

366
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,790
- Ouch.
- That stinks!

367
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,270
It's so stinky?

368
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,130
I want to touch.

369
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,900
No, don't worry, Ikko-san.

370
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,300
Are you going to stay as Ikko?

371
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,540
What?

372
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,270
No, just wondering if you are.

373
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,440
What? Who are you?

374
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,340
I'm Cookie.

375
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,250
I'm Ikko.

376
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,720
What's that?
Balls.

377
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,720
Can I touch them?

378
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,050
I don't really recommend it
but feel free to do so.

379
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,660
I want to give it a try.

380
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,630
There we go.

381
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,700
Fluffy!!!

382
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,070
Don't you have any tapioca,
Jimmy-san?

383
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,010
I have some.

384
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,940
Would my tapioca work?

385
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,450
Yes.

386
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
Mine?

387
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,150
My-My tapioca

388
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,180
It's prettier than expected.

389
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,580
For real.

390
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,750
I got a vasectomy.

391
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,250
Huh?

392
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,160
Really?

393
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,960
Was it expensive?

394
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,490
Around 300k yen.

395
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,460
That's expensive!

396
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,600
I didn't think the insurance
would cover it.

397
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,700
Of course.

398
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,940
Come on!

399
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,310
Ikko-san,
are you okay with this?

400
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,210
Okay? Okay?

401
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,880
I'll touch it.

402
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,780
So pretty...

403
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,350
Huh?

404
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,830
Ikko-san is touching him.

405
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,160
No way...

406
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,830
How much?!

407
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,070
Okay, okay, that's that.

408
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,940
"How much?" For real?

409
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,710
Ah, sorry.

410
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,750
What happened to you?

411
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:08,910
That's a big wound.

412
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,250
I've been sick.

413
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,220
No way, man.
Sick?

414
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,720
You wrap a bandage
around your rooster when you get sick?

415
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,920
Just call it a dick.

416
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,690
Rooster?

417
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,960
Okay, take care.

418
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,030
What about the tofu?

419
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,130
Let's play the tofu woodblock game!

420
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,800
The tofu woodblock game?

421
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,340
Wash your hands.

422
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,910
If you lose,
you have to get in here.

423
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,010
Where?

424
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,440
The pool?

425
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,440
If we lose?

426
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,750
If it falls, yeah.

427
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,210
It falls?

428
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,720
If the tofu falls.

429
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,220
If the tofu falls? Okay

430
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,820
I don't really care about this.

431
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,320
Why are you all running away?
What about the tofu?

432
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,090
Well, you're washing your hands, so

433
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,360
I don't have a towel.

434
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,030
I have one!

435
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,700
Do we need that much tofu?

436
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,230
I think we can all carry a lot.

437
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,730
We can carry a lot.

438
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,670
- So it's kind of like jenga?
- What's jenda?

439
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,370
- What's jenda?
- Jenga.

440
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,670
What's jenga?

441
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,740
You have a jenga right there.

442
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,580
Hamada-san has been...

443
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,480
- Jenga?
- A jenga.

444
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,580
With this, you lose if
You lost!

445
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,350
- You lost, you lost!
- No, no, no!

446
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,750
We haven't even said
"tofu game yay!"

447
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,220
- You lost, you lost.
- We didn't say it!

448
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,590
We haven't

449
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,230
But doing this is
practically impossible.

450
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,060
No, this is
totally impossible.

451
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,130
There's no way.

452
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,470
A blade...

453
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,700
Watch out, watch out!

454
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,970
Wait, wait
I'm cutting in half!

455
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,400
Watch out for wounds...

456
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,810
It's all a mess, man...

457
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,640
Cut them in half.

458
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,350
What about the money?

459
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,280
Okay everyone!
Tofu woodblock game yay!

460
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,550
We have to put them
on that place, right?

461
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,350
On this plate, yeah.

462
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,820
Take the lead.

463
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,860
Who should start?

464
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,020
What should I say?

465
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,590
Toshiba

466
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,500
- Toshiba?
- Toshiba....?

467
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,300
Tofu spinning game

468
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,660
Spinning game?

469
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,830
Tofu woodblock game.

470
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:13,440
We have to synchronize the yay at
tofu woodblock game yay!

471
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,410
With the right hand?

472
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,080
Tofu woodblock game!

473
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,540
Yay!

474
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,520
Clap clap! I go first.

475
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,450
Clap clap!

476
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,150
I go first

477
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,020
We go around like that.

478
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,190
Normally

479
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,220
Clockwise.

480
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,730
No, man! Stack it on top!

481
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,930
No way!

482
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,430
It's impossible!

483
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,470
Did you think this through?

484
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,240
Go back home!

485
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,510
I don't get it.
One, two...

486
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,010
Investment spinning game. Yay

487
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,070
Investment spinning?

488
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,610
Tofu spinning game

489
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,210
Wasn't it woodblock?

490
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,380
No, they're not woodblocks!
This is tofu!

491
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,850
You said woodblock game!

492
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,120
Tofu woodblock game
Tofu woodblock game yay!

493
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
We clap at the yay?

494
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,690
Right. Tofu woodblock game yay!
Clap clap yay!

495
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:09,930
On top?

496
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,730
What about the "me first"?

497
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,670
One from me.

498
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,340
One from me.

499
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,670
One from Koba-san.

500
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,610
One from Koba-san.

501
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,240
One from Cookie!

502
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,480
That's close! This is bad!

503
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,950
Damn it!

504
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,480
They're poorly cut.

505
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,450
- On top?
- No...

506
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,480
Huh?!
Can he put it next to it?

507
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,920
They're woodblocks, yeah.

508
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,590
On top on top on top on top!

509
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,390
Why not just next to it?

510
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,600
We'll lose right away!

511
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,700
We'll lose.

512
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,860
Not everyone will go.

513
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,530
Okay, let's do that.

514
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,270
- Where?
- Next to it!

515
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,570
You should be on house arrest
until you're 90, man!

516
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,970
I don't understand "90"

517
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,510
Why?!

518
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,710
- 90, right?
- 90 years old.

519
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,410
No, no,
wait a second.

520
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,580
You touched it!

521
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,320
- That's the one from cookie!
- Right!

522
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,450
- It's still on the place, so it's fine!
- You have to get in.

523
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,260
- I don't want to.
- You have to!

524
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,060
Ouch!

525
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,260
Come on!
Don't do that!

526
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,000
You have to get in!

527
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,470
It's still on top so it's fine!

528
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,070
That's no good!
This is a woodblock game!

529
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Get in.

530
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,410
That's too cold!

531
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,710
That's the rules.
It's a woodblock game.

532
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,750
I've never heard
of anything like that!

533
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,490
You prepared it, did what you wanted
and now pour ice as you please?!

534
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,860
- That was just a test, right?
- That's how these games go.

535
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,160
So let's do this one for real.

536
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,360
Let's do this one for real.

537
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,700
Ah, watch out!

538
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,070
That's a boulder!

539
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,070
—Boulder?
—A boulder of ice?

540
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,840
That looks cold.

541
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,010
This is kinda...

542
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,140
Is it just the feet?

543
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,740
—No uh...
—Full body?

544
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,710
Well yeah...
without the mic of course.

545
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,020
Can we take off our clothes?

546
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,180
Can we leave them on?

547
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,790
Do what you want.

548
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,420
I think they'll be
really cold, though.

549
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,820
We going there?

550
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,090
You ready for that?

551
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,830
This is too harsh, man!

552
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,200
So if the tofu crumbles
we have to go in there?

553
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,570
That's that.

554
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,100
That's too much, right?

555
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,210
You go in,
and use this to pour more.

556
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,770
That's too cold, man!

557
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,040
We have to take the mic off.

558
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,320
You use this, get in
and then pour...

559
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
You went in.

560
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,720
I did, but, well...

561
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,660
Is it really cold?

562
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,960
I think it is.

563
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,890
What a mess of a game.

564
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,300
Why don't you take off
that cape?

565
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,460
Take off the cape.

566
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,930
This is too much.

567
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,500
Take this.

568
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,870
That stinks!

569
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,810
You just laughed right now!

570
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,140
You just laughed!

571
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,450
No one saw it?

572
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,450
He smelled.

573
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,220
And then laughed.

574
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,090
You even laughed out loud.

575
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,220
I don't get what makes you laugh.

576
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,490
You suck at this!

577
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,160
What makes him laugh?

578
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,100
I didn't see that coming.

579
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,230
He just laughed, right?

580
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,000
He laughed normally.

581
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,470
Let's take a look.

582
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,610
It was far too natural

583
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,240
and it's not like
you don't know the rules.

584
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,840
He laughed like he
didn't know them.

585
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,810
What a mess of a game.

586
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,310
Why don't you take off
that cape?

587
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,650
Take off the cape.

588
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,890
This is too much.

589
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,620
Take this.

590
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,060
That stinks!

591
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,100
What happened?
What was so funny?

592
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,100
No, I was just off guard,
let me off the hook!

593
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,570
What's your deal?
For real!

594
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,440
Just let me off the hook!

595
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,940
Alright, here we go.

596
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,680
That's the second one.

597
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,280
But you have to do it at least once
that tofu thing

598
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,510
The woodblock?

599
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,180
I'll do it properly.

600
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,390
And they're all stacked

601
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,090
so I don't know which
the main one is.

602
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,820
The first one.

603
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,360
They're stacked
as a default setting.

604
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,300
Give it a try,
do it properly.

605
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,070
Because this is getting annoying.

606
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,400
Let's start again.

607
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,270
Do it once.

608
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,780
Wanna use some kitchen paper?

609
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,650
If you do this...

610
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,980
That works.

611
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,950
The first time was fine, though.

612
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,190
Yeah, I thought
cutting them was a bad idea.

613
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,890
Now we have this much.

614
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,330
I see...

615
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,100
Why are you looking
so deflated?!

616
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,130
He's also
really pissed off right now!

617
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,300
I'm the same as always,
I was just thinking.

618
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,110
You're so depressed!

619
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,640
Wait!

620
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,580
Stop trying to
bring me down!

621
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,780
No, no
no one's doing that!

622
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,180
You're self destructing!

623
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,150
Alright, let's go!

624
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,660
Like Matsumoto-san said

625
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,630
this is too unstable,
let's do this.

626
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,860
Huh? Why?

627
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,060
It'll be hard to stack them.

628
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,200
That's the point
of the game.

629
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,200
Is that size okay?

630
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,040
Wait wait,
stack them right...

631
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,710
Wanna give it a try?
Ready?

632
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,080
They're unstable cut like that
so maybe this...

633
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,410
Tofu yay yay,
tofu yay yay

634
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,550
That's not it.

635
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,320
What's that "tofu yay yay" bullshit?

636
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,580
One yay too many.

637
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,290
I go next.

638
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,990
Like a demonstration?

639
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,420
Between them?

640
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,660
No, no, no.
We're all doing it.

641
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,800
With these new rules?

642
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,400
That was Nadal's test, right?

643
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,470
No, I think this won't work.
Let's do it like this.

644
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,730
That's too hard to stack.

645
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,740
That's fine, though!

646
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,470
Let's do it once.

647
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:30,540
Tofu woodblock game yay!

648
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,710
Yay!

649
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,010
Jimmy clap clap!

650
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,820
You say your name?
I don't remember the name.

651
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,050
Kobayashi

652
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,850
This is more stable, so...

653
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,060
You have to say your name

654
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,720
We should use bigger ones.

655
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,160
I'll do it like this.

656
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,030
Cookie!

657
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:56,570
I guess I'll use this one.
And make another foundation.

658
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,800
So gentle.

659
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,170
This looks bad!

660
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,610
That's dangerous!

661
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,870
Akiyama!

662
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,710
This is bad!

663
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,610
I can choose anything?

664
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,780
Even a tiny one, yeah!

665
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,380
As long as it's there,
anything goes!

666
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,490
Whichever's fine.

667
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,890
Watch out!

668
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,190
Watch out!!

669
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,520
This one?

670
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,060
Wait a second-

671
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,630
Akiyama-san?

672
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,630
No, that's my fault?

673
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,430
That was Akiyama's

674
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,770
No, that'll happen
if we stand around chatting.

675
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,970
Okay, Akiyama.

676
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,900
Of course not!

677
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,640
I mean, you moved the table
with your dick right now!

678
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,040
That was Akiyama's

679
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,770
That was Akiyama's yeah.

680
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,580
We need to decide a time limit
because it collapses with time.

681
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,480
Like just after stacking yours?

682
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,650
Yeah, right.
Otherwise we'll just talk and it'll fall.

683
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,420
That's so,
because tofu is soft.

684
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,250
I kinda get
what he means, though.

685
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,450
I do too

686
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,190
Okay, choose a time span, Nadal.

687
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,130
Alright. Ten seconds?

688
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:58,330
Ten seconds between what and what?

689
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,700
What's the limit?

690
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,730
Why not two seconds?

691
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,270
Let's do ten.

692
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,800
It's your game!
You should choose!

693
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,070
Bang bang and three seconds.

694
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,270
Sorry

695
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,740
—Bang bang and
- Sorry.

696
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,410
Bang bang?
Wasn't it clap clap?

697
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,880
What's going on?!

698
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,120
We need to
unify the chanting as well.

699
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,620
If we get anything wrong
Jimmy-san goes in.

700
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,130
Let's do that!

701
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,600
The rules are all messed up
so Jimmy goes in.

702
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,460
That's too cruel, man!

703
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,700
Alright, five seconds then.

704
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,670
Who starts?

705
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,100
Let's go with Kubota.

706
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,470
Just go with the chant.

707
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,040
Let's go

708
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,240
Tofu woodblock game yay!

709
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,510
First tofu

710
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,520
Ah, Kubota, you're out.

711
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,620
You have to say your name.

712
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,690
My name?

713
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,320
You didn't say it.

714
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,590
So if you don't say your name
you're out?

715
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,690
You have to say it.

716
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,060
I'm gonna cry.

717
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,130
Maybe I should kill you

718
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,560
Huh?

719
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,130
—Kill...?
—Let's go again.

720
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,570
That's good.

721
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,500
Ah, shut up man.

722
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:15,870
You were gonna kill him?

723
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,540
Let's go

724
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,840
I'll kill you...

725
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,480
He's kinda...

726
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,320
I haven't said anything!

727
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,690
Get serious already
I didn't say anything man!

728
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,120
—Did he say something?
—Yeah.

729
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,290
It stinks!

730
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,120
"Tochu"...

731
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,890
So I have to start, right?

732
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,730
Shut up, man.

733
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
What's "tochu"?

734
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,900
Aren't you out
JImmy-san?

735
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,570
You said "tochu", didn't you?

736
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,600
Okay, out!

737
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,810
So I'm out?

738
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,210
Let's get in.

739
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,180
You okay, Jimmy-san?

740
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,740
You should pump up your heartbeat first.

741
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,610
Watch out, watch out!

742
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,220
- Come on!
- This is bad!

743
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,550
That's scary!

744
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:03,950
Go on, go on!

745
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,360
You go this deep

746
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,290
What?!

747
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,500
Watch out, watch out!

748
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,530
Thank you

749
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,400
Thank you

750
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,100
Thank you

751
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,810
That's how it is.

752
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,910
Thank you, Kubota

753
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,250
Sorry, for real

754
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,720
Thanks for showing me
how kind you can be.

755
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,320
You should get closer

756
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,490
Thank you, man!

757
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,520
Thank you too

758
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,790
Don't get so close!

759
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,660
Don't get close, I'll kill you!

760
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,890
I'm thanking you,
sorry for everything!

761
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,630
Sorry

762
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,430
Don't get closer
I'll kill you for real

763
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
For real, thank you

764
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,970
I'm gonna kill him
sorry, here I go

765
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,070
Ouch!

766
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,100
That's hot!

767
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,240
That's hot!

768
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Who was it?

769
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,110
Nadal, right?

770
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,850
Damn it!
I haven't even done anything!

771
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,750
It was hot?

772
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,390
That was too hot!

773
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,920
Come on,
that's too much!

774
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,930
It really is,
damn it!

775
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,360
That was weird.

776
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,730
When did it happen?

777
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,330
It was weird.

778
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,300
What's the big idea?

779
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,670
- Nadal!
- So it was me after all?!

780
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,240
Don't get closer!

781
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,080
Don't get closer,
I'll kill you!

782
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,510
I'm thanking you,
sorry for everything!

783
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,220
Sorry

784
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,090
Don't get closer,
I'll kill you for real

785
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,120
Sorry, really

786
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,520
I'm gonna kill him
sorry, here I go

787
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Ouch!

788
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,690
That's hot!

789
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,800
Hot?! How is that hot?!

790
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,800
That gets hot?!
It does!

791
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,540
There's no way!

792
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,910
That's hot?
It is!

793
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,070
Gunpowder's hot

794
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,180
Jimmy-san's reactions
are always so...

795
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,510
I feel like he'd call anything hot.

796
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,810
So I thought he was saying
some nonsense.

797
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,850
You're right.

798
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,650
It's what it is.

799
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,590
Well, I guess...
you could stop or keep going.

800
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,060
Let's get one round done!

801
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,190
Let's get serious!

802
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,390
At least until he's still here!

803
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,560
I'm still here!

804
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,000
Huh?
I said I'm here!

805
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,600
But you'll be gone.

806
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,700
Pretty soon, yeah.

807
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,130
No way! I'm right here!

808
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
In like five minutes.

809
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,500
No way, no way!

810
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:36,140
Can we at least get serious
just one time and do this?

811
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,610
Here we go!

812
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,680
Let's do this!

813
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,910
We just have to stack them,
and that's it, right?

814
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,320
Yeah, just stack them.

815
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,380
With our names, right?

816
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,720
You say your name,
and stack them.

817
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,950
A name and then stack.

818
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,690
Yell it loudly!

819
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,860
Here we go

820
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,260
Tofu woodblock game yay!

821
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,660
Ikko

822
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,670
Soshina

823
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,370
Bald doll

824
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,270
Bald doll?

825
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,740
Okay, stop.

826
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,250
Bald doll?

827
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,380
You're more than that.

828
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,950
Well, I'm balding.

829
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,650
What about your jaw or your skin?

830
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,150
Balding comes third, yeah.

831
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,960
My skin is fine already.

832
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,660
It's really not.
It's getting worse!

833
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,760
And the jaw?

834
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,590
My jaw sticks out a little.

835
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,500
Sticks out like a sore thumb.

836
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,300
Besides, you're not balding.

837
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,440
- I have more hair, but also less.
- What?

838
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,040
It comes and goes.

839
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,480
- Just leave it at Inada.
- Understood.

840
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,880
Say your own name.

841
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,610
Do it again, then.

842
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,150
Let's do it again!

843
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,810
From the start.

844
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,280
Okay, Matsuo-san.

845
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,250
Let's do it from Cookie!

846
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,590
Why me?

847
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,960
This is completely impossible.

848
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,160
He came up with the game,
and only just did something?

849
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,830
He sucks!

850
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,900
I want to see Cookie do it!

851
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,770
Alright, I'll do it.

852
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,710
But Nadal hasn't stacked his yet.

853
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,710
-You want to, right?
-Neither have I.

854
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,510
Do I still go now?

855
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,910
You haven't done it,
but I'm still next?

856
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,680
Me, Koumoto-san, Cookie.
Let's do that.

857
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,950
But Koumoto wants me
to go next, right?

858
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,890
What's with your tone, man?

859
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,020
Wanna do it, Nadal?

860
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,260
You all sound weird.

861
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,790
I want Cookie to go next.

862
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,430
You wanna go, right?!
After me, then.

863
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,030
Try again.

864
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,300
"Try again"?

865
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,770
Wait, what's this?
What's going on?

866
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,710
Why are we rotating?

867
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,710
-I want Cookie to go next!
-Let's go.

868
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,680
-I want Cookie to go next.
-That's it.

869
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,380
I want Cookie to go next, 'kay?!

870
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,020
What's with you?

871
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,690
You wanna go?

872
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,820
Rock, paper, schizzles!

873
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,260
Whoever wins
gets another try, 'kay?!

874
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,790
And turn arizzle, 'kay?!

875
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,170
I don't get it,
so I can't laugh.

876
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,500
That was close!

877
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,440
That was really close!

878
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,510
Ready, Cookie-san?

879
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,180
I go next?

880
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,150
I put this here, right?
Do I take it?

881
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,920
-Let's go from the "yay"
-Ah, right.

882
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,520
The cheer,
Jimmy-san.

883
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,020
Okay...

884
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,920
Tofu woodblock game, yay!

885
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,160
So underwhelming.

886
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,890
Ikuina Akiko

887
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,530
Huh?

888
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,800
No, man.

889
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,400
That's so wrong.

890
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,700
Cookie-san.

891
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,070
But Inada was spacing out,
so I could do that.

892
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,840
I wasn't spacing out.

893
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:58,540
Use yer right name.
What're ya doin'?

894
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,610
We're not playin' at all.
The hell you doin'?

895
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,450
Don't get that mad.

896
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,850
Jimmy-san, let's go.

897
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,650
We're not playin'!

898
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:10,950
Who was this?

899
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,720
What's with this tofu woodblock game?

900
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,690
Well, uh...

901
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:19,030
We just have to stack five of them.

902
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,530
Five?!

903
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,730
All of us?!

904
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,170
What's with this game?

905
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:27,370
What's fun about this?!
A game of just five blocks?

906
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,040
Um... I guess...

907
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,340
It's ordering others around.

908
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,280
That's the charm?

909
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,050
Let's do that, then.

910
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,920
So I just have to stack
five of them?

911
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,820
Who are they fighting?

912
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,860
You do it,
if you lose here!

913
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,260
"You"? Call me Cookie, man.

914
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,590
Cookie, do it!

915
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,800
Aren't these four already?

916
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,430
This is the last one.

917
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,200
This might work.

918
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,700
Just five seconds, right?

919
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,670
-And then...
-Five seconds, right?

920
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,910
There we go.

921
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,410
Five seconds after letting go?

922
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,740
Let go, let go!

923
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,110
Wait after letting go!

924
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,480
Let go!

925
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,010
Wait up!!

926
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
Let go, man!

927
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,450
Isn't he moving them?

928
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,720
Why are you doing that?

929
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,320
Let go already!

930
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,060
Cookie, you can let go.

931
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,620
Jimmy-san, penalize him!

932
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,790
In five seconds.

933
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,190
Cookie, let go!

934
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,630
Wait, wait,
wait wait wait!

935
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,500
I'll be the only one losing!

936
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,170
I'm keeping it in place,
it'll bounce if I let go.

937
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Let go.

938
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,340
I'm telling you
it's gonna bounce for sure!

939
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,240
Let go, and raise your hands.

940
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,540
Just shut up,
and do it.

941
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,150
Why do I have to
lose no matter what?

942
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,980
It'll bounce if I let go!

943
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,680
What do you mean bounce?

944
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,420
Tofu doesn't bounce!

945
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,390
Let go, man!

946
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,990
Cookie, let go, Cookie!

947
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,230
Jimmy-san,
penalize him already!

948
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,000
With one hand?
Or both hands?

949
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,100
What?

950
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,230
Can I use both hands?

951
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,130
Let go already!

952
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,630
I'm not talking about that!

953
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,340
I'm asking if I can
use both hands!

954
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,770
Sure.
Really?!

955
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,970
Five seconds
after pushing down?

956
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,380
No way!
Let go!

957
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,040
Then tell us the fucking rules!

958
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,950
You can't do that!
Let go!

959
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,250
Are you fucking daft?!

960
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,780
You have to let go, man!

961
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,250
You're dumb as a brick.

962
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,820
You can't use both hands.
Just one!

963
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,520
You said it was okay!

964
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,930
You said I could
use both hands!

965
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,860
I told you to let go.

966
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,900
Let go, man.

967
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,800
Why do I have to carry the loss?

968
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,070
You're gonna lose?

969
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,170
"Carry the loss" isn't a nice way
to put it.

970
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,710
Why did you decide I would be
carrying it, then?

971
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,840
You said we should
stack them in fives!

972
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,240
It's gonna bounce, man!

973
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,680
It'll only bounce if you put pressure!

974
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,550
-Why are you doing that?
-Here we go.

975
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,620
You still have to wait five seconds
after letting go.

976
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,290
What happens if I win
after five seconds?

977
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,860
If you win, it's over.

978
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,930
I want it to end already.

979
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Please end this.

980
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,230
Can we count the five seconds quicker?

981
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,700
I might die
for you bastards!

982
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,740
With that speed?

983
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,140
Yeah, it's quick.

984
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,470
I'm letting go, okay?

985
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,540
Here I go.

986
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,780
Wait

987
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:26,020
He only needs to let the right hand go.

988
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,350
Do it.

989
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,190
It's a really unstable balance.

990
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,550
It's gonna work!

991
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,060
This really feels like
playing jenga, seriously.

992
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,000
Wait, wait!
Don't do that!

993
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,930
No way!
It was gonna fall!

994
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,530
I'm not gonna let it fall.

995
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,770
No, no,
then you have to go in.

996
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,540
Are you stupid?

997
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,910
It worked!

998
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,110
It's gonna work!
1 2 3...

999
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,480
You can't touch it!

1000
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,810
Wait, Koumoto-san.

1001
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,150
Okay, done.

1002
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,250
I haven't laughed.

1003
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,320
Damn it!

1004
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,660
It's working, it's working!

1005
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,660
It's working!

1006
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,600
That was long.

1007
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,170
Why did it work?!

1008
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,730
What's with this game?

1009
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:22,510
Okay, so there were two people...

1010
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,910
It might've been both,
or just one.

1011
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,050
Cookie or Nadal!

1012
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,980
I didn't smile, for real!

1013
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:33,820
Nadal definitely smiled at some point!

1014
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,950
No, that was just because
Cookie-san smiled!

1015
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,690
You did because he smiled?

1016
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,020
Nadal doesn't want to accept
he smiled!

1017
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,390
It was just since that
beep beep sound started!

1018
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,460
What "beep beep" sound?

1019
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,660
The siren?!

1020
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,270
I had never heard that.

1021
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,030
There it is!

1022
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,810
It's gonna work!
1 2 3...

1023
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:56,970
You can't touch it!

1024
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,210
Wait, Koumoto-san.

1025
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,710
Okay, it's done!

1026
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,610
He's smiling!
He's definitely smiling!

1027
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,750
Okay, now what?!

1028
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,050
To be honest,
I brought the most weapons with me!

1029
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,320
No, no, no, you were just smiling!

1030
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,590
In any case, Cookie, here...

1031
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,260
Orange!

1032
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,630
There it is.
One for the champion.

1033
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,030
Nadal is still safe.

1034
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,800
I'm gonna watch out from now on!

1035
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,030
After what Cookie did, right?

1036
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,070
Whose point was that?
It's hard to tell.

1037
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,340
I laughed at myself.
So I can get a point.

1038
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,470
What's with that?

1039
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,610
Hmm...

1040
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,350
It was pretty decent.

1041
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,550
Looking back, yeah.

1042
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,620
It was pretty good, actually.

1043
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,090
What a polite
Documental!

1044
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,860
For real
nothing seemed out of place.

1045
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,730
It felt just right!

1046
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,560
Admirable Japanese behavior.

1047
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,370
Elegant and graceful.

1048
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,170
My book was fine as well?
It was pretty high quality.

1049
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,580
That's just a part
of Japanese culture!

1050
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:12,520
I think Amazon-san would be glad
to import something like that.

1051
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,420
It was a good show.
High class humor.

1052
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,390
High class humor?!

1053
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:22,430
With that picture book,

1054
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:25,060
It kinda makes you want to
invite friends to see it.

1055
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,100
Tell them to come right away.

1056
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,570
That's great!
