1
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,810
Ouch, ouch!

2
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,920
Papa, hurry! I'm gonna be late!

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,930
I'm hurrying.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,480
Papa, Sorata wet the bed!

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,380
What?!

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,640
Again?

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,520
Get changed, quickly.

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,910
Papa, the food is burning.

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:29,770
Crap!

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,500
I'm home.

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,280
Ah, wait a second.

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,830
Sorry, sorry.

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,710
Welcome home, Mama!

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,500
Welcome home.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,850
I'm back.

16
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,500
Want breakfast?

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,170
No. I've worked overtime without sleep.

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,400
I'm gonna take a nap and go back to work.

19
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,400
Call 110 immediately

20
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,400
Notice anyone
suspicious!?

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,070
Take that!

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,550
Run!

23
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,140
Why you...

24
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,770
Hey.

25
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,950
Papa.

26
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,190
Don't talk to strangers.

27
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,570
He's not a stranger.

28
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,920
He's our friend. We'll introduce you.

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,980
How do you do?

30
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,300
Attorney:
Hakamada Yukio

31
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,300
Daichi-kun and his siblings let me play with them.

32
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,760
We're friends, right?

33
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,030
Yes!

34
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,590
Friends, friends!

35
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,600
It's dinner time. Let's go home.

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,820
Yes.

37
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,500
Don't go near that man again.

38
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,160
Why?

39
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,150
He's what you call
a suspicious person.

40
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,110
Suspicious person?

41
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,400
Bye-bye, Mister Suspicious Person!

42
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,880
Bye, suspicious person!

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,800
Suspicious person!

44
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,290
Bye-bye!

45
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,220
Huh? "Suspicious person"?

46
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,210
Oh... No, you've got it wrong.

47
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,020
You've got it wrong.

48
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,700
Call 110 immediately

49
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,700
Notice anyone suspicious!?

50
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,820
I'm not suspicious!

51
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,020
I'm home.

52
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,830
Welcome home.

53
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,290
Look, I sewed these today.

54
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,430
Misshapen somewhat, but not bad, right?

55
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,550
Here.

56
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,910
Petition to Divorce

57
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,320
Petition to Divorce

58
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,320
Sakagami Takeshi    Sakagami Izumi

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,620
What? Why?

60
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,320
Let's get divorced.

61
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,810
What's with this, all of a sudden?

62
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,720
Do you know what day it is?

63
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,550
It's the day you got fired
from your last job.

64
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,840
I told you that I'd divorce you if you
couldn't find employment in a year.

65
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,100
Hang on a second...

66
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,530
Your name goes here.

67
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,500
Press your seal here.

68
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,040
But, I'm going to job interviews.
I'm making an effort.

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,900
I tell my subordinates daily

70
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,290
that their efforts are meaningless
if they don't produce results.

71
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,360
What'll happen if we got divorced?

72
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,540
The kids are still little.
They need a father.

73
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,720
Sorry to say, but the kids
already have a new Papa.

74
00:02:59,130 --> 00:02:59,760
Huh?

75
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,850
He's the president of a partner company.

76
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,110
He's got money, he's reliable,

77
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,250
and he'd be far better for the kids

78
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,440
than a loser father like you.

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,760
You were cheating on me?

80
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,270
It's because you're spineless.

81
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,590
That's enough to make
you cheat on me?!

82
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,930
Don't talk so loudly.

83
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,270
Just press your seal here.

84
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:30,110
Children in wife's custody: Ikegami Daichi, Ikegami Yuna, Ikegami Sorata

85
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,820
You're taking the children
away from me, too?

86
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,020
Of course. I'm their mother.

87
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,730
Or do you think an unemployed,
inadequate man like you

88
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,490
could care for them?

89
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,690
Papa, I have to pee.

90
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,200
Mama will take you.

91
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,580
I gotcha.

92
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,850
Let's go.

93
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,690
Rock paper scissors.

94
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,760
I lost.

95
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,460
You lose.

96
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,960
Rock paper scissors.

97
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,320
Hello.

98
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,110
You again?

99
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,090
Daichi-kun talked to me.

100
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,420
He said, "Papa does all
the household chores,

101
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,890
and takes care of the three of us."

102
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,450
You're a homemaker husband, aren't you?

103
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,620
Something wrong with that?

104
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,830
No, no. Nothing wrong at all.

105
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:47,770
Daichi-kun bragged that
his Papa is always home.

106
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,090
Well...

107
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,960
my life with my children
might be coming to an end.

108
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,380
I know I'm overstepping
my bounds, but...

109
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,910
are you getting a divorce?

110
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,940
It's all my fault.

111
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,880
I couldn't find
employment for a year,

112
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,980
and my wife was the breadwinner.

113
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,210
But to be honest,

114
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,190
I don't want to leave my children.

115
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,310
Why am I telling you all this?

116
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,550
It's true,

117
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,430
that the mother has the advantage
when it comes to custody battles.

118
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,730
Even more so when
the children are young.

119
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,640
However, if you believe a father
can never be awarded custody,

120
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,730
that is not the case.

121
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,360
What?

122
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,120
With regard to marriage laws,
men and women are treated equally.

123
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,370
You've been unable to
find work for a year.

124
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,890
However, you supported your family

125
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,390
by doing chores and looking
after your children.

126
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,370
I believe you have a good
chance of receiving custody.

127
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,860
Are you serious?

128
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,720
A laid-off father can get custody?

129
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,090
I don't believe it's impossible.

130
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,610
Like I said,

131
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,780
men and women are equal under the law.

132
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,110
In your household,

133
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,940
the mother earns the money
to support the family.

134
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,500
In which case you can get
child support from her,

135
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,470
and you raise your children.

136
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,030
Is that possible?

137
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,090
Yes.

138
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,560
If we can prove that the children
would be happier living with you.

139
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,290
"Prove"?

140
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,700
Who are you?

141
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,490
Me?

142
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,580
I am...

Sakagami Takeshi (42)
Fired from an electrical company a year ago,
and became a homemaker husband.

147
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,740
Wife: Sakagami Izumi (38)
Interior decorator company

148
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,890
Let's see...

149
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,750
Sakagami Takeshi, 42 years old.

150
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,940
This episode's client:
Sakagami Takeshi

151
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,080
Fired from an electrical
company a year ago,

152
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,710
Homemaker Husband

153
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,710
and became a homemaker husband.

154
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,520
Wife, Sakagami Izumi, 38 years old.

155
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,450
Office landlord:
Toyama Yoshie

156
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,450
Temp:
Shinozuka Rina

157
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,760
Interior decorator company
managerial assistant.

158
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,230
So the male-female roles
reversed after you were fired.

159
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,290
Um... and you two are?

160
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,240
I'm a temp.

161
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,020
I'm the landlord.

162
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,930
Landlord?

163
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,190
Everyone, please mind your own business,
and get back to work.

164
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes.

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,330
What's the reason for the divorce?

166
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,900
Oh, I'm Sensei's assistant, Nonomura.

167
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,130
Well...

168
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,510
The reason for the divorce is...

169
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,350
That's an easy one!

170
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,010
The wife got fed up with her
jobless, pathetic husband,

171
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,110
and stuck him with a Petition to Divorce.

172
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,980
She jumped ship in
favor of a capable man.

173
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,080
You're being too blunt.

174
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,360
Please get back to your work.

175
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,720
Yes.

176
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,240
Please excuse them.

177
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,710
That's okay.

178
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,760
What they said is true.

179
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,710
I had been warned by my wife,

180
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,650
that if I didn't find employment
within a year after getting fired,

181
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,660
she would divorce me.

182
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,610
I thought she was kidding,

183
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,840
Hakamada's Assistant:
Nonomura Kanae

184
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,840
but I guess not.

185
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,210
She said she's going to remarry

186
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,220
the president of an associate company
as soon as the divorce is official.

187
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,520
That is an intelligent choice.

188
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,530
A hopeful company president
is better than a hopeless husband.

189
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,530
After all, a woman wants
a man to protect her.

190
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,690
Hey, you two!

191
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,960
If you keep it up...

192
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,690
I won't pay the rent or your wages.

193
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,540
I'm very sorry.

194
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,000
That's okay.

195
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,800
I'm useless, so it's my fault.

196
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,810
Sakagami-san, please don't worry.

197
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,410
If your wife admits
to an illicit affair,

198
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,150
we can sue her for compensation.

199
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,250
And the matter of being
useless isn't that important,

200
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,420
when it comes to the
determination of custody.

201
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,460
What's important, then?

202
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,610
In fact, there are three criteria
for determining custody.

203
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:43,840
Criteria for determining custody

204
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,470
Number one, quality of childcare.

205
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:43,840
(1) Quality of childcare.

206
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,910
Number two, mental and
physical soundness.

207
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:43,840
(2) Mental and physical soundness.

208
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,340
And number three,

209
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,020
affection toward the children.

210
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:43,840
(3) Affection toward the children.

211
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,470
In other words, the advantage
of custody goes to the parent

212
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,590
who does the best at childcare,
who is of sound mind and health,

213
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,840
and who is most affectionate
toward their children.

214
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,550
Yes.

215
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,750
The important thing in deciding custody

216
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,880
is which parent will ensure the children's happiness.

217
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,820
My children's happiness...

218
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,570
Sakagami-san.

219
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,820
Are you confident you can
make your children happy?

220
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,140
Absolutely.

221
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,190
I know can do better than
my wife in that regard.

222
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,410
Understood.

223
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,570
In that case, you are
officially my client.

224
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,970
Compensation. Custody. Child support.

225
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,670
Let's win them all!

226
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,600
I'm in your hands!

227
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,400
Now that it's official,
let's start by gathering material.

228
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,680
Material?

229
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,010
First, pertaining to the
quality of child care:

230
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,010
Sakagami

231
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:26,340
please keep a detailed record
that clearly shows who is

232
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,080
Takeshi's wife:
Sakagami Izumi

233
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,080
in charge of childcare.

234
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,050
The kids want to go on
a picnic this weekend.

235
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,460
PTA meeting 15:00 ~

236
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,460
Picnic

237
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,460
I'll be on a business trip.

238
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,010
How about on the parent
visitation day the week after?

239
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,810
I can't take a weekday off.

240
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,260
Understood.

241
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,700
Classroom Visit Information for Parents

242
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,800
Only the father will attend

243
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,590
Next, check on your health.

244
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,340
Detailed health evaluation report
Areas of physical examination  Evaluation
Internal examination: Good
Exterior physical examination: Good
Color perception examination: Good
Visual examination: Good
Auditory examination: Good
Blood pressure examination: Good

245
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,250
It is important that there is both
physical and mental soundness.

246
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,670
Health evaluation report

247
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,670
Mr. Sakagami Takeshi

Overall evaluation

248
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
And...

249
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,390
Affection toward the children.

250
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,840
Second son:
Sakagami Sorata

251
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,060
Shower them with it as usual,
without any reserve.

252
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,310
Hang in there, Sorata.

253
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,020
Oldest daughter:
Sakagami Yuna

254
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,020
Oldest son:
Sakagami Daichi

255
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,020
Hang in there.

256
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,110
Hello.

257
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,840
You haven't left yet?

258
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,160
I'm on my way home. I'll call you later.

259
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,320
Hello?

260
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,830
You okay?

261
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,220
You okay?

262
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,130
Child Care Schedule

263
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,500
Is there enough here
to convince the wife?

264
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,890
Probably not.

265
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,310
What?

266
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,810
What's the point of this, then?

267
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,440
Usually, custody is determined
by mutual discussion.

268
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,310
But if they cannot reach an agreement,

269
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,340
it goes to conciliation or trial.

270
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,610
When it comes down to that,
appropriateness of custody

271
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,850
will be determined by a third party.

272
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,890
So you're getting ready in
case it goes to a conciliator.

273
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,890
Newly Published Examples of Legal Cases

274
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,430
Examples of supreme court hearings

275
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,080
The truth is that when it
comes to custody battles,

276
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,240
the mother has a distinct advantage.

277
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,070
The statistics say the mother is awarded custody
approximately 80% of the time.

278
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,640
Custody → Awarded to mother in 80% of cases

279
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,750
But, the mother is guilty
of an illicit affair.

280
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,990
Wouldn't that fact give
Sakagami-san an advantage?

281
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,910
Unfortunately, illicit affairs have
little bearing on custody conciliation,

282
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,450
because it can't be effectively argued
that she can't care for her children,

283
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,520
simply due to adulterous behavior.

284
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,420
So that's how it is...

285
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,620
In that case, what more does
Sakagami-san need to receive custody?

286
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,170
Let's see...

287
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,490
It would really help
if there's a neighbor

288
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,730
who assists him in childcare.

289
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,450
Have a nice day.

290
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:27,330
Takeshi's big sister:
Hara Misae

291
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,030
Thanks for babysitting today, Sis.

292
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,570
We always have each others' backs.

293
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,050
Good luck at the job interview.

294
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,040
Auntie, when's lunch?

295
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,340
All right, all right,
it's omelettes today.

296
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,020
Okay, let's do this.

297
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,790
Oh!

298
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,880
It's the suspicious person!

299
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,060
Mister Suspicious Person, play with us!

300
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,490
You've got it wrong.

301
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,760
This man isn't a suspicious person.

302
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,830
He's a lawyer.

303
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,680
What's a lawyer?

304
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,800
A lawyer is...

305
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,400
someone who helps those in trouble,
or who can't protect themselves.

306
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,560
Wow, that's like a superhero of justice.

307
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,340
Cool.

308
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,060
If anything troubles you,

309
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,540
you all can talk to Sensei.

310
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,710
He will solve all your problems.

311
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,010
Really? Promise?

312
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,160
Of course.

313
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:23,230
Pinky promise. If you lie, you have
to swallow a thousand needles.

314
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,820
It's sealed by our fingers.

315
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,390
You promised!

316
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,440
Yes.

317
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,710
Hakamada-sensei.

318
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,490
How was the job interview?

319
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,670
I got rejected. Again.

320
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,970
"Daruma-san... fell down!"

321
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,320
Please cheer up.

322
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,640
The investigation is
making steady progress.

323
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,940
Thank you very much.

324
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,400
At first I thought you
were just suspicious,

325
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,710
but you're actually an amazing person,
Hakamada sensei.

326
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,170
No...

327
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,590
the battle has only just begun.

328
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,870
The most crucial thing will be

329
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,930
when you tell the children about the divorce.

330
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,340
When you tell them, you must not,
under any circumstances

331
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,910
say anything disparaging about your wife.

332
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,770
Yes.

333
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,310
Though she is committing adultery,

334
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,380
though she is not caring
for the children,

335
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Izumi-san is still
their mother, after all.

336
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,940
No matter how much animosity
lies between you two...

337
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,890
the battle between husband and wife
should never be revealed to the children.

338
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,150
I understand.

339
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,280
"Daruma-san fell down."

340
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,430
You're it.

Hakamada Law Office

342
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,670
I have the results of the
wife's background check.

Freelance investigator:
Umemoto Kurumi

344
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,540
She's having a ball with her cheating partner,
while calling it work.

345
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,010
She comes home early in the morning
because she's been in hotels.

346
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,350
What would the kids
think if they found out?

347
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,080
Looks like her daily excesses
are taking a toll on her.

348
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,200
Her health report isn't all that good.

Health Examination Report

351
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,760
In contrast, there is no problem with
Takeshi-san's childcare ability,

352
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,790
state of health,
or affection toward his children.

353
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,890
He's a failure as a man
but a success as a father.

354
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:17,320
Based on this, Sakagami-san
meets all the criteria.

355
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,980
Sensei, it looks like
he could win custody.

356
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,760
It's too soon to rejoice.

357
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,140
There is still one thing Sakagami-san
is missing to win custody.

358
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,560
What's that?

359
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,140
Financial effectualness.

360
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:36,580
He must be able to provide for his children
if he is to win custody.

361
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,670
He needs to find work soon,

362
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,450
so he can claim steady income.

363
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:46,660
It's going to be quite tough
for a man in his 40s to find work.

364
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,990
That's true.

365
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,060
I've got it.

366
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,260
What?

367
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,180
I got a job. Finally.

368
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,200
They gave me an
unofficial letter of hire.

369
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,200
Mister Sakagami Takeshi
Informal notice of hire

370
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,300
No way.

371
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,010
That means...

372
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,280
Looks like we're ready for battle.

373
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,850
Horsey. Horsey.

374
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,300
Okay! Giddyap!

375
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,010
Hey, stop playing around.

376
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,270
Go play in the other room.

377
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,880
Yes.

378
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,020
Sorry about that.

379
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,570
No problem.

380
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,220
This is from summer last year.

381
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,440
We were still a close family, then.

382
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,580
Hey, hey.

383
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,180
When are we going on the picnic?

384
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,580
You promised, remember?

385
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,920
You said we're going on a family picnic.

386
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,620
I wanna go!

387
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,240
I wanna go! I wanna go!

388
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,550
I'm home.

389
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,120
Look after them, Daichi.

390
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,920
Yeah. We're going to the playground.

391
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,960
Bye.

392
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,030
Have fun.

393
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,930
A lawyer? What's going on here?

394
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,140
Hakamada Yukio,
Attorney at Law

395
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,520
Did you hire him using
the money I earned?

396
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,290
Sakagami-san hasn't paid me anything yet.

397
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:56,260
I will get a portion of the
compensation you will be paying.

398
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,590
Compensation?

399
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,670
Compensation for illicit activities.

400
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,370
This photo was taken
on Saturday, February 15th.

401
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,990
Daichi-kun and children
wanted to go on a picnic,

402
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,000
but you lied and said you
were going on a business trip.

403
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,590
Instead, you were having a secret
tryst with your illicit partner.

404
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,950
This is from the day of
classroom visitation.

405
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,540
This is from the day of the PTA meeting.

406
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,700
You have spent time
with your illicit partner,

407
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,960
under the pretext of working.

408
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,640
And what about it?

409
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,230
That man means more to you
than your children, doesn't he?

410
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,960
So why do you want custody?

411
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,640
I'm their mother. Of course I do.

412
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,000
"I'm their mother. Of course I do."

413
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,960
Is that so?

414
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,410
You're in a position of responsibility
in your profession.

415
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,370
You will continue to work
after you remarry, won't you?

416
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,700
Of course I will.

417
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,200
Who will look after the children, then?

418
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,840
About that...

419
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,140
I have definite plans.

420
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,110
In case Sakagami-san gets custody,

421
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,720
Sakagami-san's sister, who recently

422
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,110
moved to the neighborhood,
will help out with the kids.

423
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,550
Do you have anyone who can help you out?

424
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,950
Well, I...

425
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,150
You don't have anyone.

426
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,590
How do you plan on
raising your children?

427
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,800
I'll hire a babysitter.

428
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,430
You won't raise your own children,

429
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,740
but have someone else do it for you?

430
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,110
Will the kids be happy with that?

431
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,530
Who the hell do you think you are?!

432
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,630
You're a total stranger.

433
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,870
Stay out of our family's business!

434
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,310
I am not a total stranger.

435
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,780
I am Daichi-kun's friend.

436
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,050
Friend?

437
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,220
Yes.

438
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,110
Daichi, hurry up and pack.

439
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,100
Yuna, Sonata, be quick about it.

440
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,570
Stop it.

441
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,020
Let go of me!

442
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,520
Mama, what's the matter?

443
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,660
Let's go to your new Papa's place.

444
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,680
What?

445
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,810
New Papa?

446
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,310
Is our Papa old?

447
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,860
Let's not stay with
this no-good Papa.

448
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,050
Let's live in a new house,
with a new Papa.

449
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,040
You'll have lots of goodies to eat.

450
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,530
He'll buy you tons of stuff you like.

451
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,360
Okay?

452
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,820
I don't want a new Papa.

453
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,710
I'm not going!

454
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,780
Daichi!

455
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,060
I'm not going, either!

456
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,440
I'm not going!

457
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,910
Stop being difficult,
and come with Mama!

458
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,530
Come on.

459
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,990
I don't wanna go!

460
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,070
I'm not going!

461
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,060
Stop talking like that to the children!

462
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,080
I'm coming back for all of you.

463
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,620
I got a call from Sakagami-san.

464
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,970
The wife left the house
without the kids, after our visit.

465
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,600
Isn't that really lucky for us, though?

466
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,260
Leaving the house and her kids behind

467
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,050
will put her at a disadvantage
in the custody battle, right?

468
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,290
Yes, well, that's true, but...

469
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,440
What's wrong, Sensei?

470
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,400
You look worried.

471
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,780
I may have made a huge mistake.

472
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,960
What do you mean?

473
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,460
Your clients are here.

474
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,030
Come on in.

475
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,430
Cute clients at that.

476
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,060
I'll leave the rest to you.

477
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,760
Daichi-kun.

478
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,600
What happened?

479
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,300
Here.

480
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,900
Pocket Money

481
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,340
Please!

482
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,810
Please don't let Papa
and Mama get divorced!

483
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,640
Huh?

484
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,850
Mister,

485
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,850
please make Papa and
Mama be friends again.

486
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,080
Please!

487
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,320
Please!

488
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,820
We want to live with Papa and Mama.

489
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,220
We don't want to be separated.

490
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,580
Daichi-kun,

491
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,880
Your Papa and Mama will live separately...

492
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,980
but your Mama will always be your Mama.

493
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,110
You're a family, and that will never change.

494
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,910
Your Papa, Mama, and I
want you all to be happy,

495
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,750
That's the most important thing.

496
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,720
Liar!

497
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,790
If that's the most important thing,
why are they getting divorced?

498
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,460
We want to be together
with Papa and Mama.

499
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,480
Isn't your job, Mister,

500
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,920
to help people in trouble?

501
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,940
Aren't you the superhero of justice?

502
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:36,980
You said you'd help
me if I'm in trouble.

503
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,260
You promised!

504
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,320
You promised, didn't you?

505
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,270
Daichi-kun, I...

506
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,070
Forget it!

507
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,190
Let's go.

508
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,930
Come on. Let's go.

509
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,270
Let's go.

510
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,440
Let's go.

511
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,950
Let's go to your
new Papa's place.

512
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,620
Is our Papa old?

513
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,620
New Papa?

514
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,490
I don't want
a new papa!

515
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,490
I don't want it!

516
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,490
I'm not going!

517
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,190
Children are the victims
in custody battles, aren't they?

518
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,190
Editor at Tokiwa Publishing:
Tabata Misato

519
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,120
Misato-san.

520
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,690
You're crying while reading my manga...

521
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,260
Here.

522
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,230
Cafe waitress:
Mizutani Sara

523
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,430
I see them. I feel them.

524
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,950
Spores spreading out into space.

525
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,070
The cause of your tears is...

526
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,070
cedar.

527
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,530
Or perhaps cypress!

528
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,050
Do you have hay fever?

529
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,040
It will get worse in spring.

530
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,710
My handkerchief will need washing.

531
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,160
Enjoy.

532
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,160
Delicious.

533
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,220
Which means... things aren't going well.

534
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,170
He makes good bread
when he's distressed.

535
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,190
I just heard,

536
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,610
Sakagami-san's wife has
a legal representative.

537
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,400
They called about the conciliation.

538
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,640
I see.

539
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,070
Sensei, are you worrying
about the children?

540
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,100
Yes. You could say that.

541
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,100
Sensei, you did nothing wrong.

542
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,090
I know they'll eventually understand.
Daichi-kun, too.

543
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,870
No. It's my fault.

544
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,040
I told Sakagami-san that the children's feelings
are of utmost importance, and yet,

545
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,190
they heard about the divorce
in the worst way possible.

546
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,620
That's because the wife got
angry and left in a huff.

547
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,680
I'm the one who made his wife angry.

548
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,750
It was my mistake.

549
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,080
Yes, Hakamada Law Office.

550
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,910
Sakagami-san?

551
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,830
What?

552
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,740
Daichi-kun and the others?

553
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,630
They left quite a long time ago.

554
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,710
Hakamada
Law Office

555
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,210
Hakamada-sensei.

556
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,150
Sakagami-san.

557
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,110
They're not at school or the playground.

558
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,170
What about your sister's house?

559
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,380
Not there, either.

560
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,160
I bet it's my wife.

561
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,320
My wife kidnapped them!

562
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,760
Do you know where her new residence is?

563
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,460
I've got the address. Let's go.

564
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,280
Sakagami-san.

565
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,330
The divorce is not yet final.

566
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:30,140
If the divorce is not yet final

567
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,480
She can't be charged for kidnapping.

568
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:30,140
If the wife takes the children,
she cannot be charged with kidnapping.

569
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,160
Is that so?

570
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,590
Not only that, if your children's life
with your wife stabilizes,

571
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,660
there's a possibility that
your wife will get custody.

572
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,110
That can't be...

573
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,630
Please, give the children back!

574
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,950
You're stubborn.
I told you, they're not here.

575
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,580
You're lying.

576
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,760
I'm not lying.

577
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,490
If you don't believe me,
go look inside, everywhere.

578
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:52,210
It's true that I approached them
and asked them to live with me.

579
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,960
In front of that lawyer's office.

580
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,000
But...

581
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,370
They wouldn't come with me.

582
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,440
Really?

583
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,000
Really.

584
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,470
Then, where could they be?

585
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,740
How would I know?

586
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,880
It's your fault for neglecting them!

587
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,370
Don't make it my fault!

588
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,800
It's all your fault!

589
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,890
You'll be held responsible
if anything happens to them!

590
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,580
This is no time for quarreling.

591
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,160
Let's split up and look for them.

592
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,180
Daichi-kun!

593
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,730
Daichi-kun!

594
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,550
Daichi-kun!

595
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,760
Yuna-chan!

596
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,470
Sorata-kun!

597
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,740
Daichi!

598
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,140
Yuna!

599
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,830
Sorata!

600
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,420
Brother, I'm cold.

601
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,970
Let's go home.

602
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,330
No way. We're never going home.

603
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,210
Where's the picnic place?

604
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,590
We'll never get there.

605
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,830
Brother.

606
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,540
What's that?

607
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,400
I'm scared.

608
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,510
Don't worry.

609
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,190
Ghost!

610
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,590
Who are you calling a ghost?!

611
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,110
Hakamada-sensei,

612
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,660
I've got the kids. They're safe.

613
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:47,270
Thanks to Iron Spy Woman
Marilyn, season 15, episode 7.

614
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,370
Iron Spy Woman
Marilyn

615
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,750
Finding missing persons
is easy as pie.

616
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,340
Because...

617
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:55,800
99% of missing persons have left
a clue behind in their homes.

618
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,480
Daichi, why did you do this?

619
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,790
I won't know if you don't tell me.

620
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,830
I think Daichi-kun
yearned for this place,

621
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,400
where he and his family went together.

622
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,670
Is that so?

623
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,840
Daichi.

624
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,690
Please, don't give
your Papa a hard time.

625
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,210
You're the one giving us a hard time.

626
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,520
I want to live with Papa
and Mama. That's all!

627
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,250
Papa, you're stupid!

628
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:40,460
Daichi-kun.

629
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,290
Don't touch me!

630
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,980
I hate you!

631
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,030
Daichi.

632
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,640
You liar!

633
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,660
Mama told me about you.

634
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,900
You're not a superhero of justice!

635
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,010
You're a villain that's splitting
Mama and Papa apart!

636
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,130
I'm not your friend anymore!

637
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,840
Daichi, enough is enough!

638
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,860
Papa, Mama, and Mister,

639
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,550
I hate you all!

640
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,840
I don't believe you did
anything wrong, Sensei.

641
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,570
Huh?

642
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,140
You're doing everything you can

643
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,700
to the best of your ability,

644
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,070
for the sake of
Sakagami-san and the kids.

645
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,980
You've done nothing wrong.

646
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:39,350
No, he's not entirely incorrect.

647
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,420
From the perspective
of the children,

648
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,180
I am a villain.

649
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:51,270
Because I'm helping their beloved
Papa and Mama get a divorce.

650
00:31:53,420 --> 00:32:00,200
It's only natural that children
will want to live as a family.

651
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:05,240
I always felt that way
when I was a child, too.

652
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,890
But, it was the wife's illicit activities

653
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,150
that broke the family apart.

654
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,020
She doesn't participate in household duties,
or caring for her children.

655
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,620
Instead she's out committing adultery.

656
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,680
How can the children be happy
living with a mother like that?

657
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:25,020
Regardless, she's their
one and only mother.

658
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,510
They want to live together as a family.

659
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,430
Lawyers are powerless
at a time like this.

660
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,150
Sensei is so gloomy lately.

661
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,020
Tomorrow is the conciliation.

662
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,620
I wonder if he's ready for it.

663
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,070
The children running away

664
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,260
might reverberate loudly
at conciliation court.

665
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,030
And if that happens,
the mother will get custody.

666
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,440
If that happens,

667
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,340
how will he pay the three
months worth of rent?

668
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,670
Court of Law

669
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:20,160
We will now commence the
conciliation hearing.

670
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:22,610
Family Court: Conciliation Room

671
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,750
Both parties have their
respective attorneys.

672
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,050
Both parties have wished for them
to be present at the discussion.

673
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,590
Hence, we have arranged
the session accordingly.

674
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,810
According to the family conciliator,

675
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,850
it would be appropriate for the mother,
Izumi-san, to get custody of her children.

676
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,930
Izumi's lawyer:
Shoji Akiko

677
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,930
The other day,

678
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,650
there was an incident wherein
the children ran away from home.

679
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,210
The children were under
Takeshi-san's supervision at the time.

680
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,870
If Takeshi-san were to get custody,

681
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,890
something like that could
very well happen again.

682
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:52,810
I cannot rely on a person like that
to watch over my children.

683
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,310
And with regard to the
financial situation...

684
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:58,920
pardon me for asking, but Takeshi-san,
what is your annual income?

685
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,070
I plan for it to be around
three and a half million yen.

686
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,620
You recently found a job, correct?

687
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,500
Yes.

688
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,490
At an electrical engineering company.

689
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,320
I will work hard and get promoted.

690
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,150
Or get fired, again.

691
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,230
Izumi-san's annual income
is six million yen.

692
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,260
The partner she would remarry
earns 12 million yen.

693
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,910
That makes a total of 18 million yen.

694
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:25,240
In terms of affording a good
education for the children...

695
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,970
they are nowhere lacking.

696
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,270
Sensei, are you all right?

697
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,650
If I may.

698
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,340
Please.

699
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,200
Firstly, concerning
the runaway incident.

700
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,990
Izumi-san is the cause of
the children running away.

701
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,930
Izumi-san revealed the
plan to divorce to them,

702
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:46,510
and thereby hurt her
children's feelings deeply.

703
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,930
What's that supposed to mean?

704
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:51,900
The most careful one must
be when divorcing...

705
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,870
is when that fact is
revealed to children.

706
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,240
But Izumi-san lost
control of her emotions.

707
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,100
She disparaged Takeshi-san
in front of them,

708
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,010
and deeply hurt her children's feelings.

709
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,120
Let's not stay here
with this no-good Papa.

710
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,980
Let's live in a new house,
with a new Papa.

711
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,040
She could very well have
such outbursts again,

712
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,540
neglecting her children's feelings.

713
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,720
I merely spoke the truth.

714
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,790
There's no point in lying to them.

715
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:19,610
Next, with regard to the
financial situation.

716
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,780
Indeed, Izumi-san's new partner

717
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,500
is the president of an associate
company, isn't that so?

718
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,190
Have you changed your
mind about marrying him?

719
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,900
I have not.

720
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,420
I see.

721
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,300
We have a problem, then.

722
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,280
His annual income may
very well be 12 million yen.

723
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,280
But his company is in debt
far beyond that amount.

724
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:42,850
What?

725
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,520
They've been in the red
for several years now.

726
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,350
They have been delinquent with taxes.

727
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,350
Federal Income Tax Delinquency:
Foreclosure Warning

728
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,790
They have unpaid salaries.

729
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,790
Bill for Unpaid Wages

730
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,960
They have been delinquent
in paying back loans.

731
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,960
Final Notice

732
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,310
Thus, their bankruptcy
is only a matter of time.

733
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,290
That can't be.

734
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,800
Eventually, Izumi-san's income

735
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,630
will be redirected to paying back their debts.

736
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:06,940
You had said you would hire a babysitter
to look after your children.

737
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,890
That is looking rather difficult now.

738
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,580
How will you pay your attorney fees?

739
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,210
Also,

740
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,370
your partner has a child
from his previous marriage.

741
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,260
His ex-wife has custody of the child.

742
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,420
Do you know why he gave her custody?

743
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,490
Because he knows it's better
for the mother to have custody.

744
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,980
Wrong.

745
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,010
It appears he doesn't
like his child much.

746
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:36,060
His violent actions toward his ex-wife and child
were the cause of their divorce.

747
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,160
The police became involved
on multiple occasions.

748
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,310
Will your children

749
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,710
be happy living with a person like that?

750
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,130
I will now express my
opinion as conciliator.

751
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,030
Gauging the overall situation,

752
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,500
the custody of all three children

753
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:17,590
should go to the father, Takeshi-san.

754
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,380
Izumi-san, is this agreeable?

755
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,860
I cannot accept that.

756
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,870
If you cannot accept it,

757
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,550
we can dismiss the
conciliation as undetermined,

758
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,650
and you can take it to court to
have a judge make the decision.

759
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,620
You can appeal it,

760
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,930
but I doubt you'd get custody.

761
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,060
It appears both parties
are in agreement.

762
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,450
I now declare the
conciliation as determined—

763
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,460
One moment please.

764
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,300
What is it?

765
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,770
I am sorry to say,

766
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:52,580
but I think both Sakagami-san and
Izumi-san are unfit to take on custody.

767
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,540
Hakamada-sensei.

768
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,990
If the two of you really
care about your children,

769
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,880
why did you destroy their happiness?

770
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:17,020
All you were concerned about
was who would win custody.

771
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,950
Children are not your possessions.

772
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,850
The children are innocent.

773
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,710
Children always end up the victims.

774
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,050
If you truly care about your children,

775
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,030
then you must first ask their forgiveness,
for having destroyed their happiness.

776
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,990
You need to keep your heads bowed,

777
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,530
until their wounds are healed.

778
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,800
And you must wish for their happiness,

779
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,980
from the bottom of your heart.

780
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:11,910
Isn't that where their happiness begins?

781
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,250
You.

782
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,250
You're a lawyer.
What do you know?

783
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,170
This is ridiculous.

784
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:52,380
We're going to be living
apart from Mama.

785
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:54,460
It's Papa's fault.

786
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,490
This time it really is.

787
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:02,590
No! I don't want to
live apart from Mama!

788
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,130
Why is Mama going away?

789
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,140
I want Mama to live with us!

790
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,440
I'm sorry.

791
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,450
Hakamada
Law Office

792
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:28,090
I'm so glad for Sakagami-san.

793
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,720
He got custody and child support.

794
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,240
But why did he withdraw
the compensation fee?

795
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,680
He must've taken Izumi-san's
future into consideration.

796
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,410
He's a pushover.

797
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:42,410
If it were me, I'd mercilessly
collect what I could.

798
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,900
I'd chase them down to the pits of Hell!

799
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,810
Me too, to the pits of Hell.

800
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,900
Oh! Rent comes first.

801
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,540
My wages come first.

802
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,880
Um...

803
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,680
Your wages come last.

804
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,500
Never mind that.

805
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,050
Where is Hakamada-sensei?

806
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,790
Oh, come to think of it...

807
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,620
I bet he went into hiding.

808
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:05,460
Unforgiveable. I'll chase
him to the pits of Hell!

809
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,070
Oh, it's Mister!

810
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:10,830
Stop, Sorata.

811
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,570
That guy's not our friend any more.

812
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,100
Let's go play over there.

813
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,820
Daichi-kun!

814
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,220
I am sorry.

815
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,560
You're right about me, Daichi-kun.

816
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,250
I was a liar.

817
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,670
I'm not cool at all.

818
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,050
I'm a no-good lawyer.

819
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:43,780
I couldn't keep my promise
with my precious friend.

820
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,600
I am truly sorry!

821
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,580
Mister.

822
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,450
I already knew you're no superhero.

823
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,200
I knew it.

824
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,520
I knew it, too.

825
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,940
I never thought you were cool, either.

826
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,930
I never thought so.

827
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,300
I never thought so!

828
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,600
One, two...

829
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,050
But we'll play with you anyway. Come on.

830
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:22,770
Let's go.

831
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,010
Why you...

832
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,970
Wait!

833
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,340
You better run!

834
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,080
Why you...

835
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,030
Hey!

836
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,380
Wait!

837
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:56,400
Next episode

838
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,090
We're not officially married.

839
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:51,330
Get your hands
off my husband!

840
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:55,900
Unofficial wife VS official wife

841
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,580
You're the one
that started this!

842
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:55,900
Which one is the real wife?

843
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,940
I'm his wife!

844
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,900
I'm his wife!

845
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,440
Please stop it, both of you!

846
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:59,970
This drama is a work of fiction

847
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,940
You're both the victims here!
