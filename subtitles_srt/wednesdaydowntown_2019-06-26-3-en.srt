1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,310
...where we investigate theories from our everyday life.

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,770
Tonight's presenters are...

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,310
It's Kamaitachi!

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,170
Let's get right into it. Today we've brought a theory...

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,680
...regarding a type of food that everyone loves.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,760
Let's take a look.  Here it is:

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:32,270
If you send the smell of curry into a meeting, the person will eat curry afterwards.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,150
I don't think there's any doubt about this one.

9
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,850
Today we investigate the theory:

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:47,990
If you send the smell of curry into a meeting, the person will eat curry afterwards.

11
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:55,670
Today we've brought in six comedians for a meeting before lunchtime...

12
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:01,190
...where we will be sending in the smell of curry from the next room.

13
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,490
If all six eat curry after the meeting, the theory has been proved correct.

14
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,090
Our first target is...

15
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,490
Abereru-kun.

16
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,490
He's so bald!

17
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,940
As they start the meeting for the fake show...

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,810
...we begin our grand curry plan!

19
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,090
And then...

20
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,030
Do you smell something good?

21
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,120
Something smells good, right?

22
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,630
It smells like curry, doesn't it?

23
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,490
Did you eat some?

24
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,490
Staff: No, I didn't have any.

25
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,610
It smells amazing.

26
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,160
We continued to send in the smell of curry.

27
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,340
Staff: OK, that's it for today.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,340
Thank you very much.

29
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,500
The meeting is over.

30
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,110
Abareru-kun is in the driver's seat as he leaves the TBS office.

31
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:03,850
From here we enlist our friends at the HAL detective agency.

32
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,830
We continue the investigation.

33
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,510
After driving for 10 minutes...

34
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,610
...we arrive at Koujimachi, where Abereru-kun's next gig is.

35
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,610
When suddenly...

36
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,930
...Abereru-kun stops and stares at a parked car.

37
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,330
On that car?

38
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,030
Curry.

39
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,570
Abereru-kun's destination is...

40
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,360
CoCo Ichi. (A curry restaurant chain.)

41
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,740
With Abereru-kun we have cleared the first level.

42
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,150
He really went!

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,710
Staff: Excuse me.

44
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:07,180
Staff: We're with TBS, can we interview you for a bit?

45
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,180
Wait, what?

46
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,930
Staff: What did you eat just now?

47
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,930
Just now? I had curry.

48
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,590
Staff: Curry?

49
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,590
Yeah...

50
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,690
Curry with spinach.

51
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,890
Staff: Why did you eat curry?

52
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,270
What?  Why?

53
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,530
Because I was hungry? No?

54
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,830
Staff: Any other reasons?

55
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,470
The smell.

56
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,870
Because of the smell.

57
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,410
Staff: The smell?

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,410
Yes.

59
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,340
During the meeting..

60
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,430
...it smelled so delicious.

61
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,650
So we explained today's theory to him.

62
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,590
What is that?!

63
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,720
I fell right into your trap.

64
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,430
This is embarrassing.

65
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,030
The next target is...

66
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,430
...Viking's Nishimura.

67
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:10,550
Just like before, we send in the smell of curry from the room next door.

68
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,270
That smells good.

69
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,120
Staff: It smells good?

70
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,120
Yeah.

71
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,430
Is it curry?

72
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,710
We finish the meeting.

73
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,250
And then Nishimura heads over to...

74
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,250
Where is this?

75
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,230
Sukiya.

76
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,210
While beef on rice is their specialty, Sukiya has a diverse menu.

77
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,890
What did Nishimura end up eating?

78
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,260
Staff: Nishimura-san, pardon me...

79
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,420
Staff: We're with TBS.  Can we speak to you for a minute?

80
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,420
Sure...

81
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,660
Staff: What did you eat just now?

82
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,860
Just now?

83
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,390
I had curry.

84
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,930
CLEAR

85
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,940
We explained today's theory to Nishimura.

86
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,970
Yeah, it did smell like curry.

87
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,020
Staff: Would you say that influenced you?

88
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,790
Ah...I don't really know the answer...

89
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,790
Why the hell not?!

90
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,530
Ugh...I don't like this!

91
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,670
That's so frustrating.

92
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,660
Am I really like that?

93
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,730
Did I really eat it because of the smell?

94
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,230
Of course!

95
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,230
Next we have...

96
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,400
Anthony from Matenrou.

97
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,030
Isn't there a really strong curry smell?

98
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,530
Am I imagining that?

99
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,710
Staff: No, it does.

100
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,710
It does, right?  It smells like curry.

101
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,170
What's going to happen?

102
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,420
After walking around Akasaka for five minutes...

103
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,050
Anthony walks into...

104
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,050
...an udon restaurant.

105
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,450
However, if we look at the menu...

106
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,370
...there's still a chance.

107
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,930
Staff: Anthony-san, excuse me.

108
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,230
Staff: We're from TBS.

109
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,600
This is scary...

110
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,900
...what's going on?

111
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
Staff: We want to ask you a couple of questions.

112
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,940
Staff: What did you eat just now?

113
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,210
Udon.

114
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,610
I was eating udon noodles.

115
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,810
Staff: Udon?

116
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,810
Yeah.

117
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,610
Udon...I was eating curry udon.

118
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,240
CLEAR

119
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,110
Staff: Why did you choose curry udon?

120
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,840
Why? Wait, what is this? I'm scared.

121
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,310
Why? Why?

122
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,930
I wonder why?

123
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,310
It's because the room smelled like curry!

124
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,130
That's it, that's probably why I chose to eat it.

125
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,980
That's it, I was thinking of eating udon...

126
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,480
So we explained today's theory to him.

127
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,420
What is that?!

128
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:45,330
Wait, so I ate it because of that?

129
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,330
Yes.

130
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,790
I feel like such a dweeb.

131
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,110
Everyone feels like that.

132
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,090
Our next target is...

133
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,430
That smells good!

134
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,610
Arapon from Anzen Manzai

135
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,610
It smells like the curry I eat at home.

136
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,030
However, the store he entered was also an udon restaurant.

137
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,450
Hi - ohh what's going on?

138
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,950
Staff: Good afternoon.

139
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,950
Good afternoon.

140
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,590
Staff: Just now, what did you eat?

141
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,760
Just now? I was eating curry udon.

142
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,130
CLEAR

143
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,570
I mean, you would...

144
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,290
I don't know, would you eat it after that?  I did.

145
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,790
Next, the fifth target is...

146
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,270
Kuro-chan

147
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,910
It really...

148
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,090
It really smells good, doesn't it?

149
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,450
Staff: Does it smell good?

150
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,450
Yes.

151
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,750
Curry?

152
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,840
Staff: The smell of curry?

153
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,840
Yes.

154
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,430
Kuro-chan, is it ok
to follow you?

155
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,270
We also have success with Kuro-chan.

156
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,510
Brunch: Veggie curry.

157
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,110
Instead of rice, I'm eating it with veggies.

158
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,870
Healthy! Extra veggies with a small portion of curry.

159
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,210
However, in reality...

160
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,630
...he was hiding the rice under the veggies.

161
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,250
In fact, it was two servings of rice plus udon.

162
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,290
A lie was smeared with extra carbs.

163
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,750
Lastly we have...

164
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,570
Noda Crystal from Magical Lovely.

165
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:38,160
We sent in the smell of curry like we had done before, but...

166
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,510
Staff: About five years?

167
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,510
Yes.

168
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:45,550
Staff: Do you remember how much you were smoking in those days?

169
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,550
I think it was a pack a day.

170
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,750
Unlike the others before him...

171
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,750
...Noda doesn't mention the smell at all.

172
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,510
After the meeting...

173
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,810
...he went from Akasaka to Ogikubo by train.

174
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,110
The restaurant Noda entered was...

175
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,110
...a yakitori restaurant.

176
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,440
The theory was not proven true.

177
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,290
Actually, I don't like curry.

178
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:31,210
In conclusion, some people don't like curry.

179
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,250
So...what did everyone think?

180
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,950
It's brainwashing.

181
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,890
It feels like somehow this can be used to influence people.

182
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,740
By the way, backstage today...

183
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,390
...there was a curry lunch, and a regular lunch.

184
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,080
Which one did you eat?

185
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,580
