00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,540
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,330
Let's get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,690
Youichi Okano

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,590
The Final Moustache

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,240
Final?
-Not exactly a moustache, right?

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,410
It's not a moustache

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,410
Glad to be here

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:34,850
Have you ever received or given a red packet?

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,990
Yes

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,520
Of course, given and received

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,730
How much do Downtown give?

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,270
To be honest, 10,000 yen

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,790
New Year's red packets?

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,200
Yes, yes

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,970
10,000?

16
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,250
For 100 people it would cost 1 million

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,110
I thought you'd give more

18
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,400
Sorry, that's a bit strange

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,510
Really?

20
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,880
10,000 is not enough?

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,700
That's pretty impressive too

22
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,360
Sorry, it's my personal opinion

23
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,390
※Not speaking politely

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,290
Who're you speaking so informally to?

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,260
Whispered, quickly and quietly

26
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,860
Better get to the point quickly

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,830
Sorry, it's my personal opinion

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,830
Today we bring the theory related to the giving and receiving of money

29
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,740
It's hard to get people to accept 10 million

30
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,950
It depends on the reason, right?

31
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,050
Any reason will do?

32
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,970
Yes, different reasons are used

33
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,550
I see

34
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,360
If it seems unreasonable then it may be difficult

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,160
If its the person's savings then they wont take it, right?

36
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,560
Indeed

37
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,390
This is the fun of rich people

38
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,500
Yes

39
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,550
This time the challengers are these three

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,790
Why this expression?

41
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,460
The theory to be tested this time is this

42
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,230
What is this?

43
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,390
Eh?

44
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,440
Whoa!

45
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,230
This is real money

46
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,800
Whoa

47
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,470
"It's hard to get people to accept 10 million"

48
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,330
Ho

49
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:43,180
Now please call out the person who you think will take the 10 million

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,640
Ok

51
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,190
The challenge is to see how many people will accept it in 5 hours

52
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,320
Getting them to take it?

53
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,690
If the other party accepts it, it counts as one point

54
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,400
Suddenly called here to give him money?

55
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,330
Consider your own reasons

56
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,030
Oh, I decide

57
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,400
Need to find a few people to accept

58
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,370
Yes

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,740
Anyone?

60
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,170
Are my juniors ok?

61
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,410
Of course

62
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,210
That's okay, right? There are a lot of poor juniors

63
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,620
The number of people I know is very small

64
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,150
Whether they are juniors or seniors or contemporaries

65
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:28,060
My juniors are all money-minded

66
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,430
I think it will work

67
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,900
But after all, it's 10 million

68
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,980
So, the 5-hour challenge begins

69
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,640
Ogata goes first

70
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,870
Didn't eat, did you?
-No

71
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,010
Awesome

72
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,900
Ichikipuri, one of Ogata's juniors

73
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,250
Cheers

74
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,160
After the cheers, the 10 million challenge starts

75
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,530
How is work now?

76
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:11,600
Less growth since coronavirus

77
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,010
Barely getting by

78
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,610
Barely

79
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,880
But you're really funny

80
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,750
I really like you as a person.
-Thanks

81
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,620
I hope you can succeed

82
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,120
Thank you.
-So...

83
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,520
You come from a small town, your parents must be worried about you

84
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,130
I have been with you as your senior

85
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,130
Yes

86
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,100
See you three or four times a week

87
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,880
A bit forced

88
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,640
I think of myself as your big brother

89
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,670
The padding is too obvious

90
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,170
I also consider Ogata...
-We're together

91
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,950
It's clear there's something to say

92
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,580
I think we are friends for life

93
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,410
Yes

94
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,700
After showing that their relationship goes beyond just junior and senior

95
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,220
The 10 million offer is put forward

96
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,820
So strange to just give them money

97
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,020
Wait a minute

98
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,770
Wait...hey, wait!

99
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,340
Take it

100
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,180
What the hell? No, no, no, no.
-I really like you as a person

101
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,950
What is this?

102
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,980
10 million

103
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,350
I'm treating you like a brother

104
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,220
Scary. Scary. Eh?
-What?

105
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,220
This isn't right, is it?

106
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,950
I'll leave that to you.
-Is this for real?

107
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,620
Of course it's true

108
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,130
It's true

109
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,500
What's happening all of a sudden?
-Take it

110
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,030
Its ok, you can have it.
-No, no, no, no

111
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,700
It's scary.
-Why?

112
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,940
What's so scary about it?
-It's scary, okay?

113
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,910
We are brothers, right?
-No, no, no, no

114
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,770
Brother, right?

115
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,390
Brother, yes

116
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,150
Although we are brothers, this is too sudden

117
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:08,820
The chief is giving you money because you've worked hard

118
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,390
You should take this

119
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,130
This is between men

120
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,990
I'm talking to you as a man

121
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,560
As a man and as a brother

122
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,570
The thin excuse of "you work hard so I'm paying you"

123
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,700
Ogata strives forward

124
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,810
What's going on here?
-Eh?

125
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,440
What's going on?

126
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,980
I also make a lot of money

127
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,520
I just haven't told you that I make a lot of money

128
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,550
I earned...

129
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,160
"King's Brunch", I get more than 3 million for one appearance

130
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,050
Eh?
-I earn that much

131
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,580
What a lie!

132
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,750
Ogata makes up a bold lie and continues to persist

133
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,170
I have everything

134
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:06,640
Have a house, have a car, have a bike, have a dog

135
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,410
So weird

136
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,070
I've got it all!

137
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,330
Money is no longer useful to me

138
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,410
Really

139
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,520
Here you go. It's okay

140
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,420
Let me work on myself a little more

141
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,090
I'll try to make as much money as you

142
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,790
So I can't accept it

143
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,130
I will work hard to earn this much

144
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,100
This money has been earned through your effort

145
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,170
I can't take it

146
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,240
You're such a nice guy!

147
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,080
Ogata's moved!

148
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,790
Ogata's not suitable for this

149
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,980
Sorry, I can't take it

150
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,320
I will try my best

151
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,250
Don't cry!

152
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,220
You're really too good of a guy!

153
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,200
Don't cry, there's no need to cry!

154
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,240
I'll try my best.
-10 million for you. I hope you'll work hard

155
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,210
Thank you

156
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,740
I'll try my best

157
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,310
I really hope you can succeed

158
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,960
Somehow both of them shed tears

159
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,830
Because a bizarre situation has developed

160
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,650
We explain everything here

161
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,800
What?

162
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,560
Eh?

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,530
Downtown is watching

164
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,870
Great!

165
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,070
Thank you

166
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,980
This guy's tear ducts have collapsed

167
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,120
Don't cry, what is wrong with you!?

168
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,500
Ogata is crying too

169
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,920
This guy is really...

170
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,420
This didn't go according to plan

171
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,690
You've been weird

172
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,670
This is not a project to make people cry

173
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,640
Next is the first person Nagano called out

174
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,680
His junior, Whistling Naruo

175
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,990
This approach is conducted in a similar fashion

176
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,480
Well, I hope you'll take it today

177
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,190
Wow, it's very impactful

178
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,880
Eh?

179
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,430
Eh?

180
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,850
10 million

181
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,420
What do you mean?

182
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,390
Shut up and take it

183
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,730
Why're you giving it to me?

184
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,070
I'm telling you, I actually made a lot of money

185
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,400
Exactly the same

186
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,710
How stupid!
-The same approach

187
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,480
It's not like "I'll take it if that's the case"...

188
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,980
I have a higher appearance fee than Sandwichman

189
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,280
Wait a minute...wait a minute. What's going on?

190
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,490
Really?
-Yeah

191
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,150
I can make that much by swinging by hips 4 times

192
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,620
What do you mean "swinging your hips"

193
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,730
Doing this joke

194
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,190
4 times?
-In just 4 times

195
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,830
I usually do 25 at once

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,070
You can make 2.5 million dollars for a commercial performance?
-Yes

197
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,200
I have a high fee

198
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,710
Really?

199
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,430
Ogata's appearance fee was supposedly 3 million

200
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,340
Whereas Nagano's commercial performances supposedly net him 2.5 million

201
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,450
A total dream

202
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,920
Then I'll be honest

203
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,390
I also received it from some senior

204
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,030
Money?
-Money

205
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,130
How much?

206
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,330
10 million, 10 million

207
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,570
After that, there was no pressure, and I immediately became popular

208
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,400
All my work increased in quality

209
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,270
Who was it? Can I ask?

210
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,080
Summers

211
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,310
Summers

212
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,940
It is better to be specific

213
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,710
Although interspersed with falsehoods and lies

214
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,660
No, I can't take it. It's too much

215
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,420
It's scary

216
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,630
No, wait

217
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,300
No, I can't accept it

218
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,520
No way

219
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,270
This side ends with the same result as Ogata's attempt

220
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,510
Wouldn't take it

221
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,840
That pig is pretending to be cool

222
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,950
10 million certainly want it, you pig

223
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,880
How can such a person earn 2.5 million

224
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,080
Kasuga called out...

225
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,050
His junior HEY! Taku-chan

226
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,170
I thought your store was still open

227
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,600
Ah, Oni Soba?
-What time does it open?

228
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,800
Open until 9:30, right?

229
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:04,260
For Taku-chan, the comedian and soba restaurant owner

230
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,830
Kasuga launches his noodle-focused offensive

231
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,380
I don't have any favorite ramen

232
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,750
Yeah

233
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,420
I hope someone can do something about this

234
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:24,610
"I hope you can open a ramen store I like"

235
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,760
And so

236
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,900
I will provide the funding

237
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,340
Will provide funding?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah

238
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,970
So, this

239
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,310
Oh!

240
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,250
It's serious

241
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,150
I've got goosebumps

242
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,250
Great, right?

243
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,790
So with this money

244
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,090
Go do what you're good at

245
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,460
So...

246
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,390
Is it possible?

247
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,400
Of course you can
-Ok

248
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,430
It is not necessary to return the capital

249
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,600
Here's your money

250
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,970
Sorry about that

251
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,670
I accept

252
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,480
I'll be sure to report on the follow-up

253
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:10,630
I accept

254
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,480
It's heavy. It's awesome

255
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,520
That's not right!

256
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,870
That's weird, right?

257
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,800
Readily accepted

258
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,450
Eh?

259
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,960
Something wrong?

260
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,560
No!
-10 million back

261
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,930
You took it

262
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,100
Yes, I did

263
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,870
I thought it was about time

264
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,940
You've been waiting for it? What do you mean?

265
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,910
What do you mean you've been waiting for it?

266
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,810
I thought this day would come

267
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,540
Someone
-Someone is bound to come

268
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,750
Finally!
-Finally got it

269
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,650
Someone was bound to give it to me

270
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,950
Finally

271
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,580
So Kasuga's challenge was successful

272
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,150
Managed to get 1 person to receive 10 million first

273
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,480
The second person called out by Ogata...

274
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,670
It's impossible for Ogata, right?

275
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,900
He is also a junior, Mizuki Watase

276
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,440
Super surprised!

277
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,970
It's okay. Take it

278
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,140
Anyway, I...

279
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,940
Just take it, it's fine

280
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,810
You can take it

281
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,080
Take it. It's okay

282
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,350
Ah?
-Really

283
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,020
How...

284
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,720
I can't.
-It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Take it

285
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,120
Wait a minute

286
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,390
Don't do this

287
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,030
You don't have to fight yourself

288
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,160
It's okay. Take it

289
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,960
This kid is a bit scary

290
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,040
So many strange people

291
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,160
It's okay

292
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,430
No, no, no. Absolutely not

293
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,800
Why?
Ogata, I can't

294
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,500
It's Ogata's hard-earned money

295
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,840
It's okay, I haven't done much for it

296
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,340
Really

297
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,580
Ogata, come on

298
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,970
I'm shaken inside

299
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,450
What's wrong with you?
-Give me a slap

300
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,720
Why? That's scary

301
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,050
Please give me a slap

302
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,390
Really?

303
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,390
Just do it

304
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,230
It's okay to be shaken up

305
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,060
Absolutely not, absolutely not, please give me a slap

306
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,940
Otherwise I won't be able to get along with you in the future

307
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,740
What a disgusting relationship!

308
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,960
I can't do it

309
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,410
Please

310
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,840
Here I go
-Ok!

311
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,710
Here we go.
-Ok!

312
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,320
Why?

313
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,920
Why did you hit me?

314
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,720
Why're you hitting me!?

315
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,460
This guy is so scary

316
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,630
Why do I need to be hit

317
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,340
Therefore, Ogata's second challenge also failed

318
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,080
That's a shame

319
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,150
And for some reason it ended with a slap

320
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,310
Nagano's second person is...

321
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,180
A junior, Dayoshi

322
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:09,220
With this money, life is secure

323
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,320
So you can work on refining your abilities

324
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,660
And then hopefully you will become the man who earns more

325
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,640
I'm really happy

326
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,000
Dayoshi was completely fooled by Nagano and shed tears

327
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,090
Then

328
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,110
Ok, got it

329
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,710
Although it's bad to say

330
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,140
I probably shouldn't

331
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,610
No, you can

332
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,750
No, no, no, no, no, you can't not take it

333
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,080
Don't you want it?
-Yes I do

334
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,650
No, this can't be done

335
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,670
"This is the 10 million that Mr. Nagano gave me to put here."

336
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,960
"Watching this has inspired me"

337
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,260
That's not like me

338
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,430
Yes?

339
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,900
Yes, it is.
-That's right

340
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,730
However, I want the best for you

341
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,900
I know

342
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,340
Ok, I understand

343
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,570
I hope you'll buy some drinks

344
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,810
I'll take it.
-Good

345
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,570
Nagano also achieves his first victory here

346
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,720
Meanwhile, Kasuga goes for his second

347
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,550
Hi-Hi Iwasaki, a former member of the firm

348
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,960
Giving seniors money is super rude, right?

349
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,450
I'm not lending you this or anything

350
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,920
It's just a gift

351
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,530
For you to use

352
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,930
I want to see you spend it

353
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
I can't believe I'm so bothered by receiving money

354
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,970
No, there's no way I can take this

355
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,140
No matter what you say, I can't

356
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,110
No?

357
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,380
No way

358
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,210
In that case I hope you can use it elsewhere

359
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,860
Therefore, the result after 2 people each is shown above

360
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,870
Ogata has yet to succeed

361
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,990
The third person he found was also...

362
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,560
It's scary!

363
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,400
10 million
-It's scary

364
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,600
I can't understand it. It's scary

365
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,000
It's scary!

366
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,710
After that...

367
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,120
It's a lie, right?

368
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,540
This is a fake bill, right?

369
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,750
It's not a fake. I just got it out
-Really?

370
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,940
From a Japanese bank

371
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,310
You can't get it from Japanese banks, right?

372
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,910
I went to pick it up

373
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,600
On the other hand, Nagano...

374
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,920
I've never told anyone but I make more than Sandwichman

375
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,630
Eh?

376
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,560
Similar to Koyuki

377
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,960
Really?

378
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,060
Similar to Shinohiro

379
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,700
Really?

380
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,570
So you'll take the money, right?

381
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,370
Okay, then

382
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,500
I'll take it. I'll take it

383
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,440
Taking it? Ok

384
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,110
Surprisingly, he succeeds twice in a row

385
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,690
The 3rd person that Kasuga, who has now lost the lead, faced was...

386
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,350
Seriously, this...

387
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,650
Fake, right?

388
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,090
Abarenbo

389
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,330
This is money for you

390
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,230
No, no, no, this is not okay

391
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,630
I want you to use it

392
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,070
No, no, no, no, no, impossible

393
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,110
Although rejected...

394
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,580
He's changed since he drank

395
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,260
After drinking many of his favorite drinks...

396
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,960
Mobile Phone

397
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,690
The old one
-Yes

398
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,020
Direct contact

399
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,090
Just say it

400
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,020
So...

401
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,540
I'll take it, then

402
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,380
Does not seem to be a sober judgment

403
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,980
Anyway, he took it

404
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,750
But that's when Kasuga's time limit ends

405
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,760
Overall, he scored the above

406
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,840
Due to time constraints, Nagano also finished

407
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,060
That is...

408
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:17,130
While reconciling with Shinichi

409
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,810
Did they really make up?

410
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:40,380
Nagano's last target was Shinichi, who he previously severed ties with

411
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,520
That is, 10 million

412
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,350
Took it out so fast

413
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,030
I want to support Shinichi

414
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,600
And I hope you have fun!

415
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,840
Really?
-Really

416
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,310
What would you do with the money?

417
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,840
This guy will take it

418
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,520
High-rise apartment, right?

419
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,220
High-rise apartment?
-High Rise Apartment

420
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,950
Move house?

421
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,890
Where? Where?

422
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,890
Minato-ku?
Minato-ku

423
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,280
It is better to increase the unit price

424
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,240
There was no resistance, and he took the $10 million

425
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,540
I should get a ton of girls

426
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,710
You will?
-Yeah

427
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,180
Again!?

428
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,980
You really can't do that

429
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,020
Keep digging traps for me

430
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,120
I can not survive this year

431
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,460
Wednesday just keeps coming

432
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,660
Take responsibility

433
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:55,160
Wednesday, this program is really finished

434
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,480
A program that sours relationships

435
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,100
Can I say something too?

436
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,040
This show is finished

437
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,310
It's still fun to watch

438
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,210
And the fifth person called by Ogata, the last target

439
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,190
An old friend, Nedate

440
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,990
You haven't bought anything you wanted, have you?
-Yes

441
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,190
You especially like cars, right?

442
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,350
Really like

443
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,030
You like them so much you imitate them, right?
-Yes

444
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,700
I had a car all throughout university
-Yes

445
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,600
Really like them

446
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,830
What kind of car do you want?

447
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,000
The most wanted?
-The most wanted

448
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,070
Civic

449
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,000
Civic? Lame choice

450
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,240
The previous Civic? It's an older model so it's more expensive

451
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,440
One Civic, not the ordinary kind

452
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,150
You know the one in Initial D?

453
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,010
If its in D it must be expensive, right?

454
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,020
Very expensive. 5 million or so

455
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,720
I really want it.
-I see

456
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,430
After the perfect setup

457
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,380
The final 10 million challenge begins

458
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,900
I know. Then use this money to buy

459
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,430
Gross!

460
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,340
Use this.
-No, no, no. What is this?

461
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,100
What?
-Scary

462
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,040
What is this?

463
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,010
10 million

464
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,410
No, no,, what 10 million!?

465
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,040
What does it mean?

466
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,350
I'll give you 10 million, with this money, buy the car

467
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,620
No, no, no. What the hell are you talking about all of a sudden?

468
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,450
No. No

469
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,720
What's going on here?

470
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,120
Why? Why?
-Why are you giving me money?

471
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,790
What is it?
-I like you as a person

472
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,760
You're gross

473
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,360
What's gross?
-This is gross

474
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,360
We know each other very well, don't we?

475
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,800
Can buy Civic is very good, right?
-No, Ogata, take it back

476
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,960
Why not?

477
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,800
I want to buy it myself

478
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,240
I want to buy the car myself

479
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,430
After that, they argued for 15 minutes about whether to buy a Civic or not

480
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,900
Not much time left

481
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,670
You're a man, right?

482
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,690
So, Ogata begins to rush ahead

483
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Ogata

484
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,020
I told you to take it!

485
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,320
I can't take it.
-Take it!

486
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,920
Seriously!

487
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:02,720
They use brute force to forcefully push the money to the other

488
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,990
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, sorry, Ogata

489
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,630
10 million, I really can not accept
-Take it. It's okay

490
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,930
Ogata, please don't do this

491
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,200
It's too shameful to take someone's money

492
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,530
What is there to be ashamed of?

493
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,100
Really, really...
-I told you to take it

494
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,370
No, I can't

495
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,940
Just put it in there

496
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,840
What the hell do you want?

497
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,110
Take it over there!

498
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,310
Take it, please!

499
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,620
Ogata, please don't do this

500
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,150
Take it!

501
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,950
What's going on here?

502
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,850
I just want to give it to you. Take it

503
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,920
Ogata, honestly

504
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,960
Take it
-Tell the truth. Tell the truth

505
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,060
Honestly, it's dirty money, right?

506
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,890
It's dirty money, right?
-It's not dirty money

507
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,830
This is definitely dirty money, right?
-Why?

508
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,700
Definitely dirty money

509
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,620
Right?

510
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,860
This is definitely dirty money

511
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,100
Do you think I would do something like that?

512
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,960
You're dangerous.
-What's so dangerous?

513
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,930
This must be dirty money.
-How could I give you dirty money?

514
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,880
10 million is really not important to me

515
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,420
I made a lot of money, hundreds of millions

516
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,040
I don't want it
-Go buy a Civic

517
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,280
I really don't want it, Ogata

518
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,090
I'll buy it myself

519
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,760
I really like you as a person

520
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,630
Don't say it. Take it

521
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,210
I'll buy the Civic myself

522
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,570
No, no, no, I'll buy it for you

523
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,560
You're dreaming!
-Stop it. I'll buy it for you

524
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,560
I've told you so many times already

525
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,310
That's enough

526
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,180
I can't buy a car with your money!

527
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,800
Why are you so reluctant to accept it?

528
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,310
I'm giving you 10 million, with no risk

529
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,510
You can buy a Civic

530
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,480
I said I can't buy a Civic with this money

531
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,830
Why can't you?

532
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,820
Because I don't want to buy it with the money given by others

533
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,550
Just get it!

534
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,290
That's my goal

535
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,420
To buy a Civic

536
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,620
Please use it on your family

537
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,630
We are family, right?

538
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,660
We're family, right? Aren't we family?

539
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,880
Family, of course

540
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,330
That's why i'm giving it to you

541
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,590
If a family member says they want to buy a Civic

542
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:56,200
For me to be able to afford a Civic, it is the family that gives me encouragement

543
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,070
It's not to get a hand out like this

544
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,510
Right?

545
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,540
Ogata has a daughter, right?

546
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,180
Will you buy her everything in the future?

547
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,550
She says "Daddy, I want a car", then give her $10 million?

548
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,520
Will you raise her like that?

549
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,090
That's what you are doing right now

550
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,460
Imagine your own daughter, Ogata

551
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:21,300
When your daughter says, "Daddy, I want a car," will you buy it for her right away?

552
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,000
Will you buy her a house if she wants it?

553
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,140
If she buys it with her own money you'd be more happy, right?

554
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,870
What would you do
-Yes...

555
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,900
Daughter working herself

556
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,050
Says "Dad I bought a car", you'd be more happy, right?

557
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,880
Then think of me as your child

558
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,960
I will also try to tell you, "I bought a Civic with my own money, Ogata," right?

559
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,590
Yes

560
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:53,930
That's family, right?

561
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,460
I know...

562
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,140
Scared me!

563
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,780
Ogata, this is too tough

564
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,980
But in my heart...

565
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,820
I'm very moved

566
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,690
He's not swayed by 10 million

567
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,030
I'm touched

568
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,690
When he said that

569
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:29,900
"If you really care about me, don't do this"

570
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,500
I can't say anything else

571
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,270
Having earned millions already really sounds like just a dream

572
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,640
How can you earn it?

573
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,380
How could I earn so much?

574
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,180
Is it a lie?
-Of course

575
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,080
That's too much Ogata
-Sure!

576
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,750
That's too much

577
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,920
Really

578
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,920
I am still 5,500 yen for 1 appearance

579
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,060
Don't go around saying your fee, ok?

580
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,760
15,000 yen for a six-hour shoot

581
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,730
Don't talk about your salary

582
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:09,110
To sum up, the winner is Nagano

583
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,040
Okay, what do you think?

584
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,950
I see, that's how it is

585
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,810
Yes

586
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,180
Why did Nagano take it out like that?

587
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,420
This way
-So quick

588
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,080
The speed of adding ginger to a bowl

589
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,190
Sushi restaurant?

590
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,610
Sushi restaurant owner's speed

591
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,430
Only HEY! Taku-chan is gross

592
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,300
Yes, a businessman

593
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,040
So disgusting

594
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
Bad expression

595
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,510
Shouldn't Ogata have cried at the end?

596
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,410
Not sure

597
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,780
I kind of wanted to cry

598
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,470
Really?
-Yeah

599
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,940
I hope it'll be made into a movie

600
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,640
Movie title "Civic"

601
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,080
Let's welcome the next presenter

602
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,720
Magical Lovely!

603
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,070
Hello everyone

604
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,120
The two magical lovelies have gathered

605
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,070
Thank you

606
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,030
Today we are together

607
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,830
Yes

608
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,830
Let's do it

609
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,590
Although it is Saito's joke

610
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,470
I will abruptly bring this up

611
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,460
Last year's M-1 competition

612
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,320
The top batter Mogu Rider

613
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,980
Do you remember what sketch they did?

614
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,310
I remember, it was very impactful

615
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,640
Remember?

616
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,310
Hamada, of course, also

617
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,980
You should remember it

618
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,660
No way! Really?

619
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,850
Which part did you think was good?

620
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:38,920
Nice tempo

621
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,900
Very rhythmic indeed

622
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,930
Last year's winner, you know who it was, right?

623
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,190
Of course

624
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,960
The one with the bald guy, right?

625
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,440
There are still comedians who don't care so much about M-1

626
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,680
Even in this way you can be skilled at manzai

627
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,430
That's awesome!

628
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:04,010
They performed a segment about Kenichi Mikawa's "Scorpio Woman"

629
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,790
So this time

630
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,600
We bring a theory about this song

631
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,020
Please take a look

632
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:17,500
The lyrics "No, I'm a scorpio woman" can be spoken under certain conditions

633
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,840
Seems tough
-I also think it is difficult

634
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
Ask "What sign are you?" This kind of question is fine

635
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,680
But its hard to tell if someone's a woman or not just by looking at them

636
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,850
I don't even know how to ask

637
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,950
This time it will be difficult

638
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:40,290
The lyrics "No, I'm a scorpio woman" can be spoken under certain conditions

639
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,560
Wait a minute, I don't have a clue about this theory

640
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,500
These three, who know nothing about the theory, were gathered

641
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:53,330
All of you gathered today have one thing in common

642
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:59,640
We staged a segment about Kenichi Mikawa at M-1

643
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,780
Due to the connection, another Mikawa has come

644
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,780
※This one's stage name is Mikawa.

645
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,210
That should be the case

646
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,110
Kintaro also

647
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,110
I also...

648
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,560
At this time we reveal the task

649
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:18,730
The lyrics "No, I'm a scorpio woman" can be spoken under certain conditions

650
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,830
No way no way

651
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,730
It can't be done, can it?

652
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:29,440
So, these three have been selected to test the hypothesis

653
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,510
There is a true Scorpio woman

654
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,410
It's Ms. Mikawa

655
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,800
MIKAWA, MIKAWA

656
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,180
Is it a Sagittarius man?

657
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,820
Is it an Aquarius woman?

658
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:41,940
What a great segment

659
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,420
It's a Virgo man, right?

660
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,310
No, I'm a Scorpio woman

661
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,280
A Scorpio woman!
-What do you mean?

662
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,320
They will ask the questions the same as in the sketch

663
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:02,150
To get the respondent to say the phrase "No, I'm a Scorpio woman"

664
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,440
They can't go home until they succeed

665
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,740
Therefore

666
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,400
Each group went to a place of their own choosing

667
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,790
And started asking questions

668
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,620
This is the Lumine Theater

669
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,400
Shinjuku

670
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,010
There should be someone who understands

671
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,560
Just target these people and ask questions

672
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,120
Comedy fans should have seen the M-1

673
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,330
They immediately start to ask

674
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,320
Looking for people who would know

675
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,900
Hello, can you cooperate?

676
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,430
Just a moment, okay?

677
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,440
Do you know who we both are?

678
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,830
I'm a fan of your work.
-Great!

679
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,500
I think we can do it quickly

680
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,280
What's your sign?

681
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,480
Cancer

682
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:48,450
"What's the sign of the zodiac?" That's now how you should ask!

683
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,980
Bad brain

684
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,650
You are so stupid!

685
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,060
Tomoshige is a pure idiot

686
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,420
An argument occurs almost instantly

687
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,630
So, what should I ask? What should I ask?

688
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,730
Let people say "no" first

689
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,160
For example, if you ask "Is it Cancer?"

690
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,070
If the person is a Scorpio, they'll say "no".
-That's it!

691
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,810
It's obviously the same logic as their own skit

692
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,120
Inexplicably, Tomoshige cant wrap his head around it

693
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,940
Doesn't get it

694
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,340
Is it a segment acted without understanding?

695
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,280
Just reading the lines

696
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,880
Elsewhere, Kintaro

697
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,220
First of all, you can't ask "Is it Scorpio?"

698
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,320
Not bad

699
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,560
You have to ask a sign other than Scorpio

700
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,160
Are you a Capricorn?

701
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,520
Yes

702
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,330
Eh? Correct?

703
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,580
If its correct you'd react like this

704
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:38,730
Are you a Capricorn?

705
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:43,440
That's awesome. I am

706
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,670
Caught a Capricorn

707
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,440
Two questions accidentally right in a row

708
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,520
A small miracle

709
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,250
On this side

710
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:55,650
We are doing a project to guess people's sign

711
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,890
I guess... Pisces?

712
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,570
No, I'm a Leo

713
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,120
So it's Leo

714
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,120
Leo

715
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,760
No. Wrong guess.
-Then can you announce the correct answer?

716
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,730
Virgo

717
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,350
Ah

718
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,560
Virgo

719
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,730
Not true

720
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:14,970
For some strange reason, Mikawa simply asks people their sign

721
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,570
Taurus?

722
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,210
Not true

723
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,210
Which one?

724
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,310
I'm a Scorpio woman

725
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:27,400
Because its Mikawa asking?

726
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,710
Nice answer

727
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,980
A shame

728
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,470
Mikawa has an advantage due to their look

729
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:32,360
But received a slightly incorrect answer

730
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,990
Hi！Nice to meet you！

731
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,260
Are you an Aquarius woman?

732
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,430
Not true

733
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,430
Are you a Pisces woman?

734
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,900
Not true

735
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,870
Are you a Leo female?

736
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,870
No
-No?

737
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,700
Are you a Scorpio female?
-Right

738
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,640
Hey!
-Guessed right

739
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,610
It's over. That was the wrong way to ask the question

740
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,970
What a pity!

741
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:55,880
Really a Scorpio?

742
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,110
So stupid to ask like this

743
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,490
Wow, that's a shame.
-The answer is "yes"

744
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,620
If you ask "Are you a Scorpio woman?" As expected, the answer is "Yes"

745
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,250
If you guess right they wont say "no"

746
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,720
"Yes, I am a Scorpio woman.

747
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,830
It's become like a strange uncle asking
-A strange uncle

748
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:14,800
At this point it's been two hours since the start of the questioning

749
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,730
The problem is 'no'

750
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,270
The "no" at the beginning
-And then "I am"

751
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,600
Have to have "No, I am"

752
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,840
These are not statements that occur in everyday life
-True

753
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:29,580
People who are asked answer "no" and do not say "no"

754
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:34,450
The point is to get the respondent to say "No, I am"

755
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,960
The challengers are caught in the quagmire of getting the respondent to say 'no'

756
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,630
The comedy theatre is over here

757
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,460
Lets ask a comedian if we see one

758
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,070
Maybe there will be someone who understands

759
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:55,280
They checked the appearance list of Yoshimoto Lumine on the spot

760
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,980
What's her sign?

761
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,580
Birthday November 7th

762
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,380
Scorpio

763
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,280
So she's a Scorpio woman!

764
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,550
We were on M-1 together so she must know our segment

765
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:14,290
Her intuition is also very strong, she should definitely say it

766
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,100
Shall we contact her

767
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,830
We can't ask her to come down, right?
-No.

768
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,460
I'm so anxious

769
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,530
That's no good

770
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:27,160
On the other side is Mikawa who changed locations

771
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,050
Must also be older

772
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,670
Are you a Libra woman?

773
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,150
Yes, the people who know the song is better

774
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,210
No, I'm a Leo woman

775
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,080
But it's close

776
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,080
This is the way to do it, right?

777
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,910
A very perceptive pedestrian who understands this melody has appeared

778
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,690
So Mikawa progresses

779
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,230
Over here

780
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,960
Are you a Pisces man?

781
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,800
He is a Pisces man

782
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,530
Ah this Pisces
-I'm a Pisces

783
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,920
The special power is activated
- Guessed it right again

784
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,530
Guessed right

785
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,060
Kintaro has an impressive correct rate

786
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,650
But is still at the starting line

787
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,740
Eh?

788
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:12,580
Isn't that Soshina?

789
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,880
Brother, wait!
-Wait!

790
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,920
What is it?

791
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,820
Sorry

792
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,020
We are looking for Scorpio women

793
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,760
I'm sure you can find one

794
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,930
You have to make the respondent say, "No, I'm a Scorpio woman."

795
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,060
There must be such a person

796
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,530
You wouldn't say that, would you?

797
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:31,300
Universe's Hana is a scorpio woman

798
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,500
So we're waiting for her here

799
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,170
It's break time

800
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,500
Is it break time?
-It's break time

801
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,710
Universe is finished, too.
-Then she might come down

802
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,300
Possible

803
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,280
Five minutes after Soshina leaving

804
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,380
Ah!

805
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,850
Hello, Seshita!

806
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,780
Another star!

807
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,020
I was going to walk past as if nothing had happened

808
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,520
Go straight around you

809
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,550
We just saw Soshina

810
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,690
Is Universe there?
-Yes

811
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,430
We're just waiting for her

812
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,430
We are fans waiting for her

813
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,300
She has fans now?
-Yes she does

814
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,870
I was watching before I came out

815
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,570
I don't she's in the lounge

816
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,340
Eh?

817
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,680
Gone already?

818
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,110
Then it's pointless for us to wait here

819
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,840
When Hana goes to Lumine

820
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,170
She takes the same route home every time
-What route?

821
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,160
No one knows

822
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,150
I wonder where she's gone?

823
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:25,090
There's a door specifically for Hana

824
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,790
Maybe she'd come this way.
-Is it true?

825
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,520
I'll ask women of the same age group to ask

826
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,430
Same age group and above

827
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:38,670
I'll tell you right away that your sign is Libra, right?

828
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,010
Wow, that's a good guess.
-Ah!

829
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,400
Enough, seriously!

830
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,070
Why is she so good at guessing?

831
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:50,210
At this point, this group give up waiting for Universe

832
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,850
We must ask people to answer "no"

833
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,450
If someone says "no"

834
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,780
We have to work out how to get them to say it

835
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:58,440
"Wrong" is a great phrase

836
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,710
So Mogu Rider's plan is

837
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,060
I am a Gemini man are you too?

838
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,500
No, I'm a Leo man

839
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,690
Good plan

840
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,670
I am a Gemini man are you too?

841
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:17,440
No, I'm a Capricorn woman

842
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,250
This is a good way to ask

843
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,040
I am a Gemini man are you too?

844
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,860
This should be fine now

845
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,550
No, I'm a Leo man

846
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:29,480
I am a Gemini man are you too?

847
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,590
No, I'm a Cancer woman

848
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,000
Keep asking!

849
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,620
They've now developed a fixed asking style

850
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,340
At this point it's been four hours since the start of the questioning

851
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,480
The two have the advantage

852
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,370
5pm already

853
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:44,830
Hello

854
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:48,640
I watched your hilarious live show earlier.
-Huh?

855
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,070
Seen our show?
-Yes

856
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,840
Can I have a moment of your time?
-Just a moment

857
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,410
This is the right time, the right place and the right people

858
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,410
Ok

859
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:55,810
Seen last year's M-1?
-Seen it

860
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,980
I'm a Leo man, are you too?

861
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,750
No, I'm a Gemini man

862
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,730
Idiot!

863
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,350
Incidentally, are you like me?

864
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,600
No, I'm a Scorpio woman

865
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,850
But we don't know if she's a real Scorpio yet

866
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,200
Really?

867
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:14,860
Wait wait

868
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,070
Wait a minute. Oh, wait a minute

869
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,700
You really are?

870
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,640
Are you really a Scorpio woman?
-Really

871
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,440
Great! Great!

872
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,710
Yeah, it's over?

873
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,540
Is it over?

874
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:29,670
Impressive

875
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:30,040
Yeah, it's over

876
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,080
Easy with this fixed pattern question

877
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,580
Okay? Is that okay?

878
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,390
No, I'm a Scorpio woman

879
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,070
We don't need this bit

880
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,690
Just let them have some fun

881
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:46,300
So, Mogu Rider win after 4 hours and 15 minutes

882
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,930
And after asking 27 groups of people

883
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,800
Kintaro is unexpectedly talented

884
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,890
She may use it in future

885
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,110
What show's gonna use that?

886
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,050
Guessing

887
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,480
At 6pm

888
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,120
What sign am I, please guess

889
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,150
Gemini

890
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,490
No, I'm a Scorpio woman

891
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:18,360
Then we are the same

892
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,800
What's she doing?

893
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,590
What's going on?

894
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:22,800
What is my sign?
-Guess your sign, right?

895
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,500
Astrology
-Libra

896
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,700
No, I'm a Scorpio woman

897
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,310
Little sister, are you a Capricorn woman?

898
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:36,910
I'm Scorpio

899
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,480
What a shame!

900
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,630
On the other side

901
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,420
What blood type man am I?

902
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,220
Type AB?

903
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,860
No, I'm a type O blood man

904
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:50,860
Why blood type now

905
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:56,630
What sign man am I?

906
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,130
A Scorpio man

907
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:04,900
No, I'm a Gemini man

908
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,110
What kind of conversation is this?

909
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,220
Using an approach like an English textbook

910
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,890
Telling passerbys all the key points of the answer

911
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,780
Indeed

912
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:17,850
Are you a Sagittarius woman?

913
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:23,690
No, I'm a Libra woman

914
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,360
Ah, Libra

915
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,480
It's 9:00 p.m

916
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,150
This is too funny

917
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:36,020
Kintaro is now disguised

918
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,280
I'm doing an imitation now of the signer

919
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,350
To make others make a mental connection when I ask them

920
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:51,520
Are you a Capricorn woman?

921
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,560
No, I'm a Scorpio woman

922
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,560
Thank you

923
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,830
Super happy

924
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,900
Can I see your ID card?

925
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,070
Want to know if you are really a Scorpio woman

926
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,610
I am a Capricorn

927
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:16,340
I think it is better to go along with what you say

928
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,350
What about cooperating with her?

929
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,380
Sorry

930
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:24,350
You are a Sagittarius woman

931
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:24,510
What a scary way to ask

932
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:27,960
No, I'm a Scorpio woman

933
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,960
Right? Finally, I'm glad I didn't give up

934
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,930
It's finally over. Thank you

935
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:35,330
Don't seem very scorpio-like

936
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,570
But I'm actually not a Scorpio, i'm a Cancer

937
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,280
Really? Hey!
-I just went with it

938
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,500
These two are played by fake Scorpios

939
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,740
Both fakes

940
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,470
Both sides are fake

941
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:55,450
Guess my horoscope

942
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,650
Try guessing

943
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:00,890
Cancer

944
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,430
No, I'm actually a Scorpio woman

945
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,260
Wait a minute. Let's follow this

946
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,760
This time I will ask you

947
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,630
Are you an Aries woman?

948
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:16,670
No, I'm a Scorpio woman

949
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,070
There we go!

950
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,440
This one looks like the real thing

951
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,200
Where is the birth year, month and day

952
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,980
Ah, here we go!

953
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,720
Yes!

954
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,210
What a torturous location shoot

955
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:34,520
Great!

956
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,230
It's really late

957
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:44,460
In summary, Kintaro completed the challenge in 9 hours and 10 minutes

958
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,460
After asking 75 groups of people

959
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,960
And finally

960
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,980
It's already the second day and we still can't see the end for Mikawa

961
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,590
If this continues

962
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:02,100
So, the staff

963
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,810
Decide any more would be waste for the viewers

964
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,550
Thus, we ended things here

965
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:12,900
It's impossible

966
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:22,140
In summary
Laugh until you're satisfied

967
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,140
I don't even know which version this is

968
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,900
I see

969
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:28,170
It's torture, this time

970
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,220
It is indeed a torturous shoot

971
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,540
What do you all think?

972
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,880
Understanding the rules for some of them seemed difficult

973
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,420
That guy

974
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,750
He may not understand it now

975
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,190
He was still wondering what kind of an outing that was

976
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,890
He still remembers at least

977
00:45:42,890 --> 00:46:14,880
