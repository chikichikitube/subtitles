1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,800
First time on Gaki No Tsukai CHIKI CHIKI

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,130
Sudden Japanese Dance Competition!

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,430
Well, we've never dOnE - Done this before today

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,730
Sorry?

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,730
We knew nothing about this

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,800
Just suddenly

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,600
With no preparation we did it

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,500
And well of course I knew we were doing this a few weeks ago,

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,030
I hate cheating, so I didn't watch any videos or anything

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,060
FOR REAL?!

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,730
Really, really

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,930
To preserve that sense of uncertainty

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:44,830
This time they will come up with a classical Japanese Dance, knowing nothing about it beforehand

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:51,960
They choose 1 outfit from 5, and apply the makeup themselves too

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,300
And then hearing the music for the first time, they improvise an original dance

16
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,300
No messing about here! Just how will they fare?

17
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:08,000
After doing this, I think what you need is a delicate touch

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,530
Ah, I see

19
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,760
That's true, certainly

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,330
Vulgar people couldn't do this

21
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,600
And, and uh

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,960
I'm really looking forward to Hamada-san's performance

23
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,760
I think I will do better than Endo

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,730
Endo does seem to be the odd one out

25
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,860
Well to weturn your words-

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,400
You didn't return them

27
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:37,440
Timed and Typeset by Kedomas
Translation by senor_wristband

28
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,850
How will their dances turn out?
They rely only on their imagination in this Japanese Dance Contest

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,550
This time the five improvise a brand new Japanese Dance by listening to the music

30
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,130
Let's start with Tanaka

31
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,060
Good morning, good morning

32
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,730
First he chooses from 5 outfits the one he wants to dance in

33
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,260
There's a lot here

34
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,800
So I  just decide now? Wow!

35
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,230
(staff)You decide now

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,530
Already deciding?

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
Kagami Jishi, or the Tenaraiko?

38
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,400
I have no idea

39
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,300
This looks really intimidating to me, this thing from the Kagami Jishi

40
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,200
I have no idea what this is for

41
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,560
I'm just supposed to decide now right?

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,800
You decide right now

43
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,800
Then I think I'll go with this

44
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,330
Tenaraiko, let's go with this one

45
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,600
Are you ready?

46
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,200
Of course not!

47
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,060
I have no idea what to do after all

48
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:52,600
Tanaka chose the Tenaraiko, a girl that dances with a paper umbrella in her hand

49
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,660
Before starting the dance, he puts on makeup that should be fitting for a Tenaraiko

50
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,430
This is difficult

51
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,730
But I'll believe in myself

52
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,400
Tanaka aims for a refined makeup look

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,460
How will Tanaka's Tenaraiko performance go?

54
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,100
Tanaka's VTR ... START!

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,300
This is the first time I heard the music

56
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,800
Right, right the first time. Didn't know anything beforehand.

57
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,260
This is a difficult judgement

58
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,660
I don't think I'm doing too bad

59
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,560
What is this incredibly annoying vibe

60
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,900
What are you a courtesan?! This isn't a Tenaraiko!

61
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,530
This is a Tenaraiko!

62
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,600
You've got that part wrong, those movements are unnecessary

63
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,600
If anything, this is the opposite of a Tenaraiko...

64
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,060
What's with the paper bag?

65
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,230
It seems to be part of the costume, it was prepared for me

66
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:08,600
I see, right. Well, you sure do move slowly.

67
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,960
Right? That's a dance move right?

68
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,400
Well then ... What happened?

69
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,830
You're really using the stage

70
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,530
Yes yes indeed

71
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,300
What's the point of spinning that?!

72
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,960
They do that sometimes!

73
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,600
Shouldn't you paint your neck white too?

74
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,460
Ah! Should I have?

75
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,700
Yeah you should have

76
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,700
He's backing up!

77
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,130
I'd never think to see backwards walking in a Japanese Dance

78
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,460
See

79
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,330
That face is annoying

80
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,660
It's unsightly,

81
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,060
And this guy's chin is too long

82
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,360
The chin sticks out

83
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,260
The chin is too long

84
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,000
Finally he puts it down. What the hell are you doing?

85
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,530
What the hell is that?

86
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,200
It's a Tenaraiko thing

87
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,100
What the hell?

88
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,100
He's going "OooooOOh"

89
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,430
Ah, you have to do that too?

90
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,230
Yeah like-

91
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,860
Then hurry up and do it!

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,660
You should've used that prop sooner

93
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,500
This was pretty long

94
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,830
It was pretty long wasn't it?

95
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,960
It's over, it's over

96
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,800
Could you just tell us what the scene is supposed to be?

97
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,560
I think she's going to a temple school, she has a caligraphy class,

98
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,730
So I think she's supposed to be on her way

99
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,360
She's heading there?

100
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,730
I think she's heading there

101
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,800
Hurry up and go then

102
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:34,760
But, but that's what Japanese Dance is like. I was supressing the emotions and displaying them.

103
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,060
He's backing up and everything

104
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,260
I see

105
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,500
So next, Endo?

106
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,000
Endo what did you dance?

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
"Have the plums blossomed?"

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,530
I think you should know this one, it's pretty famous

109
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,830
Did you know this one?

110
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,930
Yeah I have some idea

111
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,700
Honestly it's the first time I've heard this song

112
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,300
Surely you've heard the song before?

113
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,900
I think it's a pretty high-tempo song

114
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,740
High tempo?!

115
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,740
High tempo?!

116
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,060
I can kind of smell the danger already

117
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,260
Endo chose "Have the Plums Blossomed?"

118
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:14,630
A famous piece, explaining femininity using flowers and shellfish

119
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,330
First off is the makeup based on the title

120
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,060
The base is white isn't it

121
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,500
Endo applies his makeup with an unusually serious expression

122
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:43,060
On Sunday, there was a 2 hour TV show, I'm trying to imitate someone from that

123
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,700
I think it was a Geisha

124
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,160
But a Geisha is different to this right?

125
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,400
Are Japanese Dancers the same as Geisha?

126
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,760
Wait I think I learned something from that

127
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,030
Oh yeah!

128
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,530
Alright, I got this. I got it

129
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:09,400
He bases his makeup on a Geisha he saw on TV

130
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,330
How will Endo's "Have The Plums Blossomed" go?

131
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,600
Oh no

132
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,700
Really?

133
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,400
You're moving so much!

134
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,730
My stomach hurts!

135
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,160
This is amazing!

136
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,660
This is just High Tension!

137
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,760
This is Endo's High Tension performance

138
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,400
I was taking this seriously!

139
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,430
Take this seriously!

140
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,830
I was!

141
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,160
You're gonna do a Hoi Hoi Hoi too?

142
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,900
I wish I could've messed about too then

143
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,860
I was taking this really seriously

144
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:01,660
I get it though, if you have to dance you just end up moving like that

145
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,630
This is just scary!

146
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,030
So scary!

147
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,430
Where the hell are you looking

148
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,370
It's very obvious you're out of breath

149
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,370
That's correct

150
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,030
What the hell is that?

151
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,560
First time I've seen that

152
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,030
Let's ask about that, what is that?

153
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,330
Wow, he's even doing the other way

154
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,300
He did it both ways

155
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,100
What is this?

156
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,900
Let's ask about this. Just what is this?

157
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,800
So monotonous!
He just repeats those moves!

158
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,830
That's true

159
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,160
He did a 1.5 turn

160
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,030
He's scooping loaches!

161
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,100
There it is!

162
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,100
Eh I got it all wrong?

163
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,200
You got it wrong

164
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,430
What happened? You're trying to convey it's too bright?

165
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,030
Yes, thank you. It's too bright.

166
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,860
He's looking in many directions

167
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,960
He does the same thing for too long

168
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,530
There's no variation

169
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,230
It's like Tanaka's

170
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,560
Thank you very much

171
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,030
What was the point of that "Bright" expression?

172
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,030
What was that?

173
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:25,630
Well it's called "Have The Plums Blossomed?", so I thought she would be waiting outside

174
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,200
Like she's wandering around looking for plums

175
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,260
What does that even mean

176
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,420
What was that knee scraping?

177
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,420
Oh yeah, that leg move

178
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,090
I was compacting the soil

179
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,190
The beans ... Sorry the seeds, putting the seeds in the ground

180
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,430
Beans?

181
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,930
I said beans by accident

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,460
You were planting plum beans?

183
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,400
Are you talking about Setsubun? (Spring Festival)

184
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,800
Let's do Yama-chan now?

185
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,100
Yes please

186
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,230
Good morning

187
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,000
Very pretty

188
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,800
What should I do...

189
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,730
This one...What should I do...

190
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,560
Woah hold on

191
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,560
Alright, I'll go with Kagami Jishi

192
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:21,360
Hosei chose the Kagami Jishi (Lion Dance) - performed by a lady of the court

193
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,260
He starts applying his makeup right away

194
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:31,160
Unlike the past 2 performers, he paints beyond his face

195
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,760
You have to take care of all the visible parts

196
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,560
Japanese beauty is in the small details after all

197
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,200
He delicately applies his makeup, to invoke the beauty of a Japanese woman

198
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,430
How will Hosei's Kagami Jishi go?

199
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,560
I see! You start like that?

200
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,130
He's into it, he's definitely really into it

201
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,330
They're round! Look at his eyebrows!

202
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,930
That's not right, they're circles

203
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,000
No no c'mon-

204
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,860
He's got the face right

205
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,360
He's really got the face down

206
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,130
That's how you use the lion head?

207
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,230
Seems that way

208
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,300
I'm the most feminine one

209
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,100
This... What do we make of this?

210
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,330
Man you're used to this aren't you?

211
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,060
Wow!

212
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,860
He's picking it up again?

213
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,860
He picks it up again. He has no idea what to do.

214
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,800
You don't need that!

215
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,130
You don't need that

216
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,330
The song was longer than I thought

217
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,030
The song was longer than I thought it'd be

218
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,530
That's true, it's pretty long

219
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,230
I thought it would be over by then

220
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,200
That's how Shimura-san uses his Swan prop!

221
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,900
What are you carrying the lion head around for?

222
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,230
Yeah

223
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,430
Well well, that was still pretty good

224
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,800
Right?

225
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,900
He had good movements

226
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,290
It's totally different right?

227
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,060
What's the story here?

228
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,130
This is an offering

229
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,830
An offering, the lion is being presented

230
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,000
And this person is being summoned by the Lord

231
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,260
Being summoned?

232
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,980
This person is being summoned?

233
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,980
I see, I see

234
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,960
*Hosei is making this up

235
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,960
That's why you were making it bite

236
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,360
Ah that's why?

237
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Somewhat seductive

238
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,830
Yes a bit

239
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,860
I think there's something to be said about this order, I think Hamada-san has something to do with tit

240
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,200
Good morning

241
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,560
Please pick from these 5

242
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,300
Eh? What's this?

243
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,430
This...

244
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,660
This one is fine

245
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,660
Alright

246
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,230
Hamada chose the Fuji Musume (Wisteria Daughter), which uses a wisteria flower prop

247
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,560
He applies the makeup he imagines a Fuji Musume would wear

248
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:48,100
Is this the right way to do it? I thought the paint would be applied more smoothly and cleanly

249
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,560
Did I have to apply something before doing this?

250
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,260
Ah! I should have put this on!

251
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,900
Ah man they got me

252
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,700
I've never seen anyone apply this before

253
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,600
I went to Kankuro's show the other day,

254
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,530
I didn't see him putting this on!

255
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:19,230
All I saw was him applying the white paint. It's all his fault.

256
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,660
Right? He should've shown me the oil application first

257
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:28,130
He applies his makeup while complaining

258
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,060
Ow

259
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,500
Hamada's Fuji Musume (Wisteria Daughter) ... How will it go?

260
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,130
So now the Japanese Dance I did, VTR start

261
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,660
I was in a hurry to get out

262
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,760
Already?
That's a grandmother

263
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,460
So soon?

264
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
That's no Daughter!

265
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,200
It was the hem

266
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,900
Woahhh what was that?

267
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,000
He dropped something

268
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,700
Is that part of the performance

269
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,700
No something came off

270
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,630
I had no idea what to do with that staff thing

271
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,630
It's not a staff, it's flowers

272
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,260
This story... What is this?

273
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,060
Finished?

274
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,730
I thought it ended there

275
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,330
Watch out!

276
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,900
Eh?!

277
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,200
Are you alright?

278
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,230
Ah, he's acting like he meant to trip

279
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,930
It's his senility

280
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,060
So scary

281
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,630
How was I supposed to use that staff?

282
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,630
It's not a staff!

283
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,600
This guy can't decide his dance moves at all

284
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,700
I thought I was finished there, but there's still more

285
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,460
It won't end there. I hope you redeem this soon

286
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,360
Woah

287
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
Woah woah woah

288
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,360
You have nothing!

289
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,660
What happened? What happened?

290
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,860
What are you swinging the flowers around for?!

291
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,860
He's spinning it!

292
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,530
That kimono was messed up

293
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,330
The hem of the dress...I apologise

294
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:31,300
I said this eariler, I, I also did the Fuji Musume

295
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,300
DownTown-san copied each other?!

296
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,960
But I was not like that

297
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,960
Please, we're counting on you

298
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,400
I couldn't watch that

299
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,600
It was like you were Punch Drunk

300
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,330
The Fuji Musume I think, after all

301
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,860
The one that meets my calibre

302
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,960
Somehow Matsumoto ends up doing the same Fuji Musume as Hamada

303
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:05,360
He applies makeup based on Fuji Musume

304
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,360
I can't belive Demon Kakka does this every day

305
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,960
While applying his makeup, he gradually gets into the role

306
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,560
Matsumoto's Fuji Musume ... How will it turn out?

307
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,960
This is the last one right? Matsumoto-san's Japanese Dance, START

308
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,200
Ah you came from that side?

309
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,200
That's good right?

310
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,160
So ugly...

311
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,660
Disgusting!

312
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,330
This is bad!

313
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,060
So disgusting!

314
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,460
This is what you meant Matsumoto-san?

315
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,460
It's a goddamn hag!

316
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,700
How is that? What about that? Nobody's used that until now

317
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,930
I noticed that just now

318
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:01,060
The girl notices the flowers now,

319
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,200
It starts now?

320
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,100
How will he use it? Just how will he use it?

321
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,060
You have no idea what to do!

322
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,400
He's not using, he's not using it at all

323
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,460
Finally he swings it

324
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,430
I guess it's just the natural move to make

325
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,530
What now? What now?

326
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,030
He covered his face

327
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,260
What happened?

328
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,200
I've seen this move before

329
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,700
So hot, it's so hot in here

330
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,000
C',mon stop it. But look, I have a lot of variations

331
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,260
What are you doing here?

332
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,330
He's dragging it!

333
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,460
What is this?

334
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,160
He left it on the floor

335
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,830
He has no clue what to do

336
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:53,860
I do know what to do, it's just longer than I thought
I didn't trip even once

337
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,360
You want it to end soon

338
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,160
Right, look at this

339
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,230
What the heck are you doing

340
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,830
What is that?

341
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,230
Ah, that's a new move

342
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,700
What? What are you doing?

343
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,130
There it is, the face cover

344
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,600
He covers his face in the end

345
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,200
Yeah you sure know what to do. You end up covering in the end

346
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,800
But you could see the story right? She notices the flowers, and then becomes one with the flowers

347
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,230
She's looking for the flowers, and looking for herself

348
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:31,300
But she thinks "Maybe the flowers are prettier than me" and switches between happy and embarrassed

349
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,500
That's the emotion there?

350
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,500
Happy and embarrased?

351
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,960
She's 15 years old after all

352
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,500
That Musume? She's 15?

353
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,560
So young!

354
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:50,500
Now professorial dancer Hanayagi Mikachiyo-sensei gives her thoughts on their performance

355
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,060
Tanaka-san was the Tenaraiko right?
Yes the Tenaraiko

356
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,230
Sensei his walking was gross right? So unnecessary

357
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,730
That was no good

358
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,500
That was no good?

359
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,500
Yes, however,

360
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,630
What I thought Tanaka did well was how you made the hairpins shake with your neck

361
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,330
Like we said before, we have to be unique right?

362
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,330
Hmm I don't know

363
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:17,530
Yes, trying your best, I thought that swaying was nice

364
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,500
Yes yes, I did that

365
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,830
But the longer it went on, the more his chin stuck out

366
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,330
No please, look at the hairpins instead

367
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,000
Next is Endo

368
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,130
I thought it was brilliant you painted your neck white too

369
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,130
Thank you

370
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:33,030
If you make your neck white, it makes your face look better

371
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,730
Also, I liked that your lipstick didn't cover your lips completely

372
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,100
That's a good thing?

373
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,600
And part way through, you did the pantomime?

374
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,630
I think that was great

375
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,130
Thank you very much, thank you for all the compliments

376
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,800
So next is Hosei

377
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,560
The round eyebrows were a mistake

378
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:59,960
That used to be in style, but for Kagami Jishi normal eyebrows are best

379
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:06,030
You got the basic feminine movements right, I think you did great there

380
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,830
Thank you very much

381
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,530
And the way you used the Lion head was good

382
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,030
I see

383
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,330
You seemed to be familiar with it

384
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,000
So Sensei, my dance please

385
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,360
When you first came out and trip, I thought "Oh poor thing!"

386
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,260
Of course right?

387
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:28,900
That's something that happens often, with new dancers or children, when they come out they trip

388
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,860
She said children!

389
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,100
Hamada-san, she said children do that

390
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,160
It's very common

391
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,500
It's a common thing huh

392
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,100
However you kept dancing to the end despite tripping,

393
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,730
I think that was brilliant

394
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,630
Thank you very much, that's all I could do

395
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,100
So Matsumoto-san did the same thing

396
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,600
That face was scary wasn't it?

397
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,360
It was terrifying

398
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,600
There's nothing I could do about that

399
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,070
That's supposed to be a 15 year old

400
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,530
It's scary isn't it?

401
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:00,860
But Sensei I feel I had a lot more variation than Hamada-san

402
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,130
You really had the aura

403
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,730
I had the aura

404
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:10,000
The spirit of using all of the props

405
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,000
I see

406
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,760
Was that noticing part way thing allowed?
It's allowed

407
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,160
I thought it was a great idea

408
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,430
Hamada-san was asking earlier how to use the flowers,

409
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:27,700
Matsumoto-san didn't swing it, but instead ran around it himself

410
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,830
I think that was a great idea

411
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,960
I ran around the flowers instead

412
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,400
The opposite idea

413
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,830
The opposite idea!

414
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:39,420
What's with all this praise
Were you already familiar with Japanese Dance?

415
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,630
I had a lot of experience to build on

416
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,330
Stop lying!

417
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,600
You can tell by looking, you had no idea what to do!

418
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,260
But it did seem like I was used to it

419
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,030
No it didn't!

420
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,600
It was wike- like I was used to it

421
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
wike?

422
00:22:54,330 --> 00:23:00,060
The sensei will choose the best dancer! Who will it be?

423
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,230
So sensei, the best dancer...

424
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,860
Matsumoto-san

425
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,330
HELLL YEAHHHH

426
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,830
Seriously?

427
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,660
No way!

428
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,940
Is it because of the variation?

429
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,940
The variation yes

430
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:22,550
The way within a few minutes he switched between different moves

431
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,550
Ah yes

432
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,430
I did seem like I was used to it

433
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,660
Enough already!

434
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,630
What do you mean "like"

435
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,660
Then, who was the worst dancer please

436
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,130
The worst one?

437
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,330
Hamada-san

438
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,630
Of course, that's obvious

439
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,960
Shozo's was better than mine?

440
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,900
I think mine was on a totally different stage

441
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,700
You tripped!

442
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,660
The Musume is tripping and falling...
