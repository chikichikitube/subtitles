00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,680
"Fuga Fuga" was coming to the first and second.

91
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,820

What will you do?

110
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,090
I thought Tanaka's was funny.

111
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,460
I am not confident, so...

112
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,230
25000 yen.

113
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,230

Mr. Onuma's "Ass Work"!!!

116
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,060

The thing can be said through the whole,
all is unsatisfactory.

127
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,200
4 men are unsatisfactory?
- Unsatisfactory!

128
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,530
They are useless at all.

129
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,930
But Mr. Onuma got 25000 yen.

130
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,440
Huh! That's evil!

131
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,270
Very evil!

132
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,810
That's very evil! And...

133
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,510
I am very mortifying.

134
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:27,790

Please contribute.

156
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,660
Please pardon me!

157
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,630
I've done my best!!!

158
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,930
But only 3

159
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,070
Only 3!?

160
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,040
You must think more!

161
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,940
The bookmark is put in!

162
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,680

165
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,490
But Mr. Onuma got 25000 yen.

166
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,990

167
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,200

00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,870

Oh, I think it's not.

175
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,150

177
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,400
I worked hard but must pay,

178
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,630
