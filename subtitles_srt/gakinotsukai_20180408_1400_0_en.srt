00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
Timer: GakiDave Translator: senor_wristband

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,720
First time on Gaki no tsukai ya arahende

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,000
1000 yen transvestite meetup!

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,060
I get what we're doing today.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,760
This is a pain in the ass.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,820
With a budget of 1000 yen, we will buy items from a 100 yen store

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,600
in order to become a beautiful crossdresser.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,040
This isn't rude right?

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,980
And then finally, drag queen Bourbonne will decide who the prettiest one is.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:36,500
This problem is, we only have 1000 yen to work with.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,500
Yeah that's true, it seems undoable.

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,240
There's a lot of stuff you can get for 100 yen,

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,120
so we gotta manage with our 1000 yen.

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,740
Is the makeup included in that?

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,700
Everything is.

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,020
This time, it's not just us.

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,780
Let's introduce our guests.

18
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,320
Good Morning!

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,440
Viking and Heipo!

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,540
A beautiful crossdresser?

21
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,860
Yes exactly!

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,280
I understand this.

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,760
Last time we did some crossdressing stuff,

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,660
He was really good at it.

25
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,130
yeah uh Suga-san, Suga-san,

26
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,900
wait I'm confused!

27
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,500
He's got it in the bag.

28
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,140
Each member's 100 yen shopping text

29
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,440
What should I do ... Something Idol-ish?

30
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,500
But deciding - something Idol-ish is...

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,570
I have to decide on a clothing style.

32
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,570
This is...

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:58,480
Black garbage bag

34
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,540
Is 70 litres big?

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,400
In terms of the size

36
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,480
Let's make a costume with this.

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,180
What's this?

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,420
This nail ...

39
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,250
You put this on nails right?

40
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:13,700
Nail parts

41
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,560
Putting this on the ear lobes, like this...

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,390
...that would be good right?

43
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,700
It would work, right?

44
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,980
I have an image in my mind.
Something a little flashy.

45
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,140
I'm thinking of something like Britney Spears.

46
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,110
They have wigs! There's wigs after all.

47
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,610
500 yen ...
Are these the only wigs?

48
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,820
But the wig is essential

49
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,000
This is - Woah! Amazing!

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,760
It makes such a difference with the wig.

51
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,220
How should I go about shopping here?

52
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,940
I have absolutely no vision here.

53
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,140
What's this?

54
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,470
Stool covers...

55
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,080
This part could work for the head or something.

56
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,080
Look, this is good.

57
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:08,800
Wig

58
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,600
This with that hat,

59
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,800
I can have come down the sides like this.

60
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
I need two of them.

61
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,560
Is 1000 yen really enough for this?

62
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,700
I have this image of a masked beauty.

63
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,630
A flowery, kimono-style look

64
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,480
I want to wear a Hakama actually.

65
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,480
TN: Hakama are like traditional Japanese trousers.

66
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,740
On top of the kimono...

67
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,070
...somehow build on this.

68
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,440
Then let's do the Hakama!

69
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,000
Something, like a Gyaru or Lolita.
Easy to shop for.

70
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,040
Hair... I gotta do something about my head.

71
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:55,680
Pink knitting yarn

72
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,340
Yarn could be good.

73
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,680
Something flashy is probably good.

74
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,060
Will this be enough?

75
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,260
I think makeup is important.

76
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,160
A flashy woman would be good.

77
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,860
A cabaret style,

78
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,220
Eye shadow...

79
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,160
I'm interested in trying this,

80
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:22,160
Eye shadow

81
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,390
This has glitter in it.

82
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,160
Glitter is no good, for a flashy crossdresser.

83
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:28,080
Last time on a shoot, we had a very pretty crossdresser on as a guest.

84
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,300
I'm keeping that image in mind.

85
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:43,960
Table cloths

86
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,760
They have table cloths,

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Ah, this is pretty, sort of...

88
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,220
...if I put two together it could work.

89
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,120
Do you have a theme in mind?

90
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,200
Something Latin, something bright and cheerful.

91
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,200
I don't know- AH this is a hat!

92
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:06,780
Seat covers

93
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,200
This is a mesh seat cover.

94
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
How's this?

95
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,640
Is it bad? Look, how's this?

96
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,640
What, what's wrong with it?!

97
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,740
Damn it, I don't wanna do this!

98
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,000
I have no idea.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Someone help me, what do I do here?

100
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,350
Is that a brassiere?

101
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,350
Crossdressers wear this often

102
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:31,490
Extra large ribbon

103
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,490
Eh? I'm wrong?

104
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,490
Just tell me! I have no idea.

105
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:38,000
After shopping, dressed in their finest, they head for a cafe.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,520
What kind of crossdresser have they transformed into?

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,960
Cafe Meeting Spot

108
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,980
What is it?!

109
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
You're not that important.

110
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Makes me so angry, honestly.

111
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,960
Tablecloths (x2)
Hairband
Eyebrow
Lipgloss
Color | Artificial lavender

112
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Ah I just hate it

113
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,980
Could I take your ord-

114
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,980
Coffee of course!

115
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,980
Don't treat me like a moron!

116
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,620
Hurry up and get it!

117
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,320
What is this, seriously,

118
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,160
They just don't care about punctuality.

119
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,480
Just morons everywhere honestly.

120
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,000
I cannot believe this. I genuinely cannot believe this.

121
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,800
Sorry for the wait.

122
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,060
Ashtray. Bring an ashtray here, hurry.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,200
They're all so clueless, honestly.

124
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,600
So late, honestly.

125
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,280
It's way cold!

126
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,220
You're late!

127
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,220
You're too early, you are!

128
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:51,340
What are you saying, I'm here on time!

129
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,340
Well you're supposed to wait for me.

130
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:57,360
Pink hair thread
Tote bag
Suit storage bag
Bath boots
Lip gloss
Black tights
Table mat

131
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,340
There was traffic!

132
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,340
Where did you come from?

133
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,360
Where?!

134
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,360
Where uhhh - Asakusa!

135
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,880
There's no traffic there.

136
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,220
Asakusa has so much traffic!

137
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,220
Don't go to Asakusa then!

138
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,750
I'm pissed off cause of the traffic!

139
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,750
Hurry up and decide on a drink.

140
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,820
Coffee of course!

141
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,930
Order it then!

142
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,340
Coffee please! Hurry up!

143
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,340
They're so late, honestly.

144
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,340
So late! Making us wait, honestly.

145
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,470
What were you doing in Asakusa?

146
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,040
Asakusa- that thing, you know...

147
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,640
I was looking at dogs.

148
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,650
You can look at dogs anywhere!

149
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,620
Askauksa has cute dogs.

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,620
The hell would I know!

151
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,500
What?!

152
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,500
You're late!

153
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Wait a minute!

154
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,660
Only uglies here!

155
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,280
What the hell are these hags?

156
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,640
After all that time?

157
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:49,400
Shower cap
Wig
Fake Eyelashes
Ankle socks|Body Towel
Lip gloss

158
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,960
Hurry up and sit!

159
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,400
Hold on, dondake? DONDAKEEEE!!!!!

160
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,400
TN: Dondake is a slang exclamation like "SHEESH" is for zoomers now I think.

161
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,000
So bloody ugly!

162
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,540
What about you!

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,540
Wait a second

164
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,040
I don't want to be grouped in with you!

165
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,920
What are you ordering?

166
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,600
COFFEE OF COURSE! HURRY THE FUCK UP PLEASE!

167
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,580
Hurry up!

168
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,550
What do you eat normally?

169
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,220
What's your favourite?

170
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,080
I like corn.

171
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,440
I like CORN!

172
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,160
It's making me laugh!

173
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,160
What are you laughing at?

174
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,920
What do you like to eat?

175
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,780
Tsukemen (cold Chinese noodles)

176
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,780
Which is it?!

177
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,780
Hot or cold?

178
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,300
I like the hot tsukemen more.

179
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,300
That kind?!

180
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,300
You like shit noodles.

181
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Yeah well

182
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,660
Hurry up and bring it!

183
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,660
You guys are slow godammit!

184
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,920
Don't mess with me!

185
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,920
I'll go home!

186
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,460
Sorry for the wait.

187
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,460
Seriously you...

188
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,990
You, raggedy ass.

189
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,990
You're the most rageddy ass!

190
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,750
Theme! What's your theme!

191
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,280
You can tell just by looking!

192
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
I'm traditional Japanese.

193
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,490
I'm from Kyoto.

194
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,490
That's dirty!

195
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,490
What are you?

196
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,140
It's Thelma Aoyama.

197
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,420
Thelma Aoyama.

198
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,760
What is that?

199
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,120
Seriously, it is pretty terrible.

200
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,860
Do you even want to do this?

201
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,340
Of course I want to do this!

202
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,340
You are just terrible.

203
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,600
What is it?!

204
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,380
What the hell are you wearing?

205
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,680
I left at bath time!

206
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,750
You guys are copying each other!

207
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,960
I came here straight from the bath!

208
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,960
You're the one copying me!

209
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,550
Wait, hold on wait,

210
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,220
Our tops are matching too!

211
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,220
You two!

212
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,220
You...

213
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,260
You guys are copying each other.

214
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,260
What, cut it out.

215
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,030
That's why they made come here third.

216
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,440
Is the variation GONNA BE OKAY?

217
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,440
What are they doing, so late.

218
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,820
They should hurry up, honestly.

219
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,560
I don't want to be with these ugly hags.

220
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,000
You're one to talk.

221
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,500
Welcome, good evening.

222
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,400
YOU'RE LATE!

223
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,880
What the hell were you doing?

224
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,780
Barefoot?!

225
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,380
Don't rush me, honestly.

226
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,070
You're late!

227
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,070
I'm not late, you guys are early.

228
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,500
Hold on, how did you use the money?

229
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,070
Where did you spend it?

230
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,940
You guys... Didn't set your hair?

231
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:19,080
Pink stole
Wig
Eyeshadow
Torn White Cloth
Eyelashes

232
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,040
We did!

233
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,580
It's terrible! What is that on your head?

234
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,460
I did this, I got this done properly.

235
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,420
Seriously what is that?

236
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,040
You're the odd man out.

237
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,050
What do you mean odd man out?

238
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,140
What concept is this?

239
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,140
Concept? Do you have a concept?

240
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,460
I do.

241
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,460
What is it?

242
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:38,460
A beautiful witch, straight out of the bathtub.

243
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,480
This person is terrible.

244
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,460
What!

245
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,320
What are you?

246
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
What are you, honestly.

247
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,840
Well I am,

248
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,760
A hot pants woman.

249
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,350
I don't understand.

250
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,350
Hold on, you came here barefoot?

251
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,800
I told you, I was in a rush!

252
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,860
What is this?  What is this? Kamui?

253
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,180
Kamui Gaiden?

254
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,500
No it isn't.

255
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,760
What's wrong with this?

256
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,390
Wear proper shoes

257
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,580
Your shoes?!

258
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,940
Are you two copying each other?

259
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,040
Yeah these are guys are matching.

260
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,040
Why?

261
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,280
The top is matching too.

262
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,580
That's why he's third.

263
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,580
The colours are matching too

264
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,900
Well if we want to be pretty, we might end up matching.

265
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,420
Hmm? Doesn't this gathering suck?

266
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,620
We told them this is the meeting place right?

267
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,120
We did, we did.

268
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,080
It is unacceptable to be so non-punctual.

269
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,360
I just hate that.

270
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,040
Welcome, good evening.

271
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,100
You're late.

272
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,920
I'm not late.

273
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,480
What are you doing? What the hell?

274
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,940
Don't say "What the hell"

275
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,420
Don't copy the same theme as your partner!

276
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,660
Only I should be Tradtional Japanese!

277
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,280
I'M the Japanese Culture!

278
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,380
Are you guys from a folktale?

279
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,360
Folkstory? I came from Kyoto
Where the hell are you from?

280
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,300
You're a grandfather from a folkstory!

281
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,300
Grandfather?! What do you mean grandfather?

282
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,700
Hold on, let me see your shoes.

283
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,340
Show them to us!

284
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,380
Why do I have to show them?

285
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,380
Faster!

286
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,240
It's like this

287
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,240
What is that?

288
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,810
Socks.

289
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,460
What is this?

290
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:32,760
Bicycle Cover (x2)
Tablecloths (x2)
Black felt hairband
Shawl
Lip gloss

291
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,880
I tied my hair up bunny style today.

292
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,380
It's all solid...

293
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,740
Are you messed up in the head?

294
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,360
What is this?

295
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,360
Amazing you walked outside like that.

296
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,160
What is this inside?

297
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,530
It's felt!

298
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,140
There's felt inside.

299
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:53,100
What is this? You guys have no confidence.

300
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,000
Let's sit down.

301
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,000
I just hate this.

302
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,100
Honestly so ugly.

303
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,100
So ugly, so ugly.

304
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,560
So ugly, it's amazing.

305
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,260
The old man smell is intense.

306
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,660
It's probably the person showing the most skin.

307
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,560
It's you isn't it?

308
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,080
It's you right?

309
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,300
Definitely not me.

310
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,140
Disgusting. What is this smell? I hate it here.

311
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,480
Are you trying to be a surfer?

312
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,230
I can surf, why?

313
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,330
I can skateboard too.

314
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,300
I just like that stuff.

315
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,360
This guy's concept is annoying.

316
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,680
This guys belly-

317
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,440
Don't look at my belly, seriously.

318
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,680
I'll work it off in the summer.

319
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,180
I'll definitely work it off.

320
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,540
I don't want to be invited to this ugly people party.

321
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,800
(various crossdresser noises)

322
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,240
I don't want to be bullied.

323
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,240
I don't want to be singled out.

324
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,220
You're one to talk.

325
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,260
You don't have a boyfriend!

326
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,580
I do have one!

327
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,580
I have one.

328
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,720
You guys broke up that last time.

329
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,720
I got another one immediately.

330
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,920
What kind of man? Tell us!

331
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,850
He works for TV Asahi.

332
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,780
What?

333
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,780
Let's ask about this!

334
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,590
Does he have any TV shows?

335
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,590
He has a bunch.

336
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,460
He's a reporter.

337
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,820
He reports the news.

338
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,880
No way someone like you is dating a reporter.

339
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,880
Well I am.

340
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,600
What the hell is that?

341
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,820
Who is your boyfriend?

342
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,970
Me? I'm free.

343
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,780
It's a pain in the ass.

344
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,760
You have a boyfriend?

345
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,760
I do!

346
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,780
He's a business industry worker.

347
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,540
Financial Relations?

348
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,640
I've heard of Financial Industry before,

349
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,830
But Business Industry?

350
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,560
It's business!

351
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,220
He's a generally a businessman.

352
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,200
I don't want to hear this from a single person!

353
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,860
That's true.

354
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,860
That hurts, stop it.

355
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,000
Honestly if I keep talking to these hags,

356
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,000
I'll become a hag too.

357
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,320
Sorry for the wait!

358
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,520
Get lost! Get the fuck out of here!

359
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,520
I'm here!

360
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,440
I'm telling you get lost!

361
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,280
There's only pubes here!

362
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,400
Aluminum two-top
Yellow wig
Eyeshadow
Sponge holder (x2)
Lipstick
Gold/Silver Origami

363
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,400
Just a bunch of pubes!

364
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,400
Sorry, what is that hair?

365
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,100
It looks grilled.

366
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,450
I got it done today

367
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,060
You don't know?

368
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,090
This new hairstyle?

369
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,690
What's it called?

370
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,780
This is uhhh...

371
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,130
...it's...Pearl White hair.

372
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,820
-  What the hell is that?
- What do you mean "What the hell?!"

373
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,080
You're weird all over.

374
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,420
Look who's talking.

375
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,720
I'm cute of course.

376
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,920
Only you are horrible.

377
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,920
Your...

378
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,880
Your hairpiece is offensive.

379
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,580
That isn't 100 yen is it?

380
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,420
It's not 100 yen.

381
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:05,140
What the hell?

382
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,920
We're all using 100 yen stuff.

383
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,080
The whole thing right? The total price.

384
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,580
And still, you're barefoot

385
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,480
You're barefoot?

386
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
You walked outside like that?

387
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,180
Barefoot?!

388
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,210
What's wrong with barefoot?

389
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,450
And your tits.

390
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,980
What are those tits?

391
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,380
This is gum tape,

392
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,020
and wrapped up tissues, what's wrong with that?

393
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,020
You spent money there?

394
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,420
I didn't!

395
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,740
That's against the rules isn't it?

396
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,800
I'm telling the truth!

397
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,990
It's true, I didn't use it!

398
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,990
This guy is so annoying.

399
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,330
If I think about I get angry.

400
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,860
Don't go and make a strange character all by yourself.

401
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,800
It's so cold out there!

402
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,960
What is that?

403
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,700
It's an old man.

404
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,460
It's freezing!

405
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,560
I waited so long too.

406
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,460
These boots...

407
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,030
...they're short boots!

408
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,960
My legs are bare, and it's cold!

409
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:27,360
Black trash bags
Giant ribbon | Rose cheek
Lip gloss
Fake nails
Feather Muffler

410
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,670
It's messed up!

411
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,360
(Old name for Osaka)

412
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,360
A grandmother from Naniwa?

413
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,360
The pants are amazing.

414
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,560
I'm from Kansai, I came from Osaka today!

415
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,450
You look the same as before!

416
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,400
You are unchanged.

417
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,240
You look pretty much the same.

418
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,000
What the hell are you saying, honestly?

419
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,840
What are those shoes?

420
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,690
Explain!

421
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,340
It looks so disgustingly hand made.

422
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,380
Perhaps that's why he took so long.

423
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,970
It took me some time, look!

424
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,860
Stop messing around already.

425
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:05,310
Wait, the material, what is this?

426
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,840
Oh no, oh no!

427
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,540
No! Not this material!

428
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,890
It's that thing from "Suna No Utsuwa!"

429
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,890
TN: A murder detective movie from 1974.

430
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,440
He's a vagabond.

431
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,720
You should work on your hair.

432
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,130
Your hair is just normal.

433
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,130
Enough, seriously just enough.

434
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,320
ENOUGH ALREADY!

435
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,000
ME TOO!

436
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,660
ME TOO!

437
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,080
UWAHAHAH

438
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,640
NO!

439
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,280
STOP!

440
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,380
Say it already!

441
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,170
What the hell?

442
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,170
Why are you acting surprised?

443
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,020
I thought I might talk over one of you.

444
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,400
(Disagreeing Crossdressers)

445
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,280
What the hell...

446
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,160
I don't want to be associated...

447
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,940
I think I'm the most beautiful one here.

448
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,700
It's me!

449
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
I think it's me, seriously.

450
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,860
You've got some confidence.

451
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,700
That guy gets zero points, right?

452
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,370
That guy gets zero points.

453
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,370
It's really awful.

454
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,660
Why me?

455
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,440
You're all over the place.

456
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,940
He's in a trash bag!

457
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,150
Is that party spray? What is that?

458
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,840
It's not a spray idiot.

459
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,920
Is that noodles?

460
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,440
It's obviously not noodles!

461
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,580
Completed

462
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,720
Wasn't that too long?

463
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,060
That was so long.

464
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,800
Long, too long.

465
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,300
I feel so bad for the server.

466
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm very sorry for saying all that stuff.

467
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,600
S'okay.

468
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,620
S'okay?

469
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,500
Our duo kind of copied each other, we're both the traditional style.

470
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,700
That's a tablecloth too right?

471
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,370
A tablecloth?

472
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:58,430
But look, I'm in high heels. See?

473
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,360
You made that right?

474
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,620
What is that?

475
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,340
This is, look...

476
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,580
That's a boot inside?

477
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,960
Cause it's a 100 yen shop.

478
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,580
So we all just got different colour versions of that.

479
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,140
Just different colours.

480
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,020
Yeah but I put the bag over it, look.

481
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,880
I've got the underwear too.

482
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,180
Show me.

483
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,820
Seriously?

484
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,540
You bought some?

485
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,900
Using the leftover material.

486
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,900
It matches huh.

487
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,620
So why then didn't you show us?

488
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,160
What if the conversation never turned this way?

489
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,700
What is the point?

490
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,600
You'd just be wearing that at the end.

491
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,620
I see.

492
00:20:53,860 --> 00:21:01,360
Here, crossdressing performer Bourbonne chooses the most beautiful person.

493
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,540
A personal touch, something you thought of yourself.

494
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:11,060
So looking at all of us, which of us became the prettiest using the 1000 yen?

495
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,760
Everyone is very confident.

496
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,780
Could you first choose the worst one?

497
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,800
"1000 yen crossdresser meetup"
Who is the ugliest?

498
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,040
Seriously consider.

499
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,000
Hama-chan is last.

500
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,760
Well, because...

501
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,380
There's no need for explanation.

502
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,020
Your face? You put just enough to look drunk.

503
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,280
I was cautious of putting going overboard.

504
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,000
Something like this I thought is too far, it's lame!

505
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,200
What the hell is that?

506
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
It's cute!

507
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,360
That's cute?

508
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,500
Too much, too much.

509
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,600
So last is Hamada, first place please.

510
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,440
Going by total balance,

511
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,410
Kotoge-kun!

512
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,380
It looks similar to Lady Gaga.

513
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,780
If that's first place what can we do.

514
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:33,050
I think Hosei-san was really confident he'd win.

515
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:39,240
Yeah, he was way more into it than us. He was so confident.

516
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,860
To be honest I thought I'd win.

517
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,580
OK, thank you very much.

518
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,640
Here the shoot is over...

519
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,780
...but Hamada notices that man is not present.

520
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,580
Heipo isn't here!

521
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:09,450
Heipo is... at a prank location.

522
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,440
He's waiting by the streetside.

523
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,260
In women's clothes.

524
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,720
Where is everyone?!

525
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,730
It's freezing!

526
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,760
Hey! Please someone, it's cold!

527
00:23:53,140 --> 00:24:01,740
I'm too bareskinned, please! Please just end this!

528
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,140
A 60+ old man, in women's clothes?

529
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,240
He might end up in danger.
