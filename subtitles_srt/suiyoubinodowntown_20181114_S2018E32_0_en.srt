00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:07,490
Welcome to this week's Wednesday Downtown!

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,490
Thanks for having us!

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,260
Let's kick it off with our first presenter. Come on out!

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,830
Please welcome Bakarhythm to the studio!

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,830
Pleased to be here!

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,770
Thanks!

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,040
Yes?

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,000
For a second I thought you were some brainy high schooler.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,340
Is it the suit?

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,010
Uh, thanks.

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,580
A programmer, a genius programmer.

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,540
About time we had a student on here.

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,650
Last time I presented,

14
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,220
The segment was "Early Bird Escape Game," remember?

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,550
It aired about two years ago.

16
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,890
We crossed an escape game with an early morning wakeup, and it was quite funny.

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,130
Bando Eiji-san freaked out on Kotouge, which made a splash online.

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,300
"...Freaked out on?"

19
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,040
Learn to turn down gigs, you idiot. Have some self-respect.

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,040
You're right...

21
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,170
Of course work's gonna be hard to find!

22
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:06,810
This time, we're mixing the escape game with something a little different. Here it is:

23
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,020
Parent-Child Real Escape Game

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,520
Parent-child?

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,650
Seems they'll bicker.

26
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,590
This time, we've gotten rid of some of the more unclear elements...

27
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,490
...so that parents and kids will be able to work together and solve the puzzle.

28
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,760
What'd you think, Matsumoto-san? Ever solved a riddle with your daughter?

29
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,500
Yeah, uh... probably.

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,100
For example...?

31
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,270
As a parent and child. Ever cooperate on a project?

32
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,270
No, yeah...

33
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,640
Like... uh, building a house.

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,910
No, that's not what I meant.

35
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,140
Building a house?

36
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,140
There's no way.

37
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,740
That's not a kid activity.

38
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,780
After the break: comedians and their kids challenge the escape room!

39
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,150
Stop!

40
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,250
And...

41
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,050
"Rest of Your Life in Prison vs. Deserted Island"

42
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,390
We ask the studio the truly divisive questions!

43
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,090
Then...

44
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,630
I'll protect you no matter what.

45
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,100
Kuro-chan's romantic reality show: Monster House!

46
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,770
I like you so much~

47
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,950
Parent-Child Escape Game

48
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,720
First stage:

49
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,860
Avoid the pits and escape the maze!

50
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,330
To reach the goal, the blindfolded parent...

51
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,900
...must rely solely on the direction of his child.

52
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,640
Three teams of comedian parent-child pairs will be participating.

53
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,670
Comedians, huh?

54
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,080
Our first participant, brought here without knowing a single thing:

55
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,280
Who is it?

56
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,280
Who's that?

57
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,780
Alco & Peace

58
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,780
Hirako Yuuki

59
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,120
Hirako-san!

60
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,720
What? Scary...

61
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,850
What?

62
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,520
Daddy!

63
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,520
Seems scary...

64
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,660
Over here!

65
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,120
Cute!

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
So small!

67
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,360
Mitsuki?

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,030
Ah, he knows her voice.

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,530
Over here, over here!

70
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,860
What? Mitsuki? Mitsuki??

71
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,130
Daddy, you're blindfolded so this might be dangerous...

72
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,940
So blunt!

73
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,670
Moving on...

74
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,200
Where am I?

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,470
Akatsu

76
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,470
No, don't let go-- don't let go!!

77
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,940
Akatsu

78
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,180
Daddy~!

79
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,080
Cute!! She looks like him.

80
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,810
Nodoka?

81
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,710
You know right away by the voice.

82
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,250
And finally...

83
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,520
Freaky! Where am I?

84
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,520
Nakagawa Paradise

85
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,520
Woman Rush Hour

86
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,290
Ah, that's right!

87
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,790
Your eyes are closed! Can you guess who I am?

88
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,360
Rintaro? Rintaro??

89
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,330
The oldest kid.

90
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,330
A boy.

91
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,360
Yup!

92
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,060
I'm waaaay over here!

93
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,630
Over here!

94
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,500
He's so happy!

95
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,830
You say "over here" but where's "here" to begin with?

96
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,770
Now that the contestants recognize their kids...

97
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,770
This seems fun for the kids.

98
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,740
PARENT-CHILD ESCAPE ROOM: FIRST STAGE

99
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,740
Won't it be too hard?

100
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,910
OBTAIN THE KEY AND ESCAPE THIS ROOM

101
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,840
Key?

102
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,110
How am I supposed to get the key?

103
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,420
ONLY YOUR CHILD IS PERMITTED TO REMOVE THE BLINDFOLD

104
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,090
The only one who can take off my blindfold is my kid...?

105
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,160
Who will be the first pair to escape?

106
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,590
I wonder...

107
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,530
Mitsuki, where are you?

108
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,470
Give me one more big shout, please!

109
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,070
Here! I'm over here!

110
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,070
"Here I am!" or--

111
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,070
She's getting a little teary.

112
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,070
Oh, jeez.

113
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,870
This way-- is it the way daddy's finger is pointing?

114
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,610
She's just a kid after all.

115
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,040
Daddy, if you get a Game Over, you might die.

116
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,980
If Daddy gets a Game Over--?

117
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,210
"You might die."

118
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,210
That's kid logic for you.

119
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,310
If I get a Game Over I'll die?

120
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,850
He'll die in front of his kid...?

121
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,310
Yeah.

122
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,250
Is it ok if I head over to meet you, Mitsuki?

123
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,950
Yikes, dangerous!

124
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,250
Yeah.

125
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,850
This way? Is this the right way?

126
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,650
That's wrong!

127
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,120
This way?

128
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,120
This way!

129
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,450
That way?

130
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,450
That way!

131
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,920
It's ok if I head this way?

132
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,520
She's 4, right?

133
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,660
That's not it! That's not it!

134
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,590
Which way?

135
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,260
Because she doesn't know her right from her left...

136
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,060
This would be hard for a 4-year-old.

137
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,060
She can't tell, huh.

138
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,200
...her directions are limited to "this way" and "that way".

139
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,200
It's even harder to indicate left and right in the reverse.

140
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,200
That's gotta be tricky.

141
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,100
This way?

142
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,100
Yeah!

143
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,240
Straight ahead just like this is ok?

144
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,870
He'll bump into the wall

145
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,840
I'm going this wa--

146
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,340
He takes his time at the starting line...

147
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,880
...and already 5 minutes have passed.

148
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,980
So that's the strategy.

149
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,050
Stop!

150
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,250
This way?

151
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,250
Yeah!

152
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,080
Straight ahead?

153
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,080
Yeah

154
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,590
Daddy's going this way.

155
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,590
Okay.

156
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,350
Good, good.

157
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,120
Tell me which way you are, okay?

158
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,120
Okay.

159
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,730
Watch out--!

160
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,860
Stop!!

161
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,130
Naturally, the parents are not aware of the pitfalls.

162
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
Why'd she say stop there?

163
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,700
Fun's not over yet, dummy!

164
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,600
Ya see?

165
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,500
It's because you didn't listen to me!

166
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,970
That's right. You told me to stop, didn't you.

167
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,970
Yeah.

168
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:33,040
By the way, restarting from the falling point is allowed.

169
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,510
How sweet!

170
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,740
Oh, so that's allowed.

171
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,950
This is to shorten the length of the game by preventing huge time losses.

172
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,180
Can't be too unreasonable.

173
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,350
But then...

174
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,150
What a cute sweater.

175
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,960
It might be too dangerous to play anymore...

176
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,960
What?

177
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,860
Playing is dangerous!

178
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,360
Huh, what? What's wrong, Mitsuki?

179
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,730
"Dangerous"

180
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,730
"Playing is dangerous."

181
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,200
Mitsuki, what's the matter?

182
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,560
Playing is scary...!

183
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,100
What? It's not scary, don't be scared!

184
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,600
Mitsuki, don't cry! Daddy's right here.

185
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,970
It's because he fell.

186
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,400
Look! It's your daddy~!

187
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,740
It was scary,
watching him fall.

188
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,740
Ah, that makes sense.

189
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,910
I wanna go back to mommy's house...!

190
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,210
"Mommy's house"...?

191
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,470
Let's go back to mommy's house together!

192
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,010
They live together!

193
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,080
Current state of affairs:
"The game is too dangerous to continue."

194
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,010
Maybe not, haha.

195
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,750
They don't live together?

196
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,850
"Mommy's house."

197
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,220
Meanwhile, the Akatsu clan...

198
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,590
Quick!

199
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,390
Huh? There's pitfalls here?

200
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,390
Nodoka?

201
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,090
...discovers the traps from the get-go.

202
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,360
Can you tell me? Tell me which way to go.

203
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,390
Ah, right.

204
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,500
Right?

205
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,500
Ah, she knows.

206
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,500
Yeah.

207
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,100
Man, they sure look alike.

208
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,430
This way?

209
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,430
Yeah, that's right.

210
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,370
Knowing left from right, Nodoka-chan is able to give precise directions.

211
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,540
The team makes sure-footed progress.

212
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,170
She's gotta know when
to say "stop" or else...

213
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,170
Right! It's all about the stop.

214
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,740
Furthermore...

215
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,480
And then one step forward...

216
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,080
Just one step forward is good?

217
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,080
Yeah.

218
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,850
Smart cookie!

219
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,080
There!

220
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Oh, nice! Very nice.

221
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,710
Here?

222
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,080
What a clever kid!

223
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,710
Yeah.

224
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,250
Even her "stop" timing is perfect.

225
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,450
She's doing great!

226
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,450
The resemblance is crazy.

227
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,790
They continue towards the goal.

228
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,690
Hurry, now.

229
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:56,800
And the father-son pair of oldest participant Rintaro and Paradise...

230
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,220
Ah, I see the resemblance.

231
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,760
Six years old, huh?

232
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,030
Now move forward without falling.

233
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,300
I can't find my footing!

234
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,270
Oh! They're doing quite well.

235
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,470
Like this?

236
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,340
...have yet to make a mistake.

237
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,840
Stop right there!

238
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,440
Stop?

239
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,870
The key's right there.

240
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,070
Key?

241
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,270
Ah, I see.

242
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,480
Ooh, got it!

243
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,080
All that's left is to grab the key and cross the finish line, but...

244
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,710
You're super close!

245
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,750
Just one more step.

246
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,620
Ah! No good!

247
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,620
Uwah--

248
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,320
This is a toughie.

249
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,190
Eh, what's the matter? Can't reach it?

250
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,320
Whatcha gonna do?

251
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,790
What do you think I should do?

252
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,190
This part in particular
seems really tough.

253
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,790
Ok, then to the side.

254
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,060
Here?

255
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,060
Yup.

256
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,930
What'll he do?

257
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,960
Go straight ahead.

258
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,890
Don't turn! Don't fall!

259
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,890
I got it.

260
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,970
Ya know what, just grab the key.

261
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,900
OW!

262
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,840
He's being goofy.

263
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,270
"Ya know what?
Just grab the key."

264
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,610
What gives?

265
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,840
Meanwhile, Team Hirako...

266
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,140
What a little rascal!

267
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,210
I'm a raptor!

268
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,350
Does she like that? Ah!
It worked!

269
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:52,050
Thanks to some cheering up from her favorite dinosaur...

270
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,480
Amazing.

271
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,520
That's something else.

272
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,090
...they restart the game.

273
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,090
There's no pit there.

274
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,760
Can he even get the key?

275
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,290
Nodoka, tell me, is the key, uh...

276
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,760
The packing peanuts
are sticking to his back sweat.

277
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,430
Is it hanging above one of the holes?

278
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,630
Yeah, yeah.

279
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,860
If I jumped, could I grab it?

280
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,860
Yeah, yeah!

281
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,830
Really now?

282
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,830
Yup.

283
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,900
What a pickle...

284
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,900
Might not work 'cause
he can't see.

285
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,810
Hold on a second! Don't go that way!

286
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:19,980
Go back?

287
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,750
She's gonna cry again!

288
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,010
Mitsuki, don't cry don't cry don't cry!

289
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,520
Do you want daddy to become a T-Rex?

290
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,120
She really loves dinosaurs!

291
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,190
If that's what it takes!

292
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,720
Got it! I can kind of pull on it...

293
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,720
What's the deal with that?

294
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,720
That's it!

295
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,860
That's it! You got it!

296
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,290
Yeah!

297
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,690
Oh, he got it!

298
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,290
I got the key!

299
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:41,300
Finally, Team Paradise snatches the key!

300
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,200
And then...

301
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,670
Clear!

302
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,740
What? I cleared it?

303
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,110
A job well done lands them in first place.

304
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,310
Their time: 17 minutes, 11 seconds.

305
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,410
Ah, I get it! That's what this was.

306
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,050
Good stuff!

307
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,380
Rintaro wants to do it too!

308
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,120
Why would you want to do this??

309
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,390
In second place, Team Akatsu.

310
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,890
A successful escape in 24 minutes, 47 seconds.

311
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,160
That's one sweaty dude.

312
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,690
And rounding it out...

313
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,300
Ahh! Mitsuki!

314
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,630
Mitsu~ki~!

315
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,900
Thank you!

316
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Adorable.

317
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,740
*smooch*

318
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,810
This'll give me a cavity.

319
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,380
Team Hirako clocks in at 36 minutes, 20 seconds.

320
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,880
Too sweet for ya?

321
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,450
And so the first stage comes to a close.

322
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,020
Our leaderboard as it stands.

323
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,950
Moving on, the second stage:

324
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,220
Relay the Message! Escape from the Memory Room.

325
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,030
I see.

326
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,460
We can choose from these four questions.

327
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:51,170
1. Where was this photo taken? 2. What's the title of the song?
3. What's the name of this item? 4. What is this person's name?

328
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,370
You know what?

329
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,710
Say, Rintaro,

330
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,810
Do you think you could crawl through that hole?

331
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,540
That's right. The answers to these questions...

332
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,540
The kids go through there?

333
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:04,820
...all lie in another room only accessible to the kids.

334
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,750
ehh~

335
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,620
They must accurately describe what they see to their parents...

336
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,690
...and get at least 2 of the 4 questions right in order to escape.

337
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:10,960
I see!

338
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,620
The lacrosse stick...

339
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,620
Can they do this?

340
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,130
Could ya go in there for a sec?

341
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,200
In here?

342
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,200
Can you fit?

343
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,330
This kid rules.

344
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,230
Scary!

345
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,760
When you've got it, head back here, ok?

346
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,730
Gotcha!

347
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,930
Makes me want one.

348
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,330
Head back to me once you know the answer!

349
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,340
Was it a picture? What was it...

350
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,670
How're they gonna do this?

351
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,500
Daddy!

352
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,340
Ah, there's music playing, what's going on?

353
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,980
I just gotta look for that photo, right?

354
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,350
They can't talk to one another.

355
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,050
Going straight for the snacks.

356
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,580
Hey now...

357
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,220
What? What? What?

358
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,660
AHHH-- ouch, OW OW OW

359
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,550
Why??

360
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,490
It hurts! This hurts!!

361
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
Electricity?

362
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,690
Wait, wait! What's going on??

363
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,130
OUCH! OW, wait! Wait!

364
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,760
Snack trap!

365
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,230
Eating the candy set up as a distraction...

366
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,830
...activates the electric current connected to dad.

367
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
That's rough!

368
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,470
Are they all gonna eat?

369
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,470
Everyone's getting zapped!

370
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,140
That hurts! That HURTS!

371
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,140
She's unfazed.

372
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,440
No, what? What kind of gimmick is this?

373
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,510
What's the deal?

374
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
They all went for the candy.

375
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,920
Scared... I'm scared!

376
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Ow! Ow, ow...

377
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,120
Why? What?

378
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,220
Why? I didn't even do anything.

379
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,790
Over there... someone was there, right?

380
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,790
Yeah, a person was there.

381
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,900
Real quick, could you go back and ask "what's your name"?

382
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,030
I see.

383
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,170
Team Akatsu's plan: start from question number four.

384
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,240
What's your name?

385
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,970
Hmm, I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

386
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,840
Short sketch! Daruma-san ga Koronda!

387
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,250
Daruma-san ga... COLOMBIA'S OVER HERE??

388
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
wonder if she can
explain this...

389
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,520
Here! It's Colombia!

390
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,860
What's your job?

391
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,890
I'm a space pirate!

392
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,360
A space pirate...?

393
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,360
Correct.

394
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,900
That's good!

395
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,100
How'd it go?

396
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,040
He had a really cool voice.

397
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,040
A really cool voice?

398
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,900
What did his face look like?

399
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,570
He was handsome~!

400
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,070
Handsome, huh?

401
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,040
That's handsome?

402
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
"Handsome!"

403
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,580
He said he was a space pirate...

404
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,580
Space pirate?

405
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,880
They've got this.

406
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,250
By any chance did this person...

407
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,650
Was his face white?

408
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,820
Yeah, it was white.

409
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,820
It was white!

410
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
He's got it.

411
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,320
You don't say!

412
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,630
I think he was at mommy and daddy's wedding...

413
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,460
Yeah...

414
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,460
Ah, yeah.

415
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,860
This person's name is...

416
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,730
Gor?Geous-san!

417
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,770
We did it!

418
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,500
We did it!

419
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,810
His peculiar occupation serving as a hint...

420
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,240
So it was Gor-san over there!

421
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,040
Team Akatsu breezes through.

422
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,910
Really now!

423
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,910
Just one more question until escape.

424
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,020
Also aiming for question four, Team Hirako.

425
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,980
Uh-oh...

426
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,980
That's gotta be scary.

427
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,620
A scary person was there?

428
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,920
What kind of clothes were they wearing? Can you tell me the color?

429
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,720
He was wearing purple clothes...

430
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,760
A guy wearing purple clothes...?

431
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,090
It was scary!

432
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,030
Number four... Gor?Geous.

433
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,330
Gor?Geous??

434
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,200
Purple clothes-- Gor?Geous!! It was Gor?Geous!!

435
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,340
You're amazing, Mitsuki-chan! Wow!

436
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,470
Gor?Geous, he came to mommy and daddy's wedding.

437
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,380
What's with the weddings?

438
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,380
He's everywhere!!

439
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,610
A "who woulda thought?" connection leads to a two-way tie.

440
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,520
Is this guy everywhere or what?

441
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,650
There was a pirate over there with a "Space Parrot"!

442
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,920
A pirate... with a "Space Parrot"?

443
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,620
That's good!

444
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,620
He's just about got it

445
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:31,920
Yeah.

446
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,830
And the face? What was his face like?

447
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,190
It kinda looked like a lady's face.

448
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,830
You mean he was wearing makeup?

449
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:38,830
Yeah.

450
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
You should know by now!

451
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,930
He had lipstick on!

452
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,500
Lipstick... it's a comedian, right?

453
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,600
He's got plenty of clues.

454
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,340
The guy who has that star over his eye...

455
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,540
What was his name again...

456
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,270
Yeah! On his face!

457
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,240
Can he not think of the name?

458
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,340
He had a star on his face?

459
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,580
Over his eye, with white makeup and a little mustache drawn on...

460
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,780
Who was that again...

461
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,610
It's a comedian. That guy with the globe.

462
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,320
Oh god, I can't remember his name! This is frustrating!

463
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,690
Dad can't remember his colleague's name.

464
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,250
Augh, that's rough.

465
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,920
Can't get it, huh.

466
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,240
Team Paradise's next target: question two.

467
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,740
SAY-SAY KOOEY NE~?

468
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,740
Ok, good good good good.

469
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,150
What's this?

470
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,550
SAY-SAY KOOEY NE~? DO DO DO DO DOO DO

471
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,320
SAY-SAY GOO-RI NE~? DO DO DO DO DOO DO

472
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,320
What song is this?

473
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,220
Say-say goo-ri ne, do do do do doo do...

474
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,220
What is this...

475
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,190
Say-say goo-ri ne... wait, I don't--

476
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,060
Now I'm wondering what it is.

477
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,660
I don't know what this is!

478
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,790
What a performance!

479
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,300
It was a song I've never heard before!

480
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,300
Say-say goo-ri ne...

481
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,230
By the way, here's the correct answer.

482
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,230
SUSHI KUI NE~?
LET'S EAT SUSHI~?

483
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,040
Ah, that's tough.

484
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,040
Well... I mean...

485
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,410
Now that I'm hearing it...

486
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,980
SAY-SAY KOOEY NE~? DO DO DO DO DOO DO

487
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,580
Though he did an exceptional job at recreating it...

488
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,980
They can do it!!

489
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,920
Once again, dad hobbles the team's progress.

490
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,780
This kid is so cheery

491
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,950
That's not all...

492
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,190
It looked a lot like one of those nets you catch bugs with.

493
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,190
He's smart!

494
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,090
What else can you tell me about it?

495
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,960
It kinda looked like a broom, too.

496
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,960
Like a broom?

497
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,730
They make brooms with nets?

498
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,730
Just answer it...

499
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,360
It was in that movie "The Cat Returns".

500
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,900
Daddy's never seen "The Cat Returns".

501
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,640
When she goes "watch out, kitty!" and tries to catch it, it's that thing.

502
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,700
He's not gonna know...

503
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,940
He's got a great memory

504
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,070
Isn't that a bug-catching net?

505
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,880
In the feature film "The Cat Returns"...

506
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,050
...this lacrosse stick actually does make an appearance.

507
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,980
Come on, dad!

508
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:39,250
There's not much more information Rintaro-kun can give.

509
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,720
Well, of course.

510
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
Smartie!

511
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,450
It's something you use in sports...

512
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,690
That, uh...

513
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,320
Dammit, I don't know what that sport is called.

514
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,690
What's with this guy! He's pissing me off.

515
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,100
Once again, the answer eludes this ditzy dad.

516
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,500
What's it called...!

517
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,500
Team Paradise moves onto the final question.

518
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,640
It was like... the Sphinx was in it.

519
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,980
Pyramids, too.

520
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,080
It was a photo.

521
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,580
Oh! Egypt!

522
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,780
Awesome, Rintaro! Nice work, wow!

523
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,350
Thanks to his son, the team finally gets one right.

524
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,290
But this question...

525
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,290
Where is it...?

526
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,960
Egypt!

527
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,660
Tsuki-chan! We can go home!

528
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,260
Egypt! Sphinx... yes!

529
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,440
...was easily answered by the other two teams.

530
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,640
Due to its very low difficulty.

531
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,080
It has now been 15 minutes since Team Akatsu's escape.

532
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,610
Wait, for a second--

533
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,610
SAY, SAY!

534
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,250
Say, say... koo-ri ne... doo doo doo...

535
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,850
Say, say... kuri... ne... doo doo...

536
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,120
LET'S EAT SUSHI!

537
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,960
Yes! We did it!

538
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,360
You got that right for the most part!

539
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,200
The final results are as you see here.

540
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:58,930
1 hour.

541
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:06,540
Though the oldest gave a valiant effort, coming in first is Team Hirako.

542
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,770
And there you have it.

543
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,740
At first it seemed like anyone's game; the variation of skill was good.

544
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,930
What a lovely little segment.

545
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,500
You would never think that they're all having affairs.

546
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,850
They're not, and even if they were...

547
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,650
Isn't the likelihood pretty high?

548
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,790
T-san, what did you think?

549
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,230
That one kid at the end who pointed out the Sphinx...

550
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,830
I wouldn't even be able to answer that.

551
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,630
"Damn, that's one smart kid" I thought.

552
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,500
He knew his famous landmarks.

553
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,500
The whole time I was trying to remember the name.

554
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,370
Even the four-year-old... amazing.

555
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,340
Well, uh. It's ok.

556
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,210
That's bad news if you don't know the answer!

557
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,210
I suppose. What about you, KenKoba?

558
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,720
"It's too dangerous to play anymore!"

559
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,020
I wonder what caused her to come to that conclusion?

560
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,020
Yeah, I wonder...

561
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,990
"Uh-oh, dad's in danger" maybe.

562
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,520
She doesn't want to see him get hurt.

563
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,890
For sure. Kids are very protective of their fathers.

564
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,400
My daughter, for example. She hates Hamada.

565
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,330
"The bad man's gonna get daddy!"

566
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,840
Please welcome our next presenter. Come on out!

567
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,450
It's Koyabu Kazutoyo!

568
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,250
He's riding a bike.

569
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,590
Thanks for having me, guys!

570
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,220
This time around I've brought something new.

571
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:39,130
"Octopus vs. Squid: 50/50 Split". That was the survey we conducted in the studio last time.

572
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:44,200
Squid ending up winning 60% of the votes that time around.

573
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,200
Of course it would, yeah?

574
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,170
So, we were unable to prove the theory. However...

575
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,360
...this time, we asked 100 people on the street...

576
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,980
...in the hopes of achieving a perfect 50/50 balance in answers.

577
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,910
We'll be asking questions straight from the panelists.

578
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,010
I've come up with a few.

579
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,120
First off, T-Pablow's question. Here it is!

580
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:06,790
Life in Prison vs. Life on a Deserted Island: 50/50 Split

581
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,530
Ooh, that's a good one.

582
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,530
We can have a lot of fun with this one, I think.

583
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,500
Which would T pick, I wonder?

584
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,640
Keeping in mind the goal is to split the answers.

585
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,640
Ah, yes, that's right.

586
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,120
I do expect the answers to be even, but I've thought about it.

587
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,640
I suppose I'd pick prison. A deserted island may not be so great.

588
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,010
You've never been to prison. How about a deserted island?

589
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:36,020
I have. Well, sort of. It was semi-deserted, only about 12 people on the island.

590
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,290
It was that kind of place.

591
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,520
So it's not a deserted island...

592
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,520
More of an island community.

593
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,430
There's people! There's only 12 of them, but they're there!

594
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,430
It was only kind of deserted.

595
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,800
They didn't have any cops, no electricity either.

596
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,800
No electricity on the whole island?

597
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,300
How'd you end up there?

598
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,240
Well, I'd been wanting to get out of my hometown for a bit...

599
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,980
So, that's where I headed.

600
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,980
You mean you ran away?

601
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,350
Yeah. Kind of sort of, a little bit.

602
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,350
Don't downplay it!

603
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,450
You ran away?

604
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,110
That's crazy.

605
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,980
On that island, we kind of...

606
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,620
You all gathered?

607
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,620
That's right.

608
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,220
All us mischievous people gathered there.

609
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,790
That's unbelievable.

610
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,830
I want to hear more stories from this guy.

611
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,460
Life in Prison vs. Life on a Deserted Island

612
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,670
Let's investigate if people are split exactly 50/50.

613
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,700
Both are undesirable situations, but...

614
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,340
While you lose your freedom, your basic necessities are met in prison.

615
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:36,080
On the other hand, you have your freedom but no basic necessities on a deserted island.

616
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,180
Will it actually turn out exactly 50/50?

617
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,350
Which is better, life in prison or life on a deserted island?

618
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,720
Life in prison.

619
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,590
Why do you think that?

620
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,990
There's food, clothes, and shelter.

621
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,200
As expected.

622
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,200
Prison.

623
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,830
Because there's everything you need there.

624
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,200
Right, a popular opinion.

625
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,200
Deserted island I suppose.

626
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,340
I kind of grew up in the countryside, so

627
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,270
I think I could survive alright.

628
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,970
Prison.

629
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,710
In prison, I might be able to have a dog and a boyfriend.

630
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,510
I think there would only be women.

631
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,520
Will the guards be women too?

632
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,120
I definitely want to go to the deserted island!

633
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,760
You can dry plants and make clothes from them.

634
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,590
It's a good theory.

635
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,630
I've thought about it a lot.

636
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,560
What is this?

637
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,530
Yeees.

638
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,000
Thank you very much.

639
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,800
Could you touch right here?

640
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:27,800
Ah, what is it?

641
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,900
This here is part of my body. My glasses I mean.

642
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,900
Ah, is that so?

643
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,100
It's okay?

644
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,100
What is she talking about?

645
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,570
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

646
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,840
Oh my.

647
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,910
It hurts. It's become part of my body.

648
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,980
Can I touch it one more time?

649
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,980
Yeah, that's fine.

650
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,380
Ah, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. It hurts.

651
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,780
Oh my.

652
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,620
Because it's part of my body.

653
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,120
What a lively woman.

654
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,350
Thank you very much.

655
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,980
What an encounter.

656
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,590
After that, we continue our investigation.

657
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,050
Thanks lady.

658
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,560
How shocking.

659
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,460
Prison would be better, wouldn't it.

660
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,790
I'd pick the deserted island.

661
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,960
The women prefer that.

662
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,960
I'd also pick the deserted island.

663
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,960
The women like the island.

664
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,860
Life in prison.

665
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,170
I pick life on the deserted island.

666
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:06,540
And so, after 10 answers, it's a surprisingly clean 5 to 5.

667
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,170
It's looking good.

668
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,370
It seems promising that the theory may be proven.

669
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,470
Truly.

670
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,210
Between life in prison or life on a deserted island...

671
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,780
...which would you choose?

672
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,680
This guy's been.

673
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,580
To juvenile detention.

674
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,450
He did bad things.

675
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,390
What did he do?

676
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:25,020
Unexpectedly, we discover someone who has been behind bars.

677
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,220
Well, they do exist.

678
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,220
There are people like that.

679
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,120
Why were you put in juvenile detention?

680
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,030
For fighting.

681
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,730
It was before I was 18, I think.

682
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,430
I was against at least 10 people.

683
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,070
And it was just me.

684
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,970
I was fighting and stabbed someone.

685
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,570
How many months were you there?

686
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,580
I was there for around 3 months, I think.

687
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,640
It may have been a bit longer. I can't remember.

688
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:52,520
The man with experience chooses...

689
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,280
Prison would be better.

690
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,690
A place without other people would be really...

691
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,690
It'd be lonely.

692
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,560
They might be bad people, but at least there's someone.

693
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,990
So softly spoken.

694
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,500
And so after asking 100 people around town, what is the result?

695
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,660
What is it?

696
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,300
Prison.

697
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,500
Life on a deserted island.

698
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,700
It's looking good.

699
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:16,210
Prison has 42 people and the deserted island has 58 people.

700
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,210
So that's how it is.

701
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,210
Close but not quite.

702
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,680
It was a good one, wasn't it?

703
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,680
It was.

704
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,380
Alright, let's go on to the next one.

705
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,450
Next we have Kendo Kobayashi's theory. Here goes.

706
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,850
When being questioned by the police,
what's more awkward to have in your pocket:

707
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,630
Bra vs. Revenge Notebook: 50/50 split.

708
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,860
What is this?

709
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,260
That would be awkward.

710
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,260
That's tough.

711
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,330
Would you have those in your pocket?

712
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,330
Of course not.

713
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,700
No, but if you had them...

714
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,700
What kind of situation is this?

715
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:43,700
Truly.

716
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,840
They'd say "You, what's this?".

717
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,800
You wouldn't be able to respond.

718
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,270
You'd be lost for words with both these things.

719
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:52,710
I only want to hear from guys on this one.

720
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,410
Next, we have Nicole's theory here.

721
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:01,450
Winter Clothes in Summer vs. Summer Clothes in Winter:

722
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,620
People are split exactly 50/50.

723
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,890
I see.

724
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,660
I think will be exactly 50/50.

725
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,430
Wearing normal winter things like a coat or a muffler even though it's summer.

726
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,600
That situation against

727
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,100
wearing a tank top or a cami in the winter.

728
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:22,010
I thought it'd be difficult to pick which one to be stuck with for life.

729
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,010
What's wrong all of a sudden?

730
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,210
Next, we have Ookubo's theory here.

731
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:32,780
Not being able to take your watch off for life
vs.
An agency will message you twice a day confirming your existence:

732
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,790
People are split exactly 50/50.

733
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,790
Eh, what's this?

734
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,290
What the heck?

735
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,420
These don't match at all.

736
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,430
Indeed, they don't really go together.

737
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:45,860
My thinking was that you normally take your watch off as soon as you get home.

738
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,470
And then you take your bra off.

739
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,470
Don't ask us.

740
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,600
So I thought, it'd be really annoying if you couldn't ever take it off.

741
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,770
Your watch until you die.

742
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,780
And something similarly troublesome would be

743
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,950
having to keep receiving these messages.

744
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,780
Which would be worse, a watch or a bra?

745
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,990
Your watch or bra?

746
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,990
Can't ever take off.

747
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,420
Which would be worse?

748
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,420
Ahhh.

749
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,220
That's a good one.

750
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,220
No, no...

751
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,530
That's a better question to answer.

752
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,530
You're like a big shot producer.

753
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,500
That's easier to grasp.

754
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:25,270
First, let's investigate what's more awkward to have in your pocket while being questioned by the police:

755
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:29,840
Bra vs. Revenge Notebook.
Is it a 50/50 split?

756
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,780
Which do you pick?

757
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,480
Going for the bra.

758
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,040
A bra, right?

759
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,380
The bra?

760
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,250
You both pick the bra?

761
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,380
It's the bra.

762
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,780
Actually, I've experienced this once.

763
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,780
Eh? With a bra?

764
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:42,250
My girlfriend comes over to play and sometimes she forgets things when she leaves.

765
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,450
That situation can happen.

766
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,220
And my friends will come over and

767
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,330
I'll be like "what to do?" and hide it in my pocket.

768
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,100
And occasionally when we go somewhere, it'll come out.

769
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,800
And I'm like "uhh..."

770
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,230
"Ah, this is awkward... what's this?"

771
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,700
Bra.

772
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,700
Bra.

773
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,700
Huh, is that so?

774
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,700
Bra.

775
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,240
When doing laundry, my sister's can get mixed in.

776
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,910
If you're talking about bras being in your pocket...

777
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,610
I was ordering a coffee and when I took my wallet out

778
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,420
a bra came out.

779
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,790
That is awkward.

780
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,890
That's horrible.

781
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,890
It was seriously the worst.

782
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,190
That would be.

783
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,090
With three people with three different experiences...

784
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:25,260
Girlfriend forgot

785
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:25,260
Mixed in laundry

786
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:25,260
Prank

787
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:25,260
...there are surprisingly people who've
experienced having a bra in their pocket.

788
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,260
So, it has happened.

789
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,930
Why'd you pick the revenge notebook, buddy?

790
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:32,670
I've carried a bra one time.

791
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,870
And it wasn't that awkward that time.

792
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,810
You've had a bra while being questioned by the police?

793
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:42,750
Sometimes, I'll be carrying the store's window display bra.

794
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,220
I'll have the bra in a bag.

795
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,720
Surprisingly, we've found someone who's actually been questioned by the police.

796
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,620
That's amazing. A perfect match.

797
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:55,360
I was able to somehow explain it that time...

798
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,800
...but I'd imagine a "revenge notebook" would be really awkward.

799
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,760
So picked the "revenge notebook".

800
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,070
Revenge notebook.

801
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,070
The revenge notebook, right?

802
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,340
That's surprising.

803
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,840
Do you actually have a revenge notebook?

804
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,900
I have one at home...

805
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:12,540
I have a "revenge notebook" or more like a "dark notebook".

806
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,270
He has one?

807
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,310
Oh, that's scary. What's in it?

808
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,750
So, what do you write in it?

809
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:19,250
Like, "how I'd want that person to disappear from society."

810
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,750
And so, the result of 100 people is?

811
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,220
That's scary.

812
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,550
Oh, it's full.

813
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,990
The bra with 75 people and the revenge notebook with 25 people.

814
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,830
This is like a batsu game.

815
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,400
The bra wins by a large margin.

816
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,830
So, it does.

817
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,900
Next up,

818
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,800
Let's investigate Ookubo's theory.
(Watch for life vs. Existence checking messages)

819
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,700
What is this, seriously?

820
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,570
Which do you pick?

821
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,700
It's hard to understand.

822
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,770
This.

823
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,970
It is a little confusing.

824
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,510
I don't have a boyfriend or anything, so I'd like someone to check that I'm still here.

825
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,510
Amazing, isn't it?

826
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,410
I'd rather not be able to take off my watch.

827
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,710
Around 1 month ago...

828
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:56,790
...my ex-boyfriend asked "where are you living now?" and "when are you free"?

829
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,890
It gave off existence-checking vibes.

830
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,330
It was annoying. I thought "Seriously?"

831
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,260
The existence confirmation.

832
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,930
I think the existence confirmation.

833
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,230
And so, the result of 100 people is?

834
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,230
Is it 50/50?

835
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,810
Oh, but...

836
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,640
The watch with 42 people and the existence confirmation with 58 people.

837
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,040
Well, it's pretty good.

838
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,640
It's not bad.

839
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,510
Next we have Nicole's theory.
(Winter Clothes in Summer vs. Summer Clothes in Winter)

840
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,780
Having to wear summer clothes in winter.

841
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,190
I sweat a lot.

842
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,120
There are people like that.

843
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,590
I also get heat rashes.

844
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,120
Right.

845
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:36,030
I think winter clothes in summer is better.

846
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,500
Winter clothes are cuter.

847
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,870
I'm president of the Don Quixote Lovers Club.

848
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,870
Ah, is that so?

849
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,500
I'll pick the first one.

850
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,470
Winter clothes in summer. I see.

851
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,540
He's definitely the only one in it.

852
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,470
And so, the votes continue to be fairly balanced.

853
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,270
That's surprising.

854
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,540
After hearing from 99 people,

855
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,610
This is?

856
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,750
it's amazingly 49 to 50.

857
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,750
The last one?

858
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:59,480
This last person may make it exactly 50/50.

859
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:59,480
One person. This is amazing.

860
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,550
How will it actually unfold?

861
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,520
Seriously? Please, please.

862
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,520
This is amazing.

863
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,060
Will the theory be confirmed?

864
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,060
Isn't this amazing?

865
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,060
It's amazing.

866
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,960
Which one?

867
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,560
Summer clothes in winter.

868
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:18,070
Unfortunately, while the theory wasn't confirmed...

869
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,070
So close.

870
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,070
Close, isn't it.

871
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,970
...it was basically confirmed.

872
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,670
Yay.

873
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,670
That's amazing.

874
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,510
Nicole was very close to getting it right.

875
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,510
Right?

876
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,510
I was really surprised.

877
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,920
Why do you sometimes insert suggestive people?

878
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,950
Stop it. Seriously.

879
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,480
Suggestive you say?

880
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,720
People that can only be called suggestive.

881
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,720
Is that so?

882
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,590
Well, we only heard from random people.

883
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,590
Are they really random?

884
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,190
Yes, they were actually random.

885
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:46,960
You were like "That guy! Let's go!".

886
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,960
No, no, no.

887
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,500
Wait a minute, we haven't seen mine.

888
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:54,340
How come you haven't shown mine?

889
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,340
I was thinking that.

890
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,910
They did it, didn't they?

891
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,910
Did they ask it?

892
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,140
Did they not use mine?

893
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,280
Well, about that.

894
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,980
Let's see Matsumoto's theory.

895
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,490
Let's see Matsumoto's theory. Here it is.

896
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:13,420
TBS vs. TV Tokyo:
which would be more annoying if it disappeared: exactly 50/50 split.

897
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,060
This is good, isn't it?

898
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,130
We can't say anything actually.

899
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,130
This is good, isn't it?

900
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,960
Don't say "Good, isn't it?". You can just say "Uh huh".

901
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,230
We can't say anything, but...

902
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,840
Why can't you say anything?

903
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,970
Because we don't influence like you do!

904
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,240
It's not about having influence.

905
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,780
I think for ordinary people, particularly young people,

906
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,980
I thought this was perfect.

907
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,550
I see. That's what you mean.

908
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:42,250
But I think it'd be fine if TV Tokyo went away.

909
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,890
I've never appeared on there.

910
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,090
Ah, you've never been a regular there...

911
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,860
Hamada, you been looking during this?

912
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,430
You can't look at that right now.

913
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:55,830
Because it's TBS. If it was Fuji TV, it would have lost completely.

914
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,530
That's true.

915
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,530
"That's true"...

916
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,700
Can you say "yeah" to that?

917
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:07,840
Let's investigate: TBS vs. TV Tokyo:
which would be more annoying if it disappeared: exactly 50/50 split.

918
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,520
Which would be annoying if it disappeared, TBS or TV Tokyo?

919
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,680
Ah!

920
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,050
I watch a lot of anime...

921
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,390
Ah, see. There's anime.

922
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,460
It'd be annoying if TV Tokyo went away.

923
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,090
TV Tokyo for me.

924
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,030
"Pokémon" is on there.

925
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,660
That guy watches Pokémon?

926
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,370
And so, quite a few anime votes go for TV Tokyo.

927
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,370
I see. So, it's about anime.

928
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,000
TBS I think.

929
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,000
TBS.

930
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,000
It'd be annoying to lose.

931
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,740
They're cute.

932
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,740
I like their dramas.

933
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,810
Many people like dramas.

934
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,810
TBS.

935
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,810
That's right.

936
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:41,040
I like dramas like "HanaHare".

937
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,640
TBS has more dramas.

938
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,640
It does have a lot.

939
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:47,220
But from women, TBS earns the drama votes.

940
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,980
That's right. Dramas.

941
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,790
Initially, it's a close match.

942
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,820
Oh, that's amazing.

943
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,690
However,

944
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,660
However?

945
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,760
It has shows like "Can I Follow You Home?".

946
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,690
Ah, that's a good one.

947
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,060
They have lots of variety shows with funny premises.

948
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,060
Makes sense.

949
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,830
I really like "Goddotan".

950
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,830
Variety shows are expected.

951
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:03,630
The show where they drain ponds is amazing, isn't it?

952
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:08,870
Due to the popularity of variety shows, a lead starts to form.

953
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,670
Huh, this is bad.

954
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,140
TBS is channel 4?

955
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,080
That's Nippon TV.

956
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,050
8?

957
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,210
8 is Fuji TV.

958
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,680
10.

959
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,780
It's not 10 at the moment.

960
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,820
There are people like this?

961
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:26,320
Sadly, there are people who don't even know what channel TBS is on.

962
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,390
These young girls...

963
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,790
However, amongst them all.

964
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:33,960
Basically, the only TV channel I turn on is TBS.

965
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,960
Oh, is that right?

966
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,430
I feel like that's what I naturally put on.

967
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,430
What is this?

968
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,000
So, if it disappeared...

969
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,040
...if TBS disappeared, I don't think I would watch anymore TV.

970
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,040
You liar!

971
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,040
Really?

972
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,610
Amazingly, we've discovered a die-hard TBS fan.

973
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,810
A proper salary man.

974
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:50,380
If I turn the tv on, it's always TBS.

975
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,280
He's definitely lying.

976
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,280
It's not the case, right?

977
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,380
What shows do you like?

978
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,380
Let's see.

979
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,850
"The Monday Late Show".

980
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,490
Wrong channel.

981
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,690
And so, the result is:

982
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,920
Oh, that's scary.

983
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,920
It's scary.

984
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:02,790
TBS with 45 people and TV Tokyo with 55 people.

985
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,760
How real.

986
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,800
There were some lively characters, right?

987
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,130
They were wonderfully lively.

988
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,130
Liveliness...

989
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,170
I don't know! I've only just heard all this.

990
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,140
No, no. Not really.

991
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,940
It's the same as before with the bra and the watch.

992
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:21,950
The staff are like "He's going to say something edgy, right?"

993
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,050
No, you've got a paranoia problem.

994
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:28,550
Earlier in here, you were like "croissant or red bean paste bread?"

995
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,950
What's funny about that?!

996
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,990
Because I didn't say that.

997
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,920
Stop itttt.

998
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,320
What's that?

999
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,830
What? Are we going to show this?

1000
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,760
Stop itttt.

1001
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,760
What are you doing?

1002
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,730
Are you lost for words?

1003
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:46,200
Please welcome our next presenter. Come on out!

1004
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,840
It's Tamura Kenji!

1005
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,950
Thanks for having me on, everyone.

1006
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,350
I'm here and that can only mean one thing, folks.

1007
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,750
The legendary segment.

1008
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,950
And here it is!

1009
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,160
Are you guys seriously happy about this?

1010
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,160
Super popular.

1011
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:15,470
Is this what you guys are really into?

1012
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,470
Hamada-san...

1013
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,600
What do you care what kids are into these days?

1014
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,600
No, but the girls...

1015
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,440
I would think the female audience members would hate it.

1016
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,440
You'd think they would!

1017
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,210
Everyone cheered!

1018
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:27,540
In this segment, six young men and women live together
and romance and drama ensue.

1019
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,280
So, uh... how's that?

1020
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,650
This is getting crazy buzz on Twitter. I was shocked.

1021
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,390
Everyone's talking about it.

1022
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:41,790
Because it's been a while, let's do a quick recap.

1023
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:46,500
Kuro-chan and Rion went on a date in Odaiba.

1024
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,500
Jumping right in!

1025
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,870
During the date, Kuro-chan tried to kiss Rion.

1026
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:55,410
Of course, the attempt wasn't successful. Meanwhile,

1027
00:34:55,410 --> 00:35:01,850
Taiga and Ran were also on a date, and on the way back, she planted one on him.

1028
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,810
As for Taiga, you're all familiar.

1029
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,850
That was Taiga's first kiss.

1030
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,590
Out of the blue, he has his first kiss.

1031
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,590
You never know when it'll happen.

1032
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:16,960
What stories shall unfold this time? Let's find out!

1033
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,600
The Monster is running wild.

1034
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,770
I have no idea what'll happen next.

1035
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,170
Could you go inside Monster House?

1036
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,500
Absolutely not!

1037
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,940
I wouldn't be able to handle Kuro-chan.

1038
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,940
He's too much.

1039
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,340
So chic.

1040
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,910
Morning!

1041
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,720
I slept great.

1042
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,380
Hm? You slept well?

1043
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,520
You were like, "I slept great~!"

1044
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,260
You came back pretty late last night.

1045
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,390
God, why is he always like that?

1046
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,390
Too early for this.

1047
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,290
Yeah, might have been late.

1048
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,790
"Might have been late"? You mean you couldn't tell?

1049
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,460
Before I realized, it had already gotten late.

1050
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,730
What were you up to?

1051
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:02,610
There's this app, and me and someone I met on there, well...

1052
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,140
Hold on a sec!

1053
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,140
What do you mean?

1054
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,380
I've never heard of meeting someone on an app.

1055
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,710
Ah, it's for hookups.

1056
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,250
Hookups??

1057
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,150
For real?

1058
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,050
Did any sparks fly?

1059
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,150
Nah, not really.

1060
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,150
No, huh?

1061
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,650
He was super pushy.

1062
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,790
Yeah, because it's a hookup app. Scary scary scary...

1063
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,790
An app?

1064
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,790
He's definitely used one.

1065
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,190
Meeting up with someone from an app is scary.

1066
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,460
Ever meet up with anyone creepy?

1067
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,460
Once or twice, I guess.

1068
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:29,530
I guess Ayumi
uses dating apps.

1069
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:32,500
Of course you'll meet creeps. Actually, a while back...

1070
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,740
She's so casual,
it's awesome.

1071
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,840
I was supposed to meet up with this girl, but a guy showed up instead.

1072
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,240
What? You've met up with someone?

1073
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,940
Not me, no, but there used to be this thing called Star Beach...

1074
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,850
...and uh... what Star Beach was...

1075
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:47,050
It was basically a place to exchange info and make plans to meet up. But that freaked me out.

1076
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:51,890
There was a friend I had on there who really wanted to meet up with this girl.

1077
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,890
They made plans to meet up, and as he's waiting he goes outside for a smoke...

1078
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,590
And what he didn't know at the time was that a dude was watching him from a building.

1079
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,230
Freaky!

1080
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,230
A guy was?

1081
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:05,500
So he's waiting, and he's waiting, and the phone's not ringing so he waits a bit more...

1082
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,200
And from above I hear someone yell "DUMBASS"!

1083
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,170
Scary! Did you go home?

1084
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,810
It annoyed me, but I was more baffled than anything. Then I went home.

1085
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,610
So... it's your story after all.

1086
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,250
She realized.

1087
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:21,020
No. Nope. This happened to my friend.

1088
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,090
You're talking
about yourself.

1089
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,250
It was definitely you.

1090
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,250
It was totally Kuro-chan!

1091
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,360
No way! That kind of stuff never happens to me.

1092
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,490
What a liar.

1093
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,290
What an ominous opening...

1094
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,790
At least deny it faster.

1095
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,100
Right away, yeah?

1096
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,270
Sure looks fun.

1097
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,270
I'm a bit worried for Ayumi...

1098
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,850
Don't watch the pachinko balls fall.

1099
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,450
How many times are
they gonna show that?

1100
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,450
What a great parody.

1101
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,390
I wanna watch, but I'm scared.

1102
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,260
How's it going lately?

1103
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,760
I'm got some new roommates.

1104
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,260
Oh yeah, that's right.

1105
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,260
We're sharing a house.

1106
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,970
It's your first time with roommates, what're they like?

1107
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,000
Well since it hasn't aired yet, I can't really get into details, but...

1108
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,970
...there's one boy who's a bit younger than me... and one a bit older...

1109
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,810
...and a famous person.

1110
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,810
Do I know them?

1111
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:25,050
Oh yeah, you two would most definitely know him, he's well-known.

1112
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,050
Wow! I wonder who.

1113
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,050
Famous in a different
way, though.

1114
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,720
Is he hot?

1115
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,160
He's one of those looks-personality gap types. He's very sweet.

1116
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,560
He's a [comedian], so that's...

1117
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,560
That's misleading.

1118
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,700
You know...

1119
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:48,710
Chore Board

1120
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:48,710
Living Room: Kuro-chan & Rion

1121
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,910
Doesn't that mean Rion's with him?

1122
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:57,050
Kuro-chan, do it properly.

1123
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,050
I am!

1124
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,350
Looks like fun.

1125
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,420
Rion, do you cook at all?

1126
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,520
I was really into it once, I can make a bunch of stuff.

1127
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,650
What can you make?

1128
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,060
Nothing special... like hamburgers.

1129
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,630
What else... oh, I can make cabbage rolls.

1130
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,630
Wow, that's impressive.

1131
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,960
If I liked it, I'd make it.

1132
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,370
So hey...

1133
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,570
What the hell is that t-shirt?

1134
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,640
I'd love to eat your cooking sometime.

1135
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,940
Seriously?

1136
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,510
Yeah, seriously! For real.

1137
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,510
I'd love to give it a taste.

1138
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,510
Disgusting.

1139
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,880
Then next time, ok?

1140
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,180
You will?

1141
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,950
It's a date. Make a bento, will ya?

1142
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,850
It might not be that good!

1143
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,850
Nah, it'll be tasty for sure.

1144
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:43,190
It'll be fun. Show me a fun time, ok?

1145
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,330
What kind of "fun time"?

1146
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,300
Rion-chan sure
is a nice girl.

1147
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,810
She's making it?

1148
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:02,950
She's making it as promised.

1149
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,980
It's hot...

1150
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,530
Morning.

1151
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,400
Nope! You can't come in the kitchen.

1152
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,400
Eh, what?

1153
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,300
I'm making lunch. Ah! Don't don't don't dont!

1154
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,770
Back hair, back hair!

1155
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,770
Uwah, nasty!

1156
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,300
Ooh, show me...

1157
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:26,570
It's poking out of his tank top...

1158
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,440
You'll just have to look forward to it.

1159
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,440
Look forward to it? Gotcha, I gotcha.

1160
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,740
You look so cute. Can I really not look?

1161
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,680
Good morning!

1162
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
Ugh, what the hell.

1163
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,210
It's gonna be fun, isn't it~? Let's look forward to it.

1164
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,680
Yeah, I'm excited.

1165
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,720
You know, I don't really have much experience making bentos...

1166
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:43,720
He's pretending to take selfies!!

1167
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,720
He's filming her!

1168
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,920
He's not taking selfies?

1169
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,960
This is my first time really making one.

1170
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,960
Really?

1171
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,090
But his face, look...

1172
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,090
He's taking pictures of her!!

1173
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,790
He took a picture!!

1174
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,790
What the hell is this technique?

1175
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,530
He... he didn't take a single selfie!

1176
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,530
This guy is out of control.

1177
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,730
That's sneaking photos.

1178
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,800
Wait, he took another one!

1179
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,540
When she turned around!

1180
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,640
Scary face, scary face.

1181
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,640
Oh, my!

1182
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,410
Nice out, isn't it?

1183
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,110
Isn't it?

1184
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,140
Oh man oh man oh man.

1185
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:10,510
It's a bit warm out too.

1186
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,510
You're right.

1187
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,520
OH OW OW OW OW OW

1188
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,520
Ahh!

1189
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,220
You're all dirty! Are you ok?

1190
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,920
I flew, I flew!

1191
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,260
You sure did!

1192
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,660
First hit, third hit.

1193
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,430
Go for it! Go!

1194
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,800
Oh, wow! Wow wow wow!

1195
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:26,800
Oh jeez oh jeez.

1196
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,330
He's looking, he's looking!

1197
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
A--Ahh!

1198
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,970
He looked! He looked!

1199
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,700
He REALLY looked!

1200
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,970
That was awesome! You went so far.

1201
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,870
This guy saw her underwear!

1202
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,840
That was seriously great.

1203
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,440
This jerk...

1204
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,040
Wonder if we'll find anything...

1205
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,480
- Anything specific?
I won't know until I see it.

1206
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,350
It'd be nice to take some pictures.

1207
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:47,350
Yeah, some photos with everyone.

1208
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,190
Isn't that one too big?

1209
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,950
Good vibes.

1210
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:51,190
No good? But this way you'd be able to see more.

1211
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,820
What do you think?

1212
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,820
This works.

1213
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,160
Right? White or blue, which is better?

1214
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,490
Blue... actually, the white one.

1215
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:58,430
Looking good over here!

1216
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,660
So two white and one blue. Yeah?

1217
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,660
Let's do it.

1218
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,530
Here I go... Rion's homemade bento, open sesame!

1219
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,400
Go ahead!

1220
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,870
Your face right now...!

1221
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,870
Oh my god, is this supposed to be me?

1222
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,440
That's your mustache, and those are your eyes...

1223
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,140
It's adorable!

1224
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,840
It's making a scary face.

1225
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,710
Really, and I mean really, this makes me so happy!

1226
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:20,280
I'm glad.

1227
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,280
Awesome! I'm so happy right now, seriously!

1228
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,050
Eat it, eat it.

1229
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,050
It's ok to dig in?

1230
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,850
Rub a dub dub
- Thanks for the grub.

1231
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:27,520
Cheers~!

1232
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,400
Hamada-san, please
watch carefully.

1233
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,400
You bet I am.

1234
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,430
Delicious!

1235
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,230
You mean it?

1236
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,800
What a relief! I didn't know if you'd like it.

1237
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,310
It's very, very good! Oh man, this is so awesome!!

1238
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,740
Ahh, thank goodness.

1239
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,910
Just eating food you'd made would make me happy.

1240
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,650
That makes me happy to know...

1241
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,820
She's the gullible type.

1242
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,090
That this day would finally come...

1243
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,920
She can't say no.

1244
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,160
For sure.

1245
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,360
Could... I go "ahh"?

1246
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,230
This is the stuff that
inspires envy.

1247
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:10,230
In a lot of ways he's
really incredible.

1248
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,530
Eh? This might be difficult.

1249
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,230
Ah.

1250
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,200
I wonder if I'm gonna be good at it.

1251
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,690
Not quite honest... yet
very forthcoming.

1252
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,270
In such a natural way, too.

1253
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,080
I'm all embarrassed!

1254
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:24,080
Yummy! Out of this world yummy.

1255
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,480
He's staring.

1256
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,620
You seemed kinda bashful as well.

1257
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:26,620
Did I?

1258
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:33,660
Ahh, really, real-- wow! Oh man, oh JEEZ this is just so much fun and I'm just WOW thank you!

1259
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,060
He's being sincere.

1260
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,730
Not even kidding.

1261
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,330
He won't stop talking.

1262
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:39,200
I wish I could have this kind of fun forever, ya know?

1263
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,760
His true self!

1264
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,400
This guy...

1265
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,000
This is gonna be awkward.

1266
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,100
Yummy.

1267
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,740
It's sweet!

1268
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,850
So, the other day when we got dinner...

1269
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:59,680
On the way back, uh...

1270
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,390
About the kiss, like, what was that about?

1271
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,910
He's weirded out.

1272
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,910
Taiga's adorable!

1273
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,380
Because I'm into you.

1274
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:09,830
That's why.

1275
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,950
Is that so?

1276
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,490
That's the wrong approach.

1277
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,490
yeah

1278
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,230
...did you not like it?

1279
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,230
No.

1280
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,100
I didn't hate it or anything like that...

1281
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:20,160
This is stressful.

1282
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:22,440
More like I'm just confused.

1283
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,480
Well I mean, I thought it would be fine.

1284
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,840
To kiss you and stuff...

1285
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,510
So I guess I'm wondering how you feel, Taiga...

1286
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,620
How I feel?

1287
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,220
Like, what are you thinking, and stuff?

1288
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,380
Me, personally...

1289
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,250
...a relationship...

1290
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,140
is something that builds over time...

1291
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,860
...and I can't suddenly go putting labels on things.

1292
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,100
That's right.

1293
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,380
So I guess what I'm trying to say is right now...

1294
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,420
...I'm not really thinking.

1295
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,290
It was his first kiss after all.

1296
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,710
I'm not really thinking we can go out.

1297
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,540
I see.

1298
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,340
Glad we talked.

1299
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,360
I'm really sorry.

1300
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,510
Seems she got rejected.

1301
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,130
Oh god, what the hell.

1302
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,880
Wow! This is great.

1303
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,390
He's got his head on her lap...

1304
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,590
Feels good when you move around a bit.

1305
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,290
You good?

1306
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:14,810
It's embarrassing with people around...

1307
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:13,640
You good?

1308
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,810
Is she ok?

1309
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,430
Yeah...

1310
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,870
Oh, wow...

1311
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,960
My head fits here perfectly.

1312
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:25,810
For real.

1313
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:30,310
Sure is fun to be a guy on a date...

1314
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,940
What's she feeling right now?

1315
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,840
Uuhn~

1316
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,600
What even is this?

1317
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,130
Rion, you might not remember but...

1318
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:39,220
...and I said this back in Odaiba too...

1319
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,570
...I'll protect you no matter what.

1320
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,960
This. This line.

1321
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:47,620
Thank you.

1322
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,500
That's awfully reassuring.

1323
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,460
That's his signature phrase.

1324
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,960
Ugh, this is exhausting.

1325
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,360
Cheers!

1326
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,360
Nice work today, everyone.

1327
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,740
Alcohol's in the mix now.

1328
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,470
Yummy!

1329
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,830
Standing and drinking just isn't my style.

1330
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,000
Right?

1331
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,910
I could fall asleep like this!

1332
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:09,320
Nah, that'd be weird.

1333
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:11,500
If this suddenly became a Sleeping Beauty situation...

1334
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,920
I could, though.

1335
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:13,490
Sleeping Beauty...?

1336
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,620
Hey, so I've been wondering...

1337
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:19,190
...how's it going so far? Your love life.

1338
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:21,820
Well, I've got stuff going on...

1339
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:25,010
With Ayumi-chan, right?

1340
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,160
He went and said it!

1341
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,160
So?

1342
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,120
Well...

1343
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,960
We're getting to know each other.

1344
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,670
Me and Ayumi.

1345
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,070
Say, Ran-chan, what's your type?

1346
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:38,820
It's probably...

1347
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:41,560
Gotta have things in common with the guy...

1348
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,600
...or else I won't be like "Oh! I like this dude."

1349
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,920
It doesn't matter if he's handsome or not.

1350
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:48,330
You go by feeling?

1351
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:49,610
Yeah, that's what I think.

1352
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,360
What's with that face?

1353
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,740
I drank quite a bit.

1354
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,740
Gonna hit the sack soon.

1355
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,360
Sleepy?

1356
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:00,300
Good night!

1357
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:01,310
Not good not good.

1358
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,310
Night!

1359
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,990
His face was super red.

1360
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,840
He was caught so off guard, hilarious.

1361
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,680
Think he snores?

1362
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:09,680
Yeah, he's probably super loud.

1363
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,840
So, uh...

1364
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:16,730
It seems you've got a good vibe going with Rion.

1365
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:18,110
Nah, nah.

1366
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,450
Not like I have with you, Ran-chan.

1367
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:24,270
What a scary guy.

1368
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:26,940
He knows just what to say.

1369
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:27,260
You say that, but you went on a date with her.

1370
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:27,970
He's just feeding her lines!

1371
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,970
Yup.

1372
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,770
It might be too late to say this...

1373
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:32,620
...and you're right, we did go on that date...

1374
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,800
...we went on a date but...

1375
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,630
...but the truth is that, when we moved in...

1376
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:40,400
...the person I liked the most was you, Ran-chan.

1377
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,400
Really??

1378
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,570
Yeah.

1379
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,610
Aaand that's a lie.
He's lying.

1380
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:47,470
I know you don't feel the same way, you said so yourself.

1381
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:50,380
So even though I was thinking "ah, she's cute".

1382
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:50,180
She thought he was gross.

1383
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,250
That's right.

1384
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,250
Yup.

1385
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,680
"Maybe it's better if I don't get too close."

1386
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,120
You said I was gross, after all.

1387
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,920
Ah, I-- I did say that, but, you know...

1388
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,760
When it's like this...

1389
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,420
...it's actually kinda nice.

1390
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,960
After I turned you down...

1391
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,590
...I was really a wreck.

1392
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,100
I was scared you'd get mad, and I didn't wanna cry in front of you...

1393
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:15,370
Nah, that's just the way it is. Women aren't into me.

1394
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,640
I don't think that's true at all.

1395
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:24,380
No no no don't
say stuff like that.

1396
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:24,380
Hell of a statement...

1397
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:26,080
N-- No, that can't be right.

1398
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,520
Even the monster
is taken aback!

1399
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:27,520
Right?

1400
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,390
Not good, not good.

1401
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,390
Can't it be?

1402
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:30,220
For real, not good.

1403
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,390
You mean it?

1404
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,390
Yeah.

1405
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:33,090
Ok, well how's this:

1406
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,730
Hold on, what's he doing?

1407
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,730
Here.

1408
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:36,190
Wanna hold hands?

1409
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:37,060
I guess it's possible?

1410
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,090
Here ya go.

1411
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,690
RAN-CHAN

1412
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,310
Whyyyy?

1413
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,310
RAN-CHAN

1414
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,410
Wha?

1415
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,140
So hey. It's not like I, you know...

1416
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,170
I don't wanna come right out and say it but...

1417
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,910
I really do like you.

1418
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,660
Eh? What?

1419
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,170
I really do.

1420
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,090
He said it so fast.

1421
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,090
Not a fan of this distance.

1422
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:58,360
I'll protect you. I mean it.

1423
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:59,540
What the hell!

1424
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,540
He said it again!!

1425
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,650
"I'll protect you" again!

1426
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,650
He says it immediately.

1427
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,340
What does he mean
by "protect"?

1428
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,950
Yeah, what's "protect"?

1429
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,820
And I know it's a long shot, but...

1430
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,720
This distance is bad news...

1431
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,780
All this time, I've been holding back my feelings but...
I like you the most. You're my type.

1432
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:11,780
Ahh scary scary scary!

1433
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,270
She's drinking too much.

1434
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,270
No, no, no, no, no.

1435
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,840
I'm not just saying that either, I'm super into you.

1436
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:16,170
Bad, this is bad.

1437
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:18,180
Even the way we're holding hands.

1438
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:24,770
...or if we kissed. We don't have to go out but...

1439
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:24,770
I can kiss you.

1440
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,400
She can...?

1441
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,310
Really? You'd kiss me?

1442
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,340
That's bad! If they kiss...

1443
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,010
I can.

1444
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,980
STOP STOP

1445
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,420
STOP THIS RIGHT NOW

1446
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,950
Don't do it!

1447
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,950
Look! Look at him!

1448
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:35,950
RAN-CHAN!!

1449
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:43,230
I really do like you.

1450
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,560
DISGUSTING!

1451
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,830
AAAAH!

1452
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:47,950
That's why I said stop!

1453
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:49,280
Please god, STOP!

1454
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:49,690
No, I can't!

1455
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:49,280
Really, now?

1456
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,100
I said STOP!

1457
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,080
His face!

1458
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:50,100
I can't watch!

1459
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,970
This is really...

1460
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,960
Let go, hands off the girl.

1461
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:57,280
Now...

1462
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,000
Just-- OH HIS THUMB!! GROSS!

1463
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:02,660
I just really like you...

1464
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,480
SHUT IT DOWN!

1465
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:05,480
AhhhhhHHHAHHA!

1466
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:06,010
Done. I'm done.

1467
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,290
What are we gonna do...

1468
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,550
Everyone's screaming.

1469
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:08,770
Nope nope nope nope nope.

1470
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,920
NO, NOPE!

1471
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:09,920
No way...

1472
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,330
This intimacy is NO GOOD.

1473
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:12,220
Yeah.

1474
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:13,620
He's SNUGGLING.

1475
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,620
No no no no...

1476
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,770
For real...

1477
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,210
What are you doing?

1478
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:19,630
For real, you really get me. You really get me.

1479
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,350
Enough. Enough of this.

1480
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,630
Go back to your room.

1481
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:20,570
Your room, go back to your room!

1482
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:22,300
Go to bed. Go to bed.

1483
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:22,300
It's not too late!

1484
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,290
I like you so much.

1485
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,600
Someone come in, please.

1486
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,600
They're gonna do it again.

1487
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,720
This is so bad.

1488
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,720
Army, someone call the army.

1489
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:30,650
SECOND TIME!!!!

1490
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:31,800
HE DID IT AGAIN!!!

1491
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,190
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

1492
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,680
NO NO NO, NO!

1493
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,000
Aw, jeez...

1494
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,030
Jeez...

1495
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:39,010
This is no good for me.

1496
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,220
I seriously like you.

1497
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,520
Not good.

1498
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:39,520
BADBADBADBADBAD

1499
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:39,860
BAD!

1500
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,120
It's bad, it's really really bad.

1501
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,120
RAN-CHAN

1502
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,400
What are they DOING?!

1503
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,400
You're drunk, Kuro-chan.

1504
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:48,640
I'm not drunk.

1505
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,260
Yeah, you're drunk.

1506
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,570
Am not~

1507
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:52,570
You so are!

1508
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:55,300
Maybe... but I'll remember this.

1509
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:58,080
Raaa~n...

1510
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,080
I'm drunk, too.

1511
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,420
Tomorrow I might not remember this.

1512
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,590
It's no good if you don't remember!

1513
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,400
Guess I've gotta kiss you again.

1514
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,400
Yeah, guess you do.

1515
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,640
Don't forget, ok?

1516
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,150
This is screwed up.

1517
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,510
Enough already!

1518
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,350
Seriously! Enough of this!

1519
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,130
It's getting late.

1520
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:16,040
That's enough.

1521
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,040
Hot, it's hot.

1522
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:16,460
I've gotta get up early tomorrow.

1523
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,050
It's hot in here.

1524
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,290
What is this?

1525
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,290
Enough, enough.

1526
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,880
Don't forget, ok?

1527
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,880
I won't.

1528
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:21,890
Go back.
Go back to your room.

1529
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,890
Go back!

1530
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,510
Because I won't forget either.

1531
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:23,950
I'm sorry if I do.

1532
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,840
Go back!

1533
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,840
Your room,
go back to your room!

1534
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:26,160
No~pe. If you forget I'll have to kiss you again.

1535
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,970
I'm sweating so much.

1536
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:28,180
What's with the sweating?

1537
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,850
I wonder...

1538
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,850
This unpleasant sweat.

1539
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,350
Good night.

1540
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,350
Good night.

1541
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:31,450
Thank god.

1542
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:32,800
Go, leave.

1543
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,800
No more, no more.

1544
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:34,600
Good night Ra~n!

1545
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,630
Night!

1546
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,840
This guy, seriously.

1547
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,300
Scary scary scary.

1548
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,620
Uwah that's where she was sitting!

1549
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:52,340
Her seat! That's her seat!

1550
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,340
He's smelling it.

1551
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,890
He's smelling it...

1552
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:55,490
...where she was sitting.

1553
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,230
Not good! This guy smells seats.

1554
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:59,580
Shut up!

1555
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,160
Is he thinking about
going for the cup?

1556
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:13,210
From where
she was drinking?

1557
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,210
No way!

1558
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:16,110
I told you!

1559
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,450
He's turning it!

1560
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,800
I knew he would do that!

1561
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,020
This guy, I knew he'd do it!

1562
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:25,020
He's a maniac!

1563
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,740
Smelling...

1564
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,740
He's doing it all.

1565
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,360
From top to bottom.

1566
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,830
He's got all his bases covered.

1567
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,830
Uwah, the smelling!

1568
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,520
He's gonna do it all.

1569
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,530
Smelling-- is he done?

1570
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,840
What a conundrum!

1571
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,160
He must be so happy.

1572
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,530
Super psyched.

1573
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,440
I sure like her.

1574
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,960
Don't forget...

1575
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,440
Don't forget, me!

1576
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,500
Don't forget!

1577
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,150
I kissed her...

1578
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,330
Don't forget!

1579
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,170
No, hold it, hold it.

1580
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:09,950
He did it all.

1581
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:14,400
Wild.

1582
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:15,870
Ran...! Ran!

1583
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,210
He inhaled so hard
he choked.

1584
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:22,970
He's wheezing!

1585
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:24,380
What is going on?

1586
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,390
That's enough, ah!

1587
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:27,930
He poured it in Ran's glass.

1588
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:29,890
He must be on cloud nine.

1589
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:31,080
He already did this!

1590
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:31,750
He's turning it around.

1591
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,840
Wouldn't it be mostly his?

1592
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,510
It's YOUR damn spit.

1593
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,510
It's yours.

1594
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,960
You've gone around once already.

1595
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,320
He's laughing again.

1596
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,460
What is WITH this guy?

1597
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,220
What a long scene.

1598
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,100
Must be nice, Kuro-chan.

1599
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,170
What am I gonna do?

1600
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,090
The journey of love.

1601
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,250
Exhausting!

1602
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,260
Thank god it's over.

1603
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,820
I'm exhausted, oh man.

1604
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,820
Same here.

1605
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,720
No, this is-- this is, uh... what exactly are you showing us?

1606
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,620
For some reason I'm drenched in sweat.

1607
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:07,950
What is this?

1608
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,800
Same, I've got the weird sweats too.

1609
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,490
It's like it suddenly got hotter in here.

1610
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:15,020
But that's not for no reason, you know?

1611
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,520
Definitely.

1612
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,220
Totally.

1613
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:21,440
Anything can happen when young single people are living together.

1614
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,610
Ahh, about Taiga-kun right?

1615
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,610
Yes.

1616
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,170
Taiga seems to have turned down Ran-chan.

1617
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,170
That's right.

1618
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:25,980
That was a bit... you know?

1619
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:25,980
You'd get jealous.

1620
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,640
That's true. What's your take, Okubo-san?

1621
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:34,170
Girls get jealous, and she'd definitely want to get to him before Rion.

1622
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,520
But all of a sudden, the Monster Magic got a hold of her...

1623
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,500
The booze, yeah?

1624
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,520
And she was drinking.

1625
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,630
He has that certain something.

1626
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:45,230
If he were a good-looking guy, I think he'd be even more popular with girls.

1627
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,530
I see.

1628
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,810
His persuasive energy with women is crazy.

1629
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:49,800
'cuz he's persistent.

1630
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:49,800
I see, I see.

1631
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:49,800
You've got a point.

1632
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,230
To be able to look into someones eyes and say that...

1633
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,520
"I'll protect you."

1634
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,740
I'll protect you...

1635
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,510
...protect? What am I being protected from? What does that mean?

1636
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,410
What does that mean??

1637
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,530
In fact, he's the number one threat out there.

1638
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:08,420
Next week! Cigarettes in a Minor's Bag!

1639
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,730
How will these comedians handle it?

1640
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:12,290
Oh, wow! These are awesome.

1641
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:13,540
And!

1642
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,760

1643
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,690
Can you change clothes before the first floor?

1644
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:20,730
Also:

1645
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,440
The show airs today.

1646
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,440
Can't wait!

1647
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,430
Monster House, episode four:

1648
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,490

00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:27,820
The worst...

1650
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,070
No, no, you've got it all wrong!
