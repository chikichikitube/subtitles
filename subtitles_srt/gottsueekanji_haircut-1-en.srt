00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,560
Aahh!!

3
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,370
You look tired, huh?

4
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,780
Isn't that so, Matsumoto?

5
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,110
I guess so

6
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,690
It's 'cause my job sort of became my hobby

7
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,860
Isn't that good?

8
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,860
So, what are we doing?

9
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,910
Let's see...

10
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,710
Just make the tip of my hair even

11
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,220
Just the tip? Alright, got it

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,470
The tip...

13
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,500
Is this gonna be ok?
- It's fine

14
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,570
Matsumoto

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:58,870
I'm done

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,920
Already?
- Yes

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,220
How much is it?

18
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,700
(38 dollars)

19
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,700
4300 yen
- Alright

20
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,450
But...
- It's ok, keep the change

21
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,350
Are you sure?!

22
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,260
Yes, 'cause it felt refreshing

23
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,630
Wait, Matsumoto

24
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,330
This...

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,040
Packing tape, a freebie

26
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,640
Why packing tape?

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,800
Well...
- It's strange

28
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,430
I'm sure there will be
a time when you'll need it

29
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,670
Oh yeah?
- Yes

30
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,670
That's bad!
- Oh, don't worry!

31
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,850
See you

32
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,260
Thanks for coming!
