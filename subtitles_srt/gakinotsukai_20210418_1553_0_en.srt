1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,690
The man incredibly gifted by god

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,060
Reiwa's most remarkable genius

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,330
He's back after 4 years!

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,320
The music producer Tsukitei Hosei

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,230
The 7th time to make an impact on the music industry!!

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,780
You're saying this yourself?

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,770
Thank you very much

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,680
Your voice sound hoarse, huh?   -He lost his voice

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,840
It surely is hoarse

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,540
I was very surprised too

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,080
The members have recorded the music already

12
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,900
I lost my voice after singing

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,900
Yeah, you completely lost your voice

14
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,870
But we've been doing this for so many times

15
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,020
And yet, the music companies never contacted us, not even once!

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,650
This is absolutely unbelievable

17
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,690
We're under the condition of corona now, so...

18
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,820
It's so complicated to say "condition of corona"

19
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,940
But I did say it clearly, right?

20
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,760
We are in a tough situation now, so I hope to make waves and cheer people up

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,930
We actually talked about this during the meeting

22
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,400
"It has been a while, shall we do this again?"

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,980
And this dude replied with two "Yes(es)"

24
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,630
He can't wait to do it

25
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,710
I was like "are you serious?"

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,670
This is the 7th time now

27
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,090
Hosei will create 3 songs with all his might

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,520
But before that...

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,010
Let's watch the songs produced up till now together

30
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,000
No thanks   -Please don't say "no thanks"

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,550
Super no thanks

32
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,570
No one was interested, so what's the point of watching it again?

33
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,680
No, no, these are truly masterpieces

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,250
And among all of the songs that I've produced

35
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,670
This one is my favorite

36
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,680
Hosei produce! The fascinating masterpieces

37
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,190
I remember
this one

38
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,430
Endo loves
this one

39
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,880
I won't say
I love this one

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,020
But I do
remember this

41
00:01:51,660 --> 00:02:01,030
Ah, Yamasaki-san, the starry sky that we looked upon

42
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,360
I remember
this scene

43
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,040
What the heck
is that face?

44
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:11,550
It's staying in my mind as if it just happened yesterday

45
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,680
His face is
pissing me off

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,720
-He's into it
-He really is

47
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:20,420
Ah, Matsumoto-san, the promise that we made that day

48
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:29,720
I've enshrined it in the drawer of my heart, because it's so precious

49
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,780
Good facial
expression,
Matsumoto-san!

50
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,250
I didn't know
what face to
make here

51
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,570
We can't reach it with our hands

52
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,390
The shining stars high in the sky

53
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,290
I just have
to say this

54
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,840
You're just
copying SMAP!

55
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,180
So please embrace us forever and a day

56
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,240
Completely
copying

57
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,500
No way,
that's not true

58
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,660
As we are weaker than you thought

59
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,300
This is
my original

60
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:58,260
So please embrace us forever and a day

61
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,480
Look at this,
I was so embarrassed

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,980
No, I like Hamada's voice,
it's deep and tender

63
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:07,510
As we can easily fall into despair

64
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,340
Just fall into despair,
who cares

65
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,560
Look at Tanaka
during the end

66
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,560
-At Tanaka?
-Yes

67
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,990
What the heck
are you doing?

68
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,960
Was that improvised?

69
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,110
How could that be improvised

70
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,460
I seriously dislike Tanaka now

71
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,450
I'm such a pathetic person if that's improvised

72
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,600
Many people talked about this with you right, Endo?

73
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,710
Nope, no one said anything about this to me...

74
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,710
Did something happened?   -Yes, of course, Endo

75
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,420
Well, anyway, please explain it with narration afterwards

76
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,300
With narration?

77
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,990
That's so troublesome

78
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,140
I don't understand this line

79
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,200
The masterpiece is sometimes ruined by the singer

80
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,710
This happens

81
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,310
I've worked so hard to create a masterpiece, and yet...

82
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,680
The vocal ability and abnormal thinking of the singer ruins it

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,760
We're just doing what you told us to do

84
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,000
You mean it should be an amazing song if we did it right?

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,110
Yes, exactly!

86
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,120
Hosei produce! The regrettable songs collection

87
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,560
Why is it the photo of him wearing the Rakugo costume?

88
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,040
This one was awful too

89
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,460
I don't remember a thing

90
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,860
Eh? You must be kidding

91
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,920
Look who's the singer

92
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,630
Yeah, I remembered this

93
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,090
It's Yashiro-san

94
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,890
I'm wearing this wig
at that time already?

95
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,200
This was the first time

96
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:30,210
I'll put this cup of diluted whiskey here on the table

97
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,180
Aki-san is the best!

98
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:40,320
And let the ice melt at your own pace

99
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:49,450
If that's what you're thinking about, then shall we dance?

100
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,420
Please pay attention to here

101
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,700
The position of the bangs were
higher than at the beginning

102
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,500
He moved it up himself!

103
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,180
Are you trying to flirt with someone like me?

104
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
I see

105
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,180
He thought he
looks better this way

106
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,620
So he moved it
while he's still singing!

107
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,220
Stop it! I'm not that kind of person

108
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,320
No, no, I'm just...

109
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,560
He's trying hard
to get a laugh

110
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,020
Please smile like how you used to smile

111
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,480
That cooled me down

112
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,880
Please don't mention that

113
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,590
Look! It's completely different

114
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,820
Don't remind me of the old days, it just makes me feel miserable

115
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:20,640
We two are the same kind of flower

116
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:28,970
Please try to touch it, the flower of love

117
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:41,590
Standing in the storm, face the reality now

118
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,770
I remember this,
I was terribly teased

119
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,800
What happened?

120
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Diamond Yukai-san teased me

121
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:48,610
Environmental destruction! We have to stop it now!

122
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:55,270
We are the destroyers! We have to stop now!

123
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,900
Why are you even doing this...

124
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,050
Here comes the main point

125
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,420
The disappointing scene
starts from here

126
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,190
How come?

127
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,380
Please keep watching

128
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,830
Yukai-san probably got hyped
and did this for the show

129
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,270
But then, look!

130
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,720
Endo ran away!

131
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,990
He knew he'll be destroyed

132
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:27,660
Look, look, I'm standing right here

133
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,530
What the heck is happening?

134
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,840
This was awful

135
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,620
-This is worse than the worst
-Yes, this is terrible

136
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,350
This is frightening!

137
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:38,680
Since a long time ago, I've been standing right here

138
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,900
It looks so good on Matsumoto!

139
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,900
I felt sorry for asking this senior
to mess around with us

140
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:45,000
The ocean, the sky, and the love of yours

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They are all the same as the unchanging earth

142
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,320
What kind of world is this?

143
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,980
Ru Ru Ru-ru-ru...

144
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,040
Good question

145
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:02,640
Ru Ru Ru-ru Ru-ru-ru...

146
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,800
Seriously, what the
heck is going on?

147
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,050
Ru-ru ru-ru-ru Ru-ru ru-ru-ru...

148
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,640
Are these 3 people crazy?

149
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,980
We're just doing
what he told us to do

150
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,150
Yes, exactly

151
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,300
You said your masterpiece is ruined because of the singer, right?

152
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,620
Yes, exactly

153
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,690
No way...

154
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,760
You moved the wig without permission

155
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,270
Well, I did move the wig, but...

156
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,110
What's even going on with Matsumoto and Tanaka's song?

157
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,390
Honestly, what was that?

158
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,220
I thought you guys will look like fairies, but I turned out to be completely wrong!

159
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,210
How the heck is that a fairy!

160
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,390
We won't look like fairies by any chance

161
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,510
I was terrified that day

162
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,690
I even thought I may get hit by a car on the way home

163
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,210
I actually thought the same thing...

164
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,450
This time, I honestly created it with all my might

165
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,960
Let's start with Cocorico

166
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
He forced us to do all kinds of things again...

167
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,400
We haven't watch this yet, of course

168
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,260
This is the most difficult one of all time

169
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,770
We had no idea how to express the mood of the song...

170
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,330
Endo, what happened? You went to a hot spring?

171
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,420
No, well...I didn't

172
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,560
The title of the song for Cocorico, is purposely chosen to be Cocorico, the name of your duo

173
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,780
Oh, that's the title?

174
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,750
Yes, so I hope you'll treasure it

175
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,380
I believe you two will be doing stage performances in the future

176
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,140
So I hope this could be the theme song of your performances

177
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,850
Oh, seriously?   -Yes

178
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,450
My impression of you two...

179
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,730
From a global perspective...

180
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,500
Is India

181
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,230
This is a country that is on the rise

182
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:40,230
But the rise has stopped recently, right?

183
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,400
-Just like how you guys have stopped
-No, we stopped a long time ago

184
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,810
Well, yes...   -We stopped ages ago

185
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,490
So I hope Cocorico can be on the rise again, just like India

186
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,870
Just like India?

187
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,160
Just do it like fury and go like "Bang!"   -Got it

188
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,750
You guys are lacking momentum!

189
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,370
Momentum...that doesn't sound good, but fine...

190
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:03,150
And this is the song for Cocorico, created with all his heart

191
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,480
So this song
is called Cocorico..

192
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Yes, that's the title

193
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,470
Hey hey hey, Women

194
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,280
Hey hey hey, Women

195
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,280
This is terrible!

196
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,550
Love you, love you, love you, love you

197
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,270
Hey hey hey, Man

198
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,820
Hey hey hey, Man

199
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,820
Absolutely awful!

200
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,150
Love you, love you, love you, love you

201
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,110
What the heck is this?

202
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,390
So cold, so cold...

203
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,650
My heart was captured by your lips

204
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,190
Learn to refuse, you guys

205
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,600
Love you, forever

206
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,390
Love you, forever

207
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,590
My heart was captured by your eyes

208
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,460
Love you, forever

209
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,210
Love you, forever

210
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,060
Is this really
Indian language?

211
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,620
Where should I take you out?

212
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,060
Yes, it is

213
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,310
Hey hey hey, Women

214
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,870
Hey hey hey, Women

215
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,470
Where will you take me out?

216
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,010
Hey hey hey, Man

217
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,320
It's even somehow frightening

218
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,630
Hey hey hey, Women

219
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,350
Hey hey hey, Women

220
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,350
Love you, love you, love you, love you

221
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,420
It's not frightening, right?

222
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,810
No way, it is frightening

223
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,460
Hey hey hey, Man

224
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,210
Hey hey hey, Man

225
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,620
Love you, love you, love you, love you

226
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,350
Hey hey hey, Women

227
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,070
Hey hey hey, Women

228
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,360
Love you, love you, love you, love you

229
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,800
He screwed you guys up

230
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,160
Hey hey hey, Man

231
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,940
Hey hey hey, Man

232
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,340
Love you, love you, love you, love you

233
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,320
What is the concept of this song?

234
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,920
Firstly, this is India music

235
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,670
I really like this style

236
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,890
I feel energetic whenever I watch India movies

237
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,210
And since Cocorico are both not energetic recently

238
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,010
No, that's not true

239
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,690
He always says we're not energetic

240
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,760
You're interrupting their business!

241
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,790
He asked us to use this as the theme song...

242
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,160
At the Lumine theatre?

243
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,730
He kept asking us to show the India side in us

244
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,340
But I found it really difficult to do so

245
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,270
And both of us...

246
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,880
Actually just me, was asked to retake for many times

247
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,070
Yeah, he retook his scenes quite a few times

248
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,730
What did he do wrong?

249
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,320
He's crap at it

250
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,380
Well, that's understandable   -Right?

251
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,160
He's simply crap at it

252
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,510
The song has also been recorded during the rehearsal

253
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,290
Hey hey hey, Man

254
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,240
Hey hey hey, Man   -Wait a second! Wait!

255
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,060
Wait a second, stop, stop!

256
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,940
For real!?

257
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,000
What do you mean?

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,540
Endo okay   -Thank you very much

259
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,040
You, for real?   -Eh? Really?

260
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,320
What was that horribly off-key singing!

261
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,700
Hey hey hey, Man

262
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,810
Hey hey hey...

263
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,490
Stop laughing dude!

264
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,410
I've put in so much effort to make this song!

265
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,380
Yes, you're right

266
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,420
If possible...

267
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,420
I want you to sing in female voice

268
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,080
Female voice?   -Female voice

269
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,920
Hey hey hey, Man

270
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,630
Hey hey hey, Man

271
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,740
Just like this   -Sounds good

272
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,370
Well, the song do stick in one's head though

273
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,840
Oh, thank you very much

274
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,240
Yes, it was really catchy

275
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,870
The next song is for this duo

276
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,830
Downtown-san!

277
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,140
I know nothing about this song too

278
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,720
I completed the songs and gave it to the staff three or four days ago

279
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,970
And the female assistant producer of Gaki no Tsukai said...

280
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,110
"Your song for Downtown really made me cry"

281
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,460
She really said this

282
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,690
For real

283
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,070
But I think that girl just quit her job though

284
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,430
No, she didn't!

285
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,340
We can't get a hold of her   -Of course we can!

286
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,340
We've been left on read

287
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,300
Why would she leave us on read?!

288
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,690
No idea why...   -Good morning

289
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,390
Good morning

290
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,620
It's insane, huh?

291
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,770
Yes, very insane

292
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,050
Right?   -I heard it from the staffs

293
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,480
And I thought I don't want to do this   -Exactly

294
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,250
No, no, please...

295
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,320
This is something that we mustn't do   -Exactly

296
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,610
No, no, give me a break

297
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,840
The lyrics...to be honest...

298
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,510
I didn't think about it at all

299
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,460
What do you mean?

300
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,110
I didn't think about it at all, and...

301
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,580
Excuse me

302
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,580
Is this being recorded?

303
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,320
Of course it is being recorded!

304
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,360
Just look at the number of cameras

305
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,720
It's completely being recorded

306
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,840
I thought this is not being recorded   -No way, it is

307
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,130
This don't need to be recorded though

308
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,810
Please record it, from the start to the end

309
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,700
I didn't think about the lyrics at all

310
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,510
Then I wrote it all at once promptly and smoothly

311
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,820
Eh? I see

312
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,390
Therefore, it sounds very natural

313
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,560
So we don't need to add any twists and turns, right?   -Yes, exactly!

314
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,610
Excuse me

315
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,300
Are there batteries in it (mic)?   -Yes, there are

316
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,400
The highlight of this song is the slow rap   -I see

317
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,910
I've never sang anything like this before

318
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,090
Please give it a try

319
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,740
We like the same type of girl

320
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,260
We have the same sense of Owarai

321
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,420
Phew...this is terrible

322
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,060
We like the same type of girl

323
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,330
We have the same sense of Owarai

324
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,700
When we're happy, when we're sad, when we're brightened, when we're frustrated

325
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,280
Who made us feel like that?   -Wait, wait, wait!

326
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,700
What's going on with you?

327
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,840
I was scared too, what happened?

328
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,180
I understand it, I know you're getting hyped, but...

329
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,650
He sang it so well, so of course I'm hyped

330
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,850
I know, I understand, but...

331
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,250
Please be patient, it's not your turn yet

332
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,750
You have your slow rap section later too   -Fine...

333
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,680
Tie me up, please tie me up!

334
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,960
I can't control myself

335
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,030
Please enjoy Downtown's song with slow rap parts

336
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,920
Look at the costume,
doesn't it look familiar?

337
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,180
We saw it just now!

338
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,350
These two are
from the video we
watched just now!

339
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,040
-I don't get it
-A hand on the shoulder

340
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:15,330
We've been together since we were kids, me and you, we've always been together

341
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,330
No, no, hell no

342
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:24,870
How long will it last? This precious time with you

343
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,440
No, no, hell no

344
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,720
All I can say is hell no

345
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:29,280
We like the same type of girl

346
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,280
You call that rap?

347
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,950
We have the same sense of Owarai

348
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,480
I was laughing already...

349
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,660
When we're happy, when we're sad, when we're brightened, when we're frustrated

350
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,050
Both of you are
laughing already

351
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:43,280
Who made us feel like that?

352
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:52,530
I bet God decided it

353
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,120
Very good

354
00:15:52,530 --> 00:16:01,470
If that's so, then I have to tell God something

355
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,170
The Kansai accent
is so strong

356
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:06,440
We like the same food

357
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,440
No way, it's different

358
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,080
We hate the same food

359
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,080
I told you it's different

360
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:15,900
When we're happy, when we're sad, when we're brightened, when we're frustrated

361
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,590
Who made us feel like that?

362
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,030
Very good

363
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:29,700
I bet God decided it

364
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:38,750
If that's so, then I have to tell God something

365
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:50,770
Thank you for letting us meet each other

366
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,190
(They're holding hands)

367
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,260
(What are they trying to express?)

368
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,970
I see, I see

369
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,170
This is really worth watching

370
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,530
No way, it's not worth watching   -It surely is

371
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,010
I don't really get the music

372
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,320
But this is so funny

373
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,150
This is so interesting

374
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,960
Hamada's shoulder became hotter and hotter

375
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,930
It became hotter and hotter

376
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:28,860
Of course it'll become hotter   -Yeah, right?

377
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,980
The title of this song is Downtown

378
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,670
Yeah, it is

379
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,280
Is this also Hosei-san's impression of Downtown-san?

380
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,830
Yeah, the lyrics came to my mind promptly and smoothly

381
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,980
How long did it take you to write this?

382
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,650
So I created all three songs in one day

383
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,300
Then I wrote the lyrics the next day

384
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,750
Did you create it in your own room?

385
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,220
Well, I have my own music studio, outside

386
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,360
Outside?   -Outside?

387
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,170
You mean you rented another room?   -Yes

388
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,790
You scared me...

389
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,460
Come on, I'm not doing it in the wild

390
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,830
I thought you treat the wild as your own room

391
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,200
I thought like "this dude is finally becoming insane!"

392
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,450
We're talking to God in Kansai dialect, huh?

393
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,470
Incredible

394
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,880
Yes, you're right, and that symbolizes innocence

395
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,240
No matter who you're talking to...

396
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,160
I honestly almost punch you in the face just now

397
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,880
"Bang!"

398
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,110
Please don't, that's too dangerous

399
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,310
Please don't do that

400
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,920
Please don't do that, it's such a brilliant song

401
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,460
Okay, so here comes the climax

402
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,390
This song is for the five of us, and the title is Gaki no Tsukai

403
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,570
I just have to say that everyone is so hyped

404
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:43,570
And I almost got crushed by the enthusiasm from you guys

405
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,100
Were we even hyped?   -I don't think so

406
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,590
By the way...

407
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,330
I feel like I drew a bad lot...

408
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,880
There's no such thing as a bad lot

409
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,330
None of it is a bad lot

410
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,880
What do you guys think after listening to the song?

411
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,260
Well, it's definitely Hosei-san's kind of style

412
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,220
Hosei-san loves this kind of songs

413
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,190
I listened to it in my car

414
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,920
And I almost wanted to hit-and-run

415
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,940
No way, please don't do that

416
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,090
This is such a troublesome song!

417
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,030
Eh, really?

418
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,420
I'm in love with this song

419
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,150
Yeah, I knew you like this kind of songs

420
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,160
A loud and explosive song

421
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,480
Nah...

422
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:34,090
Hey Boy, inside your mind, with bare hands, pour everything out
Hey Girl, inside your heart, with bare hands, pour everything out

423
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,790
Hosei is in charge of demonstrating and teaching the members

424
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,620
What does it mean?

425
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,190
There's many things that I want to talk about, but...

426
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,070
We really need to get hyped, huh?

427
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,950
Yes, it's much better if you're hyped

428
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,950
Yeah, it is, on the whole

429
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,870
For the first line "On your head, pull every hair out with bare hands"

430
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,860
Who's gonna sing that line?

431
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,750
No? I got it wrong?

432
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,260
There's no such line

433
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,090
Ah, sorry

434
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,000
"Inside your mind, with bare hands, pour everything out", that's right

435
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,930
I thought it's a self-deprecating song

436
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,960
Formation practice

437
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,160
...inside your heart, with bare hands, pour everything out

438
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,720
Hey boy!

439
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,840
Is this only broadcasted on TVer?

440
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,140
Nope, it's broadcasted on Nippon TV, and across Japan

441
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,470
As usual

442
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,290
Is it possible to only broadcast it online?

443
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,120
This is will be broadcasted across Japan

444
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,720
Hosei has been very fastidious about the costume as well

445
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,150
Matsumoto-san, please come to the front

446
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,200
Come on...

447
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,970
At the moment that it was flipped, this didn't even get a laugh

448
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:49,800
I want to get a laugh

449
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,860
I want to get a laugh if I have to do this

450
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,740
Hosei produce finale

451
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,940
This is a song for the five members, with fastidiously chosen costumes

452
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:07,410
Hey Boy, inside your mind, with bare hands, pour everything out

453
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,310
What the heck is
this look, honestly

454
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:14,290
Hey Girl, inside your heart, with bare hands, pour everything out

455
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,860
Hey yo, I'm gonna defeat this, I'm gonna defeat the world

456
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,430
Shout against the world, wow wow wow wow

457
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,430
It didn't get a laugh at all

458
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,590
Let's change it with our power, change the world with our power

459
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:28,170
Turn the world upside down, wow wow wow wow

460
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,210
Then we will finally be free, and we can fulfill our wishes

461
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,410
I'll definitely make it come true, wow wow wow wow

462
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,810
We're gonna do it together, we're gonna fight against the world together

463
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,850
Shout against the world, wow wow wow wow

464
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:47,330
Hey Boy, inside your mind, with bare hands, pour everything out

465
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:53,930
Hey Girl, inside your heart, with bare hands, pour everything out

466
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,330
You're the only
one that's hyped

467
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,000
What the heck
was this, honestly

468
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
This was awkward

469
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
This was so
awkward

470
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,740
What was he
wearing on his head?

471
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,490
-Is that the thing in rugby?
-Yes, it's from rugby

472
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,020
What is he thinking?

473
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:27,020
Hey Boy, inside your mind, with bare hands, pour everything out

474
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:33,670
Hey Girl, inside your heart, with bare hands, pour everything out

475
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:40,070
Hey Boy, inside your mind, with bare hands, pour everything out

476
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:47,020
Hey Girl, inside your heart, with bare hands, pour everything out

477
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,180
This is awful

478
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,550
How dare you make that face, dude?

479
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,200
What do you think about this as a producer, Yama-chan?

480
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,020
I think this is a masterpiece   -Oh, really?

481
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,690
In regard to the costumes...   -You were very fastidious, huh?

482
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,850
I was super fastidious about it

483
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,840
And each of them costed a lot of money

484
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,370
And there's no money left for the set today

485
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,450
So that's why it's so plain

486
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,450
It's completely empty

487
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,080
I see, so that's why

488
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,200
It's the set for NHK's gymnastic shows

489
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,920
To be honest, I really don't want this to be aired

490
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,800
No, no, no...

491
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,820
This needs to be aired multiple times

492
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,290
Dear people related to the music industry

493
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,090
I would like to sell these 3 songs

494
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,730
You're stuttering like crazy

495
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,390
This is Downtown-san's greatest wish

496
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,220
He's still continuing...

497
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,580
Please, Downtown-san really wants to release their CD

498
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,120
No, no...   -They want to release CD for Gaki no Tsuakai!

499
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,080
Everybody, please do them a favor!

500
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,320
I'm saying this for real, and Cocorico agrees with me too, right?

501
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,850
Hell no, he's going crazy
