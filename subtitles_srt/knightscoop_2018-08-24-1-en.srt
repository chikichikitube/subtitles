00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,620
Let's get started with our first request.

3
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:10,530
Our first request is from Houtani Mizuki-san, a 25 years old office worker in Suginami Ward, Tokyo.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,570
Good evening to everyone at the Detective Bureau.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,570
Good evening!

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,170
I love pork belly stew.

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,740
I love, love that soft pork fat flavor that builds up. It's irresistible.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,740
Ok, ok.

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,180
That's what my request is about this time detectives.

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,180
Okay.

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,880
I want to eat some stew I froze in my fridge 5 years ago.

12
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,390
The appearance has turned pure white, so I don't know if it's edible.

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,840
But no matter what, I want to eat it.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,630
Actually, in that stew that my deceased mother made, there is her flavor.

15
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:48,470
Please help me make delicious, 5-year-frozen stew. Thank you very much. That's it.

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,210
I was laughing at it a bit in the beginning,

17
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,890
Yeah, yeah.

18
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,890
but I feel like I need my handkerchief or something.

19
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,860
Well, you may need it.

20
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,120
Well still, this frozen stew is 5 years old.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,450
5 years ago, huh?

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,450
Yes.

23
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,000
Usually you'd throw it away I think but,

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,420
No matter what, she wants to eat it.
She seems to be obsessed with the idea.

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,860
What was the result? Were we able to eat that 5 year old stew? Please take a look.

26
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,030
You have stew frozen from 5 years ago?

27
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,030
That's right.

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,300
It's impossible, isn't it?

29
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,420
No! That's...

30
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,110
From 5 years ago?

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,110
Yeah.

32
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,360
I wonder if it'll give me stomach troubles. I want to eat it,

33
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,000
but as you know, it's been 5 years.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,660
5 years.

35
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,660
It's 5 years old.

36
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,240
Without Knight Scoop, you're not sure you'd be able to eat it on your own.

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,570
I don't know.

38
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,570
You don't know, right?

39
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,830
Well it's scary, so I thought I'd make someone do it with me...

40
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,190
No, no, no.

41
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,040
First of all, we can see it?

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,040
Yeah.

43
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,100
That 5 year old stew.

44
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,100
Yes.

45
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,820
There, huh?

46
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,170
Ah, tupperware?

47
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:55,820
Tupperware.

48
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
It's in tupperware.

49
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,370
No way, it's ice. Inside the tupperware...

50
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,370
It's really pretty.

51
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,700
It looks like crystals.

52
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:16,310
What is this ice? This is really pretty isn't it? Isn't it intricate?

53
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,160
In here simply put, is what you believed in.

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,600
Ah, I see.

56
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,920
It's not silky, right? It's all dried out.

57
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,920
Yeah.

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,340
In your request letter, your mother made...

59
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,740
Your mother's altar is here.

60
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,960
It's how she was 5 years ago.

61
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,860
When I was 20, she suddenly had a brain hemorrhage.

62
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,880
Then you didn't throw it away.

63
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,880
Yeah.

64
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,950
That day she passed, she made stew for dinner.

65
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,750
Eh?

66
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,750
Yeah.

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,170
The mother's final cooking.

68
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,050
So it's like that?

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,730
So, that's why you haven't eaten it.

70
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,110
It's sad.

71
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,730
Her last meal?

72
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,730
Yeah.

73
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,500
That morning before I went to school,

74
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,270
That day, my mom had work, um, sorry.

75
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,010
In the morning, she asked "What do you want to eat for dinner today?"

76
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,270
I really liked stew and Mom liked stew so,

77
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,590
I said stew was good.

78
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,390
Then, I said "I'm off". But when I came home,

79
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:31,000
she had a kind of unsteady appearance so I immediately called an ambulance.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,140
I stayed at the hospital until the next morning. I didn't feel like eating or anything.

81
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,310
I have an older sister but she's married and lives in Kumamoto Prefecture.

82
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,750
And my father was on a business trip in America. So I was suddenly all on my own.

83
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,780
You were alone?

84
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,780
Yeah.

85
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,940
In the morning, I came back home, but

86
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,190
Just seeing the pot...

87
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,690
It's a little sad.

88
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,310
The next day, my father came back.

89
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,310
He came back from America.

90
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,850
Yeah. So I put it in the tupperware.

91
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,020
Then I put it in the freezer. For some time, stew too...

92
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,440
I wasn't able to eat stew for some time. It was sad.

93
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,440
I see.

94
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,310
The reason you felt like trying to eat it now is to little by little bring peace of mind to yourself.

95
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,310
That's right.

96
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,550
I can probably eat a little bit, I think I can do that.

97
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,050
It'd be nice if you could eat it.

98
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,140
Yeah. I want to eat it.

99
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,960
Right?

100
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,120
You want to be able to eat it, but

101
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,130
on the other hand, there's the possibility that eating it is dangerous for you, Mizuki-chan.

102
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,130
It could be.

103
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,760
Right?

104
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,650
Mizuki-chan, if you got sick. Your mom wouldn't...

105
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,670
Right? We can't make it. She'd be angry.

106
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:48,170
Honestly, we need to know if it's edible, if it's okay to eat,

107
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,410
if it's unsafe to eat.

108
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,010
So, we have no choice but to investigate.

109
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,010
Yes.

110
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,080
To start.

111
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:01,120
I'm really sorry but I don't have any days off work.

112
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,510
Could you go in my place?

113
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,510
That's no good.

114
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,000
That's no good. It's your mom's stew. That's no good.

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,160
When are you done?

116
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,670
7 p.m.

117
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:17,900
Until then, shall I investigate? Since I'm free today.

118
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,540
I only have this, so I'm free.

119
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,540
Really?

120
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:29,280
Now, since we're researching various things about food, we've come to Tokyo University of Agriculture.

121
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,500
Excuse me, Professor Uchino?

122
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,500
Yes.

123
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,920
Excuse me, we're from Knight Scoop. Nice to meet you.

124
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,620
Could you take a look at this for a moment?

125
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,620
Ah, okay.

126
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,680
What's this?

127
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,800
This is it, sensei.

128
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,800
Okay.

129
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,730
This pork stew.

130
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,730
Okay.

131
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,120
For 5 years, this was frozen in the family fridge.

132
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Okay.

133
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,610
Is that so? That's awfully long.

134
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,490
Yes.

135
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,940
About that, can you eat it?

136
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,850
I would think that after 5 years it'd be pretty difficult.

137
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,720
Another thing I'd be curious about,

138
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,590
how was it kept since it was prepared?

139
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,960
Then, the problem is food poisoning.

140
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,730
Whether or not any bacteria got into it before freezing is one concern.

141
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,130
First is the microscope. To see if there are any microbes inside.

142
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,640
If there is bacteria, it's possible that food poisoning bacteria has gotten in as well.

143
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,460
There's only a little bit, but it is there.

144
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,460
Eh?

145
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,780
There is some bacteria and it's possible it's the food poisoning type.

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,580
Well, there's a bit more.

147
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:42,090
If we run an experiment, we can determine whether it's food poisoning bacteria or not.

148
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,370
Sorry for the sudden imposition.

149
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,370
Not at all.

150
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,530
8 PM

151
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,930
Oh, Mizuki-chan.

152
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,930
Takeyama-san!

153
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,650
Sorry. Sorry to keep you waiting.

154
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,550
I'm done with work.

155
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,920
You're done?

156
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,920
I'm done.

157
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,340
You go to work like this?

158
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,340
I go to work like this.

159
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,490
Ah, nice to meet you Dad. I'm Tantei Knight Scoop's Takeyama.

160
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,490
Ah, welcome.

161
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,080
Good evening.

162
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,080
Good evening.

163
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,980
Mizuki, does he know the request?

164
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,900
He knows.

165
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:07,900
I've heard.

166
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,680
That's why he's here.

167
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,840
How many times have I said "Is it okay if I throw this away?"

168
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,840
To your daughter?

169
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,460
Yes, she was strongly against it.

170
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,990
I went to Tokyo University of Agriculture.

171
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,200
I've done some research into whether we can eat it.

172
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,200
Okay.

173
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,640
Now I'll make a phone call and we'll hear the sensei's answer.

174
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,750
Okay.

175
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,440
Can we do it?

176
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,940
Ah, I'm nervous.

177
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,910
Hello.

178
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,960
First of all, sensei, in short, I want to ask, what's the result?

179
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,920
If you ask, I think

180
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:43,920
Yes?

181
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,310
on whether or not you can eat it, you can more or less eat it.

182
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,560
We can pretty much eat it?

183
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,560
We can eat it?

184
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,560
Yes.

185
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,450
However, the microbe risk isn't zero.

186
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,450
Yes, yes, yes.

187
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,080
Well, properly...

188
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,080
Ok.

189
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,770
Heat it up over 100 °C, ok?

190
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:01,770
Ok.

191
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,710
Furthermore, if you eat a small amount,

192
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,710
Ok.

193
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,780
the risk can be considerably reduced I think.

194
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,780
Ok.

195
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,200
But it may upset your stomach a bit.

196
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,200
Ok, ok, ok.

197
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,950
Alright.

198
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,100
Thank you very much.

199
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,320
Thank you.

200
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,320
Yes, yes.

201
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,130
Let's eat it.

202
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,000
It's good?

203
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,470
Even if it may hurt you a little.

204
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,160
It's alright.

205
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,860
What about you?

206
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,860
Let's eat it.

207
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,340
Is it okay?

208
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,760
It's decided.

209
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,930
But we don't know how it will turn out.

210
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,830
The most important thing is that it tastes good right?

211
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,830
Yes.

212
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,800
We've called just the person for it.

213
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,890
Eh?

214
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,890
Eh?

215
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,840
Please come in.

216
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,740
Hayashi-sensei.

217
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,740
Yes.

218
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,040
Good evening.

219
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,980
Good evening, sensei.

220
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,050
Stop with the "good evenings".

221
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,050
Good evening, sensei.

222
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,130
Always calling me.

223
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,130
Yes.

224
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,230
Without warning.

225
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,230
Yes.

226
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,750
Su-suddenly.

227
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:50,750
Yes.

228
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,260
Making me to come to Tokyo without telling me anything.

229
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,260
Yes, well...

230
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,990
Sensei's abilities are absolutely necessary.

231
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,040
It's not bugs is it?

232
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,320
It's not bugs. Not bugs.

233
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,050
Sensei, this is frozen stew.

234
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,660
Oh wow.

235
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,700
This was frozen 5 years ago.

236
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,920
We want to eat this.

237
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,000
Are you an idiot?

238
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,670
If it's a small amount, it's okay to eat.

239
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,860
That's... eh?

240
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,380
They want to be able to eat this. In here...

241
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,710
I can make it from scratch of course. That 5 year old stew is...

242
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,110
No, that's no good. Making it from scratch is no good.

243
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,110
Why?

244
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,250
This stew in particular, about 5 years ago...

245
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,250
Explaining the situation.

246
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,990
This is the last meal their mom made.

247
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,060
Eh?

248
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,990
How about it?

249
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,450
If I hear that, I've got to. I've got no choice.

250
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,330
Right?

251
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,220
In addition, if at all possible, I want to it as it is.

252
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,220
Is that so?

253
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,200
That's right. Your mom's flavor.

254
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,570
It's in quite a state.

255
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,080
The meat is awfully dried out.

256
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,210
To restore it from being this dried out,

257
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,350
the broth needs to be added back.

258
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,050
But I understand, that's how it is.

259
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,490
This smell is a little...

260
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,370
Freezer smell?

261
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,190
Yeah, yeah.

262
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,970
Are you not confident?

263
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,590
No, that's not it.

264
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,610
It's impossible for even Hayashi-sensei, huh?

265
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,080
No, it's not.

266
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,030
If you say impossible...

267
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,400
I can do it.

268
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,630
I'll do it. I will.

269
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,870
Starting cooking.

270
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,940
You're warming in the water to release it from the tupperware, right?

271
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,940
That's right.

272
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,040
Ah, it's come out. It's come out.

273
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,660
Amazing.

274
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,660
Wow, it came out.

275
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,700
This is all in once piece because of how it came loose.

276
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,880
Ah, I see. I see.

277
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,750
We'll not cook it too much or it'll become really dried out.

278
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,490
Somehow we're microwaving it to eat it.

279
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,290
I didn't get the feeling we'd be microwaving it.

280
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,600
You didn't think we'd be microwaving it to eat it.

281
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,750
The microwave will heat it up this way but

282
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,750
Yes.

283
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:54,870
there's still the previous problem. It will become extra dry from microwaving it.

284
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,810
It'll still be good even if you microwave it?

285
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:57,810
Yeah.

286
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,480
The broth. The broth's come out.

287
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,480
Seriously? There's broth.

288
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,780
There's broth, right?

289
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,780
The broth's come out.

290
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,940
You're separating the meat and the broth?

291
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,690
I'll the use broth after I heat it up a bit.

292
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,210
But there's broth that's come out.

293
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:10,940
That's right.

294
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,160
I would add some flavor but I can't do that.

295
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,760
We're going to heat it up to over 100 degrees.

296
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,800
I'll cook it in this pressure cooker.

297
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,050
If you move them too much, they'll fall apart.

298
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,490
Ok.

299
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,910
Since they're being cooked again.

300
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:25,910
Ok.

301
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,510
You're placing them one by one so the meat doesn't lose its shape as it's heated.

302
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,810
Yes.

303
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,510
Yes.

304
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,780
If you do it like this, it's hard for them to fall apart.

305
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,950
What do you think it'd be like if sensei weren't here?

306
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,950
It'd be really bad.

307
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,790
Sensei is amazing, huh?

308
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,200
We're not done yet.

309
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,880
Look here. There's a bit of a bad smell from the meat.

310
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,390
Uh huh, it's the meat.

311
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,390
Smells like meat.

312
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,660
I think I can get rid of that bad smell a bit.

313
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,660
Ok, ok.

314
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,790
The taste will be the same, we won't change that.

315
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,840
Spring onions and...

316
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,710
And ginger peels. We use the peels so there's no spiciness. Only the flavor.

317
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,740
To get rid of the smell.

318
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,730
You're not changing the mother's flavor, right?

319
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,730
That's right.

320
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,950
This won't change the flavor.

321
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,120
We can't leave it in this state.

322
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,870
If we add the broth in, we can cook them together.

323
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,240
That's the broth you're adding back.

324
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,240
Yes, yes.

325
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,530
I'm putting it in.

326
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,530
Okay.

327
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,200
I'm looking forward to it. I want to eat it soon.

328
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,070
Has the 5 year old stew been resurrected?

329
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,710
Ouch, ouch.

330
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,630
Sensei, did you do it?

331
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,730
Hmm, I wonder.

332
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,010
Amazing!

333
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,880
I'm shaking.

334
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,790
Amazing, huh?

335
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,620
There's no bad smell.

336
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,320
It has the perfect smell.

337
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,320
The perfect smell?

338
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,710
It smells perfect.

339
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,710
That's how your mom used to make it?

340
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,490
It smells just like it.

341
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,450
Really.

342
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,450
That feeling?

343
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,100
It was this smell?

344
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,100
Yeah, this smell.

345
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,740
While it was dried out, I tried to bring it back as much as possible.

346
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,740
Right?

347
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,740
Amazing.

348
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,410
Your mom is watching now, right? I feel like she's been brought back.

349
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,010
Shall we eat? As we're reminded of your mother.

350
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,650
Somehow my hands are trembling.

351
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,160
Itadakimasu.

352
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,160
Please.

353
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,140
Delicious.

354
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,140
Delicious?

355
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,080
It tastes like your mother's cooking?

356
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,080
Yeah.

357
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,900
Just like it.

358
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,790
Yeah?

359
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:48,510
It doesn't feel like it's been left for 5 years at all. Really.

360
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,440
Sensei, are you glad?

361
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,860
I'm glad. I'm glad.

362
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,700
It's the same, right?

363
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,170
Truly.

364
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,170
Yeah.

365
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,070
Again, it's really delicious after so long. Thank you.

366
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,140
It's delicious?

367
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,140
Yeah, delicious.

368
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,290
I feel like, from tomorrow on, I'll do my best.

369
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,250
You feel you can?

370
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,250
I feel I can.

371
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,010
Even though Dad said to throw it away.

372
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,010
That too.

373
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,680
Sorry about that.

374
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,530
Well done. Hayashi-sensei did an incredible job for us.

375
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,080
That's right.

376
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,560
Yeah, the father and Mizuki-chan had it as the mother's cooking.

377
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,560
Yes.

378
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,940
The thing is, they were able to eat the stew after being frozen for so long.

379
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,610
It's done there, right?

380
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,610
Yes, yes.

381
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,270
But Mizuki-chan in the beginning,

382
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,580
when she saw the ice crystals, right?

383
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:54,150
She said "This is really beautiful. I want to keep this."

384
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,090
She put it back in the freezer.

385
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,990
So it didn't disappear.
