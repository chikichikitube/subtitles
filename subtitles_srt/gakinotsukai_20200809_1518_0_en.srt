1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,980
The 6th time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arehende!

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,980
So loud!

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,620
Let's Play World Tabletop Games!

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,920
No I said it softly

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,140
No I said it softly

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,920
We're just normally playing tabletop games right!

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:22,700
*In the last episode they pranked Hamada

8
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,160
Yes, this time it's exactly as you say

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,290
No no no, this is weird

10
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,160
"exactly as you say"?

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,850
I'm sick of this already

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,680
The first is a German game "Hamsterrolle"

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,220
It's a balancing game

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,220
Oh, this is...

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,750
This hamster wheel looking thing

16
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,970
Normally it's suspended like this

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:53,930
I've given everyone the same color blocks

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,830
In order

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,830
we place the blocks

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,450
Whoever runs out of blocks first wins

21
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,910
That's the rule

22
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,600
Simple

23
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,180
As we place more blocks, it will become unbalanced

24
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,180
And the blocks will fall out

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,410
In that case

26
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,560
The person who caused it has to take the fallen blocks

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,140
They become your blocks

28
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,530
It increases your pieces

29
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,520
That's right

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Also, another thing

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,430
For example, if you put a red piece here

32
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,860
The next person

33
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,200
can't place the same color in the same spot

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,430
In that case, if you want to put a red piece

35
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,410
You have to put it in the zone after the next zone

36
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,440
Well, just say something when it happens

37
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,460
Like, "you can't do that"

38
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,430
Okay, I'll say something

39
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:45,640
This game will be played by these 4, starting from Housei

40
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,050
For the first piece, we skip the first empty zone

41
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,350
Oh, I see

42
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,350
So it's fine to put it here

43
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,430
I see, you can place it like that

44
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,710
Sideways is fine too

45
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,700
But this is still fine

46
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,240
We can place another one here

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,360
But you can't place a piece on top of another piece

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,510
You have to place pieces in front of the last piece

49
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,350
Then that means

50
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,170
If you place it length wise, you block the zone

51
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,430
Then we can only place a piece here now

52
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,410
Exactly

53
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,180
You just suddenly set us up

54
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,180
You made a great play

55
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,720
That was my strategy

56
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,990
You knew that?

57
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:24,990
Yes

58
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,870
Seriously?

59
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,680
You can place it in the next zone or the one after

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,510
So here

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,700
That did quite a bit, see

62
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,640
In this case we can go back right?

63
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,640
You can't

64
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,210
We can't go back

65
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,100
The next block has to be further than the last

66
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,100
Further

67
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,970
As long as it's a different color

68
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,850
You can place in the same zone

69
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,840
So I can place this then

70
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,840
Yes, that's fine

71
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,500
Yamasaki's zone is okay too right?

72
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
On the side is fine right?

73
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,550
Well you can't go backwards anyways

74
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,690
You have to move forward

75
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,690
Ah! I see

76
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,520
Tanaka I can't go here?

77
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,160
No that should be fine right?

78
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,650
On top is fine right?

79
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,670
You can go on top

80
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,220
This is surprisingly complex isn't it?

81
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,520
I can't remember all the rules

82
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,470
What's this?

83
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,140
The person who caused it to fall

84
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,740
It becomes their piece

85
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,670
This one?

86
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,670
This one?

87
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,620
Yes, yes

88
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,280
This isn't one of the ones we placed

89
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,280
It's not

90
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,250
It looks like something you'd find in a shrine

91
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,620
So this is mine now

92
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,510
You have to place that somewhere now

93
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,580
Can I place it like this too?

94
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,430
It's fine as long as it fits right?

95
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,620
If it fits it's fine

96
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,120
Does it fit?

97
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,460
It fits, it fits

98
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,960
You're pushing really hard

99
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,230
It doesn't fit

100
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,190
That one fell out

101
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:42,970
That's bad!

102
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,210
Wait wait

103
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,620
That's Housei's now

104
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,200
Eh, my turn's over?

105
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,070
The fallen piece is yours

106
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:55,080
That was amazing, just now Tanaka

107
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,080
made the scariest face since his debut

108
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,730
Since I debuted?

109
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,250
It's unusual for Tanaka to make that kind of face

110
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,520
I made that kind of face? Really?

111
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,520
Since his debut, #1 scariest face

112
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,520
It was kind of amazing

113
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,850
Then, my self will...

114
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,520
This one, this round one

115
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,910
I can't place in front here, it has to be above

116
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,320
But this one's round so I can't place here

117
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,890
I can only place here then

118
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,400
My self placed one here so

119
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,830
I know, so can I place on top of it?

120
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,800
On top of my self's piece is fine

121
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,800
Tanaka which is it?

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,400
It's as my self says

123
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,080
I tried using Nakajima Miyuki's "my self"

124
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,070
So if you place the round piece

125
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,000
I want to do this again

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,030
This time is practice

127
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,890
I have a question!

128
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,790
What do we do if it goes past the table?

129
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,330
I'll put it back.

130
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,530
Such a practical answer

131
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:56,940
The key to the game is controlling the tilt of the wheel

132
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,050
As well as having a delicate touch when placing blocks

133
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,560
Both of these skills will control the game

134
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,020
Oh, amazing!

135
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,350
Plus it didn't move at all

136
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,930
Everyone's remaining pieces have decreased

137
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,070
The game approaches it's final stage

138
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,940
Ah, but this is

139
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,140
perfectly balanced...

140
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,110
That's true, it's a bit scary

141
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,760
That's risky

142
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,320
Seriously!?

143
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,920
Nice nice nice

144
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,380
Seriously?

145
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,660
Only 2 more pieces Matsumoto

146
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,750
This is impossible

147
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,810
You could put one there

148
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,410
It'll fall over if he does

149
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,410
He's gonna try there?

150
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,970
No way!

151
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:11,810
This is like

152
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,810
my invention you know

153
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,280
No wait a second

154
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,160
That technique

155
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,850
This technique is amazing

156
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,520
No everyone's been doing that

157
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,210
Wow he did it?

158
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,160
It's moving

159
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,770
Now that it's like this it's more interesting

160
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,550
I finally see what makes this game interesting

161
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,570
Now is a pretty tense part

162
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,570
The balance is so delicate

163
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,690
There's nothing confusing about this

164
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,180
Yeah really

165
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,710
Ah it keeps moving

166
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,720
His farsightedness is making it worse

167
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,720
Seriously it's so hard to see

168
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,590
I think this impossible

169
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,090
If you fail, at least scream or something

170
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,090
Make the ending interesting

171
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,810
I really can't see

172
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,350
Eh, didn't he just place it?

173
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,740
This is

174
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,740
doable?

175
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,210
Well

176
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,210
maybe with a light one

177
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,790
This one then

178
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,570
I have a small one but

179
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,550
This looks doable

180
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,830
You're gonna put it on top of the purple?

181
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,260
I have to put it on top of the purple

182
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,430
The purple is in the 7th zone

183
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,300
No I think the next zone is fine

184
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,500
Baldy!

185
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,970
He's calling you

186
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,110
Don't care

187
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,110
Not bald

188
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,110
Can't be me

189
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,150
Another move and they'll fall

190
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,150
Why am I clapping, I'm next

191
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:07,300
But if you place it Matsumoto, it's your win

192
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,290
Of course

193
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:06,780
Really?

194
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,110
This is my last piece

195
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,710
But it's over there, he has to place there

196
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,700
He might be able to place it

197
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,700
But you have to consider the weight

198
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:24,380
This is probably the heaviest one

199
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,390
You left the heaviest for last

200
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,590
Is he gonna lose out?

201
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,230
This is so scary

202
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,260
My astigmatism is flaring up

203
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,100
This game is impossible

204
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,100
for our age group

205
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,970
One time I was watching TV

206
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:56,610
"Single Mother Ootsuka Ai" it said on top

207
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,710
Ootsuka Ai got really fat, is what I thought

208
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,020
She has this many children? I looked closer

209
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:09,860
"Single Mother Big Family" is what it said

210
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,860
You misread Big Family as Ootsuka Ai

211
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,560
Come on man...

212
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,060
No really my astigmatism, I can't tell things apart

213
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,130
If he places it he wins?

214
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,130
This is pretty hard, it's the 7th round

215
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,860
This sucks

216
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,120
This sucks, it wasn't even funny

217
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,120
He got four of them

218
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,030
Wait a second, this can't be real

219
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,660
What do I do with these?

220
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,800
Leave the wheel as is, and Matsumoto takes the fallen pieces

221
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,640
The wheel stays as it is?

222
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,560
Just like this

223
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,610
Hamada is about to finish isn't he?

224
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,340
If I place this OK then it's over

225
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,500
It's Hamada's win

226
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,020
I'll go here

227
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,020
I think so too, there's nowhere else

228
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,380
What the hell is up with this

229
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,380
It's moving so much

230
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,350
Why is it moving so much

231
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,670
Well it is round

232
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,750
No you gotta do it more gently

233
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,030
He did it!

234
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,130
Hamada's Win!

235
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,410
Thank you

236
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,740
How do we decide the rankings?

237
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,110
Well you're first

238
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,290
These two are tied for second

239
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,110
Which makes you fourth

240
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,320
No I have the shrine relic

241
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,440
It's not a shrine relic

242
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,420
It's kinda scary, it's all black

243
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,460
Next up is the French Game, Doctor Eureka

244
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,750
This one's really simple

245
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,900
Inside these test tubes are some balls

246
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,330
These are like, strong chemicals

247
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,840
Now some cards will be played

248
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,470
For example if this card was played

249
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,410
We have to copy the card

250
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,410
That's right

251
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,870
But because they're strong chemicals

252
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,710
You have to do it like this

253
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,080
You can't touch them

254
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,930
The balls right?

255
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,560
You mix them like this to copy the picture

256
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,560
This is tough

257
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,520
Whoever finishes first wins

258
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,250
This one's pretty tough

259
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,070
It's basically a puzzle

260
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,960
Nice nice

261
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:37,280
This is an elimination game, who will be left last?

262
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,310
The first one, is this

263
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,150
How should I do this...

264
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,650
Copy the picture

265
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,790
Ah this is annoying

266
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,430
This green one needs to be on the bottom

267
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,110
I think this is impossible now

268
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,470
I think I made it impossible for myself

269
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,730
Is this definitely possible?

270
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,730
Yes it's definitely possible

271
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,140
Ah! If you drop it you

272
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,140
lose instantly

273
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,130
Done!

274
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,340
Hamada wins

275
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,560
Oh he did it

276
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,540
Done!

277
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,820
Wasn't there someone who dropped them?

278
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,820
Hamada

279
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,160
No I didn't

280
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,990
It was Hamada

281
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,620
I didn't drop them

282
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,420
It definitely was around here

283
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,420
Right I heard it happen there

284
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,690
I'm the one who dropped them...

285
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,110
Couldn't you have said that earlier?

286
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,110
It was you?

287
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,570
I was the only who dropped them

288
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,540
Plus I didn't finish

289
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,540
You lost first

290
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,670
Ah, I forgot to mention something

291
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,680
Once you finish, you have to say "Eureka!"

292
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,450
He didn't say it

293
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,350
No he just told us that

294
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,460
That's no good

295
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,350
You didn't say Eureka or anything

296
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,790
By the way what does it mean?

297
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:02,990
Doctor Eureka is

298
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,990
our boss

299
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,690
Professor Eureka?

300
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,690
What the hell is that

301
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,230
Round 2

302
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,650
Let's raise our hands and shout Eureka

303
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,370
Sorry I didn't explain properly

304
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,600
Okay 4 people left!

305
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,370
And go

306
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,870
Eh? This, what do I do?

307
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,220
Oh this one's done

308
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,960
Eureka

309
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,260
Eureka

310
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,570
Well this looks like Eureka to me

311
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,700
We can just decide last place with this

312
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,310
Since he couldn't do it

313
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,310
Since he couldn't do it

314
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,580
And there's 4 of them in here!

315
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,410
We're competing against this!?

316
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,820
It might be different next time

317
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,220
If she was watching the TV, your daughter would cry

318
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,310
That's enough papa

319
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,720
This is hard to watch papa

320
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,610
'Next is the German mental card game "Neu"

321
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,950
Written on these cards are numbers

322
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,370
50, 10, there's a bunch of them

323
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,970
Everyone gets 3 cards

324
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,610
Then one by one

325
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,010
The played card's numbers

326
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,010
are added together

327
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,550
Whoever's card adds up to 102 or more loses

328
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:44,990
The numbers are 1 to 10, 50, -1, -10, 101, ten types in total

329
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,140
For example

330
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:54,670
Like 3, and 6, we approach 102

331
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,340
Whoever's card adds up to 102 or more loses

332
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,870
You might have noticed this card as well

333
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,420
Now it increases right

334
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,860
When this is played, it goes up to 101

335
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,390
Eh?

336
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,390
Eh?

337
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,120
What I don't get it

338
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,700
No Tanaka, this is 12 right

339
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,060
It's 9

340
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,060
Oh 9

341
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,800
9 plus 101 equals 110

342
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,830
Not in this case, no matter when you play it

343
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:31,370
When this is played,

344
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,370
all the previous numbers are ignored, and it becomes 101

345
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,080
This card ignores everything and sets it to 101

346
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,200
The only ways for the next player to avoid 102 are

347
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,350
Playing a -1 or -10 card, or

348
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:51,530
The can also play one of the 4 Pass cards

349
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,760
It's 3 cards,

350
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,760
it'll end fast then

351
00:15:54,430 --> 00:16:00,310
But when you play a card, you have to draw another from the deck

352
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,230
No matter what you always have 3 cards

353
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,600
Oh the entire time?

354
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,480
Who's first?

355
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,010
I'll go first

356
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,750
Why don't we have Tanaka go first?

357
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,510
Okay 2

358
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,450
9

359
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,880
We're going in that order?

360
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
Don't we always go around like this?

361
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:20,890
Always?

362
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,480
Well it's fine

363
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,490
9

364
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,110
16

365
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,230
21

366
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,920
27

367
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,270
37

368
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,710
47

369
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,810
47 huh?

370
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,340
97

371
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,150
It really went up

372
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,500
It's getting close to 102

373
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,730
You had a card like that...

374
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,150
It's a turn so now it's Matsumoto's turn again

375
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:11,340
Pass the turn and reverse the order

376
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,990
97

377
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,510
You lose!

378
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,920
You just lost

379
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
That doesn't count

380
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,250
That's the end!

381
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,790
It was a joke!

382
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,260
It's a comedian's joke!

383
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,400
What, a comedian can't make jokes!?

384
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,530
You can't make jokes on this show!

385
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:46,210
It's a joke!

386
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,210
You're so loud

387
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:51,080
Despite that, it wasn't a smooth joke

388
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:57,350
Wait a minute, this is kinda, upsetting

389
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:04,830
Gaki no Tsukai is

390
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,830
a show you can make jokes on, is what I heard

391
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,260
That's how it was pitched by the producer Suga

392
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,670
That's how he pitched it in Osaka

393
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,970
That was 30 years ago

394
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,670
Card Game Neu

395
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,670
The loser drops out

396
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,670
Who will win?

397
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,640
Then,

398
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,640
Matsumoto first

399
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,640
May I

400
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,880
Pass?

401
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,730
What's the point?

402
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,480
Who are you passing to?

403
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,440
What's the point in passing?

404
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,890
It's the first turn

405
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,220
You should save this for later

406
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,230
Let my just say

407
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:43,160
I only have Pass cards

408
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,170
Oh all 3?

409
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:47,270
All 3 were these confusing cards

410
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,620
2

411
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,520
Alright 7, 9

412
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:57,330
9, then, 59

413
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,380
I can play this

414
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,820
101

415
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,790
That's fine right?

416
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,790
Right, you can play 101 at any time

417
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,400
Right

418
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,950
Yes yes, since it's 101

419
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,950
It's 101 right now?

420
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,100
It's 101 now

421
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,630
100

422
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,610
100, I see

423
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,600
It's become 100

424
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,980
It's only 1 away, I can only do this

425
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,340
Endo aren't you in danger?

426
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,590
I can only do this

427
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,810
Eh?

428
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,080
What are you doing?

429
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,880
I didn't have anything

430
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,760
I mean, 10 would've been fine too!

431
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,890
You chose the slightly smaller one

432
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,900
Endo is the first to drop out

433
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,900
After this is an unfortunate game

434
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,860
What why?

435
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,840
If I don't have a pass card, I can't pass?

436
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,840
Housei drops out

437
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:08,050
Even worse is Tanaka...

438
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,090
Huh?

439
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,690
Why do you only have 2 cards?

440
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,420
You didn't draw at one point

441
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,660
You definitely didn't draw at one point

442
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,470
It doesn't make sense otherwise

443
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,960
I'll just take the loss

444
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,960
Well yeah

445
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,910
Tanaka makes a huge foul, drops out

446
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,450
Therefore the final round is a Downtown battle

447
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:35,940
A rare match to see

448
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,850
It's the final game

449
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,900
Let's try to avoid another lame ending

450
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,450
This will determine the winner

451
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,630
Can I go first?

452
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,020
8

453
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,670
18

454
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,230
68

455
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,800
Oh it went up

456
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,030
78

457
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,720
78?

458
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
84

459
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,350
You didn't draw!

460
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,860
He's really watching you

461
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,860
There's a really strict judge

462
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,690
84

463
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,250
88

464
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:36,670
If there's only 2 players, pass to the other player

465
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,030
This one

466
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,990
88 right?

467
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,070
98

468
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,270
98...

469
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,190
88

470
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,990
89

471
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,650
Ooh, 89

472
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,720
90

473
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,540
Well,

474
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,070
89

475
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,150
92

476
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,650
Draw!

477
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,150
Is this on purpose?

478
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,030
I can't imagine this to be anything else

479
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,440
97

480
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,910
97, here it is

481
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,960
There it is

482
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,970
Draw!

483
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,110
This is like already

484
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,580
It's over!

485
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,500
In this situation I can play this right?

486
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,120
Yes you can, you can play a double

487
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,140
What is this?

488
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,920
The next player has to play 2 cards

489
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,490
A huge card has been played

490
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,490
There's no 0.5 card

491
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:13,330
You can only play the cards already in your hand

492
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,670
That was a huge card

493
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,310
That was huge

494
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,480
Oh he has something

495
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,870
Incredible!

496
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,390
101

497
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,010
okay okay

498
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,500
Draw

499
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,830
Doesn't he have to play 2?

500
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,300
Can he draw another first?

501
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,990
He can't draw another

502
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,070
Can't he draw then play?

503
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,290
Without drawing he has to play another

504
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:40,070
I want to draw, I want to draw another

505
00:23:36,290 --> 00:24:10,660
Translation - Tekno Typesetting - mattee53

506
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,350
You can't continue with those two cards right?

507
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,180
Well honestly, it's over

508
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,020
Maybe you had a chance if you drew

509
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,460
If I drew another...

510
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,810
So lame...

511
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,670
105

512
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,810
It didn't even matter
