1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,920
Tonight's Gaki No Tsukai - Kushikatsu Tanaka Part 2!

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,880
Rules: Each member will eat 2 skewers from a menu of 34

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,740
The aim is to eat from one store in each of Tokyo's 23 wards

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,040
There's a prize of 10-man yen (100,000) if they can finish

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,760
But the challenge ends if one person gives up

6
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,680
Whoever gives up will have to pay for everything eaten until then

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,380
Last time I had this it was so thick

8
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,680
You guys didn't do that on purpose right?

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,040
We didn't tell them "Make his Yamaimo extra large"

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,340
The Yamaimo and Spring Onion are large menu items, however

11
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,980
Until now, the 5 have cleared 7 stores!

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,820
16 stores left
Will they be able to finish?!

13
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,280
TN: There are some spoilers in here for previous episodes in the Food Marathon Series

14
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,280
subbed by /u/senor_wristband

15
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,980
The 8th store, in Koto ward, Monzen-Nakacho

16
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,300
The Kushikatsu please

17
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,080
Starting from here
Pork, Yamaimo, Eggplant, Beef, Clam, Tsukune

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,260
And here is Ginko Nuts, Quail, Potato, and Nitamago

19
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,240
Tanaka-san has quite the volume there

20
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,940
Quite a large potato

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,880
Certainly is big

22
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,920
Yeah

23
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,560
But if anything, Hamada-san's ...

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,600
Hamada-san's Yamaimo ...

25
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,320
It's making him suspicious

26
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,060
Attention

27
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,840
This is really good, the Tsukune and sauce

28
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,420
Cause it's spicy

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,200
It's more delicious

30
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,000
You just want to look at it and laugh

31
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,460
He wanted to get a good look

32
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,880
This was getting in the way

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,820
He went out of his way to move this

34
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,740
He wanted to see your Yamaimo burden

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,740
It's pretty heavy huh

36
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,920
Yamaimo

37
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,620
The other 4 merrily finish their Kushikatsu

38
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,540
Only Hamada and his Yamaimo are left

39
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,940
The Yamaimo is not diminishing ...

40
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,340
The Yamaimo, I also

41
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,260
You're scared of it

42
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,100
I'm pretty scared of getting it

43
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,460
Yamaimo is scary huh

44
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,080
He did it!

45
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,080
He did it!

46
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,480
Fantastic

47
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,500
Brilliant, so

48
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,680
Next, deciding the 9th menu

49
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,580
So, Hamada-san,

50
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,320
What happened?

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,760
What happened?

52
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,640
Man, this is the worst ...

53
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,240
Spring Onion!

54
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,880
Spring Onion again!

55
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,180
Still it depends on how big it is right?

56
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,380
This store's Spring Onion is the fucking worst!

57
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,580
No that's not true

58
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,200
It's delicious right?

59
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,660
It's so delicious he thinks it's the worst

60
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:23,680
Eggplant

61
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:23,680
Ginko Nut

62
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:23,680
Hanpen

63
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:23,680
Pork

64
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:23,680
Shrimp

65
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:23,680
Spring Onion

66
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:23,720
Hamada's second item is Ginko Nut
Matsumoto and Endo have an easy to eat menu

67
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,680
Let's see Hosei-san's

68
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,540
The colour of his face changed

69
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,500
The colour of his face changed

70
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Yamaimo

71
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,780
Yamaimo has appeared-

72
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,020
BANANA!

73
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,920
Eating that is gonna be something

74
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,860
A nasty combination has appeared

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,540
Yeah

76
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,820
This is harsh

77
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,620
This is dangerous

78
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,100
So Tanaka-san,

79
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,800
Shishito!

80
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,240
You're lucky

81
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,200
Shishito is actually so good

82
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,100
He got a good one

83
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,520
What else?

84
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,140
Oyster!

85
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,460
Again!

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,480
For real?

87
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,280
Are you kidding me

88
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,300
I'm so full damn it

89
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,420
Since he can't eat Oyster, Tanaka draws two cards and gets Monaka and Lotus Root

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,260
Until now, Tanaka has eaten more skewers than anyone
The Oyster alternate rule has created a difficult situation for him

91
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,660
Next, the 9th store
In Edagawa ward, Nishikasai location

92
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,340
Look at Tanaka-san's

93
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,580
Oh boy

94
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,100
That's what I'm saying; Just eat the Oyster!

95
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,060
The Shishito is pretty big

96
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,060
Damn it

97
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,660
Let's go, let's go

98
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,260
Let's go

99
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,220
Shishito

100
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,440
It's too hot, I told you

101
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,800
It's hot?

102
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,860
Look at that

103
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,060
The size of this Banana is really getting to me...

104
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,660
The Banana's Boss Battle levels are off the charts

105
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,760
Seriously?

106
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,940
Was Banana always like this?

107
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,140
Of course

108
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,340
All I eat is friggin Spring Onion

109
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,920
I mean it's not ALL you eat...

110
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:15,120
Hamada with the Spring Onion, Hosei with his Banana and Yamaimo
Their eating speed just won't increase

111
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,200
I think at this point, we need a penalty for being slow

112
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,920
That's quite an idea ...

113
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,960
You're done the Onion, Hamada-san?

114
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,420
Such a bad mood

115
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:38,080
And Hosei finishes his Yamaimo too
Only the BIG SIZE Banana is left

116
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,600
He's not having fun at all...

117
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,620
Yes

118
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,480
He has no joy on his face

119
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,020
Even though he's having a snack

120
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,400
He's tormented

121
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,940
Do you need to make that face

122
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,580
Wouldn't that would make it hard to eat, conversely

123
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,300
I haven't eaten the Banana once yet

124
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,000
He's done!

125
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,260
He's done!

126
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,280
Brilliant!

127
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,220
Immediately after eating, deciding the 10th menu

128
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,220
So Hosei-san,

129
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,780
Beni Shoga (Pickled Ginger)

130
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,680
He got it

131
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,280
That's lucky

132
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,860
Oh he got it!

133
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,000
I did it!!!!

134
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,020
Ginger! Ginger

135
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,400
That's lucky

136
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,980
C'mon one more, one more.  One more!

137
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,060
There it is!

138
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,300
Yamaimo

139
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,240
Yamaimo again

140
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,800
How much Yamaimo are you gonna eat?

141
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,620
How much Yamaimo are you gonna eat?!

142
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:32,720
Garlic

143
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,720
Beni Shoga

144
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,720
Ham Cutlet

145
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,720
Namafu Dengaku

146
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,720
Pork

147
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,720
Pork Shiso

148
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,720
Potato

149
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,720
Quail

150
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,720
Tomato

151
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,720
Yamaimo

152
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:32,760
This time, Hosei is on his 4th Yamaimo skewer

153
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,820
We need a few changes to the rules

154
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,240
Yeah exactly

155
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,520
Maybe, you pick one skewer?

156
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,980
You get to choose one skewer

157
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,460
What kind of face is that?

158
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,500
The other one is from the cards

159
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Ah, so we get to choose then?

160
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,280
Yeah one of them

161
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,220
One of them

162
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,700
What should we do after this one?

163
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,020
We'll go with Fujiwara's theory at the next one

164
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,480
We'll go with that

165
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,800
Let's try that

166
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,880
Coming up with a new rule, they arrive at the 10th store
In Katsushika ward, Shin Koiwa store

167
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,500
That's a good one

168
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,900
Beni Shoga

169
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,320
That's a great one

170
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,360
Beni Shoga is refreshing

171
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,460
This is the one I wanted most

172
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,880
I can go for the Beni Shoga

173
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,640
Beni Shoga is good, it's kind of refreshing

174
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,280
So you're gonna eat the Beni Shoga before the Yamaimo?

175
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,700
What else would I do?

176
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,020
What else would you do?

177
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,560
You could alternate bites

178
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,100
No way, I gotta eat the good one first

179
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,840
The other 4 also seem to be reaching their stomach's limits

180
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,220
But they manage to finish

181
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,560
Oh you finished, Hamada-san, Tanaka-san, Endo-san

182
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,980
It was fast

183
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,540
You're still slow

184
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,820
It's hard to eat?

185
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,540
Damn, how is it?

186
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,620
How is your 4th Yamaimo of the day?

187
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,980
That's gotta be 10 cm at least

188
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,660
The inside of your mouth looks rotten

189
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,560
It's like he's grating yam in there

190
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,640
It's like he's grating yam, in his mouth

191
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,000
He's done!

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,160
Fabulous

193
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,560
So next we're going to Adachi ward, the Adachi location,

194
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,480
Should we change the rules?

195
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,540
Can we?

196
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,180
What we said earlier?

197
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,520
Starting now, a new rule takes effect

198
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,720
Everyone will pick one item, and the other will be decided by card like before

199
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,900
Matsumoto-san,

200
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,740
C'mon Yamaimo

201
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,120
He got Spring Onion

202
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,160
He got it!

203
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,320
Spring Onion, finally

204
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,720
Finally

205
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,420
Everyone got it

206
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,700
This is really something

207
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,320
Hosei-san's draw?

208
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,840
Please

209
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
Banana!

210
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,940
Great!

211
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,840
Banana is great

212
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,820
Well done!

213
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,620
Well done!

214
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,800
You've got a curse for Banana and Yamaimo

215
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,200
Banana

216
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,200
Beni Shoga

217
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,200
Cheese

218
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,200
Clam

219
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,200
Clam

220
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,200
Mochi

221
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,200
Namafu Dengaku

222
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,200
Shishito

223
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,200
Shrimp

224
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,200
Spring Onion

225
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,280
Hosei is on his 3rd Banana of the day

226
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,320
I've just been eaten Yamaimo and Banana the whole time

227
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,180
That's the impression we have

228
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,400
Yeah

229
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,440
How are your stomachs?

230
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,940
They're fucking full of course

231
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,940
You're all 10/10?

232
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,860
It's not about the 10/10

233
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,760
I'm tired

234
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,780
Tired?

235
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,780
Yeah that's true

236
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm tired from the excitement too

237
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,600
But it's not like we can't eat

238
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:42,620
Eating a bit, they head to the next store
The repetition causes tiredness, and fullness to build up

239
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,880
With heavy steps, they head into the Ayase Station store, in Adachi ward

240
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,300
Hosei-san, you're starting with the Banana?

241
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,040
Oh really

242
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,260
Conversely?

243
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,300
Building pain resistance

244
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,760
Building resistance

245
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,880
My, my,

246
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,400
Your body

247
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,060
My body is building resistance

248
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,220
Tanaka-san, you're quick

249
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,060
The shrimp is done

250
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,540
Hamada-san is done?

251
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,320
The Mochi is a lot, right?

252
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,800
Yeah Mochi is, yeah

253
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,300
This bastard is really something

254
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,820
It sure is

255
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,100
Yeah

256
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,260
Oh, you're already done

257
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,260
That was fast

258
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,980
Matsumoto-san, maybe this time the Onion will go together?

259
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,580
There's the heat to deal with too

260
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,700
Yeah the heat too

261
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,180
The weight too

262
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,620
Pain in the ass

263
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,180
Yup

264
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:57,040
Eat the BIG SIZE Spring Onion for the first time, he manages to finish

265
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,000
Deciding again using a new rule

266
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,160
Out of 3 cards, pick 2 you want to eat

267
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,880
Starting from Matsumoto-san?

268
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,320
Yeah OK

269
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,540
Cheese

270
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,540
Cheese

271
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,420
OKAYYYYY!

272
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,260
If the next one is good too, I'm taking that and this

273
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,420
That's a good one

274
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,520
Cheese

275
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,520
Pollock Roe

276
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,360
Isn't this enough?

277
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,500
This is pretty good

278
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,180
Tsukune
They're all winners

279
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,180
Cheese

280
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,180
Pollock Roe

281
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,180
Tsukune

282
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,100
All winners

283
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,260
What will you choose?

284
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,960
That is...

285
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,700
Remove one then

286
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,100
I guess, Tsukune is...

287
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,340
I'll pass on that

288
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,040
OK, so Matsumoto-san has Pollock Roe and Cheese

289
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,740
Let's move on

290
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,160
Hosei-san,

291
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,600
I'm so lucky

292
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,160
Banana?

293
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,400
First is Banana?

294
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,380
Well, there's still 2 more left

295
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,880
Put Banana aside,

296
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,960
Ah, Onion!

297
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,300
No way!

298
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,300
You're amazing

299
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,640
and Oyster!

300
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,520
And now Oyster!

301
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,140
That's it then,

302
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,720
That's all you can eat!

303
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,980
MIRACLE

304
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,320
Cause you can't have that one

305
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,480
This is a miracle!

306
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,600
You're getting rid of that one

307
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,760
You have to get rid of that one

308
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,260
Yeah this is impossible for me

309
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,920
There's no helping it

310
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,400
Onion...

311
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,800
Onion, and ...

312
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,040
Damn, that is tough

313
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,520
So many Bananas

314
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Banana

315
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Cheese

316
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Hanpen

317
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Liver Katsu

318
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Lotus Root

319
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Mochi

320
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Onion

321
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Pollock Roe

322
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Shrimp

323
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Somehow, now Hosei is on his way to the 4th Banana of the day

324
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Tomato

325
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,880
I'm in danger

326
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,880
(chuckles)

327
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,660
Seriously, like,

328
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,340
A little dangerous

329
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,680
It's Bad

330
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,980
I guess so, after all

331
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,800
No way you're OK with Oyster now?

332
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
I'm going to do my best

333
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,240
If I work hard now,
God will reward me for next time

334
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,520
give up

335
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,520
Hosei has given up twice 2 previous episodes

336
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:50,400
But this time, persevering with words of hope,
he wants his prayer to rescue him

337
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,040
Your face looks insane

338
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,720
But I'm gonna work hard

339
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,300
Seriously, I'm gonna do my best

340
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,860
Just this bit

341
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,020
It makes you mad, right?

342
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,740
If I can past this point, I think there's something waiting for me

343
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,100
What?

344
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,300
God, at the next place, will rew-

345
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,040
Ahh great, you go do that then

346
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,880
The 12th store, in Kita Ward, Oji location

347
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,580
This place is so different

348
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,620
Lemme see

349
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,260
Ahh, a quiet voice is nice

350
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,220
Are you kidding me with this?

351
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,220
Look how different the sizes are!

352
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,260
That one, that's no good

353
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,240
I can't eat this!

354
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,840
Banana

355
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,840
Onion

356
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,220
I'm comparing them, look!

357
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,840
Wiener

358
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,840
Let's not compare using a wiener, it'll get tiring

359
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,360
But I guess I can't say anything

360
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,960
There's also a time limit to consider,

361
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
Last time,

362
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,800
Hamada-san

363
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,800
Yes, at Ikinari Steak

364
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,840
That's what got him

365
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,720
Heavy!

366
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,520
Is it quite heavy?

367
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,740
It's so friggin heavy

368
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,580
This is like a club

369
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,100
Cheese

370
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,280
Oh yeah, compared to that onion this goes right in

371
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,880
Ah, the cheese?
Indeed, the cheese

372
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,240
Hamada-san, you're finished one?

373
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,060
Liver Cutlet            Tomato

374
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,700
Tanaka-san too?

375
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,900
This atmosphere, it's like he's being made to reflect on his mistakes,

376
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,120
Onion

377
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,120
Has the taste changed?

378
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,760
Uwahh ... So heavy

379
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,500
That's how big the onion is?

380
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,740
Amazing

381
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,440
How's that Onion, Hosei-san?

382
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,780
If we were sharing a table I'd hate that

383
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,580
this kind of person ahead of me

384
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,000
"Why did you order it then?"

385
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,220
Ah, Matsumoto-san is finished

386
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,680
Everyone except Hosei-san

387
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,560
Still has two left

388
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,840
You guys are so fast

389
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,580
Onion has decreased a lot

390
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,800
Decreased for the first time in a while?

391
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,240
That's great, Hosei-san

392
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,020
OH he went for it

393
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,300
OK, the Onion is finished

394
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,860
Onion, finished

395
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,100
Only Banana left

396
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,660
Kushikatsu Tanaka, store number 12
Only Hosei's Banana is left

397
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,380
He gave up

398
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,420
I thought he was gonna finish it

399
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,660
Amazing

400
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,360
He stopped though

401
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,240
But still,

402
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,320
Yup,

403
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,180
It's the last bites

404
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,340
This is the time to persevere

405
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,120
And he bit it

406
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,540
He bit it

407
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,560
It felt like you were about to swallow the whole thing

408
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,300
He still just bit it

409
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,980
He did it!

410
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,020
He did it!

411
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,060
Amazing

412
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:14,300
For the next menu, Fujiwara will draw 10 cards at random
The winner of Janken will then choose two cards

413
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,880
Only good stuff

414
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,520
Please

415
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,920
Yeah seriously

416
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,380
Tsukune

417
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,580
OK, OK,

418
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,580
OK, OK,

419
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,580
OK, OK,

420
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,540
Ginko Nuts

421
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,360
That's not bad

422
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,280
Not bad, not bad

423
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,560
Good

424
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,100
Monaka

425
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,580
Shrimp!

426
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,560
Not bad

427
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,560
Not bad

428
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,840
This kind of stuff

429
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,120
Asparagus!

430
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,220
Fujiwara's on a roll

431
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,360
Yeah

432
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,320
Cookies and Cream

433
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,040
Ah! Finally!

434
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,040
Finally!

435
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,380
The first time?

436
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,140
Next one?

437
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,620
Shitake

438
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,420
Not bad at all

439
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,640
Not bad

440
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,140
Lotus Root

441
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,600
Lotus Root?

442
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,840
That's good

443
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,660
Here I go

444
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,100
Please be good

445
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,160
Pork

446
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,320
A good one

447
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,180
Good, isn't it?

448
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,240
Beni Shoga

449
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,820
This is the only one we're unsure of,

450
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,900
Yup

451
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,100
Yup, these cards are not bad

452
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,680
I can go for these

453
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,960
You can definitely finish these

454
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,500
Yup

455
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,080
Yup we can

456
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Asparagus

457
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Beni Shoga

458
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Cookies and Cream

459
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Ginko Nut

460
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Lotus Root

461
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Monaka

462
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Pork

463
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Shitake

464
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Shrimp

465
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Tsukune

466
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:14,340
They get to play Janken and choose from here
But, that man will not play fair...

467
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,460
First is rock, janken hoi

468
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,160
Hosei changes to Scissors at the last second

469
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,400
This definitely not allowed

470
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,860
Right?

471
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,480
Wait a second please

472
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,600
Why, what's wrong with you?

473
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,400
I'm so full,

474
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,160
Hold on, us 4 will go now

475
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,960
What do you mean?

476
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,780
Just now,

477
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,900
Will be taken as a loss

478
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,500
It's just not right

479
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,320
Here, everyone but Hosei will choose their favourite stuff before him

480
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:56,940
Asparagus

481
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:56,940
Beni Shoga

482
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:56,940
Cookies and Cream

483
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:56,940
Ginko Nuts

484
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:56,940
Lotus Root

485
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:56,940
Monaka

486
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:56,940
Pork

487
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:56,940
Shitake

488
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:56,940
Shrimp

489
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:56,940
Tsukne

490
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:56,500
Leftover for Hosei, is the Monaka and the Cookies & Cream

491
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,280
You have 2 sweet ones

492
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,800
Are you kidding me?!

493
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,040
But this is definitely good

494
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,280
Cause it's a sweet

495
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,780
The size is not that large

496
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,880
Yeah exactly

497
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,120
So then they head to the 13th store,
Itabashi Ward, Tobu Nerima location

498
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,420
Excuse me,

499
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,380
Tsukune, Pork, Cookies and Cream, Shitake, Lotus Root, and Asparagus

500
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,660
The Cookie and Cream...

501
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,260
Huge!

502
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,340
Huge!

503
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,320
The thickness, again...

504
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,820
Oh yeah

505
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,580
You got an exceptional one

506
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,920
So heavy

507
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,420
The Monaka was a failure too

508
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,820
This guy is dangerous

509
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,240
This is dangerous

510
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,520
Should I start with the Cookie and Cream?

511
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,040
Why did you "Uwahh"?

512
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,900
How is that?

513
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,380
It's completely different than what I expected

514
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,840
It's all gooey

515
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,180
It's melted?

516
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,940
And Matsumoto-san too, with that,

517
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,700
Making no progress

518
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,860
Making no progress, yes

519
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,300
There's also the question of which to eat first

520
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,240
It's pretty hot huh

521
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,680
Ohhhh I see

522
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,820
Pork

523
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,760
That's quite something, isn't it Hosei-san?

524
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,940
I can smell the sweetness

525
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,420
It has a sweet smell

526
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,100
It's a nice aroma

527
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,400
Endo is eating it like it's nothing

528
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,500
Yes I still can

529
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,280
You won the Janken after all

530
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,420
He dropped it

531
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,220
This is dangerous

532
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,260
This is dangerous

533
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,960
This is dangerous

534
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,200
This is dangerous

535
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,060
Get out the stopwatch

536
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,360
Should we get the stopwatch?

537
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,340
No way,

538
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,120
Should, should we time this?

539
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,380
The Cookie & Cream got him

540
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,660
Alright, I gotta persevere

541
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,160
If you don't finish that Shitake,

542
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,580
Yup

543
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,360
That's right

544
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,960
Start the timer, after I'm done?

545
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,900
How many minutes?

546
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,860
3 minutes

547
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,480
Let's go with 3 minutes?

548
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,540
OK, 3 minutes

549
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,360
After you finish the Shitake,

550
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,280
3 minutes

551
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,720
He can eat it right now too right?

552
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,560
Yeah this is his chance-time

553
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,960
3 minutes-

554
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,640
He smelled the Monaka and just put it down

555
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,780
We thought Matsumoto-san might end up in trouble

556
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,280
The Shitake is taking a long time here

557
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,160
What the hell is this?

558
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,200
Maybe don't say "What the hell is this?"

559
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,040
"What the hell is this?" while holding Monaka

560
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,120
If, if you get past here,

561
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,280
Yeah

562
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,660
You might get good cards,

563
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,200
Exactly

564
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,440
The future right?

565
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,780
You might have a good future

566
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,920
Here I go,

567
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,300
OK, after he's done eating,

568
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,300
Your 3 minutes begin

569
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,100
First the Monaka

570
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,120
This is quite a lot

571
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,820
Pretty, Hamada-san did you find this one pretty tough?

572
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,400
Yeah this one was tough

573
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,480
Yeah it was a big portion

574
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,280
He is not moving an inch

575
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,000
Hosei-san?

576
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,340
Hosei-san?

577
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,860
He's like a statue

578
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,060
Maybe switch to the Cookie & Cream?

579
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,400
Yeah you're right

580
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,340
Switch to that one

581
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,200
It's good to change up the flavours

582
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,200
He removed the skewer

583
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,580
He thinks doing this will help him

584
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,720
What, what the hell are you doing?

585
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,800
That-

586
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,260
Don't just push it forward

587
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,760
He just wanted to do that

588
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,700
Just wanted to squish it

589
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,680
Time left,

590
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,000
Time left is,

591
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,880
now 1 minute

592
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,860
Here he goes

593
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,980
Are you gonna eat it?

594
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,180
Just one is good

595
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,360
Just gobble them up quickly

596
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,600
He's not eating it after all

597
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,540
What are you trying to do

598
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,940
What are you squishing them for?

599
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,660
Could we see a miracle occur?

600
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,480
He's setting himself up for a cool move

601
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,020
This preparation...

602
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,600
Yama-chan, Yama-chan it takes time to swallow it too,

603
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,540
Almost out of time

604
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,600
He's going for it

605
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,240
He barely took a bite

606
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,880
You're taking bites at this point?

607
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,360
Time's up!

608
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,020
That's game over

609
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,060
The bill this time,

610
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:48,560
Hosei-san will have to pay 22,739 yen ($204 USD)

611
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,440
I guess so

612
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,900
Unfortunately, the challenge was not completed

613
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,500
You absolutely can't eat?

614
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,300
Impossible,

615
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,280
In fact, it was impossible at the last store too

616
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,020
Amazing you made it here then

617
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,880
Amazing I made it, honestly
