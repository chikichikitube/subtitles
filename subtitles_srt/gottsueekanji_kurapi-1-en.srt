00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,820
Kurapi

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,950
Hey Kurapi...

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,250
Yes?

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,590
I'm hungry, what do you want to eat?

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,290
Ryoko-chan, what do you want to eat?

7
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,290
I don't know.

8
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,660
Kurapi...

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,560
doesn't know either!

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,240
Kurapi!

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,770
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,010
You said you had to work today.

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,010
Hey, Kurapi, what's with this woman?

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,780
What's with THIS woman?

15
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,780
I'm Kurapi's girlfriend.

16
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,190
Whad did you just say?!

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,750
So..

18
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,320
Are you two-timing me?

19
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,320
No..

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:42,890
Huh?!

21
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,060
Two-timing?
- I can't believe it!

22
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,130
You have a beautiful girlfriend like me.

23
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,160
Why do you have to date a woman like this?

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,930
What do you mean?

25
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,600
What do you..

26
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,530
Never mind.

27
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,770
I'll give you to this woman, since you are the worst man!

28
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,510
I'll give him to you since he is so ugly!

29
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,810
What are you saying?

30
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,210
He doesn't even think he is ugly!

31
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,380
He's always like

32
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,680
"I'm tired."

33
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,280
"My head hurts."

34
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,590
"My stomach hurts."

35
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,160
You work only 10 days a month!

36
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,820
Don't even pretend like you are sick!

37
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,760
You purchased a cellphone.

38
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,660
No one even calls you!

39
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,060
You can have him!

40
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,530
Your face and style are old fashioned!

41
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,600
I don't need him!

42
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,810
Judgment.

43
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,550
I did it!

44
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,050
Take him!

45
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,090
I don't need him!

46
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,790
I don't!

47
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,480
You guys are rude!

48
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,920
What's with the noise!

49
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,120
Stand up, morons!

50
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,190
I'm crying for Kurano.

51
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,190
You said, "He only works 10 days a month."

52
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,320
I'm offended!

53
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,160
How do you know?

54
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,930
Okamoto-san told me earlier.

55
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,400
You were so excited that you won!

56
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,940
What about my mouth...

57
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,410
Your mouth is fine, just rinse it out well.
