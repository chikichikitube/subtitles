00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,970

00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,250
Atsu Atsu...ahhh

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,250
wait a second, wait a second...

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,920
this is awful...

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,760
AHHHHH

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,430
How is it?

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,580
Umm...what do you mean by how...

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,870
I really want to catch up Hamada

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,060
I just now thought that I can do it

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,960
But when I actually try it...

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,080
it turns out to be quite difficult

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,640
Well yeah, it was awful just now...

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,800
So nervous,

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,200
I was terrified just now

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,900
Terrified?

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,780
Think about it...his song sold for double millions

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,020
Well yeah, so he's used to be on stage

19
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,220
I never sold any song

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,300
The vitality that Hamada showed us in Demae-can's CM,

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,760
urges Matsumoto to deeply admire him

22
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,000
While Hamada is not here,

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,880
Demae-can's studio set has been rebuilt,

24
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,010
and Matsumoto challenges himself to catch up Hamada

25
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,790
however things are never easy...

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,180
It really is difficult isn't it

27
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,110
Yeah it definitely is difficult

28
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,620
Let's try it one more time?

29
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,040
We'll pay full attention to watch it

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,170
He sure is warmed up now

31
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,170
Let's go

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,850
My face is going numb

33
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,850
Just relax, take it easy

34
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,270
De De Demae-can, Demae ga sui sui suiii

35
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,850
Ah no, wait a second

36
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,950
My hand can't help from becoming like this

37
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,040
Because I'm terrified

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,630
It's like this, like this right?

39
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,480
Sweat is coming out from a different gland

40
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,240
from a different sweat gland?

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,420
Like a subway...it's from a different place

42
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,500
Oh really...

43
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,780
Sleep well

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,660
I'll be right back

45
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,550
Should we rewatch Hamadan-san's CM?

46
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,940
Let's watch it again

47
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,780
and make sure everything is good

48
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,210
Housei suggests to rewatch the CM

49
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,720
and observe Hamada's reaction and movement

50
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:32,940
But I've actually watched many times on YouTube already

51
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,850
De De Demae-can

52
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,600

Warm, warm, delivered to you warmly

54
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Demae ga sui sui suiii

55
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,540
De De Demae-can

56
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,890
Demae ga sui sui suiii

57
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,000
I want to hear your true opinions

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,570
Excuse me...

59
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:53,990
Yes

60
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,570
The dance is completely different

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,990
He's clearly dancing in Box steps

62
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,490
Oh I see, I see

63
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,180
Matsumoto-san's steps are somehow wobbly

64
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,020
Please pay attention to the steps

65
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,100
His legs are clearly stepping

66
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,160
Yeah it is

67
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,370
Although it's hard to notice

68
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,320
he's definitely doing those steps

69
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,950
Yeah that's clearly box steps

70
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,100
because he's doing box steps

71
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,190
so the upper body becomes stable

72
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,970
Yeah

73
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,050
Housei is now lecturing Matsumoto about Box steps

74
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,110
Try it like this, with rhythm

75
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,260
Oh I see, so like this

76
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,340
As if you're going for delivery right now

77
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,720
Oh I get it, I get it

78
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,970
This cultivates your emotions as well

79
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,380
Feels like you're delivering on a motorbike

80
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,180
Exactly, just like a delivery

81
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,700
This seems to be good now isn't it

82
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,350
Remember your rhythm

83
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,540
Music start!

84
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,800
His face is different

85
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,730
De De Demae-can, Demae ga sui sui suiii

86
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,910
Wait a moment, it's completely different

87
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,370
What happened?

88
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,370
Box steps took all my attention

89
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,770
Your face also went numb

90
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,690
I'm feeling even more terrified now

91
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,510
This is no way going to surpass Hamada

92
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,740
Yes, you're right, that's for sure

93
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,250
To be honest, he looks scary sometimes right?

94
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,480
But that face was never shown in Demae-can's CM

95
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,780
He's really awesome isn't he!

96
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,870
Yeah he's awesome

97
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,950
At the same time

98
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,910
Why?

99
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,810
Why are there 2 syrup and 2 milk

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,580
Having 2 is not necessary is it

101
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,300
You're not adding anything to it?

102
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,770
No, I can't drink it

103
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,630
Try to drink it man

104
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,010
Don't be picky

105
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,130
Are you interested in anything now?

106
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,280
Not at all recently

107
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,280
You can't go anywhere

108
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,980
I didn't even eat outside these months

109
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,600
What do you think?

110
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,610
What could I do?

111
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,460
Well...

112
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,370
While watching it,

113
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,440
I think appearance is important too

114
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,800
It's not the official jacket

115
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,570
and the mic is also different

116
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,190
Yeah your right, this is just prepared by our staffs

117
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,380
Can I confirm with Hamada's manager?

118
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,910
Having the official jacket makes a difference

119
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,910
Please excuse me...

120
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,910
I feel sorry...

121
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,640
I really underestimated it

122
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,770
I thought I can do it

123
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,820
Hands are like this?

124
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,270
But it becomes like this

125
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,440
Because Ueki-san did it like this

126
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,990
Ueki-san is like this

127
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,030
But Demae-can is delivery so it's like this

128
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,290
and this concept is not in my mind

129
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,350
Come on

130
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,510
I found it!

131
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,600
It's official!

132
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,590
It's really Demae-can

133
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,330
And the mic is completely different isn't it

134
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,450
Yeah completely different

135
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:15,050
Wow, it's just...even the fabric feels much better

136
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,880
yeah

137
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,560
fabric is completely different

138
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,750
Feels like silk

139
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,250
It's official

140
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,590
It's the one that Hamada wore

141
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,180
and the mic he used

142
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,490
yeah, awesome

143
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,690
please take the mic too

144
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,520
It's completely different, even your face is different

145
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,110
I can do it!

146
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,370
I can feel the shine coming to me

147
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,740
Yeah, you definitely can do it now

148
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,930
Ok, I feel like it now!

149
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:41,820
Wait a moment

150
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,240
I've heard another important information

151
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,140
The box step Hamada did

152
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,740
it was actually not in the scenario

153
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,130
Hamada-san improvised the steps on stage

154
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,210
How awesome can he be!!

155
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,350
Really?

156
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,960
How awesome is he!

157
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,580
Can I even surpass him?

158
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,570
It's those steps that made it feels like delivering

159
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,290
What an amazing idea

160
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,580
Well, just try your best

161
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,010
The appearance is much better

162
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,460
Music start!

163
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,280
Looks much better than last time

164
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,270
It's even worse isn't it?

165
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,090
It's becoming even worse

166
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,910
Your face becomes terrified at the moment it starts

167
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,180
Like Zabunguru's Kato

168
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,670
Like feeling struggled

169
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,660
I'm much more struggled here

170
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,550
Sorry Tanaka

171
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:45,260
I feel really sorry for bothering you guys

172
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,970
No we're good, we want you to surpass him

173
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,180
You're not going outside at all right?

174
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,090
Yeah, so you guys are definitely better

175
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,140
we're being recognized by the public

176
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,650
people would know that "he's at that shop"

177
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,980
and if that shop turns out to be in trouble

178
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,100
people would say "he's also there"

179
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,030
well, you guys won't understand

180
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,260
it's definitely better

181
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:09,840
Excuse me Hamada-san

182
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,690
Yes?

183
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,520
Sorry for being a Senpai like this

184
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,030
But the appearance and atmosphere has changed

185
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,200
What about doing it with Hamada's voice?

186
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,940
So basically lip-sync

187
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,770
Singing out loud is definitely a pressure

188
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,020
If there's no need to sing anymore

189
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,100
then I can focus on the movements

190
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,150
Yeah, you can do it this time

191
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,220
There's no need to sing, just focus

192
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,410
Please try again, music start!

193
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,740
De De Demae-can

194
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,850
Demae ga sui sui suiii

195
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,700
Ah my hand becomes like this again

196
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,460
Ahhh

197
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,800
It's so difficult

198
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
It's really difficult

199
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,590
Also because bits of chicken meat is stuck in my inner teeth

200
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,060
Please take it out then

201
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,180
So it makes you into that face?

202
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,100
Yeah

203
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,390
Hamada-san

204
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,270
you're going home right?

205
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,270
Ah, yeah

206
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,800
Excuse me Hamada-san (15 minutes before)

207
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,940
Matsumoto-san says he want to be like Hamada-san in Demae-can CM

208
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,250
But it's not going smoothly

209
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,410
He's still making fun of me

210
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,570
Anyway please go help out Matsumoto-san

211
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,570
No it's none of my business

212
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,570
He took it upon himself to do it right?

213
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,040
It's none of my business, what are you talking about

214
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,380
Get out of my way

215
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,220
Can you stop please?

216
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,980
Hello, Hamada-san

217
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,120
How is it over there

218
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,520
They're still working hard

219
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,540
Ok, I got it

220
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,840
Wait, Hamada-san

221
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,560
We're together since primary school

222
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,870
Please take care of Hamada-san everyone

223
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,800
Excuse me,

224
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
can I change the destination?

225
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,920
Sure, change to where?

226
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,690
This is such a shitty episode

227
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,440
let's change it to god episode

228
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,840
people are gonna say it's shitty on the net

229
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,670
No don't think about it, please don't give up

230
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,970
our difference in level as a combi is apparent

231
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,750
When you think of Hamada-san

232
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,750
Rosary comes to mind right?

233
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,700
You're not wearing any rosary right?

234
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,060
Never saw you wear any rosary

235
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,680
Betting on the very last hope

236
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,450
Tanaka suggests to wear rosary

237
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,630
which is like Hamada's trademark

238
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,590
This really looks like Hamada

239
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,880
We can feel it

240
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,310
Sometimes he wears so much that it becomes like abacus

241
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,590
Yeah, it really looks like Hamada now

242
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,500
Wow, that's awesome!

243
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,720
It's Hamada if just looking at the hand

244
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,300
Wearing it already makes me feel secure

245
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,220
Like being wrapped up by Hamada

246
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,730
Let's try again

247
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,440
His face really changed

248
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,570
He changed at the moment he wears it

249
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,770
His face looks completely different

250
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,390
De De Demae-can

251
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,680
Demae ga sui sui suiii

252
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,960
Warm, warm, delivered to you warmly

253
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,270
Demae ga sui sui suiii

254
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,620
How is it?

255
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,820
Isn't he wearing too much?

256
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,210
There's too much rosary

257
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,050
Makes me feel like what CM is it

258
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,650
Yeah you're right

259
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,940
It feels really heavy

260
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,810
Let's confirm again about the rosary

261
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,510
But I successful removed the chicken meat

262
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,950
He's not wearing rosary

263
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,650
He's not wearing rosary at all

264
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,240
I thought it's strange too

265
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,830
Keep making noise kasha-kasha

266
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,790
This is really my mistake

267
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,980
This just came to my mind when talking about Hamada

268
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,780
Wait...wait...can you take a photo for me?

269
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,470
Well, yeah, well, he really is showing a good facial expression

270
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,380
It's really a good facial expression

271
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,190
That face is never shown on TV shows

272
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,240
Yeah, he makes faces separately

273
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,910
And that hits Dentsu and Hakuhodo's heart (CM company)

274
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,870
Yeah, that is really a technique

275
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,600
Yeah, it's not even in our mind to do so

276
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,250
-Hey     -Good morning

277
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,250
Hey good morning

278
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,210
Hamada is now here at Nippon Television

279
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,760
What a deep double eyelid

280
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,700
I want to watch it objectively

281
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,910
Can you guys do it for me?

282
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,410
I want to watch it

283
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,850
Oh I see, to watch it objectively

284
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,190
Well, Endo can you do it?

285
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,600
Are you serious?

286
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,650
That was awful, really awful

287
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,160
It's not feeling vibrant

288
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,830
Not vibrant, and his legs are not moving

289
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,660
Did my legs not move?

290
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,560
The face is also terrified

291
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,610
Really?

292
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,880
Tanaka's challenge

293
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,450
Remember your face

294
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,090
Stop! Enough, enough, it's enough

295
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,440
It's enough, let's stop, that's enough

296
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:28,750
You look like the face of an armor

297
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,840
with a turned-up chin

298
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,830
Can barely watch it

299
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,960
Yeah, you're right

300
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,280
You're trying too hard to open your mouth

301
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,200
Although Matsumoto watched the 3 member's performance,

302
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,960
however, he still can't find a way to be like Hamada

303
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,060
Wait, wait, wait

304
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,440
Sorry, I though I can do it

305
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,500
This is really quite difficult

306
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,220
Ahh, I really think I can't make it

307
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,880
I'm really struggling

308
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,550
I wonder if there's any way

309
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,720
Sleep well

310
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,920
I'll be right back

311
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:56,340
Hamada heads to the studio with the 4 members there waiting

312
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,740
By having an appearance like Hamada

313
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,450
I thought it's definitely going to work

314
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,450
Well, you're right

315
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,740
our appearance is different

316
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,740
Yeah, so excuse me

317
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,310
Give me a second

318
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,770
Well yeah, you're probably right

319
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,500
Is there anything useful though?

320
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,740
I found it!!

321
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,700
Wow, that's really useful

322
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,600
Wow, that's awesome

323
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,160
It's really awesome

324
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,210
Amazing (face mask & wig)

325
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,570
it looks like Hamada from the back

326
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,290
He looks like this from the back of the stage

327
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,710
This is how Kouhai sees Hamada

328
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,090
It looks just like Hamada

329
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,450
and moving like this

330
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,840
"Hey, what are you talking about!"

331
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,770
Wearing the face mask and wig

332
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,070
can Matsumoto be like his admire Hamada-san

333
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,740
Okay, music start!

334
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,380
How is it?

335
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,790
How is it?

336
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,390
Well, it's not bad...but...

337
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,230
Why? why? why?

338
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,910
The facial expression never changes

339
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,840
I see

340
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,470
That smile is not on the face mask

341
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,010
Yeah, it's not

342
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:34,360
Hamada actually changed his facial expression for 8 times, just within those few seconds

343
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,420
Having only one face is not enough

344
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,070
Yeah, you're right

345
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,350
I really underestimated it

346
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,220
What an amazing partner

347
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,660
I really hoped we can help more

348
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,830
Hamada-san is coming

349
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,870
I really hoped we can help more

350
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,720
Hamada-san is coming

351
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,600

357
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,760
Yama-chan,

358
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,230
are you having a balanced diet?

359
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,030
Have you been eating vegetables?

360
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,570
For the upcoming season,

361
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,700
have hotpot with your family

362
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,920
and eat a lot of vegetables

363
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,600
Endo,

364
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,450
are you sleeping well?

365
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,120
The size of your pillow is not fit right?

366
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,200
If the pillow is too high,

367
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,730
that harms the quality of your sleep

368
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,720
your head is gonna hurt again

369
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,320
Tanaka,

370
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,750
this year's summer is really hot isn't it?

371
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,730
Is it not hot?

372
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,680
Matsumoto,

373
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,770
have you visited the medical examination yet?

374
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,410
if I don't ask you to go,

375
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,290
no one else will do it for you right?

376
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,590
Being healthy is the first priority

377
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,020
Well training yourself is good,

378
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,730
but remember to check your body regularly

379
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,520
It's not just only your body anymore right?

How is it Tanaka?

387
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,680
It's really touching

388
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,320
Matsumoto?

389
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,210
What an awesome partner I have, there's nothing else for me to say

390
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,810
Are you accepting any disciples?

391
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,780
No I'm not though

392
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,180
Thank you so much

393
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,370
I'm leaving, thank you!!

394
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,630
Thank you for your work!

395
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,010
See you

396
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,340
(Director) Okay!

397
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,800
The first time he sings was awful isn't it?

398
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,880
The first time he sings was awful right?

399
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,430
No, no

400
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,530
I did it on purpose to be like you guys

401
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,660
Oh so that's it, I see

402
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,430
Anyway, can you stop mocking me on this?

403
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,270
I'm really suffering!

404
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,570
I came in earlier than you guys and took a lot of scenes!

405
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,560
Good for you, good for you

406
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,250
Hamada actually arrived 2 hours earlier than others,

407
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,300
and have been taking scenes and rehearsals

408
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,120
And this surprising guest was here during the filming

409
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,530
(Imada Kouji) Hello Hamada-san, what are you doing here?

410
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,310
It's Gaki with Demae-can

411
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,450
You wanna do it?

412
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,270
May I? For such a big business

413
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:50,440
I'm just asking you, are you using here too

414
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,390
Well, I do want to do such a big business though

415
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,320
Thank you and see you
