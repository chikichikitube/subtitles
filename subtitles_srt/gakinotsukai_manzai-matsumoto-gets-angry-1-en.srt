Matsumoto Gets Angry

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,020
You know, there are times when I get angry.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,690
A lot.
- Like what?

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,960
I was driving. There was this narrow road.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,460
Of course I didn't even want
to go that way, but I had to

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,970
An older lady and a kid were walking there.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,340
The kid was dragging a toy behind.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,810
The lady looked at it as if
it was cute or something.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,780
In the middle of the road!

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,090
What were they thinking!
- Well, maybe they just didn't notice you.

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,320
They didn't notice me at
all! So here's the question.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,930
What would you do, as the
person behind the wheel?

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,670
Honk the horn.
- Precisely.

14
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,570
Not too loud.
- That was a good answer!

15
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:02,010
I did so. I did it as soft as I could.

16
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:10,880
But you know, horns are always loud.
It's not about how soft you press it.

17
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,920
It's about the length of the honk!

18
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,290
So the lady was eyeing me.

19
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,100
I don't think she had a face like that.

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,530
I was like "Give me a break,
this isn't a walkway".

21
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,640
But I'm an adult, I don't get mad over
that like I would have in the past.

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,010
I rolled down the window and asked "What?".

23
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:39,350
The lady screamed "You startled the kid!".

24
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,830
So what happened next?
I was still talking to the lady.

25
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:05,540
Then, I don't know where the hell he came from, an old man with a huge dog.

26
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,340
"Just because you're a TV personality, you think you can get away with anything?"

27
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,120
As if I did it just because I'm on TV!

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,890
Maybe you were following
them and did it on purpose.

29
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,330
So she was saying "You startled the kid!".

30
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,370
But the kid and the big dog were like this.

31
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,600
Not startled in the least.

32
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:51,420
So, suppose they were, even though
that was so totally not the case.

33
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,050
What is so bad about startling a kid?

34
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,330
Is it wrong to startle a kid?

35
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,460
To raise a kid in this world
without startling is impossible.

36
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,570
To reach adulthood without the sound
of a honking horn is impossible.

37
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,440
Right?

38
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,350
"What am I going to do? What's a horn?"

39
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,990
"What's a horn?"

40
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,260
What if I'm driving, and the driver in front
of me doesn't notice the green light.

41
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,430
"Damn I want to honk the
horn, damn I want to!"

42
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:43,940
"But what if there's a kid in
that car. I can't startle him!"

43
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,140
I'm picking up a friend.
But he doesn't notice me.

44
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,680
"I should sound the horn. But
wait, maybe there's a kid here!"

45
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,220
"I can't startle a kid, you know!"

46
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,520
It's impossible to live like that!
