There are lots of different dishes in the world.

secretive cooking, mysterious cuisine!

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,150

00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,330
What are you doing?

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,220
Let's go!

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,160
Hello!

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,090
Well then, let's hurry and introduce you to today's cooking instructor:

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,000
From Shimantogawa Cooking School, Mrs. Cathy Tsukamoto!

12
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,950
Here she is!

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,940
Cathy Tsukamoto

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,940
Shimantogawa Cooking School

15
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,220
You bastards! You bastards! You bastards!

16
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,040
IT'S OVER!

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,390
Teacher!

18
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,140
Teacher.

19
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,100
Teacher.

20
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,110
That hurt quite a bit you know?

21
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,660
You're energetic today, aren't you?

22
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,140
Well I can't help it since I have so much extra power

23
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,490
But that's something good, right?

24
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,410
Of course it is!

25
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,360
BABO BABO!*

26
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,400
*This is a phrase Cathy Tsukamoto says while pressing her chest

27
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,500
What is going on?

28
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,850
I'm gonna be late you know, gonna be late you know!

29
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,540
I'd press them, if you would just tell me, I would press them

30
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,610
No I don't want that, you'd sexually harass me immediately!

31
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,120
Really, because you'd touch these nipples at once!

32
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,120
I wouldn't do such a thing!

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,680
It's just a joke anyway...

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,520
Your clothes are very colorful today, aren't they?

35
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,520
True!

36
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,300
Well then...

37
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,720
Today I thought, you know, should I prepare something easy?

38
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,260
But since this is about the world's unusual cuisines, right teacher...

39
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,060
do you have something like that for us?

40
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,440
Well, does Mesopotamia ring a bell for you lot?

41
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,540
Mesopotamia?

42
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,680
Did you learn about the Mesopotamian civilization?

43
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,140
Ah, of course I know about Mesomotamia, teacher!

44
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,140
What?!

45
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,790
What is with you...

46
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,410
But I went recently. Haven't gone since graduation, but I did go

47
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,410
Oh really?

48
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,050
Your tongue got twisted, right?

49
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,040
Yes, exactly

50
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,440
But I know it, of course!

51
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,590
Mesopotamian civilization, Mesopotamian civilization

52
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,330
when you think of Mesopotamia, you think of pizza right?

53
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,320
That's correct!

54
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,320
Therefore it's pizza for today.

55
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,090
Ah, I see...

56
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:52,960
Really? Pizza?

57
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,090
Yes it's pizza today it's gonna be great!

58
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,630
Pizza is so delicious, right?

59
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,000
Yea, and people don't cook it at home much, do they?

60
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,000
Is that so?

61
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,900
You tend to rely on delivery, you know

62
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,800
Oh, the one that can deliver any time of day

63
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,800
Well, that's something I don't like

64
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,910
This is something I want to say today:

65
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,950
Like you get the delivery and then quickly dispose it

66
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,110
To me, this is also something that's unbelievable

67
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,950
That's right...

68
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,080
What?

69
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,580
It's nothing...

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,490
Now, let's start with the pizza.

71
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,740
Now, first let's start with the dough

72
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,160
Yea, begin stretching the dou...

73
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,160
Let's start...

74
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,300
What the hell is this...

75
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,950
This is it!

76
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,270
Teacher, this is...

77
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,100
...The dough of the pizza prototype, correct?

78
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,100
Exactly!

79
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,340
This is important!

80
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,360
Have you guys ever seen something like this?

81
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,010
No!

82
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,580
Isn't that something you can see a lot on TV?

83
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,900
Maybe it is after all...

84
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,830
Now from here on, you just gotta do it

85
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,290
From here on it is?

86
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,410
You just gotta do it, you just gotta do it

87
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,030
You just gotta do it, little kitty

88
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,790
What on earth are you saying, teacher?

89
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,560
I really don't get it

90
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,230
You're in a good mood today, aren't you?

91
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,680
Something good must've happened, right?

92
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,900
Okay, why don't you try then?

93
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,300
Use the centrifugal force!

94
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,290
Centrifugal force, huh?

95
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,210
Yes, you just use centrifugal force, I've seen it so I know

96
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,240
Okay, if I do it like this...

97
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,840
It becomes like this

98
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,550
That's wrong!

99
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,290
Okay?

100
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,630
You have to rotate it! Rotate it you know?

101
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,920
Listen carefully, you!

102
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,850
You rotate it like this!

103
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,860
Like that.

104
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,860
Vertically?

105
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,370
Not like this?

106
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,770
It's better if you throw it higher! Here, go ahead

107
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,540
Throw it higher, okay?

108
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,550
Okay

109
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,110
WATCH OUT!!!

110
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,710
Wait!

111
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,710
Are you okay?!

112
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,520
What are you doing?

113
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,690
Can't be helped if she feels shocked

114
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,100
Although I do understand how she feels too. But...

115
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,360
it's pointless to keep saying such things

116
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,360
Yea

117
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,190
Let's sprinkle some flour shall we?

118
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,100
Yes, let's!

119
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,220
Okaaay, you just gotta sprinkle it, you just gotta sprinkle it

120
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:21,140
Today Judy is coming!

121
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:21,150
What are you saying... Who is this "Judy"?

122
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,890
So who knows the answer to what this all becomes?

123
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,750
Ready made pizza dough, right?

124
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,750
Exactly

125
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,320
Got it... It's down here by your feet!

126
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,610
Now it's become like this

127
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,920
Great, is it not?

128
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,560
Teacher, you can easily make this at home too

129
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,600
Right, teacher?

130
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,450
Now, let's put our favorites on that, shall we?

131
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,100
This is the real thrill about homemade pizza

132
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,100
Exactly!

133
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,570
You put on your favori... That is one amazing hairstyle

134
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,310
You put your favorites on it, THAT'S the thrill about it all, teacher!

135
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,950
EXACTLY!!!

136
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,580
We have loads here

137
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,580
Yes we do!

138
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,090
What should we put in?

139
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,010
You know, I think we should go with the most conventional,

140
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,600
salami and bell pepper.

141
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,400
Salami and bell pepper then, let's put it on top!

142
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,130
Let's go!

143
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,000
What do you want?

144
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,000
Sausages!

145
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Sausage, let's do it!

146
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,770
Sausage, right? Here you go

147
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,870
This too, BAM!

148
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,420
Let's add all sorts of things!

149
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,910
Shouldn't we remove the wrapping...?

150
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,910
Doesn't matter, we can leave it as it is.

151
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,970
Let's add whatever

152
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,550
Cheese too, okay?

153
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,320
Then, lets add myself too!

154
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,230
Thi.. This... Let's cover me up with this

155
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,030
What?

156
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,600
Well...

157
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,230
That's... Tha... That's not cooking, now is it?

158
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,710
What's your problem?

159
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,710
Whatever this is, it's not cooking...

160
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,110
What?

161
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,100
Yea it's not, you see...

162
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,810
If you step on it like that it'll get dirty, no?

163
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,170
It'll become unedible...

164
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,010
What is it with you?

165
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,010
Let go of me, quit it

166
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,240
Don't fight... Hey... Um, stop fighting...

167
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,770
I'll get you for this!

168
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,820
What's wrong with that person?

169
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,120
I have no idea

170
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,740
Discovering Cuisines from Around the World - until next week!

171
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,940
Goodbye
