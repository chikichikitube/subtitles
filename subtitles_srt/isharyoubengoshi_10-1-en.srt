1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,220
Thank you very much.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,680
Tavern
Yoshi

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,850
Add an order of yakisoba and yakitori.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,660
Did you bring the beer to table two?

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,990
The day will end
before you get it there!

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,160
Yes, I'll do it right away.

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,200
Table one's yakitori, thanks.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,060
Yes.

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,200
Were you listening?

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,170
I said the beer first.

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,370
Yoshioka family, bride
Yoshioka Miki

12
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,370
Yoshioka family, mother-in-law
Yoshioka Tomoe

13
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,470
Go do that first, like I told you.

14
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,370
What a useless bride!

15
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,680
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,070
Thank you for waiting.

17
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,800
So, this is your favorite
tavern, Yoshie-san?

18
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,950
Hakamada's Assistant
Nonomura Kanae

19
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,950
Office landlord
Toyama Yoshie

20
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,290
What do you recommend?

21
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,630
Other than the yakitori.

22
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,160
Yoshie-san.

23
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,260
Huh?

24
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,520
Is something the matter?

25
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,910
Nothing.

26
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,380
Nice place, right?

27
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,790
Their stews are the best.

28
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,890
You're drinking Oolong tea at a tavern?

29
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,600
I don't drink.

30
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,270
Jeez, you sound just like Sensei.

31
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,540
That man doesn't drink,

32
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,570
doesn't pay the rent...

33
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,630
Landlord, we paid the
rent just yesterday.

34
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,100
Oh, I wasn't talking about
your place, Yoshi-san.

35
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,560
This restaurant is one of my rentals.

36
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,020
Really? Here, too?

37
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,550
Here's your yakitori.
Thank you for waiting.

38
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,480
I'm so sorry for the wait, as well.

39
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,620
Why are you such a slug?
The food'll get cold.

40
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,320
You told me to serve
the beer to table two first.

41
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,970
You're blaming me? How rude...

42
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,610
I'm so sorry about that.

43
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,480
How about I bring

44
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,030
a stew dish on the house,
as a token of our apology.

45
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,760
Come on, get the stew.

46
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,760
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,970
It's not cold at all.

48
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,110
And I was going to order stew anyway,

49
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,800
so just put it on my tab.

50
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,480
But—

51
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,360
Don't worry about it.

52
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,070
I just heard. I am so sorry.

53
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,810
Don't just stand there looking stupid.

54
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,460
Clean up this table. Do I have
to tell you to do everything?

55
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,160
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,750
I have to tell you to do everything.

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,370
Nao-kun just bought me this shirt!

58
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,430
Are you alright, Rie-chan?

59
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,430
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,140
Sorry, for our bride.

61
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,530
I'm so sorry.

62
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,300
What if it stains?

63
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,220
Be careful!

64
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,270
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,040
We will pay to have it laundered.

66
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,620
Please come this way.

67
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,610
I'm so sorry.

68
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,550
That's enough of you.

69
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,810
Get cleaning! Hurry up!

70
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,450
I'm so sorry!

71
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,250
Are you all right?

72
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,650
I can do this.

73
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,520
If I let a customer do my job,
Mother would get angry.

74
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,470
It's fine, really.

75
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,560
Your hand is bruised.

76
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,810
You can't go on like this much longer.

77
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,060
It'll be your death.

78
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,740
Yoshioka

79
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,330
Do you know how much
dry cleaners cost nowadays?

80
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,420
Shunsuke can't grill enough yakitori
to make up for your losses.

81
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,000
I am sorry.

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,340
Look at this filthy room!

83
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,780
Do I have to come home
exhausted every day to this?

84
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,050
What is this?

85
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,320
I had to hurry off this
morning for preparations.

86
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,830
Don't talk back. Just clean.

87
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,690
Shunsuke, you must be tired.

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,810
Yoshioka family, groom
Yoshioka Shunsuke

89
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,840
Why don't you take a bath first?

90
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,370
Yeah.

91
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,150
Good job today.

92
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,420
This place is pig sty.

93
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,020
Make it fit for human habitation
before you go to bed.

94
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,690
Yes.

95
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,250
There, at the corner.

96
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,580
There's debris everywhere.

97
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,650
It's midnight.
Vacuuming would bother the neighbors.

98
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,730
You're full of excuses, aren't you?

99
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,670
Here. Try this.

100
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,380
I'm taking a bath.

101
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,030
Yes.

102
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,100
Mother drained the bath by mistake.

103
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,090
Mistake?

104
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,250
But I'm always the last to bathe.

105
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,140
Of course she wouldn't
do it on purpose.

106
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,930
Don't be so paranoid.

107
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,590
Mother's tired. That's all.

108
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,520
I'm tired, too, you know.

109
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,270
I work just as hard
as you and your mother,

110
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,180
but she makes me do more
chores when we get home.

111
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,770
You once said, "I'll endure anything

112
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,770
if I can always be with you, Shun-chan."

113
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,240
You knew you were going
to help at the tavern,

114
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,980
and that we were going to
live with my mother...

115
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,390
from before we got married.

116
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,480
But...

117
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,760
Give me a break. I'm tired, too.

118
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,150
Good night.

119
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,510
Hakamada Law Office

120
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,800
Don't worry.

121
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,350
I don't really want to
go to a law office...

122
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:16,880
Hakamada
Law Office

123
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,830
This place is actually
my friend's bakery.

124
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,980
Don't worry.

125
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,750
Sensei, I'm borrowing
your place for a second.

126
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,390
You'll go crazy if you
let that mother-in-law

127
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,870
keep bullying you like that.

128
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,650
But, I have no intention
of leaving my husband.

129
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,110
You're from the tavern.

130
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,480
Did something happen?

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,400
Temp
Shinozuka Rina

132
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,900
Tavern?

133
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,610
Oh, the one Yoshie-san
goes to all the time.

134
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,810
Let's try and think of a solution
to your problem together.

135
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,860
Hey, Sensei.

136
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,840
You're making too much
noise with that dough.

137
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,210
Attorney
Hakamada Yukio

138
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,870
Well, I'm infusing the dough
with feelings of gratitude to you all...

139
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,000
and in looking forward to spring,
I have named this bread "The Special Spring—"

140
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,840
We don't need to know the name.

141
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,280
Never mind the gratitude
or the bread!

142
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,600
Pay the rent!

143
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,420
I'm so sorry you have to
see all this ugliness.

144
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,720
I told everyone I was just
going shopping.

145
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,130
I have to get back.

146
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,480
Are you okay?

147
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,650
You got really pale!

148
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,670
Miki-san, take a little break here.

149
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,720
Sensei, tea.

150
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Oh. Yes!

151
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,910
Hurry.

152
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,880
It's ginger tea.

153
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,050
This is Yoshioka Miki-san.

154
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,380
She's the bride at my favorite
haunt, the Tavern Yoshi.

155
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,010
I've been noticing it lately,

156
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,310
but her mother-in-law bullies
her something terrible.

157
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,410
I saw it for myself last night.

158
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,290
It was terrible.

159
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,490
You look very tired.

160
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,600
By the way, how long did
you sleep last night?

161
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,330
About four hours, I think.

162
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,580
Four hours?

163
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,660
It's like you're in cram school.

164
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,370
I go in for prep at six in the morning.

165
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,410
Then, I get the tables set up.

166
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,780
At night I do all the cleaning,

167
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,710
and by the time I get home
it's close to one o'clock.

168
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,010
Then, I have to do chores.

169
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,500
So I can't sleep more
than that each night.

170
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,360
Sleep deprivation is bad for your skin.

171
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,890
What about your meals?

172
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,260
Are you eating properly?

173
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,430
Between chores and
working at the tavern,

174
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,400
I'm too busy to eat sometimes.

175
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,130
Often I don't have time to sit
and eat lunch or dinner.

176
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,080
That's not good!

177
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,150
You have to eat properly!

178
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,010
You don't look well at all.

179
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,430
Why don't you ask your
mother-in-law for a day off today?

180
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,210
I once had a fever of 104 degrees,
and she still made me work.

181
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,230
Come on. Get on with it!

182
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,680
Hurry up!

183
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,820
That's like an underground sweatshop.

184
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,990
Sensei, do something.

185
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,770
Miki-san will die if she
continues like this.

186
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,810
Pardon me if I may ask, Miki-san,

187
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,990
but what do you want to do?

188
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,690
I don't want to separate
from Shun-chan...

189
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,970
that is, my husband,
no matter what.

190
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,820
So...

191
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,470
I'm fine.

192
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,670
I understand.

193
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,780
Miki-san...

194
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,030
Shun-chan was my upperclassman in
high school, and I admired him.

195
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,820
He had a girlfriend for a long time,

196
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,280
so I gave up on him for a while...

197
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,690
But, after graduation,
he told me they'd broken up...

198
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,970
So I aggressively pursued him.

199
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,330
And we finally got married
seven years ago, and...

200
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,930
it was like a dream come true.

201
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,120
She's taking advantage
of your love for him.

202
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,170
Can't something be done about this?

203
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,510
Like asking your husband to have your
mother-in-law live elsewhere?

204
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,180
I agreed before we were married
that she would live with us.

205
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,520
Seriously, I have to get going.

206
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,970
Thank you for the tea.

207
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,300
Goodbye.

208
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,050
Oh. Miki-san.

209
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,090
Wait—

210
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,910
Jeez...

211
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,690
What a spineless husband,
not standing up for his wife.

212
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,550
She should dump him
and sue for compensation.

213
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,930
Yoshie-san,

214
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,790
you have to consider
Miki-san's feelings, too.

215
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,940
You can't casually make
drastic decisions for her.

216
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,030
Then, let me ask you, Kanae-chan.

217
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,010
Are you going to do nothing
while you watch Miki-san slowly die?

218
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,740
That's not what I meant!

219
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,210
Please, both of you calm down.

220
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,660
Then you'd better do something, Sensei!

221
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,720
I have to respect her decision
to stay with her husband.

222
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,490
What about suing the
mother-in-law for bullying, then?

223
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,140
Oh!

224
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,210
Good idea.

225
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,430
Let's do it!

226
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,460
Unless circumstances
are quite extreme...

227
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,600
it's difficult for a daughter-in-law
to sue her mother-in-law.

228
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,220
Who cares if it's difficult?

229
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,670
Hurry up and get the ball rolling!

230
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,840
That's right!

231
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,120
Do something.

232
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,080
Sensei.

233
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,740
Don't move in... so close...

234

Closed Today

237
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,430
Why are you cleaning
so vigorously today?

238
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:17,250
Because Mother will gripe
at me if it's not clean.

239
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,750
Maybe that's not all
there is to it, though...

240
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,600
Mother doesn't approve of
anything I do, regardless.

241
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,010
It's futile for me
to try to please her.

242
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,760
That's enough.

243
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,460
All you ever do is complain lately.

244
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,090
I'm sorry.

245
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,800
Try to get along with her.

246
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,800
It's hardest on me when you don't.

247
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,610
Mother, how is the seasoning?

248
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,910
It's hot, so be careful.

249
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,020
Mm, what refined seasoning!

250
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,400
It's delicious.

251
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,400
Yuri-chan.

252
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,260
Yuri-chan?

253
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,520
This young lady is Kubo Yuriko-chan.
She and Shunsuke are childhood friends.

254
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,200
Shunsuke's childhood friend
Kubo Yuriko

255
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,290
And here's the bride, Miki.

256
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,280
How do you do? I'm Yuriko.

257
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,970
I'm Miki.

258
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,010
Well, I'd better get going.

259
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,420
Thank you for lending me this.

260
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,530
You're leaving already?

261
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,030
I haven't seen you in so long.

262
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,080
Oh, Shunsuke.

263
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,350
Yuriko-chan brought
us fresh red snapper.

264
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,010
We cooked it together, didn't we?

265
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,700
Mother invited me the other day,

266
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,810
so I thought I'd drop in.

267
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,870
It's so fun spending time
with you, Yuri-chan.

268
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,810
Hey, why don't you stay for dinner?

269
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,720
Can you? You can show
me your cooking skills.

270
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,100
What a feast.

271
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,770
It's like a celebration or something.

272
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,310
Never mind the comments.

273
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,420
You're always in my way.

274
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,410
Mm, delicious!

275
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,860
All I ever have to eat is
half-baked swill around here.

276
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,780
This has brought me back to life!

277
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,120
Shunsuke, eat up while you can.

278
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,540
It's all your favorites.

279
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,410
It's good.

280
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,530
Your cooking's gotten
even better, Yuri-chan.

281
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,830
You.

282
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,700
You should try it, too,
for future reference.

283
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,080
I will.

284
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,340
Well?

285
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,970
Does it meet with your approval?

286
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,540
It's good.

287
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,910
Well, so she does know the
difference between good and bad.

288
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,850
She's so bad at cooking,

289
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,460
I thought she didn't
know the difference!

290
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,700
That's terrible, Mother.

291
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,760
Of course she knows the difference!

292
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,770
Try to get along with her.

293
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:58,200
It's hardest on me when you don't.

294
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,930
Oh, Mother, please.

295
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,380
Always kidding around.

296
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,910
Truth be told,

297
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,250
I wanted Shunsuke to marry
someone like you, Yuri-chan.

298
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,350
We have the same
taste in food, too.

299
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,890
There's nothing I could do, anyway.

300
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,820
Yuri-chan was already
in an arranged marriage.

301
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,580
I was too young, anyway.

302
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,720
But it's okay.

303
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,630
You got to marry this lovely girl instead.

304
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,510
Um...

305
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,210
Yuriko-san, how long ago
did you get married?

306
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,680
Let me see...

307
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,070
seven years ago, I guess.

308
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,490
Seven years ago...

309
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,240
Yuri-chan, you haven't changed a bit.

310
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,310
You look ten years younger.

311
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,950
She's always been so pretty.

312
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,900
And compared to this...

313
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,970
You shouldn't sit next to her.

314
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,430
Mother, please.

315
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,810
Delicious!

316
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,030
I can't help it.

317
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,520
I'd like to make myself pretty, too,

318
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,830
but I'm always exhausted.

319
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,660
I don't even have time to sleep.

320
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,260
Hey, Mother was just kidding.

321
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,900
I do everything Mother tells me to do,

322
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,470
at home and at the tavern,

323
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,640
to the best of my ability.

324
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,120
Oh, please, listen to this.

325
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,290
You make it sound like I'm forcing you.

326
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,010
You see how rude she is?

327
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,920
Right? I'm sick of it.

328
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,750
I'm not your slave, Mother!

329
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,520
Miki!

330
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,090
You can't talk like that to Mother.

331
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,540
Shun-chan.

332
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,960
Apologize to her!

333
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,140
Miki-san, don't be so angry.

334
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,800
Let's all enjoy a friendly meal.

335
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,380
You...

336
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,210
What do you know?

337
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,610
Hey.

338
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,670
Miki!

339
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,430
Let her be!

340
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,950
Hakamada Law Office

341
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,320
I made chamomile tea.

342
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,310
It's very soothing.

343
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,680
Thank you very much.

344
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:56,580
So, this so-called
childhood friend, Yuriko...

345
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,310
Was she  your husband's girlfriend in high school?

346
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,400
Shun-chan said that seven years ago,
before we got married...

347
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:15,110
that his longstanding girlfriend's
parents arranged her marriage...

348
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,000
and she dumped him.

349
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,590
But, why did your mother-in-law
invite his ex-girlfriend to the house?

350
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,930
I assume she's been married
the past seven years, too.

351
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,970
Mother is spiteful.

352
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,170
She praised Yuriko-san's
cooking in front of me.

353
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,540
She compared my looks
to hers and laughed.

354
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,140
She even said she'd wanted
Yuriko-san to marry her son.

355
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,600
Are you kidding?

356
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,350
Isn't the one working
her fingers to the bone

357
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,350
you, Miki-san?!

358
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,130
How can you be expected

359
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,570
to cook anything spectacular
when you have no time?

360
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,640
This is an outrage!

361
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,220
And your husband...

362
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,260
Did he just quietly watch
all that happening?

363
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,330
"You can't talk like that to mother."

364
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,750
That's what Shun-chan said
when I talked back to her.

365
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,470
That's awful.

366
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
I've reached my limit.

367
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,690
At this rate,

368
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,030
I'll gradually turn into
a horrible person.

369
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,130
I've endured this much because
I love Shun-chan, but...

370
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,050
I...

371
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,390
am going to divorce him.

372
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,760
Sensei.

373
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,700
Understood.

374
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,590
You are officially my client.

375
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,350
She overdid it by inviting
his ex-girlfriend.

376
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,770
Let's get ready for the divorce.

377
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,300
Let's sue the mother-in-law
for compensation.

378
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,650
Compensation?

379
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,750
You're young, so you probably think
you don't need compensation...

380
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,380
but you can't let people
walk all over you.

381
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,190
From everything I've heard so far,

382
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,940
the situation sounds like more
than just a case of bullying.

383
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,570
How so?

384
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,720
What do you mean?

385
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,430
In other words...

386
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,530
there's something more behind it.

387
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,850
Firstly, you must gather
evidence of bullying.

388
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,370
So, provisionally, please
apologize to your mother-in-law,

389
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,700
and go back home.

390
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,250
Mother.

391
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,410
I am sorry.

392
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,940
You think an apology is enough?

393
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,220
I think we did the
right thing. Don't you?

394
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,610
There are times people have
to stand up for themselves,

395
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,050
even if it's hard.

396
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,960
You've been worried about
Miki-san for quite a while now.

397
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,480
I...

398
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,370
have a daughter.

399
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,070
You have a daughter?

400
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,260
About seven or eight years ago,

401
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,060
my daughter was in the
same situation as Miki-san.

402
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,640
She was bullied constantly by her
Oedipus-complex husband and his mother.

403
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,230
And she ran away from them,
leaving all her belongings behind.

404
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,910
It was Sensei who helped her, then.

405
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,700
She received compensation...

406
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,110
She got her divorce...

407
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:19,900
That's why I still rent the office
out to that penniless lawyer.

408
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,430
I see...

409
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,920
That's why I had to do something.

410
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,470
Something for Miki-san.

411
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,480
Cheers!

412
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,620
Ladies of the Shopping District
Women's Association,

413
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,510
thank you for your continued patronage.

414
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,300
We're celebrating our
newest member today.

415
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,330
Wow, you really guzzled that beer!

416
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,560
How impressive!

417
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,220
Oh, please! I'm shy!

418
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,250
May I take your order?

419
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,460
Miki-san, don't bully your
mother-in-law too much.

420
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,070
Huh?

421
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,310
Freelance Investigator
Umemoto Kurumi

422
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,310
You haven't attended
our meetings lately.

423
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,530
Because my mother-in-law
says I don't need to—

424
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,040
Miki-chan, good job.

425
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,920
You must be tired.

426
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,480
You can take a break now.

427
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,180
Yes.

428
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,440
Good job.

429
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,190
Thanks.

430
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,610
She's what you call a monster bride.

431
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,600
When she gets in one of her moods,

432
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,180
she complains that she's tired,
she yells at everyone...

433
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,040
That's so scary.

434
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,180
You must be careful
to never become like her.

435
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,510
I'll be careful.

436
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,990
I'll bring you some edamame.

437
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,290
On the house.

438
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,800
You're always so good to us!

439
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,370
Um...

440
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:38,260
when did Miki-san stop coming
to the meetings?

441
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,610
Let's see...

442
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,720
It's been three years, I think.

443
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,640
Speaking of which...

444
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,690
I think that's when it all began.

445
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,880
That's when her relationship
with her mother-in-law started to sour.

446
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,130
Three years ago...

447
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,140
That's right.

448
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,280
That was about the time she started
talking trash about her daughter-in-law.

449
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,030
I think it's quite complicated.

450
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,330
Hey, you, hey!

451
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,040
I told them I'm giving
them free edamame.

452
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,430
Why didn't you have it ready?

453
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,010
I'm sorry. I'll get on it right away.

454
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,300
Just forget it.

455
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,200
What are you doing?!

456
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,190
I'm sorry.

457
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,600
"I'm sorry.I'm sorry."

458
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,050
You think can get away with
anything by apologizing!

459
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,270
I'm sorry.

460
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,290
Too bad I can't get rid of you.

461
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,720
I'm sorry.

462
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,260
Hakamada Law Office

463
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:34,820
She's been bullied like that
for three whole years!

464
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,140
For three years...

465
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,050
Three years ago,

466
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,840
did something happen
between you and the mother?

467
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,350
There was, wasn't there?

468
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,260
It wasn't about Mother, though.

469
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,000
It doesn't matter.

470
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,670
Three years ago,

471
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,090
Shu-chan cheated on me.

472
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,590
It was cold then,

473
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,860
so I think it was around
the same time of year.

474
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,850
Cheating?

475
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,330
With who?!

476
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,850
I don't know who it was.

477
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,150
When I questioned him,

478
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,760
he turned it around and said,

479
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,370
"Let's get a divorce, then."

480
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,840
But, I didn't want a divorce.

481
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,880
I said, "I love you, Shun-chan.
I'll never divorce you."

482
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,620
The guilty spouse,
or more accurately,

483
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,860
the husband who had an illicit affair
which could destroy the household,

484
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:38,390
The party guilty of an illicit affair

485
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,880
has no legal standing
to ask for a divorce.

486
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:38,390
has no standing to demand a divorce.

487
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,670
If he still insists on a divorce,

488
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,920
he'd be liable for a
hefty compensation fee.

489
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,390
And what did your husband say?

490
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,640
He said, "I'm not seeing her any more."

491
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,130
Shu-chan was very upfront about it.

492
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:47,860
Sensei, is there a connection between
the affair three years ago and the bullying?

493
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:53,010
The mother-in-law told her she didn't
have to attend the meetings any more...

494
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,540
Kurumi-san.

495
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,010
Closed today

496
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,010
The rest, I'll leave in your hands.

497
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,450
That's our meeting for today.
Good job, everyone.

498
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,510
Good work!

499
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,020
Good work, everyone. Please,
have some beer on the house.

500
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,320
I'm going out for a bit.

501
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,720
Sure.

502
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,070
Chairman, good job today.

503
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,410
Thank you, Madam.

504
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,110
I always look forward to
having our meetings at Yoshi,

505
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,680
especially this part.

506
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,840
Thank you for your
continued support.

507
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,200
This is about all I can
do for you, but...

508
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,450
By the way, I got you an estimate
for renovating the tavern.

509
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,290
Oh, thank you very much.

510
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,300
I can always rely on
Kobayashi Building Contractors.

511
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,830
We're working on the blueprint.

512
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,670
Shopping district chairman / President of Kobayashi Building Contractors
Kobayashi Hiroyasu

513
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,770
Yes.

514
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,340
Let me bring you some snacks.

515
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,780
Thanks.

516
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,620
The tavern's getting renovated?

517
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,890
Well... yes.

518
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,480
Chairman, you're the president
of a contracting firm, aren't you?

519
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,230
My place needs renovation, too.

520
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,730
Can you tell me how
it works in some detail?

521
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,220
Y-Y-Yes.

522
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,330
Iron Spy Woman Marilyn season
11, episode "Honey Trap."

523
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,290
I'm a tigress.

524
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,400
There's no man who won't fall for me.

525
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,930
It appears your mother-in-law
is having a renovation done

526
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:17,800
by the shopping district chairman and
president of Kobayashi Building Contractors.

527
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,160
Renovation?

528
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,370
Interior Renovation Work

529
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,910
Miki-san, you didn't know about this?

530
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,220
It's always been this way.

531
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,300
Shu-chan and his mother
make all the decisions.

532
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,210
There's one scenario
that is conceivable.

533
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,720
The two of them are keeping
the matter secret to you for a reason.

534
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:44,760
But why would they need to hide
their plan to renovate from Miki-san?

535
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,570
He cheated three years ago.

536
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,590
The bullying started at the same time.

537
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,500
And they've been keeping the renovation
plan secret from Miki-san.

538
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,260
When you connect those
three dots together...

539
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,880
Do you mean...

540
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,520
her husband is in on it, too?

541
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,450
That can't be...

542
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,220
But, for what?

543
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,750
I cannot say anything for certain.

544
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,560
However, if they are
conspiring together...

545
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,160
there is a high probability
your husband wants a divorce.

546
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,120
Perhaps it would be best
to confront him directly,

547
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,420
and ask him yourself.

548
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,880
Directly?

549
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,610
Are you sure that's a good idea?

550
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,920
I don't mind.

551
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,980
I'm leaving them anyway.

552
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,110
Miki-san.

553
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,790
Sensei.

554
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,850
I am relying on you.

555
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,780
Understood.

556
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,410
First off,

557
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,650
let's see how they respond
to the compensation lawsuit

558
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,450
on grounds of bullying.

559
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,300
On that occasion,

560
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,860
please be careful to not
use the word "divorce."

561
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,150
Because I am going to draw
that word out of them.

562
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,340
Yes?

563
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:05,220
I am Hakamada Yukio of the
Hakamada Law Office.

564
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,740
As Miki-san's legal representative,

565
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,860
I am here to discuss a compensation lawsuit

566
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,480
based on your psychological abuse
toward your daughter-in-law.

567
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,940
Psychological abuse?

568
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,250
Attorney at Law
Hakamada Yukio

569
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,590
Suing her own mother-in-law...

570
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,940
How bad can this
bride's character get?

571
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,110
I am told Miki-san has been placed
in charge of all household chores

572
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,230
after working full-time at the tavern.

573
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,210
As a result,

574
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,740
Miki-san has been averaging four hours of
sleep a night for the last three years.

575
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,760
She has had no time for her
regular meals on a daily basis.

576
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,810
This is Miki-san's health
diagnosis report.

577
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,130
As you can see from the report,
Miki-san has incurred considerable

578
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,880
Health diagnosis report

Name: Yoshioka Miki

Diagnosis: weight loss and
anemia due to malnutrition.

Additional notes: Probable cause
of malnutrition is due to excessive
labor and sleep deprivation
on a daily basis.

579
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:49,820
physical damage, including weight
loss and anemia due to malnutrition.

580
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,580
Health diagnosis report

Name: Yoshioka Miki

Diagnosis: weight loss and anemia

581
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,880
due to excessive labor and sleep depravation

582
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,920
I'm helpless.

583
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,130
I'm getting older, and taking this kind
of abuse from my daughter-in-law,

584
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,090
I'm helpless.

585
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,530
Mother.

586
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,230
When I was married,

587
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,700
I didn't get along with
my mother-in-law, either.

588
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,910
But I never would've sued her.

589
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,070
If she doesn't like it here,
she can leave any time.

590
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,170
Sir,

591
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,840
what are your thoughts on the matter?

592
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,670
She shouldn't have resorted
to asking a lawyer.

593
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,070
We're family, after all.

594
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,090
We should talk it out like one.

595
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,190
Miki-san has sought
your help several times.

596
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:36,630
But every time, you evaded her by
asking her to just "get along."

597
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,610
All I wanted was for Miki
to get along with my mother.

598
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,030
But...

599
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,910
If she can't, then it can't be helped.

600
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,010
Meaning?

601
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,850
I will divorce Miki.

602
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,330
I'm tired of all this, too.

603
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,690
Miki-san does not want
to divorce you, however.

604
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,790
She is willing to withdraw the
compensation lawsuit,

605
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,250
on the condition that you
and your mother treat her fairly.

606
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,760
Withdraw or not,

607
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,850
my mother has never done anything to
deserve a lawsuit in the first place.

608
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,040
So you choose your
mother over Miki-san?

609
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,680
I have only one mother, after all.

610
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,750
Shun-chan.

611
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,920
Understood.

612
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,240
I will relay your message to Miki-san.

613
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,290
The husband initiated
the talk of divorce.

614
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,590
There is no question he and his mother
are conspiring together.

615
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,610
Miki-san.

616
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,610
Are you okay?

617
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,550
I'm okay.

618
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,490
I'm firm in my decision.

619
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,710
It seems you were right
about the conspiracy.

620
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,270
How did it go?

621
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,910
I investigated as per
your instructions, Sensei.

622
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,340
About this girl.

623
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,080
Yuriko-san.

624
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,460
So this woman is your
husband's ex-girlfriend.

625
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,140
She and Miki-san's husband have been
friends since elementary school.

626
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,790
They were in a relationship for nine years
starting their second year in high school,

627
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,770
and seven years ago,

628
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,820
a little before Miki-san
would marry her husband,

629
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,820
Yuriko entered a marriage
arranged by her parents.

630
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,260
So, it's just as Miki-san said.

631
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,230
Kubo Yuriko...

632
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,000
While she was married, her
name was Nishida Yuriko.

633
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,240
While she "was" married?

634
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,050
In other words, that Yuriko
woman is divorced?

635
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,250
She got divorced three years ago,
citing adultery.

636
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,080
Three years ago...

637
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,210
Wait a second.

638
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:47,820
It was three years ago when
Miki-san's husband cheated on her.

639
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,920
Which means that his cheating
partner must've been...

640
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,700
Could it be?

641
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,600
It is probable...

642
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,080
that it was Kubo Yuriko-san.

643
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,840
It can't be true...

644
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,810
However, based on the situation alone,

645
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,930
we cannot ascertain that your husband's

646
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:17,110
cheating partner three years
ago was Kubo Yuriko-san.

647
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,130
What are you saying?

648
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,840
Both of them were involved
in adultery three years ago.

649
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,840
Since she's divorced,

650
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,700
it must mean that Yuriko-san
must've admitted to the adultery.

651
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,860
Sensei.

652
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:34,070
Can we sue the husband for compensation,
for having an illicit affair?

653
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,670
Unfortunately, we cannot.

654
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,070
You can't?

655
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,410
Why is that?

656
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,910
Legally, adultery has a three-year
statute of limitations.

657
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:52,780
Illicit activities have a three-year statute of limitations -> no compensation lawsuit

658
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,290
In other words, since
three years has passed,

659
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,720
he can no longer be sued
on grounds of adultery.

660
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,070
Only three years?!

661
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,680
I wouldn't forgive him
for the rest of my life!

662
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,350
The problem is how

663
00:30:55,350 --> 00:31:00,490
we prove the husband's continued
relationship with Yuriko-san.

664
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,710
The statute of limitations has passed,

665
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,870
so we can't sue him for compensation...

666
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,010
She's a demon...

667
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,840
Even the bullying...

668
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,840
There's still stuff there.
It's a pig sty in here!
You're really useless!

I'm not your slave, Mother!

669
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,250
I would never forgive her... demon hag!

670
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,880
Editor at Tokiwa Publishing
Tabata Misato

671
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,590
Please calm down!

672
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,290
But, this mother-in-law is a demon!

673
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,580
She's not human!

674
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,030
May I help you?

675
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,890
Demons reside in the human heart.

676
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,260
The world is full of demons.

677
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,360
What?

678
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,960
It's true. Demons everywhere.

679
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,430
Cafe waitress
Mizutani Sara

680
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,710
Your heart also has a demon.

681
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,810
Here.

682
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,230
You are a demon, too.

683
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,950
Huh?

684
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,840
Looks like she'll finally
want a divorce.

685
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:54,990
It took three whole years.
That's one stubborn bride.

686
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,080
The statute of limitations
for adultery has passed...

687
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,060
There's no way that lawyer

688
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,680
can sue for compensation,
not to mention for bullying.

689
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,820
She's the one who decided to leave.

690
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,190
Why should we have to pay?

691
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,300
I was against this marriage
from the beginning.

692
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,260
Things will go as planned, Shunsuke.

693
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,100
This is the household's list of assets,
in its entirety.

694
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,940
Yoshioka Family Assets List

695
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:25,840
Real estate
License for tavern proprietorship
Savings, cash
Life insurance
Miscellaneous properties

696
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,490
Wait a second.

697
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,960
All of them are in the
mother-in-law's name.

698
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,220
There's no joint asset
of husband-wife anywhere.

699
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,970
That's because my mother-in-law
managed all the finances.

700
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,450
We can't expect property
distribution, then.

701
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,550
This can't be happening...

702
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,150
And the statute of
limitations has passed...

703
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,490
Sensei.

704
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,590
I used my womanly charms

705
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,730
and enticed the blueprint out of him.

706
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,100
Thank you very much.

707
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,140
This is your husband and his mother's
blueprint for renovating the tavern.

708
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,210
The name of the tavern is...

709
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,920
Now we have all the
pieces to the puzzle.

710
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,790
Renovation Blueprint

711
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:13,320
Mother, in this open area here,
can we install another oven?

712
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,450
I want grilled items on the menu, too.

713
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,670
Of course.

714
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,950
You can do anything
you want, Yuri-chan.

715
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,660
That was quite a detour,

716
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,060
but I can finally be
with you, Yuri-chan.

717
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,400
I can't wait to run the place together.

718
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,400
It's going to get busy.

719
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,940
No time for coughing up lawsuits.

720
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,920
Since she's married to me,

721
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,400
we won't have to pay
her severance, either.

722
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,280
What is the meaning of this?

723
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,730
So you've finally agreed to the divorce?

724
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:59,090
For seven years,
I endeavored for this tavern.

725
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,830
Hardly getting sleep at night,

726
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,100
skipping meals, working,
and working some more.

727
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,830
And now you do this?

728
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:10,290
This establishment is in my name.

729
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,310
You can divorce
Shunsuke or whatever,

730
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,250
but I don't have to distribute
a penny of my property to you.

731
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,850
So, you at least accept me as his wife.

732
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,020
Then why are you naming
the renovated tavern

733
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,070
after your son's illicit partner?

734
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,060
His illicit partner's name?

735
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,500
Dining Bar "Lily" Renovation Blueprint

736
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,500
Dining Bar "Lilly."

737
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,400
"Lily"

738
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:34,150
"Lily" is English for "Yuri."
As in Yuriko-san's name, right?

739
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,440
What are you talking about?

740
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,170
I remembered the other day

741
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,780
when Yuriko-san came to the apartment,

742
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:50,020
that it was three years ago to that day
that I discovered Shun-chan was cheating.

743
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,550
What are you trying to say?

744
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,640
It was as if you were
celebrating that day.

745
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,810
Ridiculous.

746
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:00,030
Don't make creepy accusations.

747
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,630
No, that day was indeed
a day of celebration.

748
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,990
That was the day the statute
of limitations passed,

749
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,600
for the adultery between
Shunsuke-san and Yuriko-san.

750
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:15,440
I know who you had the affair with,
three years ago.

751
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,970
It was Yuriko-san, wasn't it?

752
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,240
Hey, you.

753
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,350
Where did you learn to
get bossy like that?

754
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,250
Because I learned that I can't
just let people walk all over me.

755
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,860
They're not walking all over you now.

756
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,990
You stood up for yourself.

757
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,080
Yuriko-san.

758
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,050
The reason for your divorce...

759
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,330
It was because of your affair
with him, wasn't it?

760
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,300
Who cares?

761
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,080
The statute of limitations
is three years for adultery.

762
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,190
That's right.

763
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,140
It's too late now!

764
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:57,610
So the three of them were
celebrating that day.

765
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,550
And right in front of Miki-san, no less.

766
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,820
What disgusting people!

767
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,440
And I believed in you.

768
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,870
Even though I knew

769
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,840
your ex-girlfriend was always
in your heart, Shun-chan.

770
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,420
I believed that some day,

771
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,400
you would only have eyes for me.

772
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,170
So I endured Mother's bullying.

773
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,760
I wanted to be a good wife.

774
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,160
And did my best.

775
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,280
I'll send you the divorce papers.

776
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,600
If there's nothing else, leave.

777
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,530
I may be overstepping my bounds,

778
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,200
but there's one more
thing before we leave.

779
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,060
Let me explain to you
supplemental information

780
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,870
regarding the statute of
limitations for adultery.

781
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,470
Supplemental information?

782
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,540
You admit that you and Yuriko-san had
an illicit affair three years ago, correct?

783
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,630
Yeah, I admit it.

784
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,760
But it's past the limit.

785
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,810
Indeed.

786
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,240
There is a statute of limitations of three years
to sue for compensation for adultery.

787
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:27,930
Compensation lawsuit for illicit activities

788
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,070
But that is when the
perpetrator is identified.

789
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:27,930
When the perpetrator is identified → Statute of limitations of three years

790
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,930
And if the person is unidentified...

791
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:27,930
When unidentified

792
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:21,460
the statute of limitations is three years
after the person becomes identified.

793
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:27,930
-> 3 years after identification

794
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:26,480
The perpetrators in this case
are the husband and Yuriko-san.

795
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,030
It is a fact that Miki-san knew

796
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,510
her husband was guilty of an
illicit affair three years ago.

797
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:37,010
Hence, we cannot sue the husband
for compensation any more.

798
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,790
However, there is one more perpetrator.
The illicit partner in the adultery.

799
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,010
That would be Yuriko-san.

800
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,410
Miki-san found out that it was her,
today, for the first time.

801
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,140
Hence, within the next three years...

802
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,490
Yuriko-san can be sued
for compensation.

803
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:57,210
Hey, Shunsuke, this isn't
how you said it'd go!

804
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,860
Why do I have to get
sued for compensation?!

805
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,180
Calm down. Calm down.

806
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,900
And you too, Mother!

807
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,830
I did this because you promised
you'd chase that wife out!

808
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,450
I waited three years
to be with Shunsuke,

809
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,410
and this is what I get?!

810
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,770
Zip it, be quiet!

811
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,910
I've had it!

812
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,150
Yuri! Yuri-chan!

813
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:18,920
Yuriko-san was waiting for
Miki-san to leave, she said.

814
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,460
Which means the husband and Yuriko-san's
adulterous affair continued until now.

815
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:28,480
That means the statute of limitations
to sue for compensation

816
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,460
has not yet expired.

817
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,580
Don't be ridiculous.

818
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,940
I can finally renovate
this establishment.

819
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,100
I have no money to pay
for compensation.

820
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,030
Tomoe-san.

821
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,840
You were going to renovate the place
into a European-style restaurant.

822
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,770
You were going to name it "Lily,"
in reference to Yuriko-san's name.

823
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,890
Thus, in order to drive Miki-san
to file for divorce of her own accord,

824
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,470
you continually bullied
her for three whole years.

825
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:57,220
Shunsuke and Yuri-chan are
destined to be married.

826
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,860
But, he had to marry
that bride there instead!

827
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,090
Again, I may be overstepping my bounds,

828
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,920
but the mother-in-law
conspired with her son,

829
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,100
planned on driving out his wife and

830
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,130
getting her son hitched
to his illicit partner.

831
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,750
Which means you are guilty
of a joint unlawful act.

832
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,740
Hence it is possible for Miki-san
to sue you, the mother-in-law,

833
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,970
for compensation as well.

834
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,980
This can't be happening...

835
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,560
I'm sorry...

836
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,080
Yoshie-san, you're in high spirits.

837
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,560
The place has a new owner.

838
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,810
Guess who it is?

839
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,320
Could it be?

840
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,190
Miki-san?

841
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,580
Thanks to the triple compensation
from husband, his lover, and mother-in-law,

842
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,130
Miki-san is now the official owner.

843
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:22,200
And today's opening day!

844
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,990
Why don't we all go for a drink there?

845
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,670
She gave me vouchers, too.

846
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,980
Restaurant Miki
10% off voucher

847
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:28,530
See?

848
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,980
Wow, look at that!

849
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,540
How wonderful for Miki-san!

850
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,520
Okay!

851
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,540
I'm going to drink until I puke tonight!

852
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,270
Please, count me out.

853
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,330
I told you, I don't drink.

854
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,680
Both of you,

855
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,740
how cold can you get?

856
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,300
Don't you want to go and
support her establishment?

857
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,790
Regarding that,

858
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:49,690
as a main point of
attraction on her menu,

859
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,930
I invented a bread that
will go well with liquor.

860
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:56,100
What's that got to do with
supporting her establishment?

861
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,740
Because it's a main point
of attraction on the menu.

862
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,680
I'm getting the chills.

863
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,940
I'm getting bad vibes.

864
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,340
What's this numb deja-vu?

865
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,840
Here they come.

866
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,080
The perfect complement to shochu,

867
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,210
pickled-plum bread!

868
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,480
Fail.

869
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,580
For Japanese rice wine,
salt-pickled squid bread!

870
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,490
Fail.

871
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,900
And one more added bonus,

872
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,650
green-pea-soup bread!

873
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,790
Fail.

874
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,240
Let's go there on our own.

875
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:19,660
Let's.

876
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,890
And this goes well with beer...

877
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,170
black-beer bread!

878
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,120
Fail!

879
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,930
Oh wait, there's one more.

880
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,030
How about this one?

881
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,410
A friendly companion
to sodas... soda bread!

882
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,640
The sales pitch is over.

883
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,960
Fail!

884
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,020
All of them failed...

885
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,480
The Divorce Chaser's Final Battle

886
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,820
The client is Kanae's ex-husband!

887
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,380
We're being sued
for compensation.

888
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,820
My wife, Shiori,
was caught cheating.

889
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:49,350
I am Honjo Yayoi-san's legal
representative, Karasuma Keiko.

890
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:55,930
The opponent is a formidable lawyer. Hakamada's ex-lover!

891
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,630
She's Hakamada-sensei's ex-lover.

892
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,330
Hakamada-sensei was falsely accused
of stalking ten years ago,

893
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,930
and was fired from the law firm.

894
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:59,000
She used Hakamada-sensei
as a stepping stone

895
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,230
to get promoted at the law firm.

896
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:04,630
A dramatic past is revealed

897
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:05,820
There's no lawyer who can surpass
her ability to garner information.

898
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:09,470
This drama is a work of fiction

899
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,570
So for this particular case,

900
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:09,440
I think you should consult
a different lawyer.
