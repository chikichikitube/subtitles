(Aho = Idiot or Idiotic)

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:14,960
When this Ohoho bomb explodes,
it will kill all the humans!

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,570
Wait!!

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,230
Ah! Kentaro!

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,000
This is our secret base, it says "Do not enter",
did you not understand that?

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,160
You idiot!

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,400
Shut up, you!

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,100
I was speaking just now, don't overlap me!

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,630
Sorry about that, Kentaro!

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,230
Go to the back!

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,600
Don't tell her what to do!

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,160
But wait! You're my wife so... Stand behind me.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,920
Stupid!

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,830
I've placed transmitters on your heads
so I could find this place, you idiot!

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:49,900
Transmitters?

17
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,340
Why you...!

18
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,030
Oh, the switch!

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,830
Damn!

20
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,830
I feel so stupid!

21
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,830
You'll see!

22
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,430
The explosion of this Ohoho bomb
will destroy the entire planet!

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,620
What!?

24
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,450
What are you going to do, Kentaro?

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,450
I woun't allow that to happen!

26
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,960
Take this!

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,160
Aho Aho Man! Help!!

28
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,630
Are you idiot?

29
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:46,030
Aho Aho Man! We have to deactivate
this bomb or it'll be the end for us!

30
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,350
Please do something!

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,030
Aho Aho Camouflage!

32
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,630
And so it was easy, although...

33
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,430
What the hell are you doing?

34
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,160
We're still exposed to it!

35
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,430
Aho Aho Doppelganger!

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,430
Just kidding.

37
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,430
Just kidding?

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,630
Don't joke around!

39
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,650
Oh! You got something, don't you?

40
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,840
I trust you, let's do it!

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,500
Aho Aho Brother!

42
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,030
Aho Aho Brother

43
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,400
They are not blood related but know each other since they were kids and so, they refer to each other as brother.

44
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,760
Brother! Brother!

45
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
Enough already!

46
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,430
What the hell, why are you so filthy?

47
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,050
Turn around, lemme see it!

48
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,360
That's disgustingly big!

49
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,960
What is the matter with you...?

50
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,830
Stop it.

51
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,430
You showed it enough!

52
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,430
Aho Aho...

53
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,030
Music!

54
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,500
You screwed up right there!

55
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,450
Don't you feel embarrassed?

56
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,830
Aren't you going to do anything else?

57
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,450
Aho Aho Union!

58
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,950
When their feelings combine,
they will make the Aho Aho Union.

59
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,360
What is it? This feeling?

60
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,430
What are you doing?

61
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,700
Now! That was you last chance!

62
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:26,030
I'll explode this Ohoho bomb
now and everyone will die!

63
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,760
Take a look at this!

64
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,760
One press of this switch and this entire city will be reduced to ash-

65
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,830
Wait! Wait! What are you doing?

66
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,860
Reduced to?

67
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,230
This city will be reduced to ash-

68
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,230
Wa-wait! Wait!

69
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,230
Leave me alone!

70
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,630
It will be reduced to ashes!

71
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,630
What!?

72
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,500
However...

73
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:08,000
If you agree with one condition, I will leave the button alone

74
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,030
A condition... I'll make it!

75
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,760
Very well! The condition is-

76
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,430
Brother! Brother!

77
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,960
Die, both of you!!

78
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,230
Brother! Brother!

79
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,230
Union!

80
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,900
What is it? This feeling?

81
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,650
To be continued

82
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,900
That's enough already!
