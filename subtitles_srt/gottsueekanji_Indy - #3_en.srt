1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,670
Indy 3

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,250
Woah! look at that!

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,490
Blocking our way, a terribly pit!

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,560
What now, professor?

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,330
We might have to end
this exploration here.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,570
Look at that!

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,900
A trampoline!

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,970
Place it there, hurry!

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,140
That's it! That's it!

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,010
Professor...

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,010
- Hmm?

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,920
Will we really be able to
cross using this thing?

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,420
Hmm, true! I'll investigare first.

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,520
Please do!

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,890
First come here...

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:45,960
then...

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,190
when it comes to this...

18
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,630
It will work!

19
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,100
This might work but

20
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,300
just now you went that way and-

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,070
But jumping will work, don't worry!

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:00:59,810
Is that so?

23
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,840
So, Imada!

24
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,510
Do your best!

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,510
Leave it to me!

26
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,580
Leave it to me, everyone!

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,390
Today's exploration...

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,230
... is over!
