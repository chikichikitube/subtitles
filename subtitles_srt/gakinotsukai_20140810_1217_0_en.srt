The First Gaki No Tsukai Arahende Thorough Search Project!
Let's stroll around town until we find a celebrity!!

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,100
Daikanyama Edition!

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,290
Daikanyama Edition, that's dope.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,340
I can't believe we're still going.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,780
Right, we promised we would keep going.

8
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,270
I see, that's not the greatest of ideas.
Right, we promised we would keep going.

9
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,550
I see, that's not the greatest of ideas.

10
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,080
That's why we're in Daikanyama.
I see, that's not the greatest of ideas.

11
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,080
That's why we're in Daikanyama.

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,220
Daikanyama!

13
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,530
We should run into some famous people in this great city of Tokyo.

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,280
Right.

15
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,530
You know, Osaka is full of comedians.
Right.

16
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,090
You know, Osaka is full of comedians.

17
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,110
You are sure to find them there.

18
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,820
But you'll find actors and singers in Tokyo, everyoneâ€™s here.

19
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,620
Right, right.

20
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,110
Has anyone met some famous people around here?

21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,860
Well, I did meet someone at the Don Quixote in Nakameguro.

22
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,830
-In Daikanyama, you goon!
-Ouch!

23
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,890
-Of course, there are everywhere!
-You're out!

24
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,550
That guy was making fun of you.

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,180
I know.

26
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,120
Tokyo, Shibuya-Ward, Daikanyama.

27
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,800
All the cutting edge stores are gathered in this popular center for clothes stores, hair saloons, and cafes.

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,720
On top of that, it is also a celebrity town that hosts tons of famous people.

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,140
These are today's rules.

30
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,870
First off, we won't end until we find someone.

31
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,090
And they have to be on their personal time.

32
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,490
-They can't be filming something.
-Oh, I see!

33
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:17,750
Right, that wouldn't work.
-They can't be filming something.
-Oh, I see!

34
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,470
Right, that wouldn't work.

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,530
Next up,

36
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,170
you can't be like, "Who was that again?".

37
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:22,320
Right, right.
you can't be like, "Who was that again?".

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,880
Right, right.

39
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,830
-It's also rude.
-Right, right.

40
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,900
You have to say their full name.

41
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,360
And lastly we have to get permission to film.

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,020
-Right....
-We have to get the agency's permission.

43
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,240
That's the scariest part.

44
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,760
So, if they say no, we fail.

45
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,500
In the searing heat of 33 degrees Celsius.

46
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,070
The search begins now!

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,340
Will they clear the task?

48
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,560
Let's get going.

49
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,260
It's already hot!

50
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,300
Will we succeed?

51
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,160
I'm already sweating.

52
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,240
I think celebs around here are on high alert since there's a lot of recordings around here.

53
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,370
-Yeah, you're right.-That's true.

54
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,000
And they might even be in a bad mood when we find them.

55
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,080
Yeah, that could happen.

56
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,280
If you imagine how you'd react if they came...

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,820
Right, I would be so annoyed if it happened to me.
If you imagine how you'd react if they came...

58
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,050
Right, I would be so annoyed if it happened to me.

59
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,160
Of course, we're invading their time.
Right, I would be so annoyed if it happened to me.

60
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,760
Of course, we're invading their time.

61
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,120
I'd be like, "So annoying".
Of course, we're invading their time.

62
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,530
I'd be like, "So annoying".

63
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,000
I would lose my mind.
I'd be like, "So annoying".

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,140
I would lose my mind.

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,170
First off, the guys head toward the old Yamate street, towards Ebisu.

66
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,860
Then...

67
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,430
Whoa, this brings me back!

68
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,250
-I used to live here, you know.
-Huh?

69
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,040
Here.

70
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,920
Oh, really?

71
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,780
I didn't know.

72
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,660
This building?

73
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,860
Yes.

74
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,640
Whoa!

75
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,610
I was locked inside this parking lot.

76
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,870
Oh, is this the place?!

77
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,610
Here?

78
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,720
Yes, yes, yes.

79
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,460
Is that where Higashino's daughter spilled the wine...?

80
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,970
Yes, she spilled wine as soon as she moved in.

81
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,560
That's hilarious.

82
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,980
I told her to apologize but she never did.

83
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,000
Why?

84
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,040
Why did she have to?

85
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,460
The guys arrive at Daikanyama's central area after a five minute walk.

86
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,820
They must be drinking some tea around here, right?

87
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,300
Right?

88
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,350
The mood is really good for celebs here.

89
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,800
Like in this terrace.

90
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,970
I wonder if Kouji Tamaki is having some tea around here.

91
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,220
Is he there?

92
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,030
-It's super empty.
-There's no one inside.

93
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,760
We're crossing.

94
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,670
If he was drinking, he'd be at the back.

95
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,790
Yeah, you're probably right.

96
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,230
Maybe he's doing some shopping.

97
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,750
-That could be totally possible.
-Yes, some shopping!

98
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,680
I've never seen a place like this.

99
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,720
That's amazing.

100
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,920
Have you seen any famous people around here?

101
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:18,960
Well, you guys.

102
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,410
Oh no, I mean other than us.

103
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,580
Ehm... Well...

104
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,540
Who was it?

105
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,580
He's got a duty of confidentiality, right?

106
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,590
He can't be telling us who comes and goes through this store.

107
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,900
We just need some info.

108
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,500
I'll say bad things about this store if you don't tell us.

109
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,430
You're the worst.

110
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,480
Sorry about this.

111
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,200
Thanks.

112
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,870
The guys didn't get any useful information... But that was expected.

113
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,420
Oh, there must be someone having a drink here, for sure.

114
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,040
-I'm sure of it.
-This place looks amazing.

115
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,340
They run away as soon as they see us.

116
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,260
Right, right.

117
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,320
Should we try crossing?

118
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,930
-Let's go.
-Let's try.

119
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,380
I'm absolutely positive someone famous is having a drink here.

120
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,370
With that being said, the guys head into Tsutaya Bookstore's T-Site.

121
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,260
However...

122
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,890
-We managed to cross the street.
-Yes, we have arrived.

123
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,720
Which way?
This way?

124
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,970
We can't go that way.

125
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,760
Oh, we can't go this way?

126
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,170
We can't walk that way?!

127
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh my!

128
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,620
Having this road blocked is gonna hurt.

129
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:15,790
We can't go that way?!
Having this road blocked is gonna hurt.

130
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,530
We can't go that way?!

131
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,110
I see.

132
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,520
We need permission.

133
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,530
Then, Shozo, you go have a look.
See if anyone's over there.

134
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,180
Good idea.

135
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,040
-Can we do that?
-That's fine.

136
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,670
-We can't take the cameras over there.
-Right, right.

137
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,210
Take a look.

138
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,750
And just in case, don't get caught if they are doing the same thing as us.

139
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,990
Of course.

140
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,710
Right.

141
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,740
So, Endo will be infiltrating Tsutaya Bookstores.

142
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,530
What should we do now?

143
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,140
Let's go in and have some tea.

144
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,410
For the time being, right?

145
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,250
-We have to hydrate ourselves.
-Or we'll die.

146
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,630
But at that moment...

147
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,680
Huh? He's wearing a mask.

148
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,280
Right.

149
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,830
He's holding a guitar too.

150
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,010
-He has a guitar.
-No way, no way.

151
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:55,030
Heâ€™s a musician.
-He has a guitar.
-No way, no way.

152
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,320
Heâ€™s a musician.

153
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,660
He's got no aura though.

154
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,850
But he might be someone big.

155
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,620
10 minutes since Endo's infiltration.

156
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,580
-He's back.
-Oh, he's back.

157
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,960
How was it?

158
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,890
I found nothing.

159
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,510
Really?

160
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,690
Then hurry up and get back.
I want you to run.

161
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:11,010
Yes.

162
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,350
Why are you walking around all leisurely?

163
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,760
I went all the way down there.

164
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,280
Don't care.

165
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,320
It's because you were taking your sweet time.

166
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,370
-I think that's why he's angry.
-Yeah, he's right.

167
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,920
He wants you to come running as soon as you find anything.

168
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,550
He's in a pretty bad mood.

169
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,710
It's because of the heat.

170
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,570
-Shozo!!
-Yes!

171
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,850
Go have a look inside that store over there.

172
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,030
Over there?

173
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,430
-Go on, young man! And hurry
-Yes!

174
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,870
-Roger that!
-Don't get too tired.

175
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,130
Ehm... We should cross this road, right?

176
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,510
Cross, cross!

177
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,290
Alright.

178
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,580
With that, Endo is going searching alone once again.

179
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,400
From where to where is Daikanyama supposed to be?

180
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,670
I mean, the train station is right down there.

181
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,060
So, does that mean Daikanyama is all the way up to the station?

182
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,560
Have you seen any celebrities around here?
So, does that mean Daikanyama is all the way up to the station?

183
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,500
Have you seen any celebrities around here?

184
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,510
Huh?

185
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,710
Have you seen any celebrities down there?

186
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,420
Well, we saw Endo running around.

187
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,590
No, not that guy!

188
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,170
He's not not a celebrity.

189
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,710
What was Endo doing at that moment?

190
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,730
Hamada is on edge today.

191
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,350
He came at me out of nowhere.

192
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,380
He's so on edge today.

193
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,240
I was a bit shocked.

194
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,880
-I'm going in.
-Alright.

195
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,000
Endo hurries up into this popular restaurant to avoid annoying the moody Hamada.

196
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,300
What will he find?

197
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,990
Nothing.

198
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,360
-Nothing?
-Nothing.

199
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,080
They asked me what I was doing.

200
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,210
Endo came up empty handed.

201
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,800
In contrast, Hosei might have found something big!

202
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,050
Huh?

203
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,680
Huh?!

204
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,470
Hold on, hold on!

205
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,580
Huh? Really?

206
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,590
What is it?

207
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,240
Huh?

208
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,930
Who did Hosei find?

209
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,560
Are you that celebrity? Ms. XXXXXX?

210
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,340
Huh?!

211
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,040
It's been 30 minutes since they started.

212
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,180
Did they have a big breakout?

213
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,320
-Huh?
-Huh?
-Hold on, hold on!

214
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,460
You're kidding me.

215
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,350
What is it?

216
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,040
Huh?

217
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,950
Who did Hosei find?

218
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,950
Huh?

219
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,420
She's a celebrity, Ms. Rina.

220
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,180
Huh?!

221
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,040
-Ms. Rina, right?
-Yes, I go by that name.

222
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,340
What do you do?

223
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,580
I am with CanCam.
What do you do?

224
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,370
I am with CanCam.

225
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,010
Model?

226
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:38,330
Yes.

227
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,030
A model!

228
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,320
Oh, I see...

229
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,860
We're done!

230
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:41,520
Amazing!

231
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,890
We won!

232
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,130
What?
We won!

233
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,250
What?

234
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,430
Ehm... You're okay with the shoot, right?

235
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,070
As long as I get Repro's permission.

236
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,220
-Your agency?
-What is 'Repro'.

237
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,640
-Oh, your agency.
-Is that your agency?

238
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,450
-She's Ms. Re-Re-Re?
-Ms. Rerina.

239
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:52,960
Huh?

240
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,730
Repro.

241
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,390
Ah, Ms. Repro.

242
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,650
You're from the agency Repro, right?

243
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,410
Repro is the agency's name!

244
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,000
That's not my name!
Repro is the agency's name!

245
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,950
That's not my name!

246
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,880
The model, Rina!

247
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,950
She's been one of CanCam's, a fashion magazine, exclusive models since 2009.

248
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:13,720
Starting at Tokyo's Girl Collection, she had worked on countless fashion shows and appeared on many commercials.

249
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,570
She's a top class model!

250
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,950
The show's producers are already getting her agency's approval.

251
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,370
However, something is bothering them.

252
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,600
-You haven't worked with any of us, right?
-I haven't.

253
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,610
Oh, really?

254
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,430
No wonder...

255
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,000
I think I've seen her.
No wonder...

256
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,310
No wonder...

257
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,200
-For real?
-Really?

258
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,620
Yes.

259
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,030
In a commercial, I think.

260
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,300
Oh...

261
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:36,810
Right?

262
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,730
That one, right?

263
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,890
The one with the salad dressing!

264
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,430
It's not me.

265
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,590
No one knows her.

266
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,880
Hold on a second.

267
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,010
Sure.

268
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,440
I'm just getting things sorted.
Sure.

269
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,480
I'm just getting things sorted.

270
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,840
-Excuse us.
-Excuse us.

271
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,610
Well, yeah...

272
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,720
Anyway...

273
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,080
So, I asked her, "Are you a celebrity?".

274
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,040
Oh...

275
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,240
I thought she was Anne Watanabe.

276
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,520
That's a super big name.

277
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,160
If you do find someone of her caliber, just ignore her.

278
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,640
We won't get her on the show either way.

279
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,340
Right.

280
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,120
Yeah.

281
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,600
And the result is...

282
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,170
They said it's okay.

283
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,920
Okay?

284
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,230
Do the rules allow this?

285
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,310
She can be on camera...

286
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,490
But unfortunately none of you were able to say her name.

287
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,120
Right, right.

288
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,800
And the rules say one of you has to say her full name.

289
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,690
-So it doesn't count.
-You're right.
And the rules say one of you has to say her full name.

290
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,600
And the rules say one of you has to say her full name.

291
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,730
Did we have that rule?

292
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,750
With that being said, the task is not complete because of that rule.

293
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,000
No way...

294
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,390
I'm sorry.
No way...

295
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:36,740
I'm sorry.

296
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:36,880
-She had an amazing aura.
-Really?
I'm sorry.

297
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,790
-She had an amazing aura.
-Really?

298
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,570
Thank you.
-She had an amazing aura.
-Really?

299
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,120
Thank you.

300
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,360
Thanks.
Thank you.

301
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,840
Thanks.

302
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,280
Sorry for bothering you.

303
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,990
Thank you.

304
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,470
Isn't this Abareru-kun?

305
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,270
-Abareru-kun.
-He's not.

306
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,550
He doesn't look anything like him.
That's just an old man.

307
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,520
It isn't Abareru-kun?

308
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,450
Did they let go of a big fish?

309
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,120
Only God knows.

310
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,760
The perfect celeb would be Yoko Kumada.

311
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,420
Yeah, Yoko Kumada would be perfect for this.

312
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,720
She's like the perfect fit.

313
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,760
And she'd be able to be on camera too.

314
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,490
What do you mean by 'perfect fit'?

315
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,740
-She'd be great.
-Right?

316
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,760
And everyone knows her too.

317
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,080
Next up, the guys are going into Daikanyama's landmark address.

318
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,010
Whoa, there's gotta be someone on that terrace.

319
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,050
Endo, go check it out.

320
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,970
Like, there could be a soccer player there.

321
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,480
I feel like Masaaki Sakai would enjoy this place.

322
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,360
Should we have a look upstairs?

323
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,940
-Then go get permission to film.
-Sure.

324
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,880
Endo starts running to get the filming permission.

325
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,440
Why is Endo holding his hip all the time?

326
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,650
Does his hip hurt?

327
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,320
Does your hip hurt?

328
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,220
M-M-M-Mi...

329
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:38,870
Huh?

330
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,680
It's my mic!

331
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,180
What was that?

332
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,270
That wasn't funny at all.

333
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,960
He was trying to make a joke, wasn't he?

334
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,560
It was that joke...

335
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,610
He was trying to act it out.

336
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,720
It was like that joke you were trying to make at the recording.

337
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,510
Oh, that joke?
It was like that joke you were trying to make at the recording.

338
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,750
It was like that joke you were trying to make at the recording.

339
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,850
It wasn't funny at all.

340
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,990
He went like, "M-M-M-Mi..."

341
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,780
So it's really packed inside.

342
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,670
Is it full?

343
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,960
But they told me it's okay as long as we do it on the terrace.

344
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,020
But it's super hot!

345
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,170
And we can also film there.

346
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,350
Let's go.

347
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,580
But they have some chairs...

348
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:15,900
We can come up with a strategy.

349
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,040
-And we can search from up there.
-Right!

350
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,010
We couldn't do that inside.

351
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,240
-We can look at the pedestrians.
-Let's go.

352
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:27,100
Time for the open-terrace strategic meeting overlooking the street.

353
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,310
And they won't know we're filming as long as we're here.

354
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,140
Right, right.

355
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,190
If they find something I'll go down.

356
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,940
If we do find someone, we have to make sure we get them on.
If they find something I'll go down.

357
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,610
If we do find someone, we have to make sure we get them on.

358
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,760
You can jump from here, right?

359
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,960
Right? Endo?

360
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,750
I-I don't think I can jump.

361
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,760
-I don't think that's possible.
-Really?

362
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,570
Let's not do that.

363
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,470
Right.

364
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,550
Hold on, climbing up is impossible.

365
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,750
But you can surely jump down.

366
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,500
Right.

367
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,820
Tanaka's diligent search continues...
On the other hand...

368
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,190
I feel alive!

369
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,100
This is so freaking good.

370
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,390
Super good?

371
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,300
Huh?

372
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,300
Huh?

373
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,370
Did we give up?

374
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,350
We can't keep searching.

375
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,200
You can't?

376
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,120
You know, I've been trying so hard to find anyone.

377
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,520
My heart can't take it anymore.

378
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,290
It's broken.

379
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,820
But we can't search beyond here anyway, right?

380
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,610
-How much is left?
-About two stoplights.

381
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,920
And there's another street back there.

382
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,800
-That's the area?
-Yes.

383
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:31,770
I see...

384
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,040
If worst comes to worst we can go up to Nakameguro.
I see...

385
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,640
If worst comes to worst we can go up to Nakameguro.

386
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,320
Rather than Nakameguro, I think our chances are better at Ebisu.

387
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,040
The Nakameguro at Don Quixote is pretty, pretty good.

388
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,400
Do you have to say that word twice?

389
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,980
You used 'pretty' one too many times.

390
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,060
You can't be using that many 'pretties' in one sentence.

391
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:00,950
Leaving the restaurant's terrace, the guys finally arrive at Daikanyama's landmark, Address!

392
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,310
So we're at the center now, right?

393
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,570
I see, I see...
So we're at the center now, right?

394
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,400
I see, I see...

395
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,570
-There's no one around.
-Right.

396
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,040
If Kumada is not here then we're never gonna find anyone.

397
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,230
Kumada has nothing to do with this.

398
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,600
Yoko Kumada is not coming, huh?

399
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,310
There's a supermarket over there.

400
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:17,780
Yeah?

401
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,560
There might be someone shopping there.

402
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,200
Shopping?
There might be someone shopping there.

403
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,680
There might be someone shopping there.

404
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,590
I see...

405
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,480
For real?

406
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,890
I'm gonna take a look.

407
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,470
Sure.

408
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,120
It's hot too.

409
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,760
It'd be nice if some celeb just came out of this bathroom after a dump.

410
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,820
I would hate to be caught like that.

411
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,800
Like, Hiroshi Tamaki coming out of here.

412
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,290
After taking a dump.

413
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,530
It'd be nice he came out saying, "Oh man, my stomach hurts so much!".

414
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,520
10 minutes after Hosei's infiltration.

415
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,130
Huh?

416
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,710
You were cooling off, weren't you?

417
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,440
Huh?

418
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,330
You were cooling off, weren't you?

419
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,210
You just went to cool yourself off.

420
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:53,600
No way, no at all.
You just went to cool yourself off.

421
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,350
No way, no at all.

422
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,620
Then why were you making that face?

423
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,680
I mean, I just heard there might be someone in there.

424
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,030
You know, we've been waiting for you.

425
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,670
-We were waiting.
-I thought there was someone in there.

426
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,910
-Was it cool inside?
-Yeah

427
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,530
Of course, it's a supermarket.

428
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,390
In the end only Hosei got to cool off.

429
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,630
Then...

430
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,580
Huh?

431
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,720
Who is that?

432
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,830
-She looks like a model.
-Right, a model.

433
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,620
Are you by any chance a model?
-She looks like a model.
-Right, a model.

434
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,630
Are you by any chance a model?

435
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,120
Yes.

436
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,250
-Do you work as a model?
-Yes.

437
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,630
Whoa.

438
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,590
I knew it.

439
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,130
Have you been on King's Brunch?
(King's Brunch is a morning variety show)

440
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:30,720
I have not.

441
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,920
Not at all.

442
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,320
After a bit of investigation, we found out that she's only starting out as a model.

443
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,450
What a shame.

444
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,420
Is there anyone famous at your agency?

445
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,050
Well there's a lot of models.

446
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:44,670
For example?

447
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,970
That's this girl, Anna Yano.

448
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,440
-Anna Yano?
-Anna Yano?
-Yes.

449
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,500
She's been in "JELLY" and in "Nuts".

450
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,130
We didn't understand a single word you just said.

451
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,460
-Nuts?!
-Nuts??

452
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,950
-Jelly?
-What is that?

453
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,170
This the sad reality of a generational gap.

454
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,950
It seems like Daikanyama, the town at the edge of fashion, is a bit too harsh for these old men.

455
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,560
After that, the guys walked around Address without much luck.

456
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,390
Come on, we have to find someone.

457
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,970
I really wanna find someone.

458
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,230
I wanna be shocked.

459
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,420
But, who would you like to see?

460
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,960
I would love to find Makoto Nonomura.

461
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,140
That's great! Mr. Makoto!

462
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,760
That'd be great.

463
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:27,970
He'd come out screaming, "What are you doing?!!"
That'd be great.

464
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,450
He'd come out screaming, "What are you doing?!!"

465
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,260
Honestly, I would love to meet the daughter of Okada from "Masudaokada".
(Happy Boy is a character of Keisuke Okada's)

466
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,750
I know her pretty well too.

467
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,950
Alright, someone's gonna pop right out of there.

468
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,980
-Just like that?
-Get ready, Kumada is coming.

469
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,160
Here comes Kumada, bam!

470
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,670
5 seconds before Yoko Kumada's appearance.

471
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,730
5 seconds til Yoko Kumada appears.

472
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,230
Damn it.

473
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,140
It would be the best if she was really here.

474
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,670
It really would be.

475
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,960
But no one would believe us.

476
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,250
Right, there's no way.

477
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,640
With no goal, these old guys kept walking beneath the scorching sun.

478
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,240
And once again, they arrive at the T-Site right by Tsutaya Bookstores.

479
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,930
Let's all go inside for now.

480
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,030
-Then we'll split up and search around.
This is a big place so...
-Right, good idea.

481
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,010
And then we'll come back.
-Then we'll split up and search around.
This is a big place so...
-Right, good idea.

482
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,630
-Then we'll split up and search around.
This is a big place so...
-Right, good idea.

483
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,880
-Let's do that then.
-Alright then, we'll be back soon.

484
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,320
-We'll be inside.
-Right.

485
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,410
We're sorry if we don't come back.

486
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,460
If that happens you can wrap up.

487
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,410
Understood?

488
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:21,720
Sure.

489
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,250
What are we gonna do?

490
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,100
I don't know...

491
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,230
Shall we have some tea?

492
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,870
That is the only thing we have left.

493
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,270
Yeah.

494
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,460
Splitting up is such a drag, just go ask over there.

495
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,240
Or you know, there's an Ousho right by the station.
Let's go to Ousho.
(Japanese chain of Chinese food)

496
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:48,800
What?!

497
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,460
Ousho.

498
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,830
-We're not going to Ousho.

499
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,130
Are you hungry?
-We're not going to Ousho.

500
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:51,390
Are you hungry?

501
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:51,750
Yeah.

502
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,480
It's Osaka's Ousho, you know?

503
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,540
Shut up!

504
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,020
The guys are just walking back and forth...

505
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,900
But then!

506
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:03,500
Whoa!

507
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,180
-A bird pooped on me!
-Huh?

508
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,500
-Huh?
-Whoa!

509
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:07,910
You're kidding.

510
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,190
No way.

511
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,060
It's true.

512
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,070
Whoa, it's true.
It's true.

513
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:09,840
Whoa, it's true.

514
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,550
Hand me a tissue.

515
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,280
Insult to injury.

516
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,020
That's the worst.

517
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,050
Where is that bird?

518
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:16,790
The worst.

519
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,640
He's got bird poop all over.

520
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,810
-Senpai!

521
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,720
Ugh, it's not coming off.

522
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,680
I wanna go home.

523
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,050
It's been about 1h 30min since they started looking.

524
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,470
But in hopes of finding someone famous, they keep walking!

525
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,150
You guys also have to look at the biker's faces.

526
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:43,510
Sure.

527
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,860
We could run into Claude Maki.

528
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,040
Right.

529
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,690
And he could be riding with Mike Maki.

530
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,650
Those two sure get along!

531
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,190
Just then, the guys laid eyes on a passing car...

532
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:58,720
Huh?

533
00:17:59,440 --> 00:17:59,950
-What?
-What?

534
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,590
Oh! Ah!

535
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,300
Huh?

536
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:03,460
Who is it?

537
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,750
Oh, hello.

538
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,210
Yes, yes, yes.

539
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:06,750
Who was that?

540
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,540
Who was it?

541
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,040
Wasn't that Sakai, from "Alco & Peace"?

542
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,480
No way, no way.

543
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,400
Wasn't he one of the Alco & Peace guys?

544
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,000
Who? Who?

545
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,140
One of the Alco & Peace guys.

546
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,320
-Alco & Peace...
-Chris?!

547
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,680
One of the Alco & Peace guys?

548
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,410
What?

549
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,740
Wasn't he one of the Alco & Peace guys?

550
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:19,960
-A comedian?
-Yes
Wasn't he one of the Alco & Peace guys?

551
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,280
-A comedian?
-Yes

552
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,000
A comedian?

553
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,070
-No way...
-It's just a lookalike.

554
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,760
I didn't see so I don't know.

555
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,610
He was driving the car.

556
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,760
-Really?
-It was probably not him.

557
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,240
It wasn't?!

558
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,440
I don't think so.
I know those guys pretty well.

559
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,310
That's the worst!

560
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,540
I'm sure he was one of the Alco & Peace guys.
That's the worst!

561
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,910
I'm sure he was one of the Alco & Peace guys.

562
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,080
Forget about it, Tanaka.
It wasn't them.

563
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,010
These two certainly look alike...

564
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:49,380
But just to be sure, we confirmed that Alco & Peace was in the middle of a shoot in Sendai.

565
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,010
It was a complete case of mistaken identity.

566
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,430
This place is prime for celebrities.

567
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:54,930
For a moment I thought...
This place is prime for celebrities.

568
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,520
For a moment I thought...

569
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,560
-I thought that was Ayabe.
-Me too.
(Yuji Ayabe)

570
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,240
I though the was Ayabe.

571
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,710
Ayabe... Right, I could see him hanging around here.
I though the was Ayabe.

572
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,660
Ayabe... Right, I could see him hanging around here.

573
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:00,980
He really looks like Ayabe.
Ayabe... Right, I could see him hanging around here.

574
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,930
He really looks like Ayabe.

575
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,080
What about these two?

576
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,300
I feel like I've seen them before...

577
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,420
There are many lookalikes, but the guys have not met a single celebrity.

578
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,520
So the guys have no choice but to keep walking!

579
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,550
There's no one here.

580
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,790
We got nothing.

581
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,480
Come on...

582
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,370
We came here cause they told us there was gonna be Kumada Yoko here.

583
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,520
There's some AKB looking girls coming towards us.

584
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,240
You're right.

585
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:35,780
These girls are AKB.

586
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:35,990
But you have to be able to name them.
These girls are AKB.

587
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,690
But you have to be able to name them.

588
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,920
No way.

589
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,690
Are you girls from AKB?

590
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:42,680
They're not.

591
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,110
You're not from AKB right?

592
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,840
Whoa, amazing!

593
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,480
Those are the guys from "Gaki Tsukai"!!

594
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,470
She knows us...

595
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,020
Let's try harder.

596
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:54,960
Let's try even harder.

597
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,200
Why'd she have to say it like that?
Let's try even harder.

598
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,160
Why'd she have to say it like that?

599
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,660
"They're the guys from 'Gaki Tsukai'"

600
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,680
What the hell are we doing?

601
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,270
After a bit of depression... The tables are turning!

602
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,410
Huh?

603
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,730
She's definitely a model.

604
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:10,710
But you don't know her name.

605
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,070
See?

606
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,120
She's greeting us.

607
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:14,490
Huh?

608
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:15,780
You're not a model?

609
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,370
Why did she greet us?

610
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,970
Oh, she's a singer.

611
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,940
-She's a singer!
-Singer!

612
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,430
A singer!

613
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,570
She's a singer!

614
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,170
What does she sing?

615
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:27,600
Hello.

616
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,340
Could you come out here for a sec?

617
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,620
Is she a singer?

618
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,690
Thank you for having me at "Hey! Hey! Hey!".
(Music variety show)

619
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,200
She's been on Hey! Hey! Hey!

620
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,410
It's been a while.

621
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,510
Oh, right...

622
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,900
You don't remember, do you?

623
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,380
You're an amazing singer, right?

624
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,230
You definitely don't remember me.

625
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,240
The artist, MiChi!

626
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,140
In 2008, she made her major debut with the song "Promise".

627
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:59,430
She stormed into the music world with her exciting performance and electrifying sound!

628
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,910
She's currently a popular figure in the club music world.

629
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,480
-Sorry for bothering you.
Are you on your break?
-Sorry to bother you.

630
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,780
Since none of them knew her name...

631
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,520
The task is not cleared yet.

632
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,400
There's lots of people like that.

633
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,490
-You guys should have gone like, "Oh! It's MiChi!".
-Right!

634
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,480
Whoa!

635
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:24,890
Who is it?

636
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:25,760
%&#&*!!

637
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,290
Hello!

638
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,580
Shiohaku 2014 has been announced!

639
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,790
This year with an exclusive Gaki Tsukai Earth Defense Force Pavilion!

640
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,980
We'll be waiting for you at Shiodome's biggest comedy place!

641
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,210
It's been nearly 2 hours since the start of the search.

642
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,230
The members have an unexpected meeting.

643
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,040
Ah! Ah! Ah!

644
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,620
Who is it?

645
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,450
It's Hinoki!

646
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,030
Hello.

647
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:56,800
Oh!

648
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,620
Hello.

649
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,300
It's Hinoki!

650
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,520
-Whoa!
-I haven't seen you in a while!

651
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,390
But you don't have anything to do with our current project!

652
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,250
Sorry...

653
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,710
The former comedian, Hiroaki Hinoki!

654
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:14,040
He made his debut at Yoshimoto Knockoff Club in 1990 as a second generation.

655
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:20,350
For a while he was also the opening act for Gaki alongside his partner, Tomono.

656
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,060
Hinoki, it's been a while!!

657
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,220
-It has.
-Is this your business?

658
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:25,820
Yes.

659
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,230
Oh, I see.

660
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
-Here?
-Amazing.

661
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:29,710
This terrace cafe?

662
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,260
Yes.

663
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,320
Why is Hinoki here?

664
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,210
Sorry...

665
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,970
-This is so unexpected.
-Did you quit showbiz?

666
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,450
Yes.

667
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,400
See you then.

668
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,500
Yes, see you.

669
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,920
Alright.

670
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,100
He is currently out of show business.
So the task is still not done.

671
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:49,740
It's already been 3 hours since they began walking around town in search for a celebrity.

672
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,880
This is their third time at Tsutaya Bookstore.

673
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,660
So what if we don't find anything...?

674
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,980
-It's a big problem.
-Right?

675
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,260
We won't get to go home.

676
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,730
But we have no choice but to wrap up now.

677
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,170
Oh, you're already saying that?

678
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:09,970
Here it comes.

679
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:18,470
Just as Hamada said, the end of the shoot was rather disappointing.

680
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,130
That's why I told these guys.

681
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,390
I told them Daikanyama wouldn't work out.

682
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,100
Hold on, the staff are the ones that decided.

683
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,250
-You should have told us sooner.
-Matsumoto, you also said you knew Daikanyama.

684
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,890
It was bad.

685
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:37,070
But you know, the Daikanyama I know is different from the Daikanyama you know.
The areas are totally different.
It was bad.

686
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,140
But you know, the Daikanyama I know is different from the Daikanyama you know.
The areas are totally different.

687
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,810
But we just went around the whole area...

688
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,450
There's a different way of looking at the Daikanyama area.
But we just went around the whole area...

689
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,640
There's a different way of looking at the Daikanyama area.

690
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:51,410
And it all depends on who you ask.

691
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,310
-Let's try our best next time.
-Yeah.

692
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,590
It couldn't be helped.

693
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,860
It was a shame.

694
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,680
Let's go home.

695
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,640
In the end, they did not find a single celebrity.

696
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,540
That's just impossible.

697
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,440
You're right.
