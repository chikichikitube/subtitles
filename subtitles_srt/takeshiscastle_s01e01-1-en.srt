1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,170
THIS PROGRAM WAS PRODUCED UNDER
THE SUPERVISION OF MEDICAL EXPERTS,

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,870
TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HEALTH
AND SAFETY OF THE STAFF AND CONTESTANTS.

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,370
After 34 years, the battles
at Takeshi's Castle are ready to return.

4
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,900
TAKESHI'S CASTLE
THE COUNT'S TOWER

5
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,130
-No way!
-What? What is it?

6
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,500
What happened?

7
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,070
We're under attack by an army.

8
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,270
OSAMU SHITARA - YUKI HIMURA

9
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,230
An army?

10
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,000
But it's been peaceful
for the last 34 years.

11
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,170
What shall we do? This is not good.

12
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,600
Well, I'm afraid that...

13
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,530
-the count has gone missing.
-He's gone?

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,330
COUNT TAKESHI IS MISSING

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,830
That must be why they're attacking.

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,530
I see. What shall we do?

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,270
-We'll be fine.
-We will?

18
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,670
Even in the count's absence,
Takeshi's Castle has a powerful army

19
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,500
of warriors to protect it.

20
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,400
That's right.

21
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,730
They can demolish our opponent.

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,570
Matter of fact,
let's visit our first warrior.

23
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,830
-Let's go.
-All right.

24
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,230
Here we go!

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,730
Is this a dream, an illusion or reality?

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,670
Rugged warriors shake off their slumber
to answer the call for battle.

27
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,900
Gather now, warriors,
in the luscious Midoriyama Forest!

28
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,800
THE YEAR 1986

29
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,700
Ready, go.

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,730
Charge!

31
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,930
On May 2nd, 1986,
a colossal battle broke loose

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,800
which later came to be known
as the thrilling anything-goes-type show,

33
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,130
"Takeshi's Castle."

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,530
THE IMPENETRABLE CASTLE

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,500
A castle so impenetrable
it was said to be protected by the Gods.

36
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:23,030
Out of 127 battles,
only 8 challengers ever saw victory.

37
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,130
8 WINS, 118 LOSSES, 1 DRAW
WIN RATE 0.06%

38
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,670
150 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE
OVER 34 YEARS

39
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,370
Its dreadful name
echoed all over the world.

40
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,800
And now, 34 years later...

41
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,730
JAPAN

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,430
...the castle has reemerged
in the Land of the Rising Sun.

43
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,700
RESURRECTION

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,870
THE YEAR 2023

45
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,970
Charge!

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,770
Takeshi's Castle is back!

47
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,430
Fortified with extravagance and fortitude,

48
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,570
packed with new games,

49
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,470
it's the palace of your dreams!

50
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,300
From all over Japan...
Nay, all over the world...

51
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,470
WHO WILL EMERGE
AS THE BOLDEST WARRIOR?

52
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,630
Attention seekers, clowns,
athletes and plain fools...

53
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,470
NO TIME FOR FEAR

54
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,570
...the best of the best
have gathered for a chance to taste glory

55
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,070
and endured grueling hours of filming.
So, we're in for a treat.

56
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,170
I'll bring justice upon you numbskulls!

57
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,130
Will it be do or die?

58
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,630
No one can predict
what will happen in this grand battle.

59
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,270
The castle remains lavish,
regardless of the economy.

60
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,530
TAKE NO PRISONERS

61
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,430
Victory is ours!

62
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,330
I'm gutted.

63
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,900
WHAT AWAITS THE CHALLENGERS?

64
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,370
Nostalgia and novelty,
comedy and drama, a show that will toy…

65
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,270
IS IT DESPAIR?

66
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,600
…with your emotions.

67
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,930
My name is Hakuzen Kanda,
and I'm confident...

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,830
OR HOPE?

69
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,030
...that there is no bigger fan
of Takeshi's Castle than me.

70
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,470
TEAR IT DOWN

71
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,400
Which is why I've been talking
incessantly in this intro.

72
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,370
TO TAKE HOME

73
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,470
ONE MILLION YEN

74
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,770
Did I make it?

75
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,800
I will destroy you!

76
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,400
I did it!

77
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,600
Here we go!

78
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,930
Take this!

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,200
Have a look for yourself and you will see.

80
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,170
Fall, fall till you can fall no further.

81
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,130
Struggle as you may,
he has you in the palm of his hand.

82
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,530
DANCE...

83
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,130
The man of the hour
that you've all waited for...

84
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:30,170
IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND

85
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,870
ARMY VS TAKESHI

86
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,170
Takeshi's Castle!

87
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,900
TAKESHI'S CASTLE

88
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,370
It's been 34 years since the first battles
to take Takeshi's Castle came to an end.

89
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,570
Three fortresses protect Takeshi's Castle.

90
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,130
An army of 100 people
look to breach its walls.

91
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,330
Thanks to the latest technologies,
the inner citadel has teleported

92
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,100
right next to the first fortress.

93
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,830
The castle is prepared for battle.

94
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,570
Seven gates obstruct the Army's path.

95
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,470
THE FIRST FORTRESS BATTLE

96
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,570
The wail of the horn
marks the start of our first battle.

97
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,470
We opened auditions to the public,

98
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,570
out of which we chose one hundred
of the best of the best.

99
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,630
We cast a wide net,
from junior high school students

100
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,930
to people in their 60s.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,630
We have idols, X-ray technicians,
YouTubers and college students,

102
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,830
all with a burning passion
to take down the castle.

103
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,570
What will become of them?

104
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,900
THE FIRST CASTLE
UEDA CASTLE

105
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,500
Here we are.

106
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,000
-Ueda Castle, right?
-That's correct.

107
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,230
Here he comes!

108
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,600
It's him.

109
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,730
THE FIRST CASTLE'S LORD
SHINYA UEDA

110
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,700
I'm gonna bring down Takeshi's Castle!

111
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,470
Wait, you've got it all wrong.

112
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,330
-No. You're in Takeshi's army.
-No!

113
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,300
-Am I?
-Obviously.

114
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,400
My apologies, I'll do my best
to protect Takeshi's Castle.

115
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,300
Do you really mean that?

116
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,930
Well, this is momentous.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,670
-How long has it been?
-It's 34 years.

118
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,000
I remember watching this show…

119
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,900
That's right.

120
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,270
…every week and wanting to join.

121
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,900
The Dragon God's Pond
is the most memorable for me.

122
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,600
-Yes.
-It was exhilarating to watch.

123
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,100
The way people would fail was dangerous,
thinking back on it now.

124
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,530
Since it's been 34 years,

125
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,700
we've brought back some older games,
as well as prepared some new ones.

126
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,970
And the older games
have also been made more difficult.

127
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,570
-Really?
-That's impressive.

128
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,170
They were
already pretty difficult back then.

129
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,370
Some were impossible to finish,
and now they're even harder.

130
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,930
However, as for Count Takeshi...

131
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,330
he's currently missing.

132
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,470
What do you mean?

133
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,900
-We have no idea why.
-No idea.

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,570
No clue.
But we have this AI Count instead.

135
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,370
Shall we try speaking with it?

136
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,900
The Reiwa era castle is a new beast.

137
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,970
Since Count Takeshi
has a habit of disappearing,

138
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,370
we've created
a virtual count using AI technology.

139
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,000
We can now ask him
about strategies at any time.

140
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,900
AI COUNT

141
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,030
Let's meet the AI Count.

142
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,330
What... the heck is this?

143
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,170
Isn't it great?

144
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,270
-Good to see you, my lord.
-Hey, Ueda.

145
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,800
You've gotten better
at navigating prime time TV.

146
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,870
He's full of compliments.

147
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,530
He's praising you.

148
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,730
That makes me happy.
Has AI come this far already?

149
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,570
The AI version
of Count Takeshi is so sweet.

150
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,730
My lord, your team
is having a great year, aren't they?

151
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,970
The Yakult Swallows, you mean?
Well, they...

152
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,700
Are you sure this is the AI speaking?

153
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,300
Hold on.
Please don't derail the conversation.

154
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,870
It seemed like you caught him off guard.

155
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,200
He was struggling
to nail down the impression.

156
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,470
-I'll admit, it was barely an impression.
-Are you sure it's an AI?

157
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,970
-Isn't it just him speaking into a mic?
-No. It's AI.

158
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,670
I'd like to remind you of our premise.

159
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,200
Your motivation is to defeat the army.

160
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,530
I'll protect this castle at all costs!

161
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,900
Your acting is horrible.

162
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,770
NARRATOR: JUN HATTORI

163
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,030
Takeshi's Castle's gates

164
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,600
at the highest plateau
of Mt. Midoriyama have opened.

165
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,600
Look at this scale.

166
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,900
-This is the future.
-I guarantee this is not CGI.

167
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,970
I'd believe it if you told me it was.

168
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,200
They were been built from scratch.

169
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,170
THE BORDER WALL

170
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,800
It's been a long-standing tradition

171
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,130
to start the show
with our first challenge, the Border Wall.

172
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,900
This challenge has seen many iterations.

173
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,600
What will the latest version look like?

174
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,900
It's the Border Wall.

175
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,600
There's a lot of people.

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,600
And a wide variety at that.

177
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,700
Here we have the commander of the army.

178
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,400
-Look, it's Kimura.
-It's Subaru.

179
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,970
Thank you for gathering here,
fearless warriors!

180
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,770
SUBARU KIMURA

181
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:05,900
Here to lead the first army in 34 years
is Captain Subaru Kimura.

182
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,370
Hayato Tani,
the original commander in chief,

183
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,230
recommended him highly.

184
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,270
I'm elated to be given this honor.

185
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,870
-Is everyone excited?
-Yes!

186
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,800
-Will you win?
-Yes!

187
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,570
-Do I look good in this outfit?
-Yes!

188
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,570
All right, I'm pumped to hear that.

189
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,970
Let's bring everyone to the final round.

190
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,430
All right!

191
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,000
I hear that that loathsome Count Takeshi
has gone missing.

192
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,230
So, we will attack
while the castle is vulnerable.

193
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,170
The enemy knows our secret.

194
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,530
You will now overthrow the first castle
in the grounds, Ueda Castle.

195
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,500
THE FIRST CASTLE
UEDA CASTLE

196
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,470
There are several obstacles...

197
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,970
Hey, Yamada's here.

198
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,400
...so bring your best game. Let's go.

199
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,900
To the person in the front row
with the pink onesie.

200
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,830
Yes, Captain.

201
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,900
YOUTUBER
KERUMAI (36)

202
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,830
Wow!

203
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,300
What was the inspiration
for your outfit today?

204
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,030
I look the cutest in this.

205
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,570
Hold on.

206
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,600
Is that Chiitan in the back row?

207
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,630
FAIRY OTTER
CHIITAN (ETERNALLY 0 YEARS OLD)

208
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,370
Can you show me how motivated you are?

209
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,230
Are you ready to throw down?

210
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,900
Thank you for revealing your legs.
Do your best.

211
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,670
-We also have Mr. Sasuke himself.
-That's me.

212
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,170
MR. SASUKE
KATSUMI YAMADA (56)

213
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,700
-Thanks for having me.
-But wait, we're not doing Sasuke today.

214
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,900
I just realized that.

215
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,800
Did you not know before?

216
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,100
Not completely.

217
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Today's enemy is Takeshi's Castle.

218
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,830
-Will you take it as seriously as Sasuke?
-I will. I'll do my best.

219
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,670
Best of luck to you!

220
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,530
The first challenge is the Border Wall.

221
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,670
THE BORDER WALL
DIFFICULTY RATING 10%

222
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,930
We'll take them down!

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,400
Bring it on!

224
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,270
KAGAYA MEMBERS
SHO KAGA &amp; SOYA KAYA

225
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,330
Let's get to it!

226
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,270
Charge!

227
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,600
The battle has finally begun.

228
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,200
The first obstacle, the Border Wall.

229
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,030
CLIMB THE WALL WITHIN FIVE MINUTES

230
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,930
Let's hope that most
of our heroes make it over.

231
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,930
This is quite the sight to see.

232
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,200
It's lively.

233
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,170
-Here they come. Watch.
-There they are.

234
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,330
-The Nasunakanishi duo.
-Are you hearing this?

235
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,630
REPORTERS
NAKANISHI &amp; NASU

236
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,970
He's fast.

237
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,430
Nice. Great speed.

238
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,530
He's in first place.

239
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,700
ACROBATICS TEACHER
MONZEN (35)

240
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,370
-Congratulations.
-You're fast.

241
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,170
-Thank you.
-You're in first place.

242
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,070
Really?

243
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,200
-I'm impressed.
-I swallowed a lot of water!

244
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,670
He swallowed water.

245
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,200
-All right!
-He was really fast.

246
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,400
-Look.
-It's Cherry.

247
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,870
As our brave challengers charge the wall,

248
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,300
many buckle
under the relentless hosing attack.

249
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,800
The water makes it too slippery.

250
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,430
It becomes harder the higher you get.

251
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,200
-Kagaya keeps hosing them down.
-It's too slippery.

252
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:18,500
Mr. Sasuke spends time lending a hand
to comrades that he met today.

253
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,170
He's offering assistance.

254
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,970
I guess that's a good tactic.

255
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,700
This is amazing.

256
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,500
Quite a few heroes
have made it over the wall.

257
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,130
THREE MINUTES LEFT

258
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,730
-They're doing it.
-That's a pretty good number.

BIRD'S EYE VIEW

260
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,030
What is that, a loincloth?

261
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,370
Look, it's Chiitan!

262
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,170
That's one muddy mascot.

263
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,570
What will happen?

264
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,870
-There's no way he'll make it.
-No...

265
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,300
Don't give up!

266
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,570
I've never seen
such a dingy looking mascot.

267
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,630
Somebody please help Chiitan.

268
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,430
Yamada is being a gentleman.

269
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,230
He's trying to help everyone.

270
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,070
Good job. Don't give up.

271
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,970

274
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,730
Spain. Really?

275
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,200
Spain!

276
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,100
-That's right.
-Hola!

277
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,100
Did you know about Takeshi's Castle?

278
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,000
Yes, I did.

279
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,900
It was broadcast in Spain
when I was little, and I was hooked.

I see, so Takeshi's Castle
was popular in Spain too.

282
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,830
It's popular all over the world.

283
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:37,400
However, their teammate
was still struggling to clear the wall.

291

Chiitan is almost there!

292
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,900
Yamada is right there,
but he's only helping women.

293
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,670
Yamada, help Chiitan!

294
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,970
Chiitan made it!

295
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,030
Nice!

296
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,170
-Great job, Chiitan!
-With no help?

297
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,700
Chiitan, the fairy,
just barely conquered the first obstacle.

298
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,100
Chiitan is soaking wet.

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,700
Don't give up!

310
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,600
-Look at that teamwork.
-Ten seconds left.

311
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,230
With barely any time left,
he gave up on saving everyone.

312
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,830
BATTLE OVER

Time is up!

314
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,500
Three of them didn't make it.

00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,270
What a shame.

319
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,030
We did it!

Ninety-three brave warriors

The road forks ahead
with more battles to come.

323
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,300
It's time to move
onto the next fortress, fearless Army!

324
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,470
Lord Ueda, that was nostalgic, wasn't it?

325
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,600
I'm impressed with Chiitan.

326
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:28,130
Yamada was there helping women,
but Chiitan did it on his own.

327
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,800
He might be
a surprisingly strong athlete.

328
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,600
-It was impressive.
-In a costume at that.

329
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,200
At first, I thought
Yamada was a gentleman,

330
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,570
-but he only helped women.
-I agree.

331
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,170
He didn't bat an eye for Chiitan.

332
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,130
I'm very disappointed in Yamada.

333
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,100
-I can't blame you.
-With good reason.

334
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,330
-So, three people failed?
-Yes.

335
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,330
That sucks.
Why don't we give them a second chance?

336
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,030
It's sad, but too many people succeeded.

337
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,130
Are you trying to make yourself look good?

338
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,930
Do you want to be like Yamada?
Why are you being so nice?

339
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,200
Should we see what the count says?

340
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,230
Count Takeshi?

341
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,830
You numbskulls! Too many people made it.

342
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,930
-See?
-He's angry.

343
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,670
Don't act like you're such a saint, Ueda.

344
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,600
I felt sorry for them.

345
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,330
The world is unfair
and you should cherish that.

346
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,930
We all saw Yamada helping only women.
What do you think of that,

347
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,600
Mr. Takayuki Nishida?

348
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,000
It's the golden rule to help women.

349
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,900
Why are you taking the bait?

350
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,330
-You're the count, right?
-Why do the imitation?

351
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,100
Apologies, the AI
seems to be malfunctioning.

352
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,230
Are you sure?
It appears to be on its A game.

353
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,130
He was quick to jump on the bit.

354
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,530
The count has range.

355
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,500
The AI needs to stop playing.

356
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,930
The next challenge is Ueda's favorite,
The Dragon God's Pond.

357
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,430
-I always look forward to it.
-Can't wait to see it.

358
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,370
-How nostalgic.
-I want to try it myself.

359
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,070
-Me too.
-It's a Takeshi's Castle classic.

360
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,900
It's the castle's signature game.

361
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,970
-We'll get to see it next.
-Sounds great.

362
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,970
THE DRAGON GOD'S POND

363
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,730
Good job getting yourselves over the wall.

364
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,970
Applaud yourselves!

365
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,000
You did well.

366
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,630
But we are far from being done.

367
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,430
From this point forward,
the struggle will only become harder.

368
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,130
Next up is the Dragon God's Pond.

369
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,430
Isn't it great
to see it again after 34 years?

370
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,400
Great. They seem so happy!

371
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,330
-Are you excited?
-Yeah!

372
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,930
All right. I wish you the best of luck.

373
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,800
Charge!

374
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,900
They're really pumped.

375
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,970
So, this is the Dragon God's Pond.

376
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,970
It's shockingly dirty.
I hope nothing weird is living in there.

377
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,130
Look! I see piranhas.

378
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,730
What? Where? Sorry!

379
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,370
Hey, Komiya!

380
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,270
-Why did you push me?
-Look behind you.

381
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,670
It's a merman!

382
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,970
What?

383
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:04,800
This is chaos.

384
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,770
The definition of a farce.

385
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,200
What a shady pond.

386
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,000
In conclusion, we, Sanshiro,
will be reporting from this lake.

387
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,400
Leave it to us.

388
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,970
-We can cut that part.
-No, we need it.

389
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,000
-No, we don't.
-It's imperative.

390
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,100
THE DRAGON GOD'S POND
DIFFICULTY RATING 100%

391
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,770
-Just start the segment from here.
-No, keep the sketch too.

392
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,930
YOUTUBER
KERUMAI (36)

393
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,200
-It's Kerumai.
-Here we go.

394
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,170
CROSS THE POND, FAIL IF YOU FALL

395
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,830
Look at him go!

396
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,600
-You got this. No!
-Come on!

397
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,570
There's that YouTuber flair.

398
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,600
It's not as easy as it looks.

399
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,730
APPAREL SHOP OWNER
YUDAI SHIBUYA (44)

400
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,900
He might be 44 years old, but he's fast.

401
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:45,900
What a shame.

402
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,900
-That's dangerous.
-That's a dangerous way to go.

403
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,370
-Good luck!
-I'll try my best.

404
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,370
Go, Mrs. Segawa.

405
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,670
HOUSEWIFE &amp; WAITRESS
KUMI SEGAWA (42)

406
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,800
Nice try.

407
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,700
You can't even enjoy the scenery.

408
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,900
Momentum is important. He's 51.

409
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,730
SHOEMAKER
HISASHI KATO (51)

410
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,400
-You got this.
-He's good.

411
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,300
You almost had it.

412
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,970
There happen to be eight stones that sink.

413
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,030
Beware not to step on those.

414
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,200
Our next team spend most days
working out on a jungle gym.

415
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,930
HIBIYA HORIZONTAL BAR CLUB

416
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,170
They are middle-aged elites
who work for a major corporations.

417
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,500
-They're seriously strong.
-We got this!

418
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,830
They aren't your average middle aged guys.

419
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,770
-Count Takeshi, root for me!
-He's 55.

420
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,500
HIBIYA CLUB LEADER
TOSHITAKA HOSOI (55)

421
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,430
What was that about?

422
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,800
-Too bad!
-That happened quick!

423
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,900
They're no match at all.

424
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,130
Based on the earlier clip,
I thought they'd do better.

425
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,630
The merman is resting with no interest
to interfere. Now is their chance.

426
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,930
MERMAN SOMETIMES ATTACKS
WITH A WATER GUN

427
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,530
-Come on!
-Let's see.

428
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,700
HIBIYA CLUB
YOSHIO YODA (60)

429
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,230
He's a spry 60 year old.

430
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,430
Look at him go.

431
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,170
So close!

432
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:10,930
At 60 years old,
he's the oldest member of the army.

433
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,370
He ran the half way, but failed. So close.

434
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,330
Go!

435
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,570
I can walk on water.

436
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,830
HIBIYA CLUB
MARSHALL IKEDA (38)

437
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,800
Marshall Ikeda is a young guy.

438
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,500
BIRD'S EYE VIEW

439
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:30,370
Not a single Hibiya Club member
makes it across the pond.

440
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,400
What a shame!

441
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,130
34 years' worth of passion
for this tournament,

442
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,570
and it only took one second
for it to all come crumbling down.

443
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,700
Meanwhile, this legend
was gearing up to conquer the pond.

444
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,000
Yamada will put up a good fight.

445
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,270
Is he practicing?

446
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,570
-He's visualizing.
-I think I got this.

447
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,330
Is he talking to the pond?

448
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,130
-We are legends.
-Here's our next dynamic duo.

449
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:03,230
Both of them participated
in Takeshi's Castle 34 years ago.

450
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:09,630
Misao even managed
to compete in the last go-cart battle.

451
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,070
-Great stuff!
-I'm jealous!

452
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,430
SECOND APPEARANCE
MISAO KATO (48)

453
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,330
She was 14 then, and now she's back.

454
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,100
-She's our age.
-She's doing great.

455
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,200
So close.

456
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,600
Was it different
from how you remembered it?

457
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,570
It's much more difficult.

458
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,030
There weren't as many stones
back in the day.

459
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,600
That's correct,
compared to the previous pond,

460
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:37,070
we've increased the distance
and number of stepping stones.

461
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,570
-They upgraded.
-We have no intention of letting you win!

462
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,670
-Wow.
-If you're athletic, it's easy.

463
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,270
And the merman is ready to stir things up.

464
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,200
I'm going to try again!

465
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,730
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

466
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,900
That gap is wide, so people steer right.

467
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,900
-Take your time.
-What a cruel game.

468
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,030
COMPETED IN MIDDLE SCHOOL
RIE GRIBOV (48)

469
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,200
-She failed in the same way as last time.
-Did she?

470
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,270
It's exactly the same!

471
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,970
I'm glad someone is having fun.

472
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,630
Let's have a look...

473
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,070
-The frame is the same.
-She's 14 in this video?

474
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,970
-The resemblance is uncanny.
-I can see that.

475
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,700
-Another failed attempt.
-There are more stones.

476
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,200
Would you like to show them how it's done?

477
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,330
Yes, I'm carrying the reputation
of Sasuke after all.

478
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,600
The world-renowned show, Sasuke.

479
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:30,530
Katsumi Yamada, 56,
has been a participant of that show

480
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,870
since its very first episode.

481
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,130
Though he was never able
to conquer the Sasuke course,

482
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,900
his legacy is filled
with innumerable highlights.

483
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm so cold!

484
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,100
What's your goal for this competition?

485
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,870
I want to complete in all the challenges

486
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,970
and become
the very first Mr. Takeshi's Castle.

487
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,870
Will he conquer his goals
and become Mr. Takeshi's Castle?

488
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,770
Here we go.

489
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,130
-Go!
-Come on, Mr. Sasuke!

490
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,000
-Will he do it? Wait, what?
-He barely put up a fight.

491
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,530
What was that?

492
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,470
Hold on, he can't keep going.

493
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,830
-What is happening?
-What do we think about that?

494
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,170
He's acting like he made it,
but he barely got past the starting line.

495
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,270
He was terrible right off the bat.

496
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,800
Mr. Sasuke fell into the pond,

497
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,270
but tried to continue as if
nothing had happened.

498
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,770
He's terminated
after falling a second time.

499
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,170
He cheated.

500
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,270
Can I try again? Is that possible.

501
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,730
No, you can't. Those are the rules.

502
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,430
The army continues to put up a good fight.

503
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,370
But no one has been able to pass.

504
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:55,430
Will there be a hero
who can conquer this impossible pond?

505
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,530
What a shame.

506
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,800
I see none of you
can get across the pond.

507
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,900
Serves you right.

508
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,930
I won't go easy on you!

509
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,200
Let's up the antics.

510
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,070
RIGHT ARM UNDER CONSTRUCTION

511
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,330
THE ADDITIONAL RULE

512
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,670
An additional rule has been activated.

513
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,670
Another rule?

514
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,270
Contestants will need
to watch their backs,

515
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,030
because there will be
a demon on their heels.

516
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,330
But no one has even won yet.

517
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,870
Who is this demon?

518
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,830
I have arrived. It's Kurochan!

519
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,800
No... They'll need to rush even more now.

520
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,030
You can't take your time anymore.
He'll toss you aside.

521
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,900
-There he is.
-Watch out.

522
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,430
-She fell before he could do anything.
-His presence was pointless.

523
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,670
Unfortunately, the demon is not effective.

524
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,970
Did you notice anyone sneaking up on you?

525
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,230
NARRATOR
SUMIKA KAWANA

526
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,270
-I didn't notice at all.
-See? He was too late.

527
00:25:58,970 --> 00:25:59,900
You didn't see me?

528
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,530
-You have to be quicker.
-My apologies.

529
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,370
-That was terrible.
-You were late.

530
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,430
Here's another duo
with prior castle experience.

531
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,570
HOUSEWIVES
ZAIDA &amp; TOMITA

532
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,570
Who are they?

533
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,130
Chikayo and Masako are former classmates
that competed together when they were 19.

534
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,800
Can they conquer the castle this time?

535
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:22,070
-She ran right into that wall.
-That's so dangerous.

536
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,100
I got th...

537
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,000
HOUSEWIFE
CHIKAYO ZAIDA

538
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,870
You got this. The demon
is doing a better job too.

539
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,070
What is he doing? Excuse me?

540
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,000
-What was that?
-Why did he fall?

541
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,900
What are you two doing?

542
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,470
Kurochan took the feedback
and tried to attack sooner,

543
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,370
but his opponent fell after two steps
and he had nowhere to go.

544
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,830
-What is this mess?
-What was that?

545
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,870
What is happening?

546
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,370
HOUSEWIFE
MASAKO TOMITA

547
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:52,270
-And here comes the demon.
-Come on, you got this.

548
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,630
Why did he fall there too?

549
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,200
He had no reason to fall.

550
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,170
The demon seems to be having
no effect on people.

551
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,470
So, after that round, he has been fired.

552
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,770
I've been fired?

553
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,470
-Unfortunately.
-No, you're lying!

554
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,530
-Thank you for your hard work.
-I'm not even tired.

555
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,900
With the demon sent away,
now is the army's chance to attack.

556
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,970
It's time to attack with full force.

557
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,970
-We seriously didn't need him.
-Bye, Kurochan.

558
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,200
Go. He's fast!

559
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,000
LEADER OF TAKAGI BAKUFU
ASUKA TAKAGI (29)

560
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,730
It's scary to run that fast.

561
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,370
TAKAGI BAKUFU
KENYA FURUKAWA (30)

562
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,730

YAYOI TAKAHASHI (37)

563
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,870
PARTNER DANCE HOBBYIST
HIROKO MINAMINO

564
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,500
ROCK CLIMBING CLUB LEADER
TORU SAWADA (22)

565
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,230
Good for him.

566
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,930
GRADUATE STUDENT IN ECONOMICS
KONAN SHIMIZU (23)

567
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,630
Nice, he went out with a bang.

568
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:55,670
UNIVERSITY STUDENT AND PRO MAHJONG PLAYER
KAZUKI TSUJIMOTO (22)

569
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,030
He was close.

570
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,470
Next up, the cute mascot
with athletic skills, Chiitan.

571
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:10,100
With unmatched physical prowess,
can he conquer the castle?

572
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:12,100
-Don't hurt yourself.
-It can really move.

573
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,030
-Charge!
-You got this, Chiitan!

574
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,670
-Be careful.
-Take you time.

575
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,900
No, not that stone.

576
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,800
Chiitan…

577
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,130
With limited visibility,

578
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,870
Chiitan couldn't see ahead
and wiped out immediately.

579
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,370
It can't see the ground.

580
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,170
DANCE ENTHUSIASTS
AKINKO &amp; MAYAYA

581
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:32,370
Who else is confident
in their physical abilities?

582
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,030
The dance-loving duo, Akinko and Mayaya.

583
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,870
Mayaya actually has a personal agenda
for being here.

584
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,130
What is it?

585
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,170
I'd like to get married.

586
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,400
I'm searching for a husband!

587
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,430
-Please, root for us.
-I hope they do well.

588
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,330
DANCE DUO
AKINKO (32)

589
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,530
Here I come!

590
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,800
Hang in there.

591
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,830
-Stay calm.
-Go!

592
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,230
-That's the correct stone.
-Look at her go.

593
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,330
That part is tough.

594
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,030
It's me, Mayaya. I'll eat this race!

595
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,300
DANCE LOVING DUO
MAYAYA (35)

596
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,400
Mayaya!

597
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,900
She went down belly first.
Right in the stomach.

598
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,230
Are you okay?

599
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,370
The next challengers are...

600
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,770
NEIGHBORHOOD BUDDIES
TOSHIYUKI (47) &amp; IMARI HIRAOKA (12)

601
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,830
NEIGHBORHOOD BUDDIES
MANAMI ISHINO (13)

602
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,330
-He's my father and she's my friend.
-He looks young.

603
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,900
Manami and Imari
are close friends from middle school,

604
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,770
who inspired Imari's father
to join them in the race.

605
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,270
-So, it wasn't dad's idea to compete?
-I can do this!

606
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,300
TOSHIYUKI HIRAOKA (47)

607
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,770
-Show your fighting spirit, dad.
-He's going for it.

608
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,900
-Look at him go.
-So close!

609
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,930
-I got this.
-Go get 'em.

610
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,370
-Not that way. I feel bad.
-That stone is bad news.

611
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,970
-I'm bummed for her.
-That gap was too wide.

612
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:51,570
This is a dangerous zone
where the stones are far apart.

613
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:55,830
She gave that jump her all,
but couldn't make it across.

614
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,970
Was it a little too far?

615
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,400
-And that was the only stone.
-She's crying.

616
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,530
You didn't have many options,
it must be frustrating.

617
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,470
Manami, can you make
your dad and bestie proud?

618
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,230
MIDDLE SCHOOL BESTIES DUO
ISHINO (13)

619
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,970
Right, good choice.

620
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,630
-No, not that one.
-Great, keep going.

621
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,900
The Dragon God's Pond is too difficult.

622
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,070
She stumbled, but got back
in the game with a speedy recovery.

623
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,200
At her age,
it's an accomplishment to make it so far.

624
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,930
She was so close.

625
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,530
We even have idols in the running.

626
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,100
TWO MONTHS AGO
THE AUDITION

627
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,930
We are Sengoku Resistance.

628
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,330
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you all.

629
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,670
The group debuted in January, 2022,

630
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,000
under the name Sengoku Resistance.

631
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,130
We'll bring the castle down!

632
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,830
Nice. I hope they keep up that energy.

633
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,230
Go for it.

634
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,330
Here I go!

635
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,530
Macaroni is his name.

636
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,700
SENGOKU RESISTANCE
MACARONI

637
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,630
Go. Be careful.

638
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,030
-What are you doing?
-Come on, Macaroni.

639
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,170
-What are you doing, Macaroni?
-That gap is too wide.

640
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,430
-Tough spot.
-It's difficult.

641
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,970
-What're you doing?
-No!

642
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,800
-Superstar!
-Kazu, the Superstar.

643
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,670
SENGOKU RESISTANCE
KAZU THE SUPERSTAR

644
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,930
Here we go again, same spot as Macaroni.

645
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,870
You're right. Why did he jump there?

646
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,230
All speed and no strategy.

647
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,600
I'll do my best. Double cheese burger!

648
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,830
"I'll do my best, double cheese burger"?

649
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,430
SENGOKU RESISTANCE
HI-SAI

650
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,200
-Nice. Good job.
-Go! Keep going!

651
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,330
You can do it!

652
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,230
-No, Hi-Sai!
-Crap!

653
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,970
He had momentum and even resisted a slip.

654
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,730
This idol came very close to the goal.

655
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,030
The final contestant. Will Marco do it?

656
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,270
SENGOKU RESISTANCE
MARCO

657
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,870
-Marco.
-Okay, Marco.

658
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,700
-Good start.
-You got this, Marco.

659
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,230
I got this! No!

660
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:01,470
-The merman's attack worked.
-It got him.

661
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,170
Nice, Marco!

662
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,870
-They're all out.
-But having fun.

663
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:09,100
He resisted the merman's attack,
but failed in the end.

664
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,200
However, the last two players
gave a great performance.

665
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,070
-Well done!
-Thank you.

666
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,070
They received the Fighting Spirit Award
for their lively showmanship.

667
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,300
That's great to see.

668
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:28,400
Grit and perseverance can earn someone
the Fighting Spirit Award,

669
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:31,300
which allows you
to move on to the next stage.

670
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,800
This is the way of Takeshi's Castle.

671
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,830
Unfortunately, no one completed the task,

672
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,030
but 17 warriors move on
after receiving the Fighting Spirit Award.

673
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:46,330
We must go on and take down Ueda Castle.

674
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,170
The rules are too wishy-washy!

675
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,570
Seventeen people moved on.

676
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,000
I didn't see a single person succeed.

677
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:57,030
Yes, no one succeeded,
but 17 are moving on.

678
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,930
I don't get it.

679
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,630
With the Fighting Spirit Award
or with enough popularity,

680
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,170
-you can continue.
-That's right.

681
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,930
I have a few bones to pick with this.

682
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,130
First of all, Kurochan
and that goofy merman,

683
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,570
we can do without them.

684
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,230
No, we need them. They're valuable.

685
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,070
You really think so?

686
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,970
If I'm being honest, no, I don't.

687
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,400
Because it doesn't make sense.

688
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,300
If it's already too difficult to complete,
why add obstacles?

689
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,000
-Where is the logic in that?
-A demon adds fear.

690
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:32,500
Mr. Sasuke even tried using
some visualization techniques.

691
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,630
-Was that necessary?
-No, it wasn't.

692
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,630
I'm most annoyed that he acted
like he didn't fall when he clearly did.

693
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,130
That was silly.

694
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,770
Apparently, Yamada has always had a habit
of making excuses after he fails.

695
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,070
That is what's great about him.

696
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,770
He's got bad sportsmanship and is clumsy.

697
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,800
That's not a compliment.

698
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:59,500
It was great to see people
who competed on Takeshi's Castle before.

699
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,630
That made me happy.

700
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,100
It's wild to try the same challenges
on the same show 34 years later.

701
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:10,000
It's a rare experience that not many
of us get to have. Don't you think?

702
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,300
I agree.

703
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:13,930
-Shall we call the AI Count?
-Okay.

704
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,300
Yeah, that was interesting.

705
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:21,570
I also think Kurochan and the opening bit
about the merman were useless.

706
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,670
-That's not true.
-If the count says so, that's correct.

707
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,670
-They weren't necessary.
-They were.

708
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,170
Let's see what fate awaited
the other fork in the road.

709
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,630
The challenge they met is...

710
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,270
BEACH BOYS AND GIRLS

711
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:36,770
Reach the other shore
ridding the rotating surfboard.

712
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:40,070
This super hard game is called
Beach Boys and Girls.

713
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:45,200
Let's see what transformation
has taken place after 34 years.

714
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,100
-Are you excited?
-Yes!

715
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,700
-Do you want more?
-Yes!

716
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:56,570
I can feel your enthusiasm from over here.

717
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,030
Good job on making it this far.

718
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:04,800
Our next game sounds like a lot of fun.
It's called Beach Boys and Girls.

719
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,200
-Are you ready, beach boys?
-Yes!

720
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,230
-What about you, beach girls?
-Yes!

721
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,970
Okay! But stay alert,

722
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,970
this game is not be taken lightly.

723
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,030
Prepare yourselves. Charge!

724
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,370
We'll make sure you take a dive!

725
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,200
HOSING CAPTAINS
KAGAYA - SHO KAGA &amp; SOYA KAYA

726
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,270
-This brings back memories.
-It really does.

727
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,670
REPORTERS - NASUNAKANISHI
NAKANISHI &amp; NASU

728
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,100
Just like in the old days.

729
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,730
What are the last 11 digits
of your phone number?

730
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,300
That's the whole phone number, dummy.
And what's with this water?

731
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,400
What is this mist? It keeps hitting us.

732
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,100
If you're going to splash us, just do it.

733
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,630
-Pardon me, miss.
-It's freezing cold!

734
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,270
Please, stop! I'm sorry!

735
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,730
That's funny.

736
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,400
We will now bring you,
Beach Boys and Girls!

737
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,430
Let us see how the battle unfolds.

738
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,700
-Let's begin.
-Cheers.

739
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,030
Who needed that?

740
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,630
-I think it was great.
-It made me laugh.

741
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,700
BEACH BOYS AND GIRLS
DIFFICULTY RATING 81%

742
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,730
-Yeah, let's vibe out, everyone.
-It's Koo.

743
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,270
He has beach boy vibes.

744
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,300
I want to see you jump up and down!

745
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,830
Go!

746
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,300
We have girls in bikinis.

747
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,530
Beach boys and girls, start!

748
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,900
START

749
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:36,900
Yeah!

750
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,030
Akari, mommy's going to do her best!
Root for me!

751
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,630
HOUSE ORGANIZER
MANAMI (44)

752
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,830
-She's a house organizer.
-Let's go, Mom!

753
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,330
HER HUSBAND
YU (39)

754
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,430
Don't get hurt.

755
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,070
RIDE THE SURFBOARD
WHILE AVOIDING THE OBSTACLES

756
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,270
START - GOAL

757
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,800
Look at me!

758
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,800
-Good luck.
-Great. Good job.

759
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,170
Keep going!

760
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,000
You can't see the board,
so you have to hurry.

761
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,370
-She's good.
-Well done. Very good.

762
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,100
-The water is coming right at her.
-Keep going!

763
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,470
No!

764
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,530
ENTREPRENEUR
YU (39)

765
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,730
You can count on me, Akari!

766
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,470
Good luck, darling!

767
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,130
They're competing as a couple.

768
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,100
Good luck!

769
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,270
Nice, he landed on his feet.

770
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,600
-All right.
-Great job, husband.

771
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,330
-You have to stand up.
-Hurry!

772
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,530
Too bad.

773
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,800
She's laughing.

774
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,130
Go get 'em!

775
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,570
COMEDIAN
CHERRY YOSHITAKE (41)

776
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,830
It's time for Cherry to fight!

777
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,570
He's an athletic guy.

778
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,170
BODYBUILDER
NAOTAKA YOKOGAWA

779
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,130
CYBERJAPAN DANCERS

780
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,470
-Be careful, Cherry. Take your time.
-Good. Keep going.

781
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,330
-Are you okay? Be careful.
-He's a bit bouncy.

782
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,300
-Cherry!
-That's dangerous.

783
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,970
-What's he doing?
-Come on, Cherry.

784
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:01,570
-What was that? He's in big trouble.
-Cherry...

785
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,070
I'm sorry!

786
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,070
Apparently, it's taking five
or six people to fix it.

787
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,870
Is there anything more embarrassing?

788
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,000
All I've done is cause trouble!

789
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:18,700
You're shouting,
but look at it this way. No one cares.

790
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,000
I am so very sorry!

791
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:24,200
-I feel so bad.
-He muddied his own face.

792
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,300
Next up, we have a team
of childhood besties.

793
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,530
FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENT TEAM

794
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,070
They came to make the best memories
in their last years of college.

795
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,700
Let's get the Fighting Spirit Award!

796
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,300
Is that them?

797
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,270
Okay, you can have the award.

798
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,300
Just like that?

799
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:47,370
Let's see
this team's victory dance. Start!

800
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,330
FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENT TEAM
MIYUKO ISAKA (21)

801
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,230
Easy to jump!

802
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,170
Yeah!

803
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,930
That was a nice callout to DJ Koo.

804
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,470
You're doing great.

805
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,170
-Good job.
-You got this.

806
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,170
-You got this.
-Stay calm.

807
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:05,430
-She made it.
-Can she get back up?

808
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,470
-You gotta be quick here.
-Hang in there.

809
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,830
-Be quick.
-Go!

810
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,200
-Nice!
-Good job.

811
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,230
-Good!
-She got past it.

812
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,800
Let's go. Jump.

813
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,930
What happened? I thought she had that.

814
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,130
-She hit her butt.
-Is she okay?

815
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,800
She jumped too far
and hit her butt on the way down.

816
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,530
That must've been painful.

817
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,930
-All right.
-Let's go.

818
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,100
FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENT TEAM
RINA HOSOKAWA (21)

819
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,900
-The surfboard slowly speeds up.
-Good job.

820
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:45,030
-Be swift here.
-Hurry.

821
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,730
Quickly!

822
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,170
No, not there!

823
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,570
-Why?
-That was dangerous.

824
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,670
-That was really dangerous.
-What a scary fall.

825
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,700
COLLEGE STUDENT TEAM
MIRI KATO (21)

826
00:39:58,770 --> 00:39:59,600
I'll try my best!

827
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,200
You got this!

828
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,900
-Hang in there.
-Stay calm!

829
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:07,030
-Jump now. Go!
-Well done, beautiful.

830
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,200
Hang in there!

831
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,300
-You can do it!
-You got this!

832
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,070
They'll spray the water now.

833
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:18,230
-Quickly, hurry!
-She seems calm.

834
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,470
It hasn't fazed her.

835
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:23,570
The goal is near. One last jump.

836
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,100
GOAL

837
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,770
-So close!
-She almost had it.

838
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,530
You can do it!

839
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,930
-What a shame.
-She almost had it.

840
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,570
-You were so close. You were right there.
-I know.

841
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:41,100
I stumbled, so it is what it is.

842
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,470
-How cute.
-The goal was close.

843
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,600
She put up a good fight.

844
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:50,570
Ms. Kato has gone the farthest so far
and has earned the Fighting Spirit Award.

845
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,470
She was so close.

846
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,570
Next up is nurse Aoi Nakano.

847
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,700
She came without telling her colleagues.

848
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,600
I hope she wins.

849
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,070
I will stay till the end!

850
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,130
-Good luck.
-Make it happen.

851
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,830
NURSE
AOI NAKANO (29)

852
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,100
Are you okay?

853
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,800
Hang in there.

854
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,670
Hang in there.

855
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,370
-Well done. Go!
-Get back up!

856
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:18,000
-Quickly. Nice.
-You got this.

857
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,400
She'll miss it.

858
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,070
It's so dangerous.

859
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:23,070
She'll miss it.

860
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,770
-It's so dangerous.
-Truly.

-Nakano wins the Fighting Spirit Award!
-What a great fall.

Be humble.

-I mean, we're all pumped.
-That's right.

-Can you all make it?
-Sure.

-They'll be fired.

909
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,030
First up, is the team leader, Acre.

910
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:10,770
He seems clumsy.

911
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:16,030
This should be easy for him.

912
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,170
Okay.

913
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,170
Hang in there. Stay calm.

-No, he couldn't.

-Our leader is fired.
-How unfortunate.

917
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,930
Their leader failed miserably.

918
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,500

-It's tricky.

-Wow! Look, he's standing.

he reached the goal
with his hands never touching the board.

939

the very first winner of this game.

-He's a slackline walker.

950

-I see.
-That's why he's good on wobbly surfaces.

-Indeed.

I wish we could see
who won the awards and why.

962
00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:02,130
It's nice to see 18 winners, but I barely
remember who they are or what they did.

963
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,430
I think that's on par
with the confusion of a battle field.

00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,570
-I agree.
-I guess so. Let's go with that.

965
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:13,730
At this rate,
we're losing contestants too quickly.

966
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,170
There's a chance
we won't have any winners.

967
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:19,000
They should've all been disqualified
at the pond.

This might be a good time
for a Loser Resurrection.

Wait, what is that
and how is the award system any different?

970
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:28,870
We don't give away the award that easily.

971
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,030
We gave away tons!

972
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,800
We gave out more than a dozen at the pond.

Excuse me, AI Count?

974

Lord Ueda is not happy with the result.

975
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,900
-Should we do a consolation battle?
-Ueda has no clue what he's talking about.

976
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,170
Although, it's not good
to be too forgiving either.

977
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,370
We've been nothing but forgiving so far.

…can mean an untimely defeat.

1029
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,800
Winner, Takeshi's Army!

1030
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:20,770
But Takeshi's Army is diverse.

1031
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:22,730
GRAVURE IDOL
AIRI SHIMIZU

1032
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,300
-What a perfect opponent.
-It's a cute lady!

1033
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:29,470
-Ready, go.
-Do you think the idol is strong?

1034
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,130
There's no way.

1035
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,700
-She voluntarily ran into the pond.
-She didn't want to win.

1036
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,370
RETURN TO THE FRONT

1037
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:39,730
Please, excuse my shortcomings.

1038
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,600
-She deserves the Fighting Spirit Award.
-How come?

1039
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:43,970
COMEDIANS
KYOHANSHA

1040
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:47,270
The college student
facing an up-and-coming comedian...

1041
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,600
-Ready, go!
-Good luck!

1042
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,270
FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENT TEAM
MINAMI SUDO (22)

1043
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,070
...did not make it back to the field.

1044
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:55,730
Her teammate, Matsuzaki,
will compete against...

1045
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,770
FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENT TEAM
AIRI MATSUZAKI (21)

1046
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,300
-Not him again.
-No!

1047
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:02,400
PRO WRESTER
TOMOAKI HONMA

1048
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:04,570
-Seriously?
-That's impossible.

1049
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:07,430
-You got this.
-I'll beat you with one arm.

1050
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:11,230
I don't think
they understood what he said.

1051
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,100
-Start!
-Come on, you got this!

1052
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,470
Nice. She's got this.

1053
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:17,930
What, really?

1054
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:22,330
He gave her the leg up and lost.
What's even the point?

1055
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,730
How lame.

1056
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,100
RETURN TO THE FRONT

1057
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:27,800
-That was another Fighting Spirit Award.
-Yes.

1058
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,330
I messed up bad.

1059
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,870
The third consolation game
is the Slip-and-Slide Quiz.

1060
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,700
The Slip-and-Slide Quiz.

1061
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:40,370
First, the warriors bath in slime,

1062
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,970
then go down the slimy slide
to answer with either A or B.

1063
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,630
What was Hideyoshi Toyotomi's nickname?

1064
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,670
ROCKET NEWS 24 WRITER
SANG-JOON PARK (44)

1065
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:53,000
A is monkey. B is racoon.

1066
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:54,000
Okay. Go for it.

1067
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,300
Which is the right answer?

1068
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,930
He's got momentum.

1069
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:04,970
CORRECT ANSWER
A: MONKEY

1070
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,330
-He got it wrong.
-He went with B.

1071
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,700
I'll win no matter what.

1072
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:09,730
GRADUATE STUDENT IN ECONOMICS
KONAN SHIMIZU (23)

1073
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:14,600
In Rodin's The Thinker,
which hand under his chin?

1074
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:17,630
A, his right hand or B, his left hand?

1075
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,700
Can a current Tokyo University student
answer correctly?

1076
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,530
CORRECT ANSWER
A: THE RIGHT HAND

1077
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,500
-He's got it wrong.
-They're all failing.

1078
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:30,400
That's not a good look
for a Tokyo University student.

1079
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:33,200
-Isn't it fun to watch?
-That's true.

1080
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:35,170
DRIVER/ACTOR/MODEL
DAI HIRAYAMA (31)

1081
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:36,630
50/50 chance. I'll do my best!

1082
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:42,130
Is Hawaii in A, the Northern Hemisphere,
or B, the Southern Hemisphere?

1083
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,630
So where is it?

1084
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,300
CORRECT ANSWER
A: NORTHERN HEMISPHERE

1085
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,770
RETURN TO THE FRONT

1086
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,670
-Good looking guy.
-And he drives a taxi?

1087
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:52,630
You're a true man. Well done!

1088
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:57,730
I've never been on a quiz show
or answered a quiz correctly.

1089
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:02,670
-Yamada didn't received an award?
-Funny that he's in the consolation round.

1090
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,530
Which one of the goats

1091
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,230
ate the letter first
in the Japanese nursery rhyme?

1092
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:12,700
A, a white goat. B, a black goat.

1093
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,030
Don't tell me he can't climb that?

1094
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:19,270
-You got this!
-He's struggling with that tiny hill?

1095
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,730
CORRECT ANSWER
B: A BLACK GOAT

1096
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,470
-This is bullcrap!
-He got it wrong?

1097
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:29,230
Yamada is hopeless.

1098
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:33,230
I've never seen a black goat.
Is that why it's in a nursery rhyme?

1099
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,530
Do black goats actually exist?

1100
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:39,600
They do.

1101
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:42,270
-What's he talking about?
-I'm sure they don't.

1102
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,370
He's terrible.

1103
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:48,800
Mr. Sasuke was given an Award
and we look forward to his future success.

1104
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:50,100
No, don't do that!

1105
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,370
Don't give an Award to Yamada!

1106
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:57,670
-He got the Fighting Spirit Award.
-For what achievement?

1107
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:00,500
I'll say it, he's a complete fool.

1108
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,130
No, he's not.

1109
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,970
Starting from next episode,
we should decide who gets the award.

1110
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:10,270
The only person I'm willing
to give an award to is Airi.

1111
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:14,100
Why? She's in our army.

1112
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:19,100
I'd like to introduce a new game that was
specifically developed for this series.

1113
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:22,070
-A new game?
-Yes, it's called Strong Arms.

1114
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:24,270
That's what it looks like.

1115
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:26,270
Fear not and go forward!

1116
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,830
-I'll do my best!
-You can do it!

1117
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,000
Yu-chan!

1118
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,230
Here we go.

1119
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,230
NARRATOR
YUYA UTSUGI

1120
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,770
This is quite the task.

1121
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,830
Don't be afraid, keep going!

1122
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,070
-Is he standing on fabric?
-That's right. It's very wobbly.

1123
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:43,600
That was quite high!

1124
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:47,630
-No!
-That's a tough challenge.

1125
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:54,930
On next episode,
Strong Arms will wreak havoc.

1126
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,500
NEXT, THE LAST BATTLE
AT UEDA CASTLE

1127
00:54:56,570 --> 00:55:00,400
We'll see more classic games
with new twists.

1128
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:05,800
Will the army make it to the final battle?

1129
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:09,900
Also...

1130
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:21,570
WHAT IS THE CAPTAIN'S SECRET PAST?

1131
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:27,830
THE FIRST BATTLES IN 34 YEARS
BEHIND THE SCENES

1132
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:34,530
THREE DAYS OF SHOOTING
ONE HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS

1133
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:46,870
FRIENDSHIPS WERE MADE
IN BETWEEN BATTLES

1134
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:53,370
I'm a YouTuber and also a doctor.

1135
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:54,730
A doctor?

1136
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,370
Yasu is so cool!

1137
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,100
Ready, go!

1138
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,430
THOSE WHO MET HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME

1139
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,530
That's crazy!

1140
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,470
Rock, paper, scissors!

1141
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:15,030
CREATED DEEP BONDS WITH EACH OTHER

1142
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,800
Congratulations!

1143
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:19,800
Takeshi's Castle is the best.

1144
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:22,400
AND THE BATTLES CONTINUE…

1145
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,570
Sorry for the wait. We're almost ready.

1146
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:25,470
ON STANDBY

1147
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:26,700
SOUND TECHNICIAN

1148
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:29,570
-Just a second.
-He's changing batteries. Do dance!

1149
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:32,730
-Please, be patient. Sorry.
-Everything is fine.
