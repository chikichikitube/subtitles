Hey

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,920
What?

7
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,920
What's up with this guy?

Tsukitei Hosei

00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,620
Hm? Is something wrong?

What happened?

13
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,100
"What happened"?

14
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,130
You mean the all back hairstyle?

15
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,130
Everyone said that it would suit me

16
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,800

Tanaka Naoki

21
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,800
It seems like a makeover

22
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,970
It has sort of a Rakugo actor vibe

23
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,950
You mean that?

24
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,570
Yeah, that's why I've put my fringe up and exposed my forehead

25
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,150
You really seem to admire Shinosuke

26
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:41,250
*Tatekawa Shinosuke is a rakugo performer. He has helped to popularise rakugo among young Japanese people

27
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:41,250
Tatekawa Shinosuke

28
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,280
You really seem to admire Shinosuke

29
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,550
Like the Master

30
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,950
Compared to Shinosuke-san, the volume is...

31
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,250
Compared to Shinosuke-san, the volume is...

32
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,920
That's rough

33
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,770
Rough?

34
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,920
There's no volume

35
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,100
Is that so?

36
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,850
With that, Peyang won't choose you*

37
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:54,070
*Tatekawa Shinosuke did a commercial once for Peyang noodles

38
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,570
Speaking of volume

39
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,630
How about making it an all back only when you do rakugo?

40
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,070
How about making it an all back only when you do rakugo?

41
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,840
Sort of a Yazawa Eikichi* mindset

42
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,600
*Famous japanese rockstar

43
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,620
In order to get into the mood

44
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,620
Yeah yeah yeah

45
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,620
What's with this song?

46
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,670
Who are they?

47
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,300
Who?

48
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,350
I have no idea. I really don't know

49
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,140
I'm crazy in love with you

50
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,150
No no

51
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,120
Matsumoto, behind you

52
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,480
When I found out that we couldn't be together

53
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,920
This is quite amazing

54
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,350
He's not even in sync at all

55
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,450
Exactly, it's good and all but,

56
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,690
I will never let you go for you are my everything

57
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,950
This woman...

58
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,070
Yeah yeah, it's great but,

59
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,450
Who is it?

60
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,820
What's this from?

61
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,620
I don't know what this is from

62
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,600
What the hell is this?

63
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,370
Exactly, what the hell is this

64
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,330
It's so long

65
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,640

00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,250
Yup

Still remember that?

71
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, I remember

72
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,320
Yeah, I remember that

73
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,340

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,480

Do you just keep changing wives like this

80
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,220
Do you just keep changing wives like this

81
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,690
Let's just say that she is my new wife

82
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,690
Your ex-wife then?

You had a really great smile on your face

143
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,220
No, I was actually nervous

144
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,270
Is that so?

145
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,920
Let's see what my wife thinks

146
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,390
How was it?

147
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,320
Would you ask me that?

148
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,890
Would you ask me that?

149
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,150
Well that's all there

150
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,120
Thank you Hamada, please have a seat

151
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,670
The next lip sync singer

152
00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:01,310
Promiscuous night of adults

153
00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:01,310
The bittersweet duo will sing

154
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,350
Suzuki Kiyomi with Rats and Star, Lonely Chaplin

155
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,380
Go ahead!

156
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:15,720
A popular 80's song and still a popular duet karaoke song till this day.

157
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:15,720
Lonely Chaplin/ Kiyomi Suzuki with RATS&STAR

158
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:15,720
Lyrics by: Fumiko Okada  Composer: Masayuki Suzuki

159
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:31,900
The wind reflected in your eyes looking afar

160
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:38,980
When did that happen

161
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,420
He's mocking the singer

162
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:48,950
You leaned your face against the window sill

163
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:56,800
A sadness that you can show only me

164
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,630
Lonely Chaplin

165
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:11,140
Even if you disappear for a long time

166
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,850
I will definitely wait

167
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:25,220
That melody that binds us together

168
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,390
From wherever we hear it

169
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:34,370
We will know it anytime

170
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:42,040
The limits of unfulfilled dreams

171
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,900
Thank you

172
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,220
Please, if you two will come here

173
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,630
The two of you had such alluring voices

174
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,870
What an amazing degree of perfection

175
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,870
He's making fun of the original singer

176
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,510
From the great Haruo Minami earlier, you've renewed

177
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,670
this stage with a sexy atmosphere

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,670
Stop mocking him

179
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,200
Enveloping it completely, haven't you

180
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,800
We're glad to hear that, right?

181
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,620
It was very mature lip syncing

182
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,970
Mature lip syncing?

183
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,090
Yes, thank you very much

184
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:34,060

Lip sync

198
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:45,740
Returning again

199
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,740
The return of famous song lip syncing by the Late Night Hit Songs Studio

200
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,080
A somewhat famous cover song initially and has been covered by many bands and singers since it's original release in 1975.

201
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,080
Lyrics/Composer: Shozo Ise

202
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,080
Producer: Onuma Akihiro

203
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,080
The Last Snow/ Iruka

204
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,970
Next, producer Onuma will perform Iruka's hit song

205
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:59,220
After the annoying seasons have passed

206
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:07,260
Now that spring has come, you've become so beautiful

207
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,170
This guy pisses me off

208
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,750
He does look a little like her

209
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,470
He really does look like her

210
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,270
Yeah, he does

211
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,300
The Exciting the Lip Sync Competition has become a close match

212
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,300
The next performer will be...

213
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:23,610
Theme song for the comedy/action film of the same name.

214
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:23,610
Lyrics by: Etsuko Kisugi  Composer: Nakao Kisugi

215
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:23,610
Sailor Costume and Machine guns/ Hiroko Yakushimaru

216
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,350
He looks so enthusiastic

217
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,770
That preparation

218
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,750
He's fully prepared

219
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,400
His face is ready too

220
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,050
He's betting his life on this song

221
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:38,220
"Goodbye" does not mean farewell

222
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,470
You'll be scolded if you keep doing that

223
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,100
He's pouting

224
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:45,430
The distant promise of meeting again

225
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,600
So annoying

226
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:53,340
Although it exists only where dreams linger

227
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:58,480
You're only being distant

228
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,370
It's gradually getting worse

229
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:13,520
I want to stay like this, embracing you for hours

230
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,370
This guy really

231
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,220
Pisses me off

232
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,670
His stubble is so thick

233
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,370
His face looks somewhat chubbier

234
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,850
And his stomach...

235
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:28,210
I want to stay like this, warming up your cold cheeks

236
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,620
He only sometimes does the mouth thing

237
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,350
What the hell?

238
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,000
Having finished singing, how do you feel?

239
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,150
Um,

240
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,680
I was very nervous, I wonder if I did well

241
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,820
I was very nervous, I wonder if I did well

242
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,850
There's no need to act like Yakushimaru

243
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,720
Which part did you pay most attention to?

244
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,360
The gun is very heavy

245
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,020
You mean this

246
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,800
You can act like Yama-chan

247
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,100
I was afraid I couldn't hold it up

248
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,670
You can go back to being Yama-chan

249
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,670
I see. Thank you

250
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,570
Please have a seat. So, the next lip sync singer..

251
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,150
Don't pass in front

252
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:11,380
That passion is exactly like a revolutionary soldier

253
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,390
With a voice that could change Japan

254
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,400
By Kaientai, "You're the boss"

255
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:27,970
Hit song by Keintai. A three man band featuring "Takeda Tetsuya", an actor and singer who has been imitated several times in other GNT episodes. (You may recognize him from Kinpachi Sensei or from Prison Batsu during the 101st Marriage Proposal skit.)

256
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:27,970
Lyrics by: Tetsuya Takada  Composer: Toshio Nakamuta

257
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:27,970
Sitting there silently while drinking is fine

258
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:27,970
You're the boss/ Kaientai

259
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:34,970
You started your story, there might have been many hardships

260
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,670
His entrance is on point

261
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,440
Producer: Yoshinobu Nakamura

262
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,200
We can't win this

263
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:41,650
Your boasts are too long, only counting the women you've made cry

264
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,300
His entrance was perfect

265
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:49,850
Boasting doesn't increase the value of being a man

266
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,400
Did he look like this?

267
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,230
You're the boss  You're the boss  You're the boss

268
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:02,530
You're the boss  You're the boss~

269
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:09,340
Sing with me!  You're the boss  You're the queen  You're the shareholder

270
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:16,510
You're the leader You're the general You're the president You're the genius

271
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,120
You're the gang leader  You're the boss

272
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,870
Thank you, come over here please

273
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,290
It's bad if it's too long

274
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,100
That was amazing, thank you for that

275
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,000
Matsumoto, having watched it through, what do you think?

276
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,400
The "You're the boss" part went on for a while, didn't it

277
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,040
Probably because that was the punchline

278
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,610
By dragging it out

279
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,610
You could see how inexperienced he is

280
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,820
After this

281
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,820
Endo will passionately perform that song!

282
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,390
The next lip sync singer

283
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:03,230
Japan's music might not have evolved to what it is today

284
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:03,230
Perhaps, if Japan did not have him

285
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,400
By Shinichi Mori, Winter Riviera

286
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:16,140
Mori Shinichi is a famous folk song singer (The Gaki members imitate him in many of the batsu games because of his particular looks and way of speaking.)

287
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:16,140
Lyrics by: Takashi Matsumoto  Composer: Eiichi Otaki

288
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:16,140
Winter Riviera/ Mori Shinichi

289
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,950
Already his face

290
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,900
Just the face already

291
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,620
The first line

292
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,300
He's about to make the face

293
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,900
Is he?

294
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:35,190
She kindly tells me

295
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:44,170
That she should already be asleep now

296
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,420
You're mocking him

297
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,750
He's mocking him, right?

298
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,750
I think so too

299
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,050
Don't mock Shinichi Mori

300
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:56,510
If she cries, turn on the radio by the window sill

301
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,300
He shouldn't mock Mori Shinichi because he's so famous

302
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,550
It's a little bit different from exactly impersonating him

303
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,850
This is good

304
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:05,160
You should sing a cheerful song for her

305
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,170
That's right

306
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,850
That's good

307
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,050
But any more than this

308
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,050
Any more is too much

309
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,100
That start feels like it'll lead to

310
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,830
An American freight

311
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,730
a good run

312
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:16,070
Waits on the pier

313
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,800
That's good, even the subtle things

314
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,220
He will peak at the hook of the song

315
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:25,240
Winter Riviera, a man

316
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,850
He held back

317
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,850
Yeah, he held back

318
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,070
He managed

319
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,970
He's held himself back

320
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:32,320
Like a ship leaving the harbor

321
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,850
Ok Endo, this time is fine

322
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,590
The sadder it gets

323
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,270
Don't do that

324
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,120
Stop it, that's too much now

325
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:44,730
I become more silent

326
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,250
Ok, it's good now

327
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,250
Ok ok

328
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,500
Stop it, stop doing that

329
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,070
It's good now

330
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,950
He just barely made it through

331
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,020
Yeah yeah

332
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,220
He managed to hold himself back

333
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,050
Thank you

334
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,400
Come over here, please

335
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,900
That was a really magnificent lip sync of Shinichi Mori

336
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,790
Even the people behind me were highly praising you

337
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,670
This time was good

338
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,660
Yeah, it was good

339
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,250
He tried to restrain himself

340
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,500
If you overdo it...

341
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,000
That's not your limit, right?

342
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,200
Then could you do it one more time as much as you can?

343
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,970
No no that's not okay

344
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,700
That is definitely not ok

345
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,370
It seems like, if you overdo it then it'll slow you down

346
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,280
My mother really likes it too

347
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,280
To mention your mom is too much

348
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,790
As expected of Shinichi Mori

349
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,520
Why does he say mother so politely?

350
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,420
I wanna see him

351
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:51,400
Japanese men are bewildered by her voluptuous charm

352
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,570
The one, the only, Cool Beauty

353
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,670
Akina Nakamori's Desire

354
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:07,010
Award winning hit song which has also stayed on best single charts. Won best Single of the Year for the first annual Japan Gold Disc Award

355
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:07,010
DESIRE/ Akina Nakamori

356
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:07,010
Lyrics by: Yoko Aki  Composer: Kisaburo Suzuki

357
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,250
A creep has appeared

358
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:17,560
Director: Kenji Suga

359
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,320
This is really infuriating

360
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,290
A strange person has come down the stairs

361
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,650
That's disgusting

362
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:37,070
Sometimes I feel so bored that it is unbearable even when you are around

363
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,220
I wonder if he'll do that

364
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:45,950
If it is some prate I want to dance now

365
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,970
This is gross

366
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,420
The glass discotheque

367
00:16:49,420 --> 00:17:01,430
Yes, everybody are fallen angels, instead of wings, sweat is spattering

368
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,900
It's perfect

369
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,570
Yep, perfect

370
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:09,910
It's Ok to adhere to anything, lovers in an era

371
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:15,610
Where love is absent

372
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,070
Here it comes

373
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,920
It's about to start

374
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,900
Here comes the hook

375
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:21,620
Falling head over heels, Desire

376
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:27,630
Burning like a blaze, Desire

377
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,050
The "Dance, Dance" part is coming

378
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,500
Even love, to the extent of dance, dance, dance, dance

379
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,120
There

380
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:41,640
If you can't in it you will be isolated

381
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,450
His body is barely moving

382
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,350
He's not moving at all

383
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,070
You can hear his bones creaking

384
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,050
Old man

385
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,570
Old man

386
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,620
What an old man

387
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,570
Thank you

388
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,400
Please come over here. This time which exact part did you most concentrate on?

389
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,210
This time was extremely difficult

390
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,770
He's out of breath

391
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,320
Last time, um, what was it again?

392
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,880
TM Revolution

393
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,880
Don't purposely overdo it

394
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,150
It was TM revolution, right?

395
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,290
Akina Nakamori

396
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,420
Akina's

397
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,420
Suffering was portrayed really well

398
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,260
However, we, as the audience suffered way more

399
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,420
He barely moved at all

400
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,860
That's why I said this old man is creaking

401
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:51,810
Which performer will stand victorious!?

402
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:51,810
With a prize on the line, in this heated lip sync battle

403
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,910
I will now announce the winner

404
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,380
I will now announce the winner

405
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,850
Here we go... The winner is...

406
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:09,870
Shinichi Mori's Winter Riviera. Congratulations!

407
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:15,330
Lip Sync

408
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:15,330
Hit Songs Studio

409
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:15,330
Late night

410
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:15,330
Shozo Endo

411
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:15,330
Victor

412
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,120
He did a good job restraining himself

413
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,070
That face

414
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,110
He looks more like Takeshi now (Takeshi Kitano)

415
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:25,040
Now, there is a reward for the winner, Shinichi Mori

416
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,810
To sing along

417
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,810
With just the instrumental of the song

418
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,050
My actual voice?

419
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,750
After this

420
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,750
Endo will perform MAX Shinichi Mori

421
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,320
I wonder if I can do well

422
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,820
Acquiring the competition

423
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,290
What do you mean "acquiring"?

424
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,020
It should be winning

425
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,070
You "acquire" license, not competitions

426
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,820
Pardon me

427
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,170
So,

428
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,970
The winner of the competition

429
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,750
Performing Winter Riviera

430
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:04,820
Lyrics by: Takashi Matsumoto  Composer: Eiichi Otaki

431
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:04,820
Winter Riviera/ Shinichi Mori

432
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,170
Here he comes

433
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,750
Here he is

434
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,720
So far, he's almost the same as before

435
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,920
He started fine

436
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:22,530
She kindly tells me

437
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:31,580
That she should already be asleep now

438
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,750
Endo Endo

439
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,370
That's not bad

440
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,500
That's fine

441
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:43,820
If she cries, turn on the radio by the window sill

442
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,670
Endo, that's good

443
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,070
That part was really good

444
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:52,360
I will even sing a cheerful song for her

445
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,550
He's redeemed himself from earlier

446
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,720
There it is

447
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,030
An American freight

448
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,230
An American

449
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,030
An American

450
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,070
Samba

451
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,030
Samba

452
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:09,010
*Endo mixed up the words. "Pier" is Sambashi in japanese. That's in the next line.

453
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:02,170
Waits on the pier

454
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,770
American Samba?

455
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:12,450
Winter Riviera, a man

456
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,700
An american midwife is waiting

457
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:09,010
*Sanba is midwife.

458
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:16,070
He won't be the winner like this, we were mistaken

459
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:19,560
Like a ship leaving the harbor

460
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:24,800
The sadder it gets

461
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,800
This is exactly like Endo

462
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,750
Yeah I agree

463
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,300
He's not doing it properly

464
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:33,600
I become more silent

465
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,350
That's such a forced grin

466
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,820
Oh man, so close

467
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,650
Just that one part...

468
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,820
Thank you

469
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,150
That was amazing

470
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,150
It was really good wasn't it?

471
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,220
I thought you were actually Shinichi Mori

472
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,030
How was it?

473
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:03,030
An american midwife is

474
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,030
waiting on the pier

475
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,640
Having made this error

476
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,640
I'm very sorry

477
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,070
It's hard to say that he's the winner

478
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,440
It's hard to say that he's the winner

479
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:12,810
Well, I guess

480
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,110
There should be another winner

481
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Another winner

482
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,580
It should be DESIRE

483
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,450
It should be DESIRE

484
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,450
Tsk!

485
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,250
What a last minute change

486
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,660
There's a clicking sound from back there

487
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,560
Director Suga

488
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,560
Revised Victor

489
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,570
The winner, Director Suga will perform with his voice

490
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:39,120
So, the winner of the competition, Akina Nakamori's

491
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,150
Desire

492
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:49,310
DESIRE/ Akina Nakamori

493
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:49,310
Lyrics by: Yoko Aki  Composer: Kisaburo Suzuki

494
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,100
Good luck

495
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,150
Director looks different

496
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,450
It's not an easy song

497
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,750
Yeah

498
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,420
That's to be expected

499
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:03,220
Sounds like an ordinary old man

500
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,800
He isn't voicing out at all

501
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:19,010
Sometimes I feel so bored that it is unbearable even when you are around

502
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,570
But, the real Akina's voice is also quiet

503
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,420
This is scary

504
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,220
We can't help watching until the end

505
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,650
Exactly

506
00:23:21,270 --> 00:24:09,690
This video was brought to you by tofu panda fan subs

507
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,370
This is hell

508
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,350
It's torture

509
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,420
This is hell for everyone

510
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,970
The singer and the audience

511
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:36,200
Because it feels like hell and no one will benefit from it, he is forced to stop
