00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,540
Documental Season 5 - Finale

2
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,520
Hello, I'm Hollywood Zakoshisho

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,520
I know that I'm the type of comedian who attacks aggressively

4
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:40,360
I have a pen, I have an apple

5
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,280
Apple pen

6
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,160
However, Funakoshi Eiichiro cheated on me

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,930
He chose another woman over me, he cheated on me

8
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,980
Hello, I'm Chihara Junior

9
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:07,490
When a comedian gets absolutely no laugh,
to be honest, we become really depressed

10
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,060
I'm about to cum

11
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:22,610
We just have to believe that "this is getting a laugh, no problem, this is funny", that's all we can do to get through

12
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,600
And I'm actually easily amused...

13
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,020
Nice work   -Thank you

14
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,980
I feel tired too just by watching it

15
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,500
There's quite a lot of good scenes this time

16
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,920
Everyone has been working really hard

17
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,650
Well, I have no complaints at all

18
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,730
Huh? I have so many cards?   -Give some to me then

19
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,490
I need to touch my eyes in order to wear this

20
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,280
Hey, wait a second...

21
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:29,190
Attack points

22
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,090
We've never worked together on our own right? Junior-san?

23
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,840
Yeah, you're right

24
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,660
I'm really happy   -Yeah

25
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,340
Let's start

26
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,590
Okay, okay, please give me some time to prepare

27
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,210
*Akira 100% is a Japanese comedian whose act is completely naked, wearing only a pan and neck tie

28
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,210
Here comes the exaggerated Akira 100%*

29
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,950
Aren't you feeling a bit cold?

30
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,550
Chilly, chilly

31
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:34,090
Aren't you feeling a bit cold?

32
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,510
Aren't you feeling a bit cold?

33
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,850
Chilly, chilly

34
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,370
Aren't you feeling a bit cold?

35
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,130
This is hilarious

36
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,620
Nice one, keep it up

37
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,960
Is he going to do it at this distance...

38
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,190
Aren't you feeling a bit cold?

39
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,890
Chilly, chilly

40
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,350
Okay, good...

41
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,420
He endured it

42
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,000
Junior-san, you don't know much about games right?

43
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,340
I know nothing about games   -You don't play games right?

44
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,240
You mean like Famicom?   -Yes, Famicom

45
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,090
So Famicom gags won't work then

46
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,020
Oh, you wrote it all down?   -Yes, it's all here

47
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,830
There's so freaking many   -Yes, there's freaking many

48
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,230
I'll do Toshi-chan, you wanna watch Toshi-chan? (Toshihiko Tahara)

49
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,460
There's so many others and you wanna do Toshi-chan?   -Yes, Toshi-chan

50
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,220
I'll do it now, please look at me, Junior-san

51
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,490
Umm...

52
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,050
Umm...I'm...

53
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,600
I'm...umm...I'm Toshi-chan

54
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,860
I'm Toshi-chan

55
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,350
I'm Toshi-chan...

56
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,310
I'm...

57
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,970
Toshi-chan...

58
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:11,080
I'm Toshi-chan...

59
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,590
I'm Toshi-chan, Toshi-chan, Toshi-chan

60
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,280
I'm Toshi-chan

61
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,370
I'll imitate IKKO then, IKKO

62
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,960
(I'll imitate IKKO then, IKKO)

63
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,880
You're not saying his well-known line?   -Nope

64
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,700
You're not saying it?   -Nope

65
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,580
So you're not saying it?

66
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:14,510
Is there a version where you say it?   -Nope

67
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,890
Time to let the zombies out

68
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,690
Zombie time

69
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,830
Ah, the zombies are coming

70
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,570
Hey, I want you guys to meet someone   -Who?

71
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,210
I want you guys to meet someone   -Oh, really?

72
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,170
Is it fine?   -Yeah, well, we're quite busy here though

73
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,230
But I really want you guys to meet someone   -Okay

74
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,890
Please sit here   -Oh, sit here?

75
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,520
But we're quite busy though, very busy   -Excuse me

76
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,410
Well, but I think you guys will be happy to meet this person

77
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,160
So it means that we know this person right?

78
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,060
Yeah, I think so

79
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,100
Please come in

80
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,930
Do you recognize him?   -Not at all

81
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,670
You should recognize him   -Eh?

82
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,800
No, I don't   -Yes, you should

83
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,920
Eh?   -He looks so angry though

84
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,810
So scary   -Come on, you should know him?

85
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,810
No, I don't   -No idea at all

86
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,140
He's Jouto no Teru (from Be-Bop High School)

87
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,180
Are you trying to mess with me, you idiot?!

88
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,330
Give me you pants, dude!!

89
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,580
I'm the boss Teru, if you've got any problem with this, come find me at Jouto, you idiot!!

90
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,940
You understand me?!

91
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,190
Holy crap, he's really that Teru

92
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,660
Of course

93
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,500
This guy is still wearing his pants

94
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,280
Give me your jeans, dude!!

95
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,930
Ah, it's stuck...

96
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,750
His shoes...

97
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,140
You laughed just now

98
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,150
Was something stuck?

99
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,950
Well, no...

100
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,420
I laughed because this wasn't going smoothly at all

101
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,180
I feel like Takahashi is the one who made me laugh

102
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,960
Yeah, it's difficult to tell

103
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,240
But Junior is out for sure   -Yes

104
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,270
However, there's still some time left

105
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,800
And since you laughed because of the zombies

106
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,980
Zakoshi will be enduring the zombies on his own, until time runs out

107
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,980
And if he couldn't make it, it will be a "no contest"

108
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,540
Wahh, there's still like 30 minutes left   -Yes, 30 minutes

109
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,780
Anyway, Junior is out

110
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,130
Junior, why did you laugh?

111
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,570
Well, because I thought like "this is not going smoothly at all!"

112
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,330
Ah, it's stuck...

113
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,440
His shoes...

114
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,340
Your body went like this...

115
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,670
Thank you very much

116
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,420
You were in a pinch during the first half right?

117
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,880
Yeah, I was in a pinch, and to be honest, I even thought I'll be out in 20 or 30 minutes

118
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,920
Something gummy came out of him...

119
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,090
Hello, I'm Koizumi Junichiro

120
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,560
Junior is...

121
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,960
And Zakoshi, that guy is too strong

122
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,900
Na, ka, ta, Nakata

123
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,230
I'm a per---fect human

124
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,340
He's too strong right?   -Yeah

125
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,570
Too damn strong

126
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,710
Wahh, I'm the only one left

127
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,510
I'm the only one left, on my own

128
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,050
Come on, zombies, you idiots!!

129
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,070
Come on!!

130
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,500
Okay, let's start

131
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,500
Zombie time

132
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,400
Eh? I need to endure the zombies for 30 minutes? That's hellish!

133
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,360
All I can do is to hold back my laughter

134
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,780
Please come in

135
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,030
Let's sit over there

136
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,720
Sorry, it's a little bit messy

137
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,340
You've been here once before right?   -Yeah, about 6 months ago

138
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,770
So you're a repeat customer   -Are the girls still the same?

139
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,160
No, the girls are different, it has been a while

140
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,750
The girls are different...

141
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,410
Come here, lie down over here

142
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,050
Young man, over here

143
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,540
You were eating sushi?

144
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,300
Yeah, today is Chinese's home party

145
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,870
Yes, over there, lie down over there

146
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,590
Oh, you look slimmer   -Really? Thank you very much

147
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,410
Are you busy with your work?

148
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,150
Face down?   -Yes, face down

149
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:22,750
Sit here?

150
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,200
Young man, you look slimmer than before, are you tired?   -Yes

151
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,400
Which part of your body feels tired the most?   -Umm, around my waist

152
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,780
And my legs as well...

153
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,560
Is it raining outside?

154
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,280
-I don't know about the weather outside
-I see, you're always staying indoors

155
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,940
Okay, I'll give you a massage

156
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,620
Young man, this feels really comfortable...my service...

157
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:55,020
The girls here are all very cute, Lily-chan, Lulu-chan, everyone is cute

158
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,200
Lily-chan from Dalian

159
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,060
Ah, Dalian?   -Lulu-chan...

160
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,100
Lulu-chan from Shanghai...

161
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,900
They are all very cute

162
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,900
Are you his friend, young man?

163
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,680
Yes, I'm his friend

164
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,940
Starting from here

165
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,970
Thank you very much, young man

166
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,500
Okay, please give me the VIP course then

167
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,940
Is it cold outside?

168
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,800
Oh, not really cold today

169
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,740
There's not many girls during this time, it's February, it's the Chinese new year, the girls all went home

170
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,180
You're in a good shape, young man   -Thank you

171
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,020
You're really muscular   -Thank you very much

172
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,220
Do you have a girlfriend?   -No, I don't have a girlfriend

173
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,750
Nope? Chu-chu-chu-chu-chu...

174
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,060
This guy has a wife though

175
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,030
You have a wife?   -Yes

176
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,600
So you can't hang out, huh?   -Yeah, I can't

177
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,400
So you can't come to these shops, huh?   -Yeah, I can't

178
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,630
This young man is always coming though, chu-chu-chu...

179
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,640
You're getting too excited   -Excuse me

180
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,400
Okay, young man

181
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,040
Okay, lymph

182
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,210
Lymph massage, lymph...

183
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,650
This is the lymph massage, young man, the most comfortable massage

184
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,220
Comfortable massage, lymph...

185
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,200
You don't have any pubic hair, young man?

186
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,630
Yeah, many things happened...

187
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,850
-You must be hanging out a lot, young man!
-Many things happened and my pubic hair is gone

188
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,330
Having no pubic hair means you're hanging out a lot, right?

189
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,510
Thank you, young man

190
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,890
...VIP course...the best...

191
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,910
Okay, please give me the best VIP course

192
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,580
Thank you, young man, I'll give you the best VIP course

193
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,320
The most comfortable course...

194
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,530
The most comfortable course, the lymph course...

195
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:14,110
The lymph course for you, young man...

196
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,640
The lymph course...

197
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,360
What are you doing, young man? Stay still!

198
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,210
Don't move, come on, it scares me

199
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,100
Okay, the lymph course

200
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,080
Young man...

201
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,170
The super lymph course...

202
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,000
This is so embarrassing

203
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,220
Young man, did you visit our shop at Tamachi?

204
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,370
Ah, I didn't visit the one in Tamachi

205
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,360
The girls are all different now   -Oh, really?

206
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,820
I went to the one in Shinbashi instead...

207
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,990
The first-time customers need to take reservation on phone

208
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,970
After that, I will be here giving them a massage, the VIP course...

209
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,880
The lymph course...

210
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,890
Okay, young man, thank you very much

211
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,120
You're not allowed to touch here

212
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,880
If you want to touch...there's another touchable VIP course...

213
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,630
The touchable VIP course...

214
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,100
You want to touch?   -Yes...

215
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,810
Okay, you can touch here only

216
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,230
Okay, young man, the comfortable course...

217
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,140
Okay, this is the most comfortable VIP splash course

218
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,660
VIP splash course

219
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,310
You want it clockwise or counter clockwise?

220
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,980
Ah, counter clockwise feels good...

221
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,670
Okay, the comfortable course, the comfortable course...

222
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,620
The most comfortable course...

223
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,030
The most comfortable...   -Wait a second, wait a second...

224
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,080
(Oh my god...)

225
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,890
The course is finished   -It's his turn now

226
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,970
(Okay, I see where this is going)

227
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,260
My turn?

228
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,720
(That's a good idea)

229
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,110
This must be tough

230
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:13,250
(This is just...this must be tough...)

231
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,180
This is his first time

232
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,370
This is a difficult hurdle to jump

233
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,730
I'll take off your hat   -Okay

234
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,080
Young man, just lie down and relax   -Okay

235
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,830
Just like this

236
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,100
Which part of your body feels tired?   -My neck feels sore

237
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,330
Young man, VIP course right?

238
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,100
Yes, VIP course please

239
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,690
Okay   -Turn around, face up

240
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,280
Okay   -Face up

241
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,000
Okay, young man, the comfortable course...

242
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,440
What a big body!

243
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,200
You're eating a lot, huh?

244
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,740
Look at yourself, this thing here

245
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,990
What? Booo?

246
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,860
What did you eat, huh?

247
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,200
It smells so bad   -No, I don't think so

248
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,700
Young man, chu-chu-chu-chu...

249
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,300
Okay, VIP course, here starts the VIP course

250
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,790
Okay, young man, next the lymph course

251
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,520
Good, good, lymph course

252
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,450
The lymph course

253
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,090
Young man, the lymph course

254
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,820
The lymph course, young man

255
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,470
Okay, young man

256
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,960
What are you doing? You're like a cockroach!

257
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,820
Have you finished showering?

258
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,440
Not yet?

259
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,650
Shower...

260
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,150
(Is he actually laughing?)

261
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,830
(Should this be count as laughing?)

262
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,020
Okay, young man, the last bit

263
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,690
A final touch

264
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,190
Hey no, you can't touch me, this ends if you touch me

265
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,740
Okay, finished

266
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,270
We're done, young man

267
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,300
Do the rest yourself, we're done

268
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,400
Okay   -Thank you very much

269
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,680
Did you feel comfortable?   -Yes, very comfortable

270
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,360
It's the best to come here with your friends, very interesting

271
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,240
Do you want to take a shower?   -Yes, please

272
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,760
Have you finished showering? Not yet?

273
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,680
(What will happen if Jimmy is the one to do this?)

274
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
(I really want to see it)

275
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,380
Okay, young man, you're done?

276
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,620
He said it was comfortable   -Yeah, very comfortable

277
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,550
Are you guys waiting for your friends?

278
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,480
Yes, we are   -Okay

279
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,620
Hello, I would like to get a massage

280
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,040
I would like to get a massage

281
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,300
Did you make a reservation?

282
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,000
Well, umm, I made a reservation just now

283
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,040
Can we stay here as well?

284
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,910
Excuse me

285
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,780
*Singapore can also be interpreted as "hidden pole (芯がポール)"

286
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,780
My Singapore, Singapore, Singapore*

287
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,050
So, can I get a massage please?

288
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,370
You're wearing something interesting, huh?

289
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,500
Should I lie down with my face up or down?

290
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,050
Face up, please

291
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:52,170
You guys are staying with your friend, huh?   -Yeah

292
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,220
Can I start now, young man?   -Ah, yeah...

293
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,540
VIP course?   -Eh?

294
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,550
VIP course?   -Eh? Beat course?

295
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,110
VIP course for this young man...this is quite disturbing though...

296
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,850
Should I take it off then? What should I do with my Singapore?

297
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,020
-What to do with this Singapore?
-I'll let you decide what to do with my Singapore

298
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,100
This Singapore looks interesting, so just keep wearing it   -Really? Okay

299
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,550
Lymph massage, okay?   -Okay

300
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,610
Come on, nothing strange about this, this is not anything dirty

301
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,980
Macau...

302
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,120
Macau?

303
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,070
Macau, Macau, oh, Macau, Macau...

304
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,050
Oh, that's your Macau?   -Ah, Macau, Macau...

305
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,720
Hey sister, wait, sister...

306
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,410
Oh, sister, wait a second...

307
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,470
Please wait a second, sister, I'm about to cum, I'm about to cum...

308
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,680
Sister, seriously, please stop, sister...

309
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,740
Seriously, I'm about to cum, wait a second, wait a second...

310
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,450
Please, don't let me cum, it can't be aired...

311
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,860
You're so loud, young man   -Excuse me

312
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,430
Wait a second, not that, my Singapore, Singapore...

313
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,650
(Zakoshi is incredible)

314
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,840
I'm gonna cum, sister, I'm gonna cum...

315
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,650
Sister, please no, sister...

316
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,820
Do it yourself if you're gonna cum

317
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,820
Okay, young man, go take a shower and do it yourself   -Thank you

318
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,370
(He's incredible)

319
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,260
Excuse me   -He's incredible

320
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,880
Are you going to take a shower?

321
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,460
You're not?

322
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,240
Well, shower, umm...

323
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,090
That was close

324
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,450
Excuse me, are you free right now?   -Eh?

325
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,180
Well, my friend...

326
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,750
He's a Kabuki actor, and his costume has been stolen

327
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,550
Eh? That's no trivial matter

328
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,490
Yeah, and we're finding it now

329
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,120
Is it fine for us to find it here   -Yeah, sure

330
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,770
He said okay, come in

331
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,330
Tamura Ken's helper - Moriya Biyori

332
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,380
We have to find it, or else you'll be in trouble

333
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,160
How does it look like?

334
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,700
*Shumei is the name succession ceremony held in kabuki theatre, taking on new stage-names, most often those of the actor's father, and hold great honor and importance

335
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,700
It's for the Shumei ceremony*

336
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,920
Today is the Shumei ceremony?!   -Yes

337
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,580
And you can't find your costumes?   -Yes

338
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,220
Eh? You're in big trouble

339
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,480
It's my son's first stage appearance!

340
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,700
Today is so important!   -He don't even have underwear on

341
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,950
Not this one right?   -No, not this one

342
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,310
Holy crap

343
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,570
No, I didn't take it

344
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,340
Really?   -Yes

345
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,950
*Jounetsu Tairiku is a famous documentary TV show

346
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,950
Jounetsu Tairiku has been filming me for a long time

347
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,600
Well, that's none of my business, I didn't take it

348
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,710
No, it's not about whether you took it or not

349
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,140
Eh, he has a wart   -Excuse me

350
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,420
He has a big wart there

351
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,640
I found this   -He has a big wart

352
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,020
I found these shoes   -Ah, those are mine

353
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,330
He found it!   -Let me wear these first

354
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,140
Are these your shoes?   -Yes, let me wear these first

355
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,910
You can do tap dance?

356
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,640
Maybe I'm quite talented with this

357
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,060
My legs are dancing on their own

358
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,030
This is his first time

359
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,140
I should have learnt tap dance instead

360
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,410
Didn't you learn it before?

361
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,630
I'm really talented with this, I should have learnt it instead

362
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,760
You must've learnt it in order to do those dance steps

363
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,330
He's a Kabuki actor, dude   -Really?

364
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,400
He couldn't have learnt it before   -Well, yeah...

365
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,790
*"YOOO" is one of the shouts and calls used in Kabuki theatre

366
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,790
It's impossible for him to say "YOOO" during his dance, right?

367
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,600
Well, yeah, you're right   -Try it out

368
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,600
YOOO

369
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,770
I should have learnt tap dance instead

370
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,270
What do you think?

371
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:59,420
Yeah, he should have learnt tap dance instead

372
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,040
He has a wart, by the way

373
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,050
Please look at his wart

374
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,360
Eww, what the heck!   -Where?

375
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,500
A wart   -Which one?

376
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,700
This one   -Where is it?

377
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,120
This one   -Which one?

378
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,460
This one, dude   -Where?

379
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,940
Right here!   -Where is it?

380
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,920
Which one do you mean?

381
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,140
This one, this one, this is a wart

382
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,830
Look at it   -I looked already

383
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,720
Ouch!

384
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,540
Thank you

385
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,920
Be careful with your wart

386
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,360
Okay, not much time left

387
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,440
He's here again?   -You should definitely quit

388
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,040
I still want to do it

389
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,910
The power of your punch dropped

390
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,160
I think you should quit too

391
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,710
I really want to do it again

392
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,480
Sit over here

393
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,460
Try to hit his body

394
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,030
He hit me just now, but the power is totally different comparing to his golden age

395
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,530
I think you're losing your vigor too

396
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,720
Go for it

397
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,980
He's definitely weaker

398
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,490
This is nothing compared to his golden age

399
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,700
No need for him to be naked though

400
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,130
This is just...completely...

401
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,370
He's absolutely weaker

402
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,780
You don't even have the power to knock him down now

403
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,220
Ah...he's so weak...

404
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,510
Eh? Me?

405
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,510
One, two, three

406
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,830
He sure is becoming weaker

407
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,270
He definitely won't laugh because of this, come on...

408
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,280
My poop is coming out

409
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,540
He won't laugh because of that, come on...

410
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,750
He must be professional, right?

411
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,920
Eh?   -Is he professional?

412
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,280
This hurts so badly   -He won world titles in three weight classes

413
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,100
No wonder it hurts so badly

414
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,330
You don't know about him?   -Eh? Who is he?

415
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,820
(He don't recognize him?)

416
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,600
(Eh? He don't know Hozumi Hasegawa?)

417
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,290
Thank you very much

418
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,730
I don't know much about boxing

419
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,280
What are you doing?

420
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,120
I'm Miko

421
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,080
*Jimmy is imitating the famous Timotei shampoo CM:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXj8xj47FIY

422
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,080
Timotei, Timotei*

423
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,310
I'm Miko

424
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,560
He was close just now

425
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,400
Okay

426
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,900
There's not much time left

427
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,320
Is there any more happenings?

428
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,360
Come on, come on   -Yeah, they should

429
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,840
Zombies, come on, come on, come on!

430
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,880
Not coming?

431
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
What will you do?

432
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,720
So scary!

433
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,060
It's so noisy here

434
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,140
You're being noisy, young man

435
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,200
You understand me? I can't take this anymore

436
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,530
Well, I think he got him

437
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,400
Well, I'll give you an orange card   -Yes

438
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,640
That one got you   -Yes

439
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,960
So scary, so scary   -This is scary

440
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,270
You're being noisy, young man

441
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,940
You understand me? I can't take this anymore

442
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,950
Okay, orange card

443
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,970
And 5 more minutes   -Okay

444
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,970
Akiyama, let's go

445
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,670
This is terrible

446
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,470
Zombie time

447
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,210
What the heck?

448
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,890
What's going on?

449
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,700
I'm Miko

450
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,700
I'm Miko from the municipal office

451
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:25,110
I'm Miko from the municipal office, in charge of police affairs

452
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,290
Got it

453
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:30,900
My at sign is JJ   -JJ?

454
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,130
I'm Miko   -You are Miko

455
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,590
Please call me again   -Okay

456
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,170
I'm Miko   -Okay

457
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,440
Got it

458
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,380
No more time left   -Thank you very much

459
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:47,630
No more time left, they need to be more aggressive

460
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:51,770
Last 3 mintutes

461
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,770
This is terrible

462
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,870
Can you go immediately?   -Please wait a second

463
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,630
Hopefully they can make him laugh

464
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,290
But that's a tough challenge

465
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,840
Hey

466
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,670
You laughed right?   -No, I didn't

467
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,560
Why don't you laugh?   -I did laugh

468
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,170
Laugh more, dude! You're always easily amused

469
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,390
I did laugh   -Laugh, dude

470
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,260
I did laugh

471
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,710
What's wrong with you?   -You wanna start a fight?

472
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,320
Is he laughing slightly?

473
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,100
Hell no, my knee is going to break

474
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,440
Just laugh, dude

475
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,370
My knee is going to break

476
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,250
God damn

477
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,960
It's so dry

478
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,600
Eat some sushi, dude   -I'm eating

479
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,420
One more   -One more?

480
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,420
Dig in

481
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm waiting for you

482
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,230
Probably the last one

483
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,380
You're being really noisy

484
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:50,450
You hear me? Be more considerate

485
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,350
This is so scary

486
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,350
Are you listening?   -Miko, Miko...

487
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,420
I'm Miko, Miko...

488
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,630
Come on, be more considerate

489
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:03,250
Okay, time is almost up

490
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,550
Let's start the countdown

491
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:17,260
(10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
-Give me toro, I want toro   -Here you go, toro

492
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,180
Finished!

493
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,340
Incredible!   -Oh, finished?

494
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,230
It's finished

495
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:30,580
Finish!

496
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,180
I endured it   -Yes, you endured it

497
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,940
I endured it

498
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,990
Zakoshi is the winner!   -Thank you very much

499
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,140
He's so strong

500
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,780
Good job, he endured it

501
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,110
I was so worried, when he came in the last second

502
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:49,380
Well, this is really incredible

503
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,610
Thank you very much!

504
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,220
I did it!   -Congratulations

505
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,610
Thank you!   -That was amazing

506
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,360
Yeah, he's amazing

507
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,330
No complaints   -Really?

508
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,070
No complaints   -Thank you very much

509
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,620
Look at this

510
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,620
It's 10 million

511
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,340
I did it, it's double of R-1's cash prize

512
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,690
Where did you almost laugh?

513
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,500
Akiyama's zombie, which I actually laughed

514
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,430
You understand me? I can't take this anymore

515
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,710
Anyone will laugh at that one

516
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,240
And Kanoh Eiko's toy as well

517
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,790
What are you doing, buddy?

518
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,790
(What are you doing, buddy?)

519
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,840
I'm waiting for the toilet, dude!

520
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,320
(I'm waiting for the toilet, dude!)

521
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,610
That was awful

522
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,720
That was just...

523
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,140
Everything you do comes back to you

524
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,330
Am I the fourth champion?

525
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:53,760
Yeah, there was no champion for the first contest

526
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,980
Hooray!

527
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,130
Hooray!

528
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,900
This is 10 million

529
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:08,320
Well, my last wish about this contest,
please don't let any robber come to my home

530
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,120
I have to say, I have no complaints at all

531
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,190
Aren't you feeling a bit cold?

532
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:29,380
Of course, as an audience, I really want them to make him laugh in the end

533
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,690
He's strong in both offense and defense, right?

534
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,420
Yeah, you're right   -He's not laughing

535
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:39,070
Yeah, he's not laughing...

536
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:47,400
And the unknowledgableness of him, for not even recognizing the former champion Hozumi Hasegawa

537
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,720
That was really unexpected

538
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,440
He's probably just thinking "what's wrong with this guy"

539
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,550
But anyway, he've been attacking all the time as well

540
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,940
So I think this is a victory with no complaints
