1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,850
Looks nice!

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,820
This place has changed completely.
Great.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,830
September 24th 1996

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,930
The look of this station in the past was really shabby.

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,100
I don't hesitate to guide acquaintances anymore.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,100
At Japan Railways Amagasaki Station

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,710
This time, we have come to our hometown Amagasaki.

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,140
How long has it been since last time?
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:38,580
It must have been so long.
I haven't been in this station for maybe more than 10 years.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:45,590
Because people say Amagasaki has changed, we came here to confirm it with our won eyes.

11
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,130
I was astonished at this entirely changed station.
Me too.

12
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,400
I see Ama has been rapidly changing to the average.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,600
They're normally making an announcement.

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,610
Looks so clean.
They sell goods in Japanese yen now.

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,910
Should he apologize?

16
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:11,880
Another currency "Amar" used to be circulated here.

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,920
Was it here?

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,220
Shioe.
It's the direction of our houses.

19
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,230
There is an exclusive residential district.

20
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,230
It is on a hill.

21
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,600
Shall we go to town?

22
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,080
Here is Hamachu's house.
Oh, Hamachu.

23
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,580
He was our classmate.

24
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,920
His father was a pro baseball player.
He wasn't a really good player.

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,420
And his son used to eat snots during classes.

26
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,460
Look at that mailbox.

27
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,160
Your letter will never be delivered if you post it in that.

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,570
Don't say that.
My letters were never be delivered.

29
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,570
I know that's just a fake.
I was cheated many times.

30
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:24,790
(no sub)

31
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,790
Do you think that wall is high?

32
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:34,670
We two jumped over the wall once when we ran away.
You don't need to say that.

33
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,670
But it's true. We jumped over that.
Ran and jumped.

34
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,240
We needed to do it to escape.
I can't say what we did before it.

35
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:52,620
(no sub)

36
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,120
You're joking!

37
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,090
I'm serious.
What are you doing here?

38
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,790
Are you Yumi?
Yeah.

39
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,230
Who?
She is Morioka's sister Yumi.

40
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,200
I can't recognize her because her look has changed.

41
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:14,040
What does your older brother do?
He is in a living room now.

42
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,050
Do you know your brother was mentioned in our song?
Don't say that!

43
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:25,420
I hate it!

44
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,790
Don't say anything about it!
Anyway, she is Morioka's sister.

45
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:52,210
(no sub)

46
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:57,220
Our elementary school, this is the worst place.
No, it's not worst!

47
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,590
This wasn't a bad place.

48
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:26,410
(no sub)

49
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,710
It hasn't changed over there.
Yeah.

50
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,220
We used to peel our penises over there.

51
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,490
It made us feel good.
We felt good when we climbed poles.

52
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:47,230
When I was the third grader, I didn't use to stop climbing there even after a class started.

53
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:02,110
When I saw Hamada at the first time, we were beside that gate.

54
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,490
When I went back home, you entered through the gate.

55
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,860
You were wearing a pantaloon.
Haven't you gone too far?

56
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,830
And had a perm, so I was surprised at your look.
And I was carrying a bag like this.

57
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,870
Yeah, though every student carried a satchel, only you carried a bag like a sandbag.

58
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,870
So, I though you must be an international student.

59
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,340
From Mongolia.

60
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:37,080
Your mother stood here every morning.

61
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,090
She volunteered to control us like this.
I saw her every morning here.

62
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,160
What disgusted me was,

63
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:57,170
when I didn't wash my face, she used to wipe my eyes with a handkerchief smeared by her saliva.

64
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,840
My father was here as well.
He used to stand there.

65
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:16,020
This place hasn't changed a bit.
The smell of broiled pig innards from Yamazato's shop!

66
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,360
Hiroshi!

67
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Oh, dad, I haven't seen you for a long time.
I've regularly come here.

68
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,370
Where is a skewer?

69
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:42,650
I used to come here, skewer and eat it without permission.

70
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,820
This brings back memories!
You've been running this shop for a long time.

71
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,820
This food looks bad, however, tastes good.

72
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,830
Shake hands with our baby.

73
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,830
I know this baby will be the food later.

74
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,580
(no sub)

75
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,050
Look at the aluminum door.

76
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:29,060
There was a wooden door before, but we cut that door.

77
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,670
Others are wooden doors, but only that is the aluminum one.

78
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,670
We cut it with a saw.

79
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:48,110
A foreigner lived in the next apartment.

80
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,080
We stole his underwear.
We took it from a washing machine outside.

81
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,060
He suddenly opened a window and said "Don't steal my underwater."

82
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,590
"Don't come here again."
And we ran away.

83
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,060
We hid ourselves under the stairway.

84
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,300
After our friend went out, we went up ad entered his apartment.

85
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,570
We'd had a duplicate key made.

86
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:19,340
When he was attending PE class,
I picked a key from his pocket.

87
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,750
I gave it other friend and asked him
to have a duplicated key made.

88
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:33,490
(no sub)

89
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:39,100
Itao wanna overcome his father.

90
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:45,570
So, they are playing a sumo match.
He wanna win a sumo match.

91
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:50,170
In traditional Japanese way.

92
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:55,710
Let's see "Can Itsuji Itao overcome his father?"

93
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,590
Can Itsuji Itao overcome his father?

94
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:06,720
Itao came back to his hometown.
Can he overcome his father?

95
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,100
We leave judgment to his mother.

96
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:22,770
East side, father.

97
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,650
Look, his son looks so serious.

98
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,050
West side, Ichiro.

99
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,220
She is calling him Ichiro.

100
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:42,260
* The kanji of his name Itsuji
can also be pronounced Ichiro.

101
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:42,260
I don't still understand
why she calls her son Ichiro
though his name is Itsuji

102
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,400
His name is a bit hard for her to pronounce.
I see.

103
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Father forgot to hold salt.

104
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,750
Can he beat him?

105
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,590
A horn of a train is sounding.

106
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,890
He is baring his testicles.

107
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,270
As if he wanna say his son was in it.
I see.

108
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,270
He is expressing it with his own body.
Showing his testicles.

109
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:32,210
Because we are outside now,
he may be arrested.

110
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,580
It might be good that he'll be arrested.

111
00:10:34,580 --> 00:11:23,030
(no sub)

112
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,170
Look at over there.

113
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,210
About 200m ahead of us.

114
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,210
There was Ito's house.

115
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:46,220
Ito whose house was there was my former partner,

116
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,250
and can you see a wall?

117
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,990
Hamada and he suddenly started to fight there once.

118
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,990
Do a wall and it have relation?

119
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:01,870
I mean, you gave Ito a headlock and hit his head several times against the wall of Kirin Beer's building.

120
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,840
I tried to stop you.

121
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:13,540
After fighting, you started to walk to that direction saying "Let's go".

122
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:22,150
Because Ito was still there, I wondered if I should follow you or be with him.

123
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:27,160
You were going that direction, though your house was located in the opposite.

124
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,230
I don't know why, but I followed you.
Oh, did you?

125
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,270
If I had been with Ito, we might not have formed the duo.

126
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,370
The moment was the turning point, wasn't it?
Seriously.

127
00:12:41,040 --> 00:13:26,150
(no sub)

128
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:33,460
This place brings back memories as well.
We used to buy snacks here when we went on school excursions.

129
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,530
Shakutani's house!

130
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,530
Here is Shakutani's house!

131
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,540
Shouldn't I talk about him?

132
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,650
I still feel guilty for him.

133
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,650
Was his house narrow like this?
I think it looked wider.

134
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,290
No ones live here anymore.

135
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,160
He was a bullied child.

136
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,390
One day, he had feces in his pants, and he begged me not to tell it to anybody.

137
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,700
"I never tell it to any one!" I replied,
but I spread extremely it the next day.

138
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:19,700
You've drifted apart from him since then.
He finally changed to another school without my noticing it.

139
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,670
This alley is so narrow.
Yeah.

140
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,880
Look at the bicycle.

141
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,650
How scary!

142
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,750
Even plants are more powerful than those of other places.

143
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,860
It hasn't changed here at all,
but here was my former house.

144
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:48,870
Here is nothing anymore.
My house has been demolished.

145
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:55,070
There was a dentist next to my former house.
There is nothing left

146
00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:19,600
(no sub)

147
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:25,940
What is Core Shio?

148
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,070
Are you stupid? This store used to be called Shioe Department.

149
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,640
What is Core Shioe!?

150
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,080
(A stranger came to ask them autographs.)

151
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Excuse me, but we're filming a TV program now.

152
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,530
This is Amagasaki.

153
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:58,400
He is the Mayor of Amagasaki.

154
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,110
He comes in contact with residents like that.

155
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,410
I got it!
Really? I don't get it yet.

156
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:14,420
This is a path behind Tatsumi's house.
Ahh! I got it too! The back of Tatsumi's house!

157
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,920
I noticed just now.

158
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,930
I have remembrance of that scenery.

159
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,830
We are behind his house now,

160
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,830
and there was Tomozo's house around the corner.
You're right.

161
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,310
Only this path hasn't changed.

162
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,580
Sorry, but I can't express what I'm feeling.

163
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:58,930
There was a Hitachi plant around here,
and there was a square here as well.

164
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:04,200
I invited him to become comedians together here.
Yeah, at this point.

165
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,410
There were benches over there.
I was sitting astride a bicycle and laying my foot on a bench.

166
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:15,610
Hamada's former house was beyond there.

167
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:21,150
I invited him at this point.
The square isn't here anymore.

168
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,160
We used to practice our comedy show here as well.

169
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,160
We called a friend and had him watch our practice.

170
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,670
We might do it there.
"Hello everyone!"

171
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,470
We practiced hard.

172
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,870
He said it's probably good.

173
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,080
He said it's just so-so.

174
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,080
Though he was just a layman, we asked him impression.

175
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,460
I wish it were still here.
A memorable place for us.

176
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,190
This place has changed as well.

177
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,430
Completely changed.

178
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:09,770
That area had better be reconstructed as well.
But I heard they've been disputing about it.

179
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,770
It's look has completely changed.

180
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:19,010
Look, as if this town is really peaceful.
Yeah.

181
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,980
Thought it can't be.
The sky has become smaller.

182
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,420
There used to be more people like the Mayor in the past.

183
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,950
Weren't it?
Yeah.

184
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:38,060
People are looking at us now.
So what?

185
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,070
Their eyesight is 20/4.

186
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,140
What extremely good eyesight!

187
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,480
I'm pretty gone on everything.

188
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,280
Surprisingly, everyone is wearing shoes.

189
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,650
That's what made me surprised.
Me too.

190
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:06,990
They basically used to walk with bare feet.
Let`s go back.
