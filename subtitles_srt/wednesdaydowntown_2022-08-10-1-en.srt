00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,620
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,110
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,560
Savannah's Takahashi!

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,270
Isn't this everyone's favorite Takahashi?
-Everyone loves him

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,500
There's no such thing

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,960
But it's not right to say "no such thing"

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,730
So

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,380
We have previously verified that it is easy to leave an artist alone on location

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,380
Did it several times
-3 times

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,950
Panther's Ogata
-Yes

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,180
Tram?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,460
On the other side of the road crossing was the film crew

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,860
When the tram passed, the people were gone

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,260
Most unpleasant

15
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,120
This time, we bring you a spin on this idea

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,740
The theory i've brought is this:

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:02,710
Waking up in the morning at your travel destination to find everyone else missing is quite sad

18
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,810
I'm going to cry. I'm going to cry.
-It's hard to top

19
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,040
What else do you need to say?

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,050
This time the person is left behind on a private trip

21
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,270
I see

22
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,120
Imagine getting up in the morning and finding yourself alone

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,310
What would you think?

24
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,360
Well, you'd call someone, right?

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,230
You'd call

26
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,430
First you'd call them

27
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,100
What do you think, Cookie?

28
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,430
I'd think, "No, I'll just keep waiting"

29
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,430
Just wait?

30
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,210
Wait until my flesh disappears

31
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,270
Only the skeleton remains

32
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,210
This is my fault, I shouldn't have asked you

33
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,040
Sorry, sorry

34
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:59,830
Waking up in the morning at your travel destination to find everyone else missing is quite sad

35
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,460
So sad

36
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,740
First of all, the first scene is camping

37
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,670
This is a bit scary

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,360
The target is

39
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,290
Incidentally, this time not only the camping partners who came together are missing

40
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,400
All the camping supplies except for the tent that he is sleeping in are also taken away

41
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,240
The setting is to wake up in the morning and find themselves completely alone

42
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,830
Cheers!

43
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,270
It's great!

44
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,530
The long-awaited camping trip of the Ogata Army begins

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,710
Has something interesting happened to you recently?

46
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,240
In fact, 2~3 months ago I went on a trip

47
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,120
Commandante Ishii, KAZMA and I, and Attack Nishimoto

48
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,550
We booked random accommodation

49
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,050
This will do, right?

50
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,020
And went to a hot spring

51
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,790
Unbelievably, Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi was there

52
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,260
The real guy!

53
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,930
That's awesome.
-Is that true?

54
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,500
Don't give me an unexpectedly surprising story!

55
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,930
He was there for his health

56
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,440
That's for sure

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,270
It seems that the lower half of his body is also quite strong

58
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,340
To be honest, I forgot to look at his knob

59
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,240
Show me. That's the most important thing, right, you guy?
Forgot to look at the knob...

60
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,780
I'd love to hear what kind of knob he has
-Right?

61
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,420
A million unexpected Nagabuchi anecdotes got the group all excited

62
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,560
They did not go to sleep until 2:00 am

63
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,060
Good night
-Goodnight

64
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,490
Thank you for your hard work

65
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,880
So, 3 hours later

66
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,300
Oh, who's out there?

67
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,030
In order not to wake him up

68
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,120
Ogata slowly starts to crawl out

69
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,040
Impressive, he's out

70
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,910
Then the two people in the next tent get up quietly

71
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,220
And quickly began to retreat

72
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,760
If you don't put it all away, it's not funny

73
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,710
Then, the other tent is carried away untouched

74
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,910
So lonely

75
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,340
Perfect!

76
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,280
Preparation work completed

77
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,760
Waking up would be scary

78
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,190
The next step is just to wait for him to wake up

79
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,000
Ogata looks like he's been up all night

80
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,190
However, after an hour and a half there is no sign of him waking up

81
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,950
The time came at 6:50

82
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,650
What will be the reaction?

83
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,440
It's almost 7:00

84
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,440
Looks so sleepy

85
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,370
Eyes swollen like copper bells

86
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,130
This is not the face of the setter

87
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,610
The alarm clock will go off

88
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,310
Here is the perfect opportunity

89
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,350
This will definitely wake him up

90
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,380
If not?

91
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,020
We go home

92
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,820
Seriously?

93
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,990
Ah, he's up

94
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,200
He's up, he's up, he's up, he's up

95
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,170
Finally, he wakes up

96
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,780
He first notices the person next to him is gone

97
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,630
Probably dumbfounded

98
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,130
Of course you'd react like this

99
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,060
You'd look beside you

100
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,390
All silent

101
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,800
No one at all

102
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,580
Ahhhh or something like that

103
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,360
Single camping

104
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,320
Why're you looking again?

105
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,480
No, we aren't there

106
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,950
Hey, why is there no one here?

107
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,940
You think they'll be there if you look again?

108
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,250
Really double-checking

109
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,490
We're not there, how can we be there?

110
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,870
The campsite has been searched for all the way back and forth

111
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,220
Of course, there is no sign of anyone

112
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,110
After all, even the tent is gone

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,700
Ogata!

114
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,140
Later, he tries calling Ogata's phone

115
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,480
Definitely won't answer

116
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,820
Why... ah...

117
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,990
What the hell did I do?

118
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,970
Thinks he did something wrong

119
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,920
Did I say something that excessive?

120
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:58,530
He thinks he's been left behind because of a slip of the tongue...

121
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,070
Sorry about that

122
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,200
Then... disillusioned

123
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,070
For some reason he lies on the river bank for more than 30 minutes in anger

124
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,750
This was followed by...

125
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,350
Pushing against a tree stump

126
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,440
And bathing in the river with his clothes on

127
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,530
It seems to be quite enjoyable

128
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,230
Ah-

129
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,010
Head buried in the tent and shouting

130
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,770
All kinds of peculiar behavior

131
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,410
Scary

132
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,080
This solo camping lasted for three hours

133
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,430
At last, he begins putting things in order

134
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,330
And packs the tent away

135
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,320
To leave the campground

136
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,890
For the taxi that he calls

137
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,760
The program team sent a pre-prepared vehicle

138
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,760
One-person camping?

139
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,600
No, originally four people came together

140
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,540
I don't know why the other 3 people are missing in the morning

141
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,040
Eh? Eh?

142
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,470
They seem to have gone back

143
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,810
Not only are the people gone, but the camping tools are also gone

144
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,110
I am really too miserable

145
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,670
30 minutes to the nearest station

146
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,560
Then

147
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:32,760
Ah, Ogata!

148
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,090
What is this all about?

149
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,490
No, no. What is this?

150
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,260
What's wrong with you? What's wrong?

151
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,300
No, not what?

152
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,430
Sorry sorry sorry

153
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,800
Eh? Hey, seriously?

154
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,640
Really, what's this?

155
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,670
No, that...
-Huh?

156
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,670
Because you were still sleeping

157
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,270
No, no, don't leave me behind

158
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,510
Hey, seriously, what are you...?
-No, no, no. You were still sleeping

159
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,540
Still sleeping, what the hell!?

160
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,410
I told you to get up.
-No, no, you're confused

161
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,720
You wouldn't wake up

162
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,920
Seriously, why are you drinking coke?

163
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,550
Are you guys sightseeing?

164
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,790
We've been walking around
-It's true...

165
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,790
As the emotional state prevails

166
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,620
The reveal the truth

167
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,860
Oh, whoa, strange guys are coming...

168
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,910
We explained the project to him

169
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,770
I first thought "we did have a barbecue yesterday, right?"

170
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,970
Thought you were dreaming?
-I did, really

171
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,310
Thought maybe you'd actually come alone.
-Really thought so

172
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,780
So, next

173
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,030
We verify using added dream elements

174
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,700
This time the target is Alco&Peace Sakai's junior

175
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,070
Computer Universe's Hasshi Happy

176
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,260
What the hell kind of name is that?

177
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,120
This time not only will all the fellow members disappear

178
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,300
Don't know a single one of them

179
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,690
Even the hotel staff and residents will disappear

180
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,880
Thus, an occult element is added

181
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,150
What will happen?

182
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,920
Eh?

183
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,050
Whoa

184
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,990
Super cool!

185
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,920
They enjoy the first day at the spa

186
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,090
And have a late 1:00AM bedtime

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,940
Best day ever

188
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,170
5:30

189
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,950
The same as before

190
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,740
Without waking the target

191
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,030
Everyone leaves the room

192
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,820
They must be nervous, right? iIt's over if they wake them up

193
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,340
Indeed

194
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,580
This time the target's cell phone is taken

195
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,650
As is his luggage

196
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,060
Yes, yes, it is better to go straight like this

197
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,040
Then, while the trapped people successfully exit

198
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:24,260
All the residents in the hotel also disappear

199
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,040
Preparation work completed

200
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,780
Oh he's up

201
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,710
He's getting up

202
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,420
He's realized

203
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,050
The phone...is gone

204
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,790
If the phone is there, there's a solution

205
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,130
However, it's not just his cell phone

206
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,780
His companions and luggage are all missing

207
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,070
What'll be the reaction?

208
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Sensing the situation

209
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,380
Eh? Where...

210
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,910
Eh?

211
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,600
You'd have this reaction

212
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,810
A little panic

213
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,410
Computer Universe

214
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,300
Panicking, he leaves the room

215
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,330
The places he visits are

216
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,030
The lobby on the 1st floor

217
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,730
Wow, that's scary

218
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,000
Anyone?

219
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,240
Anyone?

220
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,890
And, of course, there's no one

221
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,560
Completely gone

222
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,220
He's making that kind of sound

223
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,050
Didn't expect this

224
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,680
There's no one there

225
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,930
A super fast runner

226
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,530
Super funny

227
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,660
Anyone?

228
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,630
Wow...what?

229
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,800
Ahhh

230
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,270
Anyone? Anyone?

231
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,540
Not good

232
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,300
Going crazy

233
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,540
Ahhh

234
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,440
Why is there no one there?

235
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,950
Excuse me, is anyone there?

236
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,530
You're not going to cry, are you?

237
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,550
Anyone?

238
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,150
Wow, it's over...

239
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,780
It's over

240
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,050
Not a single person? Anyone?

241
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,960
Anyone?

242
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,720
Ugh...

243
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,460
It's like "Calling for Love in the Center of the World"

244
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,460
Anyone?

245
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,780
Really like a movie

246
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,120
It's a little scary if there is no one at the front desk

247
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,900
Ahhh, no one

248
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,970
No one

249
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,440
Nobody...

250
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,420
"Somebody help me!"

251
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,150
Anyone?

252
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,080
Ah, it's over

253
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,580
Not a single person

254
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,630
What's going on?

255
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,690
Ah, there is no water...

256
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,060
This is just a coincidence

257
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,160
Ahhhhh

258
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,360
I can't do this

259
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,700
I can't do this anymore

260
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,630
Ah, someone help!

261
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,030
Somebody!

262
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,610
That's a little scary

263
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,600
Surely scary

264
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,640
Out again

265
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,940
He's outside

266
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,310
Looking for a car?

267
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,750
Oh wow, that's scary

268
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,190
That's scary

269
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,660
The cars are gone too

270
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,920
Yesterday it was full of cars

271
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,930
It's really like the end of the world...

272
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,670
For a first time prank

273
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,630
He's been gifted with a luxury experience

274
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,180
His belt is gone too

275
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,170
His clothes are open!

276
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,160
Wow someone's there

277
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,500
Finally met someone

278
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,040
Ah someone's there!

279
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,850
Are you from here?

280
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,480
Uh-huh... that way... right over there

281
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,820
What's going on? What happened?

282
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,050
Is this place open?

283
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,990
Hasn't been open for ages

284
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,390
It was popular in the bubble era

285
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,660
The setup is revealed

286
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:21,060
The hotel is long since abandoned

287
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,400
I came to stay here yesterday

288
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,510
Where...here?
-Yes

289
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,500
Good acting!

290
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,780
You can't get in, right? Isn't it locked?

291
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,610
No, you can, we got it

292
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,280
Can you come here for a moment?

293
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,110
It's still open

294
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,410
He's grabbing him!

295
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:41,530
I'm from the area, there hasn't been anyone here for 10 years...

296
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:45,090
I've got goose bumps

297
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,590
What? What?

298
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,060
Wait, so afraid, so afraid, so afraid

299
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,760
Look, there are lights on

300
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,500
It's weird

301
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,440
Come and see, come and see, please

302
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,670
Is there a renovation team coming?

303
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,160
Why are you still so concerned about not wanting to show your body?

304
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,140
No, I'm staying here

305
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,910
Eh?

306
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,410
I also had a drink

307
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,650
Also went to the bath

308
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,350
Eh?

309
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,880
Really, I'm not lying

310
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,550
You see, not a single car

311
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,390
Please don't say it again

312
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:20,310
Already convinced of the setting

313
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,760
He brings an older man, an actor, with him

314
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,630
And returns to his room

315
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,890
However, there is one last step here

316
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,070
Wait ah ah so scared

317
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,370
There are people!

318
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,970
Someone's in there

319
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,710
Wait, wow, I'm scared

320
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,480
Who is it? Whoa!

321
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,090
What's up? What's going on?

322
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,900
Because it is a hotel where time has stopped for decades

323
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,440
The other 3 people who came with him are already old men

324
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,900
A puzzling setting

325
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,400
What the hell is this!?

326
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,940
Can't figure it out anymore

327
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,800
Is it time travel?

328
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,410
So

329
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,440
What's going on? What's wrong with you?

330
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,340
Are you...Ochiai-san?
-I'm Ochiai

331
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,280
You too?

332
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,750
Sakai...

333
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,520
Are you okay?

334
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,150
This...

335
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,180
He has gradually begun to accept the fantastical setting

336
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,490
What a simple person

337
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,590
So, the truth is revealed

338
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,100
Scared the hell out of me!

339
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,770
Ahhh, Sakai, Sakai is really...

340
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:43,840
That what really... really... really...

341
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,550
What happened to you?

342
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,180
Ochiai is balding

343
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,880
No that's not it

344
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,890
That's not the point

345
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,690
What were you doing!?

346
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,020
I thought I had come to another world

347
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,230
Genuinely believed it

348
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:07,830
In summary
Sadness is no longer the point

349
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,240
So that's it

350
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,670
If this setting continues to develop

351
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,560
You could do a real long story with it

352
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,510
A long-form trick

353
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,980
All the way up until the old men compete in the M-1 tournament

354
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,870
Still gonna compete in M-1?

355
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,390
The second half is so strong

356
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,060
The tent one is all but forgotten

357
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,520
Please don't forget that part

358
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,190
Especially the story of meeting Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi with his own eyes by chance

359
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,050
Let's welcome the next presenter

360
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,740
Who is it?

361
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,390
Here we go. It's Super-Sasaguaiko-Machine

362
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,450
Hello everyone

363
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,460
It's been a long time

364
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,690
Long time no see

365
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,330
Has it been 2 years or 3 years?

366
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,860
It's been 3 years since I saw you

367
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,670
What was the last one that you came with?
-What theory?

368
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,870
This is a sequel to that theory

369
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,370
Do you remember what the theory was?

370
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,010
It seems to be related to professional wrestling, right?

371
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,980
Was it!?

372
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,310
What are you doing?

373
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,480
That's definitely it!

374
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,760
I remember that one most clearly

375
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,350
I remember Maeda

376
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,370
Ah, Maeda's speech problem, right?
-Yes, yes

377
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:39,190
By the way, Maeda is doing a talk show with Fujinami Tatsuo today

378
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,200
He's not coming, don't worry

379
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,070
Maeda's not coming here

380
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,790
Yes, I can confirm he wont be coming

381
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,500
I see

382
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,230
The theory I brought this time is

383
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:52,670
The 2nd Teaching Women How to do a Figure-Four Leglock Over the Phone

384
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,640
It was done

385
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,380
Do you remember?
-It's been done

386
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,430
How does it work?

387
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,900
I'll briefly review the highlights from last time to illustrate

388
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,150
Please take a look

389
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,740
The last time was 3 years ago

390
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,540
First, Keiji Muto

391
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,360
Then Genichiro Tenryu

392
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,990
Then Liger

393
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,960
Legendary wrestlers

394
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,720
These three challenged this theory

395
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,980
Tenryu was successful

396
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,140
As was Liger

397
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,750
But Muto failed

398
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,230
A big failure

399
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,400
That's what happened

400
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,560
Sure enough, it's hard to call and teach women the tricks of professional wrestling

401
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:46,880
How about the fact that it is difficult to describe wrestling in words?

402
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,750
If you can use the phone, teach women to use the skills

403
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,510
It actually can be done

404
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,800
And this led to a moving sense of triumph

405
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,960
A huge accomplishment

406
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,860
However, it is a bit realistic to say that

407
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,260
The job wrestling industry we work in

408
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,720
Has many secrets

409
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,580
It's a contact sport after all
-That's for sure

410
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,700
In these 2 years, because of coronavirus

411
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,580
We have had a tough time

412
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,980
So, professional wrestling making phone calls

413
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,770
Phone calls about wrestling

414
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:25,340
A new industry has potentially emerged

415
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,400
Phone work about wrestling?

416
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,630
Do not say it as if it really happened

417
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,500
It sounds a bit like a wrestling job

418
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,170
One more thing

419
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:41,160
Muto Keiji announced his retirement in the spring of 2023 next year

420
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,660
Therefore, Muto-san's sure-fire leg-lock technique

421
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,400
It is unsure whether or not it will be inherited by someone

422
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,170
It is also very important for Muto

423
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,320
So, if we don't teach the technique

424
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,050
Worst case scenario, his retirement may have to be postponed

425
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,060
I'm a little worried about this

426
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,560
No, no, no

427
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,030
So, how did it turn out?

428
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,730
Please take a look at the VTR

429
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:08,940
The 2nd Teaching Women How to do a Figure-Four Leglock Over the Phone

430
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,690
So

431
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,440
Scared me!

432
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,810
Cell phones are handed to the two ELF's members who know nothing

433
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,390
The person on this phone will give you instructions

434
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,220
I hope you will act according to the instructions and achieve success

435
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,420
Oh.
-Huh?

436
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,390
The content of the instructions...of course

437
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,400
The figure four leglock

438
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,990
Hold the other's legs in place like the number 4

439
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,950
A representative skill of pro wrestlers

440
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,570
So, of course, the person who comes to teach this skill is

441
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,570
The master of the leg lock

442
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,610
Without further ado

443
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,990
It's been a long time since I've used this kind of phone

444
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,710
Whoa!

445
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,290
Why did you get scared?

446
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,370
Hello
-Hello?

447
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,740
I am a professional wrestler Muto

448
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,240
Eh, really?

449
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,340
It's ELF's Arakawa, isn't it?
-Yes

450
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,850
So, please do as I say

451
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,820
So we can complete the move

452
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,260
Do you understand?
-Okay

453
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,630
Because there is a time limit and it must be completed within the time limit

454
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,860
If we don't start soon

455
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,830
Ok

456
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,100
Can Haru and Arakawa stand facing each other?

457
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,640
Face to face

458
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,680
Is it okay for Haru to lie on her back on the spot?

459
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,550
Haru, can you lie on your back?

460
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,950
She down?

461
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,860
So fast

462
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,180
Yes, lying down

463
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,320
Well, it's a little difficult from here, Arakawa
-Okay

464
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:12,500
Put your right foot between Haru's legs

465
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,370
The left foot on the outside.
-No instructions for me?

466
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,370
It in there?

467
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,200
In there?
-Yes

468
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,010
In there?

469
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,010
Then

470
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,580
Put Haru's left leg...
-Left leg

471
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,280
Muto can't see that's why this is difficult, right?

472
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,300
Can't understand, yes, yes

473
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,940
What's the best way to say it...

474
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:37,220
Forbidden to use specific instructions

475
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,220
Move Arakawa's legs

476
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,130
Put Haru's left leg...

477
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,160
Cross over

478
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,400
Sit down while passing it through

479
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Haru's left leg must be bent over

480
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,840
Okay, I'm done folding

481
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,070
It's folded, right?

482
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,410
What happened? I was folded

483
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,320
This is instead...

484
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:02,950
Haru's right leg, below the knee of the right leg

485
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,620
From the top of Arakawa's crotch up to her navel

486
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,650
Completely incomprehensible

487
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,520
Is this clear?

488
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,760
A little pain

489
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,460
It will hurt. It will hurt

490
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,690
Wrestling moves are meant to hurt

491
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,330
Is this right?

492
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,700
Asking "Is this right?", I can't see it either

493
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,340
The right foot is inbetween my navel and crotch

494
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,370
Do you have a referee there?
-There's a referee

495
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,110
Is that a completion?

496
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,680
The referee has the final say

497
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,330
NO
-NO？

498
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,820
Fight
-Fight？

499
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,680
It's a "NO"

500
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,750
Then...then let's move it back

501
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,890
The last action you performed
-Yes

502
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:48,630
Haru's right leg straightened

503
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:57,500
Left leg bent up
-Bent

504
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,140
Grab the ankle

505
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:06,440
Put your ankle below the thigh

506
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,350
"On your thighs"... so that's it?

507
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,520
So that's how it is, huh?

508
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,650
And then? And then what?

509
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,750
Pain, pain, what?

510
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,720
And then? Where do I put my legs in?

511
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,160
The right foot in the triangle of the hole

512
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,090
Ah right leg ah OKOK wait a minute

513
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,630
Let me put my foot under your ass. Under your ass

514
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,970
Scary, why're you so suddenly excited!?

515
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,970
Then, Arakawa, sit down

516
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,350
It's not that way, is it?

517
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,080
It's this way, right?
-It hurts like hell

518
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,240
Haru has a leg that is straight, right?

519
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,380
Haru's right leg

520
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,420
Straighten the leg. Straighten the leg

521
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,090
Yank it to the top of your own waist

522
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,760
She'll hurt a bit

523
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,360
Girls are softer though, so it's okay

524
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,030
The right leg is now on the top

525
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,840
I am lying down

526
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,640
The leg that is bent should be on top of the leg that is straight

527
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,210
Toes on top

528
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:15,980
Finally, the left leg should be on the toes

529
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,950
The left leg should be pressed on that

530
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,820
Wait, wait, wait

531
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,720
Haru, come under my knee please

532
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,460
Can you press down?
-You have to press down?

533
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,360
Knee, control with the knee

534
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,190
It will be very painful so be gentle
-It hurts!

535
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,660
Wait, that hurts.
-Is it okay? Referee

536
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,400
Ask the referees
-OK

537
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,170
Yes!

538
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,400
Ah, I'm exhausted...

539
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,780
Can retire now

540
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:48,780
The Muto-ELF combination took 4 minutes 52 seconds to successfully complete the move

541
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,400
Superb competition

542
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,630
The next challengers are...

543
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,050
Good Morning
-Good morning

544
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,790
This program's idol group

545
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,260
Two members of Mameshiba no Taigun

546
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:04,220
The skill to be challenged is...

547
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,530
Difficult!

548
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,610
The anaconda vice

549
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,460
Wrists and neck are clamped in a death grip

550
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,790
The original move of Tenzan Hiyoshi

551
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,960
Therefore, Tenzan will explain the move

552
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,880
Hey, it's coming. Then I'll answer it

553
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,250
Ah... hello

554
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,860
Hello~

555
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,660
Sorry, I'm Tenzan Hiroyoshi

556
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,000
Cute

557
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,230
I am a professional wrestler

558
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,400
It's Aika, right?

559
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,430
Yes, I'm Aika The Spy

560
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,000
Okay, next

561
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,540
I'm going to say this move

562
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,710
Is Miyuki there?
-She's next to me

563
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:54,480
Seems so suspicious!
-Very true

564
00:28:51,710 --> 00:29:00,420
Miyuki, can you lie on your back, Miyuki?

565
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,960
Scary looking but softly spoken

566
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,360
Akin to some new type of telephone fraud, Tenzan explains

567
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:16,400
Aika should be pressing against Miyuki's upper body

568
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,570
Like that?

569
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,940
Ah, I've done it

570
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,840
Although I can't see

571
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,750
Please grab her right wrist

572
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:34,380
Grab the right wrist with the left hand, right?
-Yes, yes, yes

573
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,460
And then, just like this, press on her

574
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,760
Pull hard in the direction of Miyuki's feet

575
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,270
Hand clenched like you're trying to break her neck

576
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:54,140
Does it feel like the neck is going to break?
-Stop! It hurts!

577
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,940
It hurts, Aika, Aika

578
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,480
It hurts!
-How about the referee?

579
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,550
No? Give up?

580
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,180
OK

581
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,750
OK!

582
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,520
Ah, OK Come on, it's good

583
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,550
What are you talking about?

584
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:18,880
Tenzan and Mameshiba no Taigun perfectly complete the move in 3 minutes and 49 seconds

585
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,010
"OK Come on" is good

586
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,490
The final challengers are...

587
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,850
Good morning

588
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,520
Oda Ueda

589
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,890
These two are challenged with the skill of...

590
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,890
While clamping one of the opponent's legs

591
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,340
Lock the face upwards as much as possible

592
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,360
STF - The step-over toehold with face-lock

593
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,310
This looks so hard

594
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:52,720
The person in charge of explaining the technique is the creator, Chono Masahino

595
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,470
I am Chono

596
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,040
Good morning

597
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:02,310
First, please put the opponent down

598
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,310
Please let her lie down

599
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,810
This way

600
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,450
She down?

601
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,380
Okay, already lying down

602
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,650
Then, Ueda is lying down... what're you called again?

603
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,090
So noisy

604
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,390
I'm Oda
-Oda

605
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,830
Oda, please lift up Ueda's legs

606
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,520
But in fact, the original version is not two legs

607
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,680
Instead, only one leg is lifted to turn the person over

608
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,650
That's the beginning of this technique

609
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,780
So

610
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,940
We aren't at the XXX

611
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,480
Wednesday... this isn't what I expected of Wednesday

612
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,250
Please take the left leg as the axis to turn the person over

613
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,080
Is that so?

614
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,150
Ah it hurts, it's gonna break!

615
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,300
Accidentally said two legs

616
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,590
Ow ow ow, stop!

617
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,430
Already doing it wrong?

618
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,400
And

619
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:00,230
Oda is lying face down, right?

620
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,030
Oda is now sitting and has always been

621
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,940
Eh? Sitting?

622
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,270
What's Udea doing now? Lying down, right?

623
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,440
Oda is sitting, Ueda is lying down

624
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,610
Sorry, the name is a little difficult to distinguish

625
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,610
Ah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, what...

626
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,480
You're doing it to Ueda, right?
-Yes

627
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,450
There's no time for that, Chono

628
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:30,190
Oda, please put your legs between her legs

629
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,800
Oda uses her own legs...?

630
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,900
Both legs clamped

631
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,670
No longer has anything to do with Ueda

632
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,100
Then the middle of the leg

633
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,940
The leg of Oda... ah not Oda, that...

634
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,940
What does the leg look like now?

635
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,010
The legs are...

636
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,580
What's Oda's leg doing?

637
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,920
Oda is currently sitting

638
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,220
Ah...
-Yes

639
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,070
Just can't get Ueda's name out

640
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,920
Sitting? Wait... sitting...

641
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,390
Already confused

642
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,530
Wait a minute wait a minute

643
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,860
The caller is panicking

644
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:10,370
Oda is down...facing downward and lying down?

645
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,070
Oda is still sitting, hasn't changed.
-Eh? Sitting?

646
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,910
Eh, is Ueda lying face down?

647
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,510
She's lying face up

648
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,940
Ah that's no good

649
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,470
Already in a state of affairs where the name and situation are confused

650
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,920
Chono, time up

651
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,260
Is this considered a failure?

652
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,390
It's time to judge

653
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,460
Whose fault is this?

654
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,200
Instead of saying who... it's time

655
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,600
GOD DAMN!

656
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,410
Okay, OK, thank you very much

657
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,680
In summary
GOD DAMN!

658
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,980
What's this?

659
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,800
The verification result is "God Damn!" what does it mean?

660
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,450
What a terrible ending

661
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:02,850
"Okay, OK", don't show us the place where his fire is extinguished

662
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,250
Malicious editing

663
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:09,230
However, it's confusing via phone, right?

664
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,990
Yes, you can't see each other at all

665
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:13,760
If such a tradition existed, it would probably be very popular

666
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,430
Store managers calling to send vulgar instructions to women...

667
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,000
It's like remote health care

668
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,470
Matsumoto, it could really be done

669
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,110
Don't fan the flames!

670
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,510
Should we try a crowdfunding campaign?

671
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:38,490
Next is everyone's theories

672
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,880
It's Fujiwara!

673
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,430
They always do this "so that's it~" type line

674
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:50,630
But then they never do it here

675
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,070
We can't do that

676
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,960
We're not being paid enough

677
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,070
I don't want to hear that

678
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,780
Yes, there's no way to cash in

679
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,940
It may be a bit sudden. Do you know the program "Home Alone"?

680
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,810
You know that, don't you?

681
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:07,850
This time we bring a theory related to this

682
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:12,690
There is at least one lone store in every industry

683
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,900
What industry?

684
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,990
In the case of stores, do public restrooms count?

685
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,750
It would be strange to count that

686
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:17,930
Not really

687
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,760
Who pays money for public toilets?

688
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,000
So that's it~

689
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,860
So that's how it is, so that's how it is

690
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,910
Thank you

691
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,080
His old age is super obvious!
-Thank you

692
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,650
White hair has spread upward

693
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,820
More and more... eroded.
-The amount is becoming more

694
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,200
I'll become all white at some point, please look forward to it

695
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:50,590
There is at least one lone store in every industry

696
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,990
First of all

697
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,230
The Lone Restaurant

698
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:01,970
This store is located in Kiwa-cho, Kumano City, Mie Prefecture

699
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,720
At a glance, only this store seems to be located away from the hustle and bustle of the place

700
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,240
As a restaurant there is no more inconvenient location than this

701
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:19,310
So, we took a bus from the nearest station and walked along the mountain road for 1.5 hours

702
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,790
After getting off the bus, you have to walk along the road with almost no street lights for about 10 minutes

703
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,640
Also gotta walk!?

704
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,530
Is this really the right path?

705
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:34,320
At first it was a bit hard to believe that there was really a restaurant here

706
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,150
Unbelievable.
-Is it really a restaurant?

707
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,870
Not at all, right?

708
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,740
So sudden

709
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,340
But there is

710
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,480
This is the Lone Restaurant

711
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,080
The name is Mizuwari

712
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,210
These people must have been drinking and driving, right?

713
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,350
No no

714
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,160
They'll call a chauffeur to pick them up.
-Really?

715
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,370
Hurry in and see...

716
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,220
Looks busy

717
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,500
Just the right amount of business

718
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:11,210
Why did you open a restaurant in the deep mountains?

719
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,940
If it is opened in a place where people live

720
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,450
If the door opens and closes, the karaoke sound will be heard outside

721
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,950
In the city its okay, but countryside people go to bed early

722
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:23,550
I think sooner or later we'd receive complaints

723
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:27,130
Indeed, if it is in a quiet street

724
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:30,400
The sound from this house would be quite attention-grabbing

725
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,660
Next is the lone vintage store

726
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,560
This store is located in Tahito-cho, Iwaki City, Fukushima Prefecture

727
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,810
30 minutes drive from the nearest station in the direction of the mountain road

728
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,420
Through the woods

729
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,690
This is General Store Tabi

730
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,740
American workwear-based vintage store

731
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,660
And a buyer's store dealing in vintage goods

732
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,730
Originally I didn't want to open a store

733
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:15,200
I wanted to have a garage where I can park a bus

734
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,810
Then how did it become a store?

735
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:22,250
Because I have a bunch of vintage clothing myself

736
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:25,520
For the sake of display, I wanted to hang them all up

737
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,620
Acquaintances or friends who come often said they wanted stuff

738
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,790
So it became a store

739
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,390
Next is the Lone Pachinko Shop

740
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:44,010
This store is located in Kanzu Island, Izu Islands, Tokyo

741
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,330
Population is about 1800 people

742
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,320
An island where most of the islanders are engaged in fishing

743
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,880
30 minutes drive from Kanzu Island Airport

744
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,730
In the village's periphery is a solitary presence

745
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,550
What's there

746
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,640
There's one!

747
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,800
The only pachinko parlor on the island, Oasis

748
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,710
Let's take a look

749
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,510
Wow I can't believe it!

750
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,050
Today the customers

751
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,020
Are just one

752
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,940
Why open in such an isolated place?

753
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:24,940
A pachinko store itself should be opened in a more prosperous place

754
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,780
But if you open in the center of the island

755
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:31,550
It'll be easy for people's wives to see them playing there

756
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,520
So it happened like this because of that

757
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:40,020
If you open in a quiet place, customers have less attention on them

758
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,940
This is the reason to exist on an isolated island

759
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,800
Moved here 20 years ago

760
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,300
If the sky is clear, fishermen are out at sea to work

761
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,430
If so, its complete empty

762
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:58,070
The business is barely viable

763
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:01,240
Next is the Lone Inn

764
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:09,400
Located in Toga Village, Nanto City, Toyama Prefecture

765
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,890
Surrounded by mountains and lakes

766
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,920
No other buildings are visible at all

767
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,010
Supreme solitude

768
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:24,780
The only way to get to the hotel is by boat

769
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,680
A 30-minute boat ride in a green landscape

770
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:34,130
After boarding the private dock

771
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:41,010
You reach the Omaki Onsen Inn

772
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,510
Originally there was a village near here

773
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,260
But due to the construction of the dam it was flooded

774
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:55,220
So, only the hot spring hotel has been preserved

775
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:58,330
It's pretty hard to get here, isn't it?

776
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,100
What is the approximate number of guests?

777
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,740
We've been featured in many mystery tv dramas

778
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:09,280
So guests come now and then

779
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,310
An isolated location

780
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:15,690
A perfect setting for a murder

781
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,950
It's easy to kill people

782
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,690
Not easy to be noticed

783
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:24,730
It has become a popular secret place to stay for those inclined

784
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,860
The only thing is, as a place to stay, there are no roads around it

785
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,210
In addition to the place where you live, you can not get out at all

786
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,570
Next is the Lone Hotel

787
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:44,960
Located in Genkai-cho, Higashi Matsuura Sur, Saga Prefecture

788
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,170
This store is also completely unconnected to the local community

789
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:54,180
A place that cannot be reached by land

790
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:01,150
Therefore, the owner has to go to the port to meet the customers who have made reservations

791
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,330
It is physically impossible to have guests just coming to eat

792
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,680
So, a 10-minute sea cruise by shuttle boat

793
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:20,470
Opened in a place surrounded by sea and mountains

794
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,930
The placed is called Gyosanjin

795
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,890
Both owners are fishermen

796
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:34,190
Because he wanted to eat freshly caught fish

797
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:38,510
He opened this restaurant next to his house 14 years ago

798
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,770
It's a lot of trouble to come here

799
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,710
Can guests come?

800
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,410
Saturday and Sunday, there is no way this year

801
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,350
Day and night are fully booked

802
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:55,020
Weekends are already full up until next March

803
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:59,520
All working days before November are also full

804
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,600
Super popular

805
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,950
A super popular restaurant that even the regional Michelin guide has introduced

806
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,200
Do celebrities come to eat privately?

807
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,900
Yes

808
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,700
Like who?

809
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,600
*Carlos Ghosn: Former CEO of Nissan, who was arrested by Japanese police in 2018 on suspicion of huge financial crimes Absconded to Lebanon in late 2019

810
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,600
Carlos Ghosn

811
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:18,540
Last is the Lone Batting Practice Centre

812
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,430
Really?

813
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:26,110
Located in Kumano-cho, Aki-gun, Hiroshima

814
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:30,390
Leaving the city from the nearest station

815
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:33,680
Its a 15 minute drive along the mountain road

816
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:42,490
This facility with a huge parking lot is

817
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,540
Aki Batting Center

818
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:54,180
We asked the hammer-throwing turtle owner from Mario about the business

819
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,510
The turtle that can throw a lot of hammers

820
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:00,050
Do customers come in large numbers?

821
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:04,020
Usually 0, but at most 7~8 people

822
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,390
There are only about 20 people at most on weekends

823
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:13,310
By the way, there was only one customer on this day

824
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,800
Is it sustainable?

825
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,470
The debt is astronomical, so it is difficult to maintain

826
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:24,140
How much is it?

827
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,840
All together about 300 million

828
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,010
Eh...

829
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,750
In addition to this batting practice center

830
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,110
Do you have another job?

831
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,450
No

832
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:37,190
In summary
We found some

833
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:39,990
What else is there to say

834
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:46,000
Hamada was very interested in the lonely restaurant just now

835
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,180
Have an opinion or something?

836
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,270
What're you saying?

837
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,940
Isn't it a restaurant?

838
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,680
So what?

839
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,100
To drink

840
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,610
Well, it's all watered down (Mizuwari)

841
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,410
What?

842
00:44:58,410 --> 00:44:59,780
Super watered down

843
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,840
That's no good

844
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,040
No, its almost water

845
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,750
You can't!

846
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,350
There's water (mizu) in watered down, its fine

847
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:06,550
That's not right!

848
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,680
It's water, its the same

849
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,950
It's not a restaurant!

850
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,420
They have a driver, dont worry

851
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,760
A lone driver

852
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:19,500
"I'm going to have a drink."

853
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,630
"You come and pick me up later"

854
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:22,260
An older woman

855
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,000
Yes, call the woman

856
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,970
She has sons

857
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:26,620
So it's like this

858
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,900
Yes, yes, that's right

859
00:45:28,000 --> 00:46:13,000
