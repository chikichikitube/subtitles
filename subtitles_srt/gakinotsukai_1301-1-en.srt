You're bothering the neighborhood.

13
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,390
I'm not...

14
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,730
The people here...

15
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,670
They're right here.

16
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,330
I'm not shouting...

17
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,860
All the residents here...

18
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,860
I'm not shouting that loud.

19
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,630
They heard you all the way to TV Asahi.

20
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,270
It's impressive.

21
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,700
Matsumoto. This time, without using phones,

22
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,370
Yes.

23
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,700
we have to meet each other.

24
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,040
You know,

25
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,040
I was the one saying this was reckless

26
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:34,810
Can they meet each other without using phones?

27
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:34,810
Test

28
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,070
but the staff really wanted to do it.

29
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,310
And we decided we would go around trying to get back

30
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,880
together in this place, after being separated.

31
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,080
"Isn't everyone except Matsumoto a bunch of idiots?"

32
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,150
No way.

33
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,450
That's what everyone was saying.

34
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,450
They wouldn't say that.

35
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,450
Everyone in the coffee shop were saying that.

36
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,690
Who would say that?

37
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,060
What were you talking about?

38
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:49,160
The people in the table next to us were saying that everyone in Gaki except Matsumoto was an idiot.

39
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,630
That makes me angry.

40
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,630
That's irritating.

41
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,760
Yeah.

42
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,780
It's so irritating.

Rules Explanation

44
00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:07,910
After getting a theme

45
00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:07,910
they must head to the place that comes to mind

46
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:07,910
If they can get together

47
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:07,910
in the same place, the test ends.

48
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,100
Let's explain the rules.

49
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,070
First, the five must head to the place that comes to mind after receiving a theme.

50
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,740
Until everyone is able to reach the same destination, the test will continue.

51
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,910
Will they be able to meet each other?

52
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,920
We should know, we've been together for a while now.

53
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Yeah, it's been a long time.

54

But right now, Yamasaki is from the countryside.

61
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,860
Living in Osaka for the past 3 years

62
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,860
The countryside? Sorry, but isn't that countryside the place where you came from?

63
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,790
Wait, you're not a resident comedian*?

64
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:27,430
*A term that originates from Yoshimoto Kogyo's project called "Anata no machi ni sumimasu" [(They will) live in your town],

65
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:28,470
Comedians living in each of the 47 prefectures, hoping to

66
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:28,470
Resident Comedian

67
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:28,470

Hey, wait a minute.

71
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,200
Osaka's resident comedian...

72
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,530
I always thought that was the case.

73
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:37,240
*where they made a comedian or TV personality actually move and live in one of Japan's 47 prefectures.

74
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,940
A resident comedian?

75
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,840

Ah, guess I was wrong. I see.

79
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,840
So if we don't meet each other it won't end?

80
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,780
Yes, that's how it is.

81
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,310
I'd like if they told us what the first place is.

82
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,210
Yeah, they should tell us.

83
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,220
It makes sense.

84
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,480
Just to kinda get an idea.

85
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,450
Yeah.

86
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,450
Yeah.

87
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,650
They could tell us, nobody will say anything.

88
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,390
I see.

89
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,290
Let's get it right the first time.

90
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,690
What will we get?

91
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,020
Everyone, look over here.

92
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,890
Don't say anything.

93
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,890
1, 2...

94
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:10,480
Speaking of a large parking lot?

95
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:10,480
Theme

96
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,470
You gotta be kidding.

97
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,400
Isn't this too difficult?

98
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,560
This sort of thing...

99
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,570
Right off the bat we got a hard one.

100
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,940
Wait, wait.

101
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,010
Wait a minute.

102
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,940
This one's hard.

103
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,650
Well, it's fine if we all go to that place.

104
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,550
Right?

105
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,620
Wait.

106
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,480
Let's all just go there.

107
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,480
Yeah.

108
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:28,490
Kojimachi Nippon TV

109
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:28,490
Moved to their starting locations

110
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,520
First, in order to prevent them from knowing each other's destinations, they're all placed

111
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,490
in different starting places around Kojimachi's Nippon TV office.

112
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,490
There's at least three places I can think of.

113
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
This is pretty difficult so

114
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,440
if I figure out the correct answer, I'll go there

115
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,840
But everyone else...

116
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,710
After all, their way of thinking is really shallow.

117
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,710
After all, their way of thinking is really shallow.

118
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,180
Taking that into consideration, that one place is pretty large but...

119
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,550
It's very risky.

120
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,750
Well, considering this type of show,

121
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,060
It's possible that we could get it right the first time.

122
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,160
Well, it is.

123
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,060
Is that fine?

124
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,390
But with this theme...

125
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't think it's gonna be a parking lot attached to something else.

126
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,500
I was thinking that Komazawa Park's parking lot was pretty large but

127
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,470
that's Komazawa Park's parking lot, right?

128
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,540
It wouldn't be just a parking lot.

129
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,010
I don't believe that everyone else will think that way.

130
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,980
Will everyone be able to meet each other!?

131
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,980
t

132
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,980

147
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:47,770
Speaking of a large parking lot?

148
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:47,770
Theme

149
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,100
Without using phones, will they be able to meet each other?

150
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,770
First, they all head out towards the large parking lot that they thought of.

151
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:57,680
The time limit is 30 minutes.

152
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:57,680
Transportation by taxi

153
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:57,680
rec

154
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,340
This time, they'll use taxis for transportation.

155
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,810
The time limit is 30 minutes.

156
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,420
What will be their destination?

157
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,350
Let's go to Akasaka.

158
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,260
Thinking of the time limit, Matsumoto heads to nearby Akasaka.

159
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,000
From here it should take about 10 minutes.

160
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,100
Or 15 minutes, right?

161
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,800
The time it takes will be just right.

162
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,770
If I wanted to

163
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,740
go all the way to Ueno, 30 minutes wouldn't be enough.

164
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,680
go all the way to Ueno, 30 minutes wouldn't be enough.

165
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,750
So there's no way that's the place.

166
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,650
Well, the term "large" is subjective.

167
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,060
It you asked me if it was large, I would say it is.

168
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,720
It's large, Komazawa Park's parking lot.

169
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,530
It's large, Komazawa Park's parking lot.

170
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:50,470
I think we've recorded there at least once before, the parking lot's size should still be in everyone's mind.

171
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,870
The size of everyone's range of activity.

172
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,880
That's probably the most important factor, really important.

173
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,210
Endo is using the expressway while traveling.

174
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,450
Where exactly is he heading?

175
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,650
At the same time, Hosei is...

176
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,090
Please take me to Yoyogi Park's parking lot.

177
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,090
That's the only place I could think about.

178
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,360
The first one that came to mind?

179
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,890
Yeah.

180
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Are there other large parking lots...?

181
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,470
Well, I don't know but...

182
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,940
I don't think there are any other..

183
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,600
large parking lots.

184
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:32,440
Matsumoto reaches his destination

185
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,440
It's been 10 minutes since the start.

186
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Matsumoto is the first to reach his destination.

187
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,280
This is it.

188
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,880
Akasaka Parking Center.

189
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,090
You can't tell from outside, but this is actually pretty big.

190
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,020
Hamada has to know this place for sure, he always comes for that.*

191
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:48,490
*It's a love hotel

192
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:54,470
Got permission to record here

193
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,300
We go inside the parking lot to check its size.

194
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,870
Look over here, once we turn this corner...

195
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,040
I think it's gonna be pretty big.

196
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,980
Look at this place, and there's also a floor below.

197
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,410
In the middle of the city, in Akasaka, there's really

198
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,980
no other place but here.

199
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,290
How many cars do you think it can fit?

200
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,820
It's so large.

201
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,090
Let's ask here.

202
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,190
Excuse me.

203
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,200
Can we... ah, hello.

204
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,300
There's another floor below, right?

205
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,330
Yes, there's another below.

206
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,940
How many cars can park when it's full?

207
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,940
About 150.

208
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,410
One hundred... one hundred and fifty cars.

209
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,210
Parking: About 150 cars

210
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,210
redf

211
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,600
It's pretty impressive to have that many in the middle of the city, isn't it? Especially here in Akasaka.

212
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,890
You could even say that this is the largest parking lot in this area.

213
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,580
Well, I don't think it's a large number of cars.

214
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Right? Thank you.

215
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,860
And there you have it.

216
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,760
There you go.

217
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,600
Seriously, it's this place for sure.

218
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,740
I still think the

219
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,740
largest parking lots are those attached to a park.

220
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,140
But I don't believe that way of thinking is right.

221
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:15,280
Contrary to Tanaka's belief, Hosei is heading towards Yoyogi Park's parking lot.

222
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,180
Hey, driver.

223
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,190
Speaking of a large parking lot, which

224
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,190
place do you think about?

225
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,790
It'd say it would be Yoyogi Park, wouldn't it?

226
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,600
This is very reassuring. It's really this place, the large parking lot.

227
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,400
Yes it is.

228
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,030
Right?

229
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:32,960
Great.

230
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,670
Matsumoto just keeps waiting for the others.

231
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,370
If they still aren't here,

232
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,340
I don't think they'll come anytime soon.

233
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,780
They're not coming, are they?

234
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,710
'Cause they're idiots.

235
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,150
If they were...

236
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,620
already there,

237
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,620
"What took you so long?"

238
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,190
They would say something like that.

239
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,990
It would be great if I met them.

240
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,970
Hamada arrives at his destination

241
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,660
10 minutes after Matsumoto's arrival,

242
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,970
Hamada arrives at Komazawa Park's parking lot.

243
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,070
This place is big, right?

244
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,740
Look, if you want a large parking lot...

245
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,040
It would be this place.

246
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,520
Are you serious!? Is nobody going to show up?

247
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
Really?

248
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,050
You know, there was another parking lot that I was thinking about.

249
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,720
It should be coming up. It's by the next traffic light.

250
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,460
Right.

251
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,530
The parking lot to the right.

252
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,830
That one.

253
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,860
Here.

254
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,530
Yes.

255
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,330
This one's pretty big, isn't it?

256
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,200
It's big.

257
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,030
This one.

258
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,940
It's pretty big but...

259
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:51,280
I don't think everyone else would've thought about this one.

260
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,210
I thought at least one of them would come here.

261
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,650
That's why I told you they're all a bunch of idiots.

262
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,880
They're all idiots.

263
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,760
They've gone through here before and I'm sure they know this place.

264
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,330
But they must think that

265
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,330
only five cars fit in there.

266
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,430
'Cause they're idiots.

267
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,060
They're all a bunch of idiots.

268
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:17,740
Tanaka arrives at his destination

269
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,300
Another 5 minutes later,

270
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,900
Tanaka arrives at his destination.

271
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,070
Alright, please.

272
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,360
Please be there.

273
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,950
I know it. It's here.

274
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,280
Are you sure?

275
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,180
Yeah, there's no mistake.

276
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
It's this place.

277
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,360
They're not here...

278
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,500
They're not here.

279
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,430
Why don't you look inside?

280
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,370
Yeah, they might be in here.

281
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,370
Yeah.

282
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:55,540
Got permission to record here

283
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,140
Look!

284
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,180
Look!

285
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,210
Look!

286
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,550
This place is really large!

287
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,750
Look! It's amazing, right?

288
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,590
All that's left is to wait for them to get here.

289
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,220
Yeah.

290
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,200
No way, this is the worst.

291
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,040
Nobody came here.

292
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,540
Where the hell is everyone?

293
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,450
Matsumoto contacts the others to confirm their locations.

294
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,540
Hello?

295
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,010
Hello!

296
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,080
Hello.

297
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,080
Hello.

298
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,680
Good job.

299
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,020
Hey, nobody... nobody came here.

300
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,190
This is Endo, there's nobody here either.

301
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,360
Endo, where are you?

302
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,560
Right now, I'm in Odaiba's...

303
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,560
There it is!

304
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,400
What?

305
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,130
Land floating on the sea doesn't count, Endo!

306
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,800
Let me explain.

307
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,940
No! No! No! No! No! It wasn't there in the first place so...

308
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,870
The parking lot here...

309
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,480
It's obviously going to be huge. I really hate you for going to Odaiba.

310
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,810
You're kidding?

311
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:12,980
Odaiba - Aomi Parking Lot

312
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:12,980
Parking: 598 cars

313
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,880
There's space for 598 cars.

314
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,420
Of course there is! It's land floating in the ocean, you idiot.

315
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,980
That's no good, no good.

316
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,180
Tanaka, where are you, Tanaka?

317
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,920
Well, Tanaka is at... I'm at Daikanyama.

318
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,560
Daikanyama?

319
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,560
Daikanyama?

320
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,930
The one by Hachiman street. The facade looks like a Japanese house.

321
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,230
Ah, the one with the gate.

322
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,100
That's gotta be small, right?

323
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,270
It's not small, it fits 44 cars!

324
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,040
That's small!

325
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:42,180
Daikanyama Parking Lot

326
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:42,180
Parking: 44 cars

327
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,710
44 cars? Are you trying to be funny?

328
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,240
Hey, hey, hey, are you serious?

329
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,180
You have to consider the place, besides, we've recorded here before.

330
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,450
Yama-chan.

331
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:43,950
Yes.

332
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,450
Yama-chan, where are you?

333
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,550
I'm in a pretty memorable place for all of us.

334
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,460
We've recorded here often, Yoyogi Park.

335
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,460
Ah, Yoyogi Park...

336
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,200
A park's parking lot doesn't really count.

337
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,200
How many cars can park at Yoyogi Park?

338
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,900
85 cars.

339
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,910
Parking: 85 cars

340
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,910
Yoyogi Park Parking Lot

341
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,500
85 cars.

342
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,500
85 cars?

343
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,670
85 cars.

344
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,910
Hamada, where are you?

345
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:12,040
We both almost had the same idea, I'm in Komazawa Park's parking lot.

346
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,550
I'm telling you that an "attached parking lot" doesn't count.

347
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,180
Yeah, it has space for 225 cars.

348
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:23,090
Komazawa Park Parking Lot

349
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:23,090
Parking: 225 cars

350
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,380
That's too far away.

351
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,820
No, it's way too far.

352
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,520
I mean, it's really far from Kojimachi.

353
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,920
And you, Matsumoto?

354
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,320
You know...

355
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,330
Yes.

356
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,330
Yes.

357
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,160
You have to think about the distance.

358
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,100
I started a bit away from Kojimachi.

359
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,130
Right.

360
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,130
Yeah.

361
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,130
Yes.

362
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,130
Yes.

363
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,300
It's Akasaka, Akasaka.

364
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,530
Akasaka...

365
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,530
Akasaka?

366
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,400
The one near TBS in Akasaka.

367
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,970
There's a love hotel, right? There's a parking lot right in front of it.

368
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,580
It has space for 150 cars!

369
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,210
Do you understand?

370
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:53,720
Akasaka Parking Center

371
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:53,720
Parking: 150 cars

372
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,120
If there's a parking lot that can fit 150 cars in Akasaka...

373
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,750
That'd be it!

374
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,360
Well, in this first try we all ended up in different places. It was obvious.

375
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,360
Yeah, we're all over the place.

376
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,460
It's a bit sad that there wasn't even one pair.

377
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,260
In the next one...

378
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,200
Yes, yes, yes.

379
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
In the next one, let's do our best to get together.

380
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,200
Yes.

381
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,370
Let's meet each other.

382
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,370
Please.

383
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,700
Tanaka is awful.

384
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,110
He went to a parking lot with 44 spaces.

385
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,110
You can find those anywhere.

386
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,810
What the hell is he thinking?

387
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,410
So, Hosei went to

388
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,350
Yoyogi Park...

389
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,520
He decided to go

390
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,420
with that "attached to something" pattern.

391
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,990
That way of thinking is wrong, in the first place.

392
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:36,390
Seems like Yama-chan and I had the right idea.

393
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:37,800
This is the next one.

394
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,500
Right.

395
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,270
Will this separate us again?

396
00:13:43,770 --> 00:14:17,540
Speaking of a big billboard?

397
00:13:43,770 --> 00:14:17,540
Theme

398
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:52,280
This is just... how am I supposed to figure this out?

399
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,910
A big billboard, huh?

400
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,650
Is there one?

401
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,050
No, this is...

402
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,630
This depends on the person.

403
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,590
Of course.

404
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,690
Well, yeah.

405
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,130
There's only one place

406
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,330
where I think, "Man, that one's big...",

407
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,870
so let's go there.

408
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,430
I see.

409
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,540
I could meet someone there.

410
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,870
The one near Sun Music.

411
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,440
Yes.

412
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,980
The Onishi Lion billboard that's near Sun Music.

413
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,310
I always see it.

414
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,750
Let's go. That's it.

415
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:38,760
Speaking of a big billboard?

416
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:38,760
Theme

417
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:38,760
Next, they must head towards to the big billboard they think of, starting from where they are.

418
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:45,030
Was I really that wrong with the parking lot? I was sure that I would find someone in Odaiba.

419
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,170
I guess everyone has their own way of thinking.

420
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,070
Endo went all the way to Odaiba.

421
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,910
I thought of going to Odaiba too, but then I realized it was too far.

422
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,740
That's why I decided against going to Odaiba.

423
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,650
But yeah,

424
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:03,850
this time

425
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,990
Cocorico are really awful.

426
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,590
Aren't they?

427
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,990
Yeah.

428
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,320
Tanaka, the parking lot you chose was the one with the least spaces by far.

429
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,720
Yeah, the parking spaces.

430
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,100
For a "genuine" parking lot, it was large, wasn't it?

431
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,530
For a "genuine" parking lot, it was large, wasn't it?

432
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,530
I thought it was pretty large.

433
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,640
We were way off with the parking lots.

434
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,110
I wonder,

435
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,910
will we be able to meet?

436
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,920
Endo enters the metropolitan area while traveling on the expressway.

437
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,650
There are a lot of billboards.

438
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,890
There's Yuukorin's.

439
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,590
Yeah, there's that one, it was...

440
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,920
What was it?

441
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,520
Car Seven.

442
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,860
It's Car Seven.

443
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,860
I think it's there.

444
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,460
Over there.

445
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,460
By the corner.

446
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,700
This one, look. Car Seven.

447
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,330
Car Seven's...

448
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,270
I always see Yuukorin's Car Seven. It's big too.

449
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,840
Yes, this one's big.

450
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,340
It's big but it's on the expressway.

451
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,340
It might be difficult for this type of challenge.

452
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,340
It's hard to meet here.

453
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,920
Yeah, you probably can't see it from below.

454
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,820
Matsumoto arrives near his destination

455
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,450
And Matsumoto arrives near the vicinity of his destination.

456
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,820
There it is.

457
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,490
I can see it now. Look at it.

458
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,390
Onishi Lion.

459
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,530
This one's huge.

460
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,630
There's no way you can miss seeing Onishi Lion.

461
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,640
Look, it's amazing, isn't it? It's big.

462
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,010
Every time I pass through here I see Onishi Lion.

463
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,380
It's gotta be this one, right?

464
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,210
Onishi Lion.

465
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,250
I can only think of Onishi Lion when I go through here.

466
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,460
I read the "Don't worry" and then I get worried.

467
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,830
This billboard has been up there for a long time.

468
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,860
Radio Nippon.

469
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:06,100
I knew it was Onishi Lion because he always wears that, but I didn't know what it was about.

470
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,310
Is there anybody here?

471
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,390
There! Who's that? Yamasaki?

472
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,900
Yes, he's here!

473
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,770
There he is.

474
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,200
Alright!

475
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,440
That's Tsukitei, isn't it? Alright!

476
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,840
Of course it was this one, there are a lot of big billboards but

477
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,240
this billboard is really one of a kind.

478
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,080
It would be great if one more person

479
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,780
came here, but for now...

480
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,020
It had to be this one, right?

481
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,860
Of course!

482
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,290
I knew it was gonna be this one.

483
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,890
Ah, I'm so glad!

484
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,160
That's what I was saying,

485
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:07,930
Matsumoto and Hosei

486
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:07,930
join up

487
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,730
It couldn't be a billboard with a new musician's album.

488
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,270
Right, right.

489
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,470
There's a lot like that in Shinjuku and Shibuya but...

490
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,070
Yeah.

491
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,900
This is it.

492
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,640
This has been Onishi Lion forever.

493
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,370
Yeah, it's always been Onishi Lion.

494
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,410
Really.

495
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,940
You see it with its "Don't worry~"

496
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,780
Telling you everything's alright.

497
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,320
It does say "Don't worry~", but

498
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,450
This one for sure.

499
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,420
You can always remember it.

500
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,420
I do remember it.

501
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,890
I think, "Ah, it's Onishi Lion!".

502
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,120
That aside, the dumb thing about the others...

503
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,490
is that they're coming from really far away.

504
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,490
Like from Odaiba.

505
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,730
Yeah, there's an idiot who went to Odaiba.

506
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,730
Of course.

507
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,800
Going to Komazawa was dumb too.

508
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,000
They're not thinking about the next one.

509
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,400
Not thinking at all.

510
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,000
Right?

511
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,910
When I heard about Tanaka's 44 car parking...

512
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,870
You know,

513
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,640
I actually got scared.

514
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
It's scary, right?

515
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,480
I mean, going to a 44 car parking lot thinking it's large.

516
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,480
40 something...

517
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,910
That's what it makes you feel.

518
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,750
I got a bit

519
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,780
scared of him.

520
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,520
Is that it, Tanaka?

521
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:04,120
Tanaka arrives near his destination

522
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,750
Yes, yes, that's it.

523
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,250
That one?

524
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,690
Yes, that one.

525
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,420
That, that, that!

526
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,790
Isn't it hu...

527
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,930
Isn't it huge?

528
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,200
Look!

529
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,330
It's huge.

530
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,400
It was actually this big.

531
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,510
Was it actually this big?

532
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,480
This might even be

533
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,250
bigger than I thought.

534
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,680
Now I'm scared of Cocorico.

535
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:38,720
Is this duo called Cocorico okay? One of them went all the way to Odaiba.

536
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,320
Odaiba was never an option.

537
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,400
If you think about having to go to the next place, Odaiba was out of the question.

538
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,790
Right.

539
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,400
Endo arrives at his destination

540
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,500
This one's big.

541
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,060
This one, right?

542
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,230
Besides, there's two of them.

543
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,100
Really.

544
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,300
There's the one in the front...

545
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Two of them.

546
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,300
See?

547
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,070
And the one on top.

548
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,240
Is there anyone here?

549
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,510
There's no one here. No way.

550
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,580
You gotta be kidding me.

551
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,250
This billboard is really big.

552
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,220
This is a really big billboard.

553
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,190
Surrounded by scaffolding.

554
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,890
This is what a big billboard looks like.

555
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,800
Hanada Masaru... Why aren't they here?

556
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,600
I mean, this is a huge billboard, seriously.

557
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,170
Is this no good?

558
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,940
Hamada arrives at his destination

559
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,580
And finally, Hamada arrives at his destination.

560
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,310
Here you go, see?

561
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:41,550
If you're talking about a big billboard, it has to be APA Hotel's with the picture of their president.

562
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,020
Could you even think of another big billboard?

563
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,230
There's no place more famous than here.

564
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,500
Are you kidding me? Seriously?

565
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,970
Isn't this too strange?

566
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,570
Really, where are they?

567
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,470
I mean, seriously...

568
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,840
Seriously...

569
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,980
Why aren't they here?

570
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,010
Hello.

571
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,520
Hello!

572
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,480
Hello?

573
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,620
Yamasaki and I,

574
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,820
have already met.

575
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,230
We're together now.

576
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,230
You met Yama-chan.

577
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,400
We're together now and we're enjoying each other.

578
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,600
Matsumoto and Hosei, you came across each other?

579
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,200
Really?

580
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,600
It was obvious.

581
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,670
Where are you guys?

582
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,670
Where are you?

583
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,670
Where?

584
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,300
We're in Yotsuya.

585
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,240
Yotsuya!?

586
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,940
On Yotsuya's 4th District.

587
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,510
On the building that was the former Sun Music office.

588
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,540
Ah, that one's big.

589
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,780
There's a billboard with Onishi Lion, right?

590
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:45,350
Yotsuya's 4th District Onishi Lion Billboard

591
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,120
Hamada, where are you?

592
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,320
Ah, I'm in Akasaka.

593
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,890
Akasaka?

594
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,890
Akasaka?

595
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,890
Akasaka.

596
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,460
APA Hotel's billboard with the president.

597
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,830
Akasaka APA Hotel's President Billboard

598
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,780
There's a billboard with the president?

599
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,830
I think that one's a bit unreasonable.

600
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,830
Was there a billboard like that?

601
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,500
Well, I'm in

602
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:09,010
South Aoyama's 3rd District Hanada Masaru Billboard

603
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,040
South Aoyama's 3rd District. In front of Bell Commons.

604
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,020
South Aoyama...

605
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,440
The big billboard with the surrounding scaffolding, showing Hanada.

606
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,040
I can understand going there.

607
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,040
I'm right below it.

608
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,680
And Tanaka?

609
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,980
Tanaka is at Omotesando,

610
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:29,830
Omotesando
Samantha Thavasa Billboard.

611
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,450
right below the Samantha Thavasa billboard.

612
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,750
What the hell are you doing at a Samantha Thavasa billboard?

613
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,990
Wait, isn't that just a regular billboard?

614
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,920
It's freaking huge!

615
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,830
Don't say that, it's really big.

616
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,330
But right now, we're

617
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,700
closer than we were before.

618
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,670
Yeah, you're right.

619
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,930
Yeah.

620
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,930
Yeah.

621
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,070
We're all close to each other, so we'll meet.

622
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,670
Probably.

623
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,770
I want to meet you guys.

624
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,770
I wonder if the rest of us will meet?

625
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,770
It's cold.

626
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,770
Let's meet at the next one, I want to see you.

627
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,840
Let's meet at the next one.

628
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,840
The next one.

629
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,840
Yes, let's do it.

630
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
But the right place was here.

631
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,780
I'm telling you this is the biggest one, the right answer.

632
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,350
So now they're both gonna work together?

633
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:54,920
Yes.

634
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,850
I see.

635
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,420
Let's see what's next.

636
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,760
This is the next one.

637
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,760
Alright, let's go.

638
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,330
1, 2, go.

639
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:27,250
Speaking of a frequent Gaki recording location?

640
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:27,250
Theme

641
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,170
Let's think about this one. Because now we can both think about it.

642
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,810
This one's actually really hard.

643
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,840
Because there are actually a lot, of answers.

644
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,680
I'm a bit intrigued by the "frequent" part.

645
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,250
Even if you say it's a frequent location...

646
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:33,690
Will everyone be able to meet each other!?

647
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:33,690
t

648
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,690
Will everyone be able to meet each other?

649
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,800
Next week, the second part of "Meeting each other without phones"!

650
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,800
"Meeting each other without phones"! Second Part

651
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,800
Next Week

652
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:51,010
Speaking of a frequent Gaki recording location?

653
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,960
We always go all over the place.

654
00:23:38,260 --> 00:24:09,660
This video was brought to you by Tofu Panda Fansubs

655
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,150
From 27 years of history with this show,

656
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:57,180
Which memorable recording location will they choose!?

657
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:57,180
t

658
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,680
which memorable recording location will they choose?

659
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,490
That's gotta be small, right?

660
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,790
It's not small, it fits 44 cars!

661
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,660
That's small!
