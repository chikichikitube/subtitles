100% Rola Produced! Take tons of cards! Kaurta Compeition!

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,800
Matsumoto-san, what does this mean?

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,920
Well before I explain,

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,120
Yamasaki-san pissed me off and is getting fired from this show

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,700
I saw the newspaper!

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,680
Seriously what was that?

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,420
"Matsumoto Fires Yamasaki"

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,680
Yeah for real

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,670
Tokyo Sports actually published the truth for once

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,960
No no no!

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,940
It's not true!

13
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,740
It's not true at all

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,820
One day we'll find out if it's true

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,900
It's lies, lies

16
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,860
Ah the explanation!

17
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,720
Oh yes please

18
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,720
Well as it says on the banner,

19
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,140
Rola handmade some Karuta cards

20
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,310
She did everything herself I heard

21
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,020
Really?

22
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,310
She wrote the words and...

23
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,620
For real?!

24
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,140
She drew the pictures too?

25
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,820
Yes

26
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,820
So we're gonna be competing for real

27
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,820
Oh really?

28
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,180
I'm looking forward to that!

29
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,180
Is it really that exciting?

30
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:59,380
Yes, I don't know what the cards are gonna be like

31
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,380
It's hard to understand her reality

32
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,380
Yeah Rola's reality

33
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,380
Shes an eccentric person

34
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,460
So! Let's begin!

35
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,520
Introducing, Rola!

36
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,100
Rola-chan!

37
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
So cute

38
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,740
Cut that out!

39
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,260
Yeah for real

40
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,960
So you wrote the words and drew the pictures?

41
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,100
Yes!

42
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,020
1 year... Ah! It took 1 week

43
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,040
1 year?!

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,040
1 year?

45
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,960
That's unnecessary

46
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,060
So, whoever comes last,

47
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,780
There's a batsu that Rola though of...

48
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,400
Really?

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,400
Yes!

50
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,760
A batsu-game, so if I had to explain...

51
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,280
(A department store)

52
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,280
Do you know about 109?

53
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,820
Don't make fun of us

54
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,820
Of course

55
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,520
So you'll stand in front of it doing an impression of me

56
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,000
That sounds horrible!

57
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,000
And what's horrible is,

58
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,960
It's not even that funny

59
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,140
An impression of Rola?!

60
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,140
It sounds awful Im telling you

100% Rola produced Karuta Competition

63
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,340
Rola drew the pictures and wrote the words on these cards,

64
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,400
The first to get 10 cards wins

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,740
The one who does worst has to do an impression of Rola in front of 109

66
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,140
So, who will lose?

67
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,380
They seem so close to Tanaka Oi!

68
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,380
Tanaka you cheater!

69
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,380
Oh yeah they are!

70
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,880
There's goddamn nothing near me!

71
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,340
It's the same!

72
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,180
Alright alright

73
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,180
And Endo keeps peeking at them!

74
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,100
ENDO YOU KEEP PEEKING

75
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,740
I'm not!

76
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,740
Yeah don't mess around

77
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,780
You're so passionate about this

78
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,360
Alright then here we go, begin!

79
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,740
Don't look down

80
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,500
Read it!

81
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,020
Yeah Rola

82
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,020
I thought something else would happen

83
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,020
We're obviously waiting for you!

84
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,160
Why didn't you go?

85
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,160
Alright

86
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,660
Alright look up!

87
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,660
Here I go!

88
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,920
(Re) "I mixed up lettuce and cabbage!"

89
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,580
So fast! He was so quick!

90
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,700
So Rola-san? Is it just what it says in the card?

91
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,340
Yes exactly, I always mix them up

92
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,740
Even now?

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,520
Even now!

94
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,520
Ah right of course

95
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,890
You can tell once you eat it right?

96
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,480
I can't

97
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,100
Then what's the difference!

98
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,840
Alright here we go

99
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,840
Next one

100
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,400
(Ka) "I found a handsome person!"

101
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,060
It's not here?

102
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,060
It's not!

103
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,580
It says "Let's go to the jungle" on it

104
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,860
"Let's go to the jungle"?
You like people like this?

105
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,860
Yes, people like this, wild people

106
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,300
This guy is not my type, but this line...

107
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,740
Then draw your type!

108
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,260
You get to draw the pictures

109
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,260
OK!

110
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,120
Here I go

111
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,720
Look up

112
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,200
(Ke) "Does it surprise you I'm a germaphobe?"

113
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,160
He already took it!

114
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,160
Hold on!

115
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,180
Stop this!

116
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,180
Stop stop stops stop

117
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,700
No listen! Listen!

118
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,300
All he did was go "EHH!"
You have to take it too!

119
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,280
Exactly right?

120
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,840
But I touched it first!

121
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,320
Endo you don't get a point, but that doesn't mean you get a point!

122
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,800
Why?!

123
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,220
Endo you can't do that, this

124
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,220
You can't just hit it and go EHHH

125
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,980
She said this is Endo's point!

126
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,980
Yes

127
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:31,980
No no!

128
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,860
Endo you messed up

129
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,860
He messed up right?

130
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,720
Why is this my fault?

131
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,440
You messed up

132
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,680
See even Rola is saying it

133
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,680
You can't do that?

134
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,680
Yeah!

135
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,680
You have to take it

136
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,840
No wayyyy

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,840
Well that aside,

138
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,740
What about just stealing it from the side like that?

139
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,740
But Rola said it's fine, right?

140
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,160
Yes, it's fine!

141
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,160
Thank you!

142
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,020
No way, for real?

143
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,020
Sorry, what does this "I dont wanna touch it" mean?

144
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,540
Yeah I hate germs so I always press the elevator buttons like this

145
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,060
This part gets dirty then

146
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,860
Yeah but I can just wipe it later

147
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,120
Then what's the difference!

148
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,460
It's the same thing

149
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,460
Oh yeah

150
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,760
Here I go

151
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,520
Look up

152
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,020
(To) "The Toilet is too long, my grandmother"

153
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,700
OW!

154
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,620
What about this, he can take this one too?

155
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,620
HAMADA-SAN YOU CANT DO THAT

156
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,620
Yeah I don't wanna play anymore

157
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,480
If he's doing that I'm done

158
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,580
I already took it

159
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,580
Tanaka explain

160
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,020
I think 3 of my fingers are broken

161
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,540
You were quicker than me?

162
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,780
Yes right now

163
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,780
Sorry sorry

164
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,620
Here I go

165
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,620
Ok

166
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,400
(Ni) "Don't smirk like that Tanaka-kun!"

167
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,880
AHASH I got it

168
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,240
I GOT IT AHHH

169
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,440
You're so fast! It's scary!

170
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,120
He should stop smirking?

171
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,120
This is Tanaka-kun

172
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,120
Oh, this is about me?

173
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,140
Yes! I see Tanaka-kun smiling all the time and I really hate it so,

174
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,720
You hate it?

175
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,720
You mean Tanaka right?

176
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,360
Yes

177
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
You dislike Tanaka the most out of all of us?

178
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,840
Yup!

179
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,120
She said it so clearly. "Yup!"

180
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,240
Then there's no point in taking the cards, if she already hates you

181
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,240
Yeah, exactly

182
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,260
Alright, next one

183
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,220
(Sa) I love cherries

184
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,480
Wow!

185
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,500
Just like it says on the card?

186
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,360
Yes I wrote "I love cherries, and Tanaka too?"

187
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,360
I see

188
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,180
It's so obvious you're following up from the last card

189
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,880
That's what I wrote for real

190
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,880
Oh wow!

191
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,480
What do you mean?

192
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,480
Eh why?

193
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,840
I love cherries,  so I wonder if Tanaka likes them too

194
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,840
Ah, you're asking Tanaka-kun?

195
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,040
Yes yes yes yes

196
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,940
I thought you were saying you love him too

197
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,940
Oh no no no no no

198
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,940
I'll ask you again,

199
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,940
Which one of these members do you hate most?

200
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,600
Tanaka-kun

201
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,600
C'mon!

202
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,310
Did you need to ask that?

203
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,340
(He) I found a strange old man

204
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:06,320
The one who comes last must do an impression of Rola in front of 109

205
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,330
Trying to avoid that embarassing fate, the 5 desperately snatch cards

206
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,460
I love visiting sick people, do you guys too?

207
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,800
AHAA BITCH

208
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,960
MORONS

209
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,340
Oh no!

210
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,340
You're too fast!

211
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,900
This is guy is just straight up good!

212
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,900
For real

213
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,800
Seriously look, Hamada has 5 points

214
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,800
And me...

215
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,940
He really does!

216
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,980
Endo you're in trouble

217
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,980
I am I am

218
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,220
Oh right, it's up to 10

219
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,220
Yes

220
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,180
Alright next one

221
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,680
Alright

222
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,000
(Ra) Do you know what rackets are?

223
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
AIYO!

224
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,080
This was cause of the picture

225
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,080
You didn't even read it

226
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,920
And did you notice, this guy goes AIYO! every time

227
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,780
As if it's an official rule

228
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,980
It scares me

229
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,600
Alright here we go

230
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,600
Alright!

231
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,680
Swinging Swinging! Let's all do Bun-Bungee

232
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,180
You're too excited

233
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:05,560
This-

234
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,320
Bun-bungee?

235
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,320
What is this picture?

236
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,260
It's bungee jumping,

237
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,360
And I thought the rope was too long, so it's Bun-bungee...

238
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,880
It's supposed to stretch though

239
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,880
Yeah it's a bungee rope. Bun-bungee sounds like a Chinese dish

240
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,260
You want to go Bungee jumping? You like it?

241
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,500
I love bungee!

242
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,200
Oh really?

243
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,380
Yes!

244
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,620
You're not scared of that kind of thing

245
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,620
I'm not scared!

246
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,080
So you've done it a bunch before?

247
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,440
Nope!

248
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,440
Nope!?

249
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,660
You haven't?!

250
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,760
I haven't

251
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,760
Amazing

252
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Alright next one

253
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:42,400
(ii) "Super dope! Today was so sunny so I hung up a lot of laundry"

254
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,400
AIIII!!!!

255
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,980
You're gonna stab him

256
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,980
Let's watch our hands

257
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,160
But Tanaka that was rude of you wasn't it?

258
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,520
She didn't finish reading it at all!

259
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,700
The phrase is so long

260
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,700
Rola c'mon read it

261
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,700
"Super dope! Today was so sunny so I hung up a lot of laundry"

262
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,440
You didn't listen to her at all

263
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,440
Yeah!

264
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,440
It's so cute too

265
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,440
Yeah!

266
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,000
She went through the trouble of coming up with the phrase

267
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh yes, right

268
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah!

269
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,380
So that one doesn't count

270
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,560
Take away a point

271
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,560
I have to return it?

272
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,380
Yeah she hates you

273
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:24,780
100% Rola Produced Karuta - Hamada is far in the lead, and Endo still has 0!

274
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,400
Endo you're awful

275
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,820
I have nothing at all...

276
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,700
I hate this!

277
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,700
Seriously Endo, what's going on?

278
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,320
What happened? You have NOTHING

279
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,580
I don't know at all

280
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,580
You gotta do better

281
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,440
I mean as a person, you are so dead

282
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,960
I'm not dead! I'm having fun playing and bantering

283
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Alright here I go...

284
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,540
(Ee) Endo-kun &-

285
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,540
Oh!

286
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,580
See he's also too fast

287
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,220
You're too fast!

288
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,300
All she said was "Endo"!

289
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,300
You're too early!

290
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,300
Yeah!

291
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:59,280
Endo-kun & I had a location shoot the other day. Endo-kun didn't talk to me at all. Why?

292
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,240
You have to listen to the whole thing!

293
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,240
Yeah!

294
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,120
Why Endo?

295
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,120
Why? I mean we did talk though

296
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,120
No not "Why Endo" Yama-chan, put it back

297
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,320
Yeah put it back, I had to do it too

298
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,380
Yeah

299
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,380
Exactly!

300
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,380
Right?

301
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,480
It's cause she hates you right? You don't hate me right?

302
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,120
Hmm I think I hate you more

303
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,280
There it is!

304
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,440
Don't worry

305
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,560
Yama-chan you gotta put it back

306
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,560
Yeah, I told you to

307
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,500
This is taking too long

308
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,500
Yeah you cant do that

309
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,500
Here I go

310
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,900
(Ta) Throbbing Hearbeat

311
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,820
AI!

312
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,440
How do you know she's done?

313
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,940
No I listened and I waited!

314
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,780
I waited just now! I waited just now!

315
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,800
I already found it a while ago! But I waited for her to finish!

316
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,800
I hate it when you guys complain, so I waited!

317
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,280
C'mon...

318
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,260
I got this one properly

319
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,260
Really?

320
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,720
This was a short one

321
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,200
Yes it was

322
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,200
Throbbing Heartbeat?

323
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,660
Yeah, I thought "Wow that's a cool word"

324
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,360
This illustration is Yamasaki-san?

325
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,360
Eh? This is Yama-chan?

326
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,640
Eh?! That's me?

327
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,640
Isn't this an alien (?)

328
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,220
There are short phrases too then?

329
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,220
Yes there are

330
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,080
Ok...

331
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,360
What are you doing?!

332
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,360
No way!

333
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,480
You're kidding right?

334
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,480
Sorry it just felt off. Here I go

335
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,820
Hold on hold on

336
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,420
Endo, what happened?

337
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,020
What happened Endo?

338
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,020
Yeah, why aren't you more lively

339
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,980
I AM being lively

340
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,280
Just like always, I'm being lively

341
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,340
Sorry, can I get something cleared up? What timing should we reach for the cards?

342
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,620
How about when she stops talking?

343
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,620
Ah ok, when you stop talking?

344
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,480
Wait until she stops talking

345
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,020
Until you stop talking?

346
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,020
And even if you see it, you can't do this

347
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,380
Look up until she stops talking

348
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,380
Yeah you're right

349
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,380
Oh yeah, its better not to look

350
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:41,700
Here I go

351
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,440
Hold on hold on. Hold on.

352
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,440
What?

353
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,620
Endo what happened?

354
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,040
Endo!

355
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,040
You're doing it way too early

356
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,100
What happened?

357
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh really?

358
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,940
C'mon banter around a bit more

359
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,940
Do it after the "don don" sound

360
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,940
I am bantering around

361
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,860
But the thing is, I have no points and Im freaking out

362
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:11,200
Im feeling really anxious. Let me concentrate please.

363
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,200
Yeah Hamada is way in the lead still

364
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,680
Alright, so when she stops talking

365
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,680
Here I go

366
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,680
This is so hard to do

367
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,420
Ill keep talking till the end

368
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,420
OK

369
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,720
Matsumoto-san, do you love your daughter?

370
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,160
AIYAHAAAIIYAGHAAA

371
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,920
He's going AIYO again

372
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,260
Can we ban him from going AIYO?

373
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,260
Yeah it scares me

374
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,900
This is a picture of Matsumoto-san?

375
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,580
Yes! Do you love her?

376
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,460
Well of course I do

377
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,340
How much do you love her?

378
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,340
Well uhh I love her a lot

379
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,340
What the hell?!

380
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,740
Rola keep going keep asking him

381
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,400
No more!  No more!

382
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,760
Turn to the camera and say something to your daughter

383
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,320
To the camera? Hey...

384
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,700
This is camera number 4!

385
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,200
What was that?!

386
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,200
This is camera number 4?

387
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Here I go!

388
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,920
(U) Pickled plums and rice go great together

389
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,700
Here!

390
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,090
It was right in front of your eyes

391
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,160
So you were looking at then? From the start

392
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,520
C'mon stop doing that, don't do that

393
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,840
No way!!

394
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,620
You were looking the entire time huh?

395
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,620
You can't do that man

396
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,760
What are you people saying?

397
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,760
You know-

398
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,020
I was looking at him,

399
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,980
He was peeking like crazy!

400
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,910
Liar! Liar! Liar!

401
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,460
No way

402
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,720
I didn't peek at all!

403
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,740
What're you gonna do? Keep it or put it back?

404
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,470
I didn't do anything wrong at all, im keeping it

405
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,120
2 point penalty

406
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,460
2 point penalty!

407
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,130
You're at 3 points

408
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,730
This is so strict!

409
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,600
Here I go

410
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,420
(Me) Pollock roe and rice go great together

411
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,260
Downtown is really scary.

412
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,380
Matsumoto-san hand touch penalty!

413
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,380
WHY ME?

414
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,440
THAT DOESNT COUNT AS TOUCHING HIS HAND

415
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,300
I DID IT ON ACCIDENT

416
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,100
Rola is saying it though...

417
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,630
Yeah you touched his hand just now

418
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,630
So what about his points?

419
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,400
Minus one.

420
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,400
Matsumoto-san loses a point.

421
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,240
"Short sleeves please, Im eating out today"

422
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:48,980
Hand touched again

423
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,980
This doesn't count!

424
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,900
You put your hand on top of mine Matsumoto-san!

425
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,900
You touched his hand!

426
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,590
Minus one.

427
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,300
This is not what the touch penalty is for

428
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,260
MINUS ONE!?!

429
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,030
I'm so close!

430
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,980
Let's try to sleep some more - Ah! Im late

431
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,980
Wait a minute...got it!

432
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,470
Because of the penalty I cant play this at all!

433
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,580
Rola Karuta Competition

434
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,540
The 5 are subjected to Airhead Rola's rules

435
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,140
I just cant stop yawing!

436
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,800
Yes!  Here.

437
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,700
I think that's worth......two points!

438
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,220
Without even noticing it Im doing so shit!

439
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,690
You're right!

440
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,320
No not "You're right!"

441
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,800
Here I go!

442
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,700
Wa! You scared me! Why would you do something like this?

443
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,440
That was fast!

444
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,440
Yama-chan is quick!

445
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,840
Hey Rola, isn't this weird? Look how good Yamasaki is doing

446
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,390
He always gets the cards right near him

447
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,680
I think maybe he's peeking

448
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,680
I'm not!

449
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,670
So that's why...minus four.

450
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,660
OY!!!

451
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,880
ROLA NO! HOLD ON! NO! THAT IS NO!

452
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,120
Stop fighting it, there's no point!

453
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,260
I also got unfairly penalised

454
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,000
Four is so many!

455
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,920
That's how bad your penalty was

456
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,160
Yes. Here I go!

457
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,060
(Shi) "Shh! My puppy is sleeping right now, so be quiet Yamasaki-kun"

458
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,520
That was close...

459
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,540
That was kind of weird just now...

460
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,540
Hold on really?!

461
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,180
Why did you say "That was close"?

462
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:56,340
Well cause I almost just only touched it again like last time, so I thought it was gonna get stolen again

463
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,320
Are you sure it's not because we'll find out you were peeking?

464
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,980
Since the same thing happened to Yamasaki-kun...

465
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,980
Minus two.

466
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,980
Ehhhh!?

467
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,980
I'm going back to 1?

468
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,060
I cant play anymore!

469
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,060
Did I really do something that bad?

470
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,980
I cant play anymore!

471
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,980
Yeah for real!

472
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,980
Did I really do something that bad?

473
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,540
Endo you cant do that, seriously

474
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,420
Eh why? That makes no sense

475
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,840
This is fine.

476
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,730
He can't have it right?

477
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,150
He can have it

478
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,860
Whatever Rola-chan says goes

479
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,140
Alright Yamasaki-kun here I go

480
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,040
(No) There's so much seaweed on my teeth! I cant take it off

481
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,100
You didn't

482
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,100
You didn't say AIYO

483
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,040
You didn't say it right?

484
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,780
You told me not to!

485
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,040
That deserves a massive penalty

486
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,040
He told me not to say it

487
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,210
You didn't say it

488
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,010
But, he told me not to go AIYO

489
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,120
Everyone was expecting you to say it

490
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,760
AIYOO!!

491
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,950
That started her!  It was scary!

492
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,800
Ah my goosebumps!

493
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,660
Minus five.

494
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,100
Finally!

495
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,180
You're the same as Tanaka now

496
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,200
This will never end!

497
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,360
How is anyone supposed to get 10 points now?

498
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,780
We've taken so many cards but our scores are so low

499
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,820
It's anyone's loss in this Karuta compeition. Only 5 cards remain!

500
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:50,100
(ki) "So beautiful! I love forests...What about you guys?"

501
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,220
He touched his hand!

502
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,220
He touched his hand!

503
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:02,120
No I wasn't!  Wait wait wait wait!

504
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,510
You get.....minus four.

505
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,120
NO NOT MNIUS 4! NOT MINUS 4!

506
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,520
That move now deserved it

507
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,580
She stopped for a bit!

508
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,160
She wasnt finished at all

509
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,640
Wait, really?!

510
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,080
OK, here we go.

511
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:34,620
(Ri) "I want to eat an apple. Let's go to the grocery store"

512
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Right?

513
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,300
But, you didn't really say anything

514
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,300
I said "Hai!"

515
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,380
Rola no, you're totally mistaken!

516
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,880
The one below 0

517
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,500
Ok, now I've really lost all motivation

518
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,500
This is just-

519
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,100
You could get a +5

520
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,880
(everyone): Yeah there's always that possibility

521
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,670
For real?

522
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,320
"Koko-chan is waiting for me! I gotta go home soon!"

523
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,340
GO!

524
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,220
What was that?!

525
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,450
This guy was looking!

526
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,340
We were all looking up!

527
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,300
I have minus one point!!!

528
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,780
Here I go...

529
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,780
Tanaka-kun minus four.

530
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,480
WHAT THE HELL?!

531
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,800
Sit down!

532
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,800
WHY THE HELL I GOTTA GET -4?!

533
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,930
Alright!

534
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,240
This makes no sense!

535
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,220
What did he do wrong?

536
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,020
I felt bad for him,

537
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,800
That's not a reason!

538
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,920
So I thought Tanaka-kun should be punished instead

539
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,120
Alright next one

540
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,860
(Na) "Anything is OK!"

541
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,080
Hamada-san touched my hand!

542
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,730
He touched his hand!

543
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,540
He didn't say "HAI!" I said it in a loud voice

544
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,540
Minus five!

545
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,800
Yes!  Back to zero!

546
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,800
Wow I'm at the top now

547
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,700
You barely took any!

548
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:35,100
Finally, one card is left. Who will have to do an impression of Rola?

549
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,700
Here we go:

550
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,860
Ring-ring-ring. Ring-ring-ring. The Bell Rings

551
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,500
Ring-ring-ring. OK that's it.

552
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,890
He touched it.

553
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,760
You touched it! You cant do that

554
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,760
He cant right?

555
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Well maybe but this guy is depressing right?

556
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,260
I'm not depressing! I said "HAI!"

557
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,100
I went like- Rola-chan listen- I went like this.

558
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,100
So you touched your hand again

559
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,680
So according to Rola, you get the penalty

560
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,440
My energy was good right?

561
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,530
Yes it was

562
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,520
His energy was good. But he didn't say AIYO again

563
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,020
No I said AYY! just now

564
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,240
This guy didn't say anything

565
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,240
No I said "Hai!" - You heard me right?

566
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,950
And Tanaka is just talking it easy

567
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,950
I didn't hear anything

568
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,500
I have nothing to do with this

569
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,000
Im getting bullied by Rola here!

570
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,030
Ive been penalised so much! WHAT DID I DO NOW? WHAT DID I DO NOW?

571
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,160
Rola will decide!

572
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,070
Tanaka-kun you were super loud just now

573
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,010
Tanaka-kun, he was too loud so...

574
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,920
Since he didn't do anything,

575
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,150
...minus two.

576
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,150
Well, that's the end!

577
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,780
Nice judging!

578
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,900
This is not possible! This is not possible!

579
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,400
You didn't even do anything

580
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,400
I didn't do anything

581
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,600
In fact I took a ton of cards!

582
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,220
And Rola kept penalizing me!

583
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,040
Alright Rola, what's the batsu game for Tanaka?

584
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
The batsu game for Tanaka is...

585
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,740
He will have to go to Shibuya 109...

586
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,960
...and do an impression of me in front of it.  By doing this, for example.

587
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,180
There's no helping it, Rola decided you lost

588
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,230
There's no way I'm accepting this!

589
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,080
Next week, Tanaka does an impression of Rola! Look forward to it!
