The Future Century
Squadron: The Five Rangai!

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:11,000
By the way, we broke up.
- You did? Good for you.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,480
Yes!

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,580
Hey, evening.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,200
Ryoko-chan, do you like low
frequency therapy equipment?

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,700
I mean, do you have stiff shoulders?
- Yes I have sometimes.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,540
It's very good for stiff shoulders.
- You don't have stiff shoulders!

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,100
I'll give you if you want it.
- Thank you

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,080
Ok, I'll bring it next week.
You noisome bitch!

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,000
Heeelp!

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Stop!

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,800
Red Rangai!

13
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,340
Red Rangai Model!

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,060
Red Rangai
who has a face in the belly!

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,220
Deflowered Red Rangai!

16
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,220
Red Rangai Eater!

17
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,700
Our powers combined!

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,820
The Five Rangai!

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,520
Ladies, run!
- Thank you.

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,740
Hey.

21
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,600
Where are you going?

22
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,340
Take your position.

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,420
You are not on this side!

24
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,760
I realized I should rather
be on your side.

25
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,580
No. Go away!

26
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,180
You're not a Rangai! Absolutely not!

27
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,940
Well... - Only you!

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,320
That's why I thought
I should be on your side.

29
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,620
This is not what I meant
by "unite".

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,080
Our team concept this time is to
offer various kind of Red Rangai.

31
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,720
He's the only one who got it right.

32
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,380
Look how much you've improved
since last week!

33
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,380
I even feel a little hot.

34
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,660
I can call 3 of you Red Rangai.
But not you!

35
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,280
Red Rangai Eater!

36
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,880
That's my point.
This is Red Rangai down here.

37
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,900
And you are not!
Go away!

38
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,320
You guys have got it all wrong.
How can you fight?

39
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,600
Do ku ro.

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,820
You don't think
you have a problem, do you?

41
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,180
I think I'm going to get more
fan mail than anyone here.

42
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,160
You! Are you obsessed with
Rangai having sexual aspect?

43
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,960
He's just dirty by nature.

44
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,060
Always bare feet.

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,920
I was definitely feeling his skimpy
costumes these days are intolerable.

46
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,140
I'm doing my best. - Pieman's
rating is dropping down like crazy

47
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:27,960
It's killing me.
Harder I try, lower the rating get.

48
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:36,960
You have to think it through again.
You've got it all wrong about what I said.

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,040
May I?
- Yes.

50
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:48,200
We don't think... that 5 Rangai
is the only form of heroes.

51
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,740
We would like to make
our own form of heroes.

52
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:59,140
I mean, we want to produce ourselves
with our own ideas. - I see.

53
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,380
We want to stand on our own feet.
- We like to give it a try.

54
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,760
Please Dokuro-san, let us do it.

55
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,720
Let me remind you first that
you completely blew it this time.

56
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,260
You don't kick me!

57
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,900
What's that for?

58
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,960
You go back to square one!
Think hard one more time! - I will.

59
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,760
Remember to unite as a team.
Also remember you're heroes.

60
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,100
Hey! I'm speaking to you,
look at me!

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,620
Goodbye.
- Don't disappoint me next time!

62
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,460
Can you get through?

63
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,060
Look at the way you move.
- You go first, you'll take it longer.

64
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,660
You completely blew it!

65
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,100
What?

66
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,080
Have a think!
- I will.

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,420
The Future Century Squadron: The Five Rangai!   To be con't.
