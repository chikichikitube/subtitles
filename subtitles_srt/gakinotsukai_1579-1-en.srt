00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,980
Matsumoto-san,

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,550
Endo Shozo

3
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,550
Hamada Masatoshi

4
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,550
Matsumoto Hitoshi

5
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,550
Tanaka Naoki

6
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,550
Tsukitei Hosei

7
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,000
Yes, yes?

8
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,980
We're back with the highly rated Jiji-Nuki

9
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,550
No no, not so sure about that

10
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,020
*TN: Gaki no Tsukai Production Supervisor

11
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,020
The person that likes this the most is Yanaoka*

12
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,890
He can keep the production costs low for this

13
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,630
Especially since we're put in this jail of a room...

14
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,630
It's only us five in here, too

15
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,100
You can't play this game sober

16
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,770
Gotta drink some tequila

17
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,940
I'd like to do this game while drunk

18
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,180
(Saying something about this game being impossible)

19
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,240
You've got some terrible memories from this Hamada-san

20
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,010
You got owned

21
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,010
*TN: Konbu is a seaweed heavily used in Japanese food

22
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,010
by that giant konbu* once

23
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,720
Konbu Slap

24
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,720
Past Batsu Game

25
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,720
The Konbu Slap punishment was crazy

26
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,590
The BPO* probably saw that and made their decision

27
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,060
TN: the BPO, an ethics watchdog group,
made recommendations against pain for comedy

28
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,820
Probably

29
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,360
Comedy based on pain, right?

30
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,990
That probably it, the BPO decided after that punishment

31
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:56,040
Typesetting: u/this_guys_a_t***
Translation: u/classicalover

32
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,870
Downtown no

33
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,870
Gaki no Tsukai

34
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,870
Ya Arahende

35
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,870
Presenting: Gaki Jiji-Nuki

36
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,880
The cards being used will have various different original subjects on them

37
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,880
Like the game Old Maid, match the cards to deplete your hand

38
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,890
Whoever is left with the one unmatchable card must follow its orders

39
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,790
First let's use the roulette to pick the dealer

40
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:31,840
Dealer decided by roulette

41
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,990
Can I spin?

42
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,030
Every goddamn time you do this

43
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,030
And every time you're first right?

44
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,840
Spin it more!

45
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Something is up with the bearings

46
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,210
Before I announce the first topic,

47
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,540
Draw one card from the pile

48
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,640
and show it to the camera

49
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,650
Old Maid Card Reveal

50
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,650
Here I go!

51
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,490
ytivaC a
toG ohW
rotagillA ehT

52
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,490
Excuse me, the card is upside down

53
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,520
It's upside down.

54
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,490
What's "upsighdown?"

55
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,490
How can you not understand

56
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,890
Come on man

57
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,830
If you think about the word in kanji you'd understand

58
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,830
I processed it in katakana

59
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,000
The Alligator
Who Got
a Cavity

60
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,230
The word is everywhere on cardboard boxes

61
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,230
Please deal the cards

62
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:10,780
6 cards per person (5 for the dealer)

63
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,620
Before you look at your cards...

64
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,200
It pisses me off that you're a know-it-all

65
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,680
Why does it piss you off?

66
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,850
You could do whatever you want with the game

67
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,290
Ah! No way, you think I would cheat? I would never

68
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,190
You do it all the time

69
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,190
All the time!?

70
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,630
Excuse me, I can't play this game with that kind of attitude

71
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,500
It's been like that

72
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,500
for several years already

73
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,840
No it hasn't!

74
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,470
You're going too far into his weird side

75
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,940
Too far

76
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,410
This round's theme is...

77
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:45,710
Create a Nursery Rhyme

78
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,320
This is the second time right?

79
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,710
Yes, we had this theme previously

80
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,680
A fictional nursery rhyme's title is written on each card

81
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:56,790
Create and sing the fictional nursery rhyme

82
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,790
The loser must sing a nursery rhyme from the remaining card

83
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,960
I had the punishment last time,

84
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,220
it's actually really hard

85
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,360
Pretty challenging

86
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,200
I'll do ANYTHING to avoid this one

87
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,570
We're all trying to avoid this

88
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,170
First round: Nursery Rhyme

89
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,170
Here are the cards. Can Matsumoto get his revenge?

90
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,080
"Old Man" starts

91
00:03:18,080 --> 00:04:13,570
Joker

92
00:03:18,080 --> 00:04:13,570
The Alligator
Who Got
a Cavity

93
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,180
Nothing matches

94
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,790
I've got nothing too

95
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,460
I'll just take a card from the top

96
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,830
"The Ant Progresses"

97
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,830
Pair

98
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,830
The Ant
Progresses

99
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,100
My turn to draw right? Okay

100
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,000
I've gotta check carefully for pairs

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,200
'Cause you missed pairs before

102
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,770
Well, I think it's fine not to notice

103
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,140
That's why he got konbu slapped

104
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,580
I'd hate to get slapped by konbu from that...

105
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,250
Damn, I got slapped by konbu because of that?

106
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,080
That was the worst

107
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,250
You probably have konbu minerals left on your body

108
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,360
Ah, this should match

109
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,200
Here's a pair

110
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,570
Pair

111
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,570
Pikarin
of
Mt. Gorogoro

112
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,300
Nice

113
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:40,230
Joker

114
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:40,230
The Alligator
Who Got
a Cavity

115
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,260
After that, the pairs keep coming

116
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,370
A match!

117
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,510
I got "Liar Tanuki"

118
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,510
Liar
Tanuki

119
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,510
Pair

120
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,880
I've got "Whimpering Bear"

121
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,880
Pair

122
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,880
Whimpering Bear

123
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,360
While other cards are being matched...

124
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,650
NOTHING

125
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,090
I'm checking properly

126
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,230
If this keeps going

127
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,230
let's just say Hamada gets the punishment

128
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:47,200
4th Round Cards Left

129
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,200
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

130
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:53,510
5th Round Cards Left

131
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,800
Give me something

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,510
Gimme a damn break

133
00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:02,410

134
00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:02,410
The Alligator

135
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,510
You have NOTHING good!

136
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,440
He's missing the pairs in his deck again isn't he?

137
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,850
No I'm not, I'm not, really I don't have any

138
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:07,920
Only Hamada doesn't have a single match

139
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,890
Cards Remaining

140
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,890
The first one to win is...

141
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:29,870
Joker

142
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:29,870
The Alligator

143
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,600
I'll choose this one.

144
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,920
This is hard.

145
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,960
Card: Kichintosan

146
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,600
I matched!

147
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,830

148
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,830

149
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:25,370

Kichintosan?

154
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,370
Kichintosan?

155
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,370
Kichintosan, what the hell?

156
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,870
Don't wanna do that one

157
00:05:30,140 --> 00:06:02,710

161
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,210
What, for real?

162
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,680
Excuse me, I'm second

163
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,680

Thank you, "Bye-Bye Sacchan"

168
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,390
Nothing we can do about that.

169
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,160
I still haven't got ONE pair!

170
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,960
I guess even that happens too

171
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,260
You won't get a pair for the rest of your life

172
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,820
No way I won't get one

173
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,770
Holy sh*t, finally got one

174
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,740
"Belly Button Sticking Out"

175
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,710

00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,710
After eight rounds, Hamada finally gets a pair

178

Cards Remaining

179
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:09,910
Hosei draws for the win

180

However, Hosei only has two cards left

181
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,040

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,860
It's a battle between Downtown!

191
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,360
So it has become

192
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:31,000
Who will sing the fictional nursery rhyme?

193
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:31,000
Only Downtown remain!

194
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,640
If I don't get a pair here I'm screwed

Cards Remaining

196
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,080
This is bad

197

I hate this

201
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,120

I'm thinking soon that

213
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,260
I'm gonna get the punishment

214
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,570
You shouldn't do that

215
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,700
Just take a breath

216
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,700
I hate this,

217
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,740
I F*CKING HATE THIS

218
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,710
This isn't a game you play sober!

219
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,780
I choose the middle one!

220
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,080
What did he draw?

221
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,410
Maybe I should cover the one I drew...

222
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,620
Ehh--wh-what, it's wrong

223
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,760
It doesn't match!

224
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,890

You'll want to make it this time

229
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,900
Gosh this is exhausting

230
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,900

He drew, here we go

236
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,510
Which is it?

237
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,180

He's just repeating the title

254
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,880
When it got the cavity~

255
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,400
it also got an autograph~

258
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,460
THAT WAS THE WORST!!

259
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,130
The f*ck was that?

260
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,930
THIS SUCKS SO BAD

261
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,570

Getting someone to sightread and sing this,

265
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,540
that's messed up!

266
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,950
Even with 40 years

267
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,950
as a veteran comedian!!

268
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,250

Horse, huh?

281
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Would suck to do a horse imitation

282
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,510
You got one right?

283
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,680

How much is it worth, having the cards face the TV?

310
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,930
Are you all stupid?

311
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,030
Okay you done filming them?

312
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,640
I'll go with this one

313
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,640
No matches, really?

Put the cards in the circle properly, OK?

327
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,510
Maybe he should be disqualified for that?

328
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,980
Stop saying stupid sh*t!

329
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,780
Just because it's sticking out the circle!?

330
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,020
Okay, from now on, don't do that

331
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,950
It gets confusing otherwise

332
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,950
Okay fine

333
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,950

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,010
Right?

581
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,250

"Flash Cotton Scarf"

585
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:16,230
Cards Remaining

586
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:16,230
Matsumoto draws for the win

587
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,460
Now it's Matsumoto's turn

588
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,330
If Matsumoto doesn't match,

589
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,230
Damn I've always been left until the very end today

590
00:19:16,230 --> 00:20:09,650
Joker

591
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,670
Excuse me?

592
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,440
Makes my heart pound

593
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,440
IF you match here...

594
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:22,810
Please!!

595
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,540
Please!! This is important

596
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,110
This is important

597
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,110
Please

598
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,900
You can do it

599
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,620
What will happen?

600
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,800
Jumping on
Foot Rock Mat

601
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,600
Is it there?

602
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,600
Vertical reveal, vertical reveal...

603
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,570

604
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,540
Vertical reveal, vertical reveal...

605
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,840
Vertical reveal......

606
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,710
It's backward so I can't read it

607
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,420
How annoying

608
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,510
Really?

609
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,580
Pair

610
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,580
Wet Towel
Slap

611
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,580
"Wet Towel Slap"

612
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,650
Alright, so that means Shozo you take this card

613
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,650
Matsumoto

614
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,650
has won!

615
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:15,060
Cards Remaining

616
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,060
Endo draws to win, Hosei to Batsu

617
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,120
You don't have a choice

618
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
That's correct

619
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,560
IF this is a pair,

620
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,060
Then you'll win.

621
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,430
Are we doing this already?

622
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:48,360
Joker

623
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,060
On the count of three

624
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,830
WAIT WAIT wait up

625
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,100
What happens if this matches my card?

626
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,470
What do you mean, matches?

627
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,170
Wait what? That's my...

628
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,910
This is Shozo's card

629
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,910
Can I show my card?

630
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,910
Yeah you can

631
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,110
You don't need to show yours

632
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,110
You don't need to show yours, but...

633
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,280
You can show yours, but

634
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:36,880
Nobody

635
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,620
will be watching

636
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,620
It's about if it matches

637
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,250
Wait, so if this matches my card, I win?

638
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,020
To summarize, if my card matches Shozo's you win

639
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,020
If it matches, right?

640
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,360
If it doesn't match you draw from Shozo

641
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,660
Ohhhhhh I get it

642
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:54,060
Cards Remaining

643
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:54,060
Endo draws to win, Hosei to Batsu

644
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,060
So the moment the card matches Shozo's you get punished

645
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,500
Who will get the punishment, Hosei or Endo?

646
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:21,560
Joker

647
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,400

650
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,780
Endo

651
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,780
has won!

652
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,710
So, Hosei Yamasaki,

653
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,880
Hosei, what do you get...

654
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,020
Eh? "Powerful Low Frequency Electric Shock"

655
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:21,560
Powerful
Low Freq
Electric Shock

656
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,560

657
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,300
POWERFUL SHOCK MACHINE

658
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,300
Please stand on the punishment stage over there

659
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,170
Are we ready?

660
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:58,330
Joker

661
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:58,330
Powerful
Low Freq

662
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,170
You got the bear punishment too

663
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,410
Here I would like

664
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,740
to make the announcement

665
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:47,150
This batsu will be

666
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:47,150
an air

667
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:47,150
punishment charade

668
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,150
So lame

669
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,350
It's how you always fake your punishment anyway

670
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,350
No I'm not

671
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,760
I'm not faking my punishments

672
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,220
This will be tough huh

673
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,390
This is a charade and is not real

674
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,390
Damn damn damn damn

675
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,620
There will not be a real shock machine

676
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:09,910
Recreating the batsu through an "air punishment"

677
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,680
Please act as if you were being punished with

678
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,910
the powerful low frequency shock machine

679
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,580
An "air punishment" game for Hosei!

680
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,380
Punishment with a powerful low frequency electric shock!

681
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,250
As the punishment progresses,

682
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,150
the shocks will get stronger

683
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,320
Yeah, as the levels increase

684
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,290
There's 10 levels

685
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,290
Up to 10 levels.

686
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,290
Switch on!

687
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,930
Right now it's level 2

688
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,000
Oh sh*t here it comes

689
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,070
It's only level 2

690
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,100
Okay level 3

691
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,900
Wait...

692
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,070
What the f*ck is this!?

693
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,580
Let's go from level 3 to level 5

694
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,080
Jumping from 3 to 5

695
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,080
Don't increase it so quickly!

696
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,120
He's even moving horizontally

697
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,220
I wonder why

698
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,390
There's no pain at all!

699
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,730
D-d-damn it hurts!

700
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,630
Let's use the "clenching"* switch

701
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,640
*TN: Matsumoto and Hamada misread "massage"

702
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,600
The "clenching"* switch is on

703
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,370
He's clenching

704
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,370
Level 6 and "clenching"

705
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,210
It's not hurting at all

706
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,610
He isn't saying anything either

707
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,040
Ah, eh, wha-, is happening?

708
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,880
It's at 7 now!

709
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,320
It's super powerful now

710
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,420
Wait, sto-, stop it!

711
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,420
It's at 7 now, 7!

712
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,990
Beating, beating and "clenching!"

713
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,630
Sto-, stop!

714
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,360
He isn't raising his voice at all!

715
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,930
*TN: Bonchi Osamu

716
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,930
It's Osamu-san

717
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,870
Come on doesn't it look good? It's Halloween-y

718
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,870
Halloween!?
