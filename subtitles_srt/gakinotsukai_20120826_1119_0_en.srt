48
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,710
Yeah you did...

49
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,700
Do you feel better?  Getting it all out before going on set?

50
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,870
Do you feel better? Getting it all out before going on set?

51
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,000
There were some rumours, that in the toilet...

52
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, in the toilet...

53
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,770
Some explosions were heard...

54
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,130

71
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,320
I want to get to go first for once...

72
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,700
You're the youngest?

73
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,570
Well out of us Gaki guys...

74
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,150
How old are you, youngest one?

75
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,120
The youngest one here is 41 years old...

76
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,340
You're so young!

77
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,370
Here we go, the power of youth!

78
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,590
When was the last time you ate Mizu Youkan?

79
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,150
About year 6? (Aged 11-12) I think...

80
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,880
For real?

81
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,210

82
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,890

00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,270

89
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,690
Mizu Youkan...

90
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,880
I know right?

91
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,160
Mizu Youkan and...

92
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,570
Mizu Youkan huh?

93
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,610
Youkan (sweet bean paste) are two different things after all...

94
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,510
Man that's sweet!

95
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,300
Wow, so it's like this?

96
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,340
Are you serious?

97
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,210
It melts so quickly in your mouth

98
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,790
Are you "taming it"?

99
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,990
How is it? Are you "taming it"?

100
00:01:53,020 --> 00:02:46,180
Correct answer is

101
00:01:53,020 --> 00:02:46,180

Oh no... look at him squinting...

111
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,230
He can't see for shit...

112
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,670
The last time he ate this, I bet he could see clearly then...

113
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,440
The last time he ate this, I bet he could see clearly then...

114
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,020
Created by Meisu Hyakusen

115
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,480
That's the so called "youngest one"?

116
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,530
As it doesn't smell at all...

117
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,170
and nor did the one before... Here I go...

118
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,380
Oh is that so...

119
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,890
No, this is wrong!

120
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,970
Everyone says that...

121
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,860
You going to do that cliched reaction?

122
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,860
The Mizu Youkan

123
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,520
that I ate is NOT Wakamatsuen Yoshimasa

124
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,850

131
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,660
It's NOT the Kappo Shisada Mizu Youkan

Melt in mouth Mizu Youkan... Nakajima Taishoudousan

142
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,010
It's the same...

143
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
His ability to distinguish is starting to..

144
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,100
It's the first time he's...

145
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,150
He's stuck, isn't he?

146
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,420
The ones I have tasted before were a bit harder in the mouth...

147
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,120
This just melted as soon as it went into my mouth

148
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,460
Maybe he's chosen this one too quickly?

149
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,500
Hang on a second, but you know, this one is...

150
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,940
Is it that similar?

151
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,070
Did you find it?

152
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,630
I think I have met it...

153
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,100
But he did say that when he met Chiaki as well

154
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,770
But he did say that when he met Chiaki as well

155
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,180
We did break up after saying that...

156
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,840
He said the same thing about melting in the mouth too...

157
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,710
He said the same thing about melting in the mouth too...

158
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,140
I remember well he said, "I've found her"

159
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,900
I'm going to go for it

160
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,300
Ugh but this one is just...

161
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,470
If I'm completely wrong, it'll suck so hard...

162
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,000
Here we go

163
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,670
I'm going with this one

164
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,360
Okay

165
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,100
Here we go

166
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,040

Pathetic...

171
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,250
Just pathetic.

172
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,740
Not even close

173
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,740
Sucks so bad...

174
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,380
Wow, scary...

175
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,990
He's scary...

176
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,620
He's really scary...

177
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,320
This looks bad...

178
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,130
I ought to tame your sense of taste!

179
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,280
Yeah, let him do that...

180
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,270
Yeah you should

181
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,500
Get tamed!

182
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,740
This was the correct one

183
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,670
Can I just try?

184
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,080
Try it...

185
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,990
and if it melts as easily...

186
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:57,880
What do you think?

187
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,220
I have no idea...

188
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,660
Shifuku Mouth-melting Toro Mizu Youkan

189
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,660
Answer for Hamada

190
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,660
Nakajima Taishoujou

191
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,490
The one chosen for Hamada is the Nakashima Taishoujou...

192
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,280
Shifuku mouth-melting Toro Mizu Youkan

193
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,590
Have I scooped any?

194
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:16,590
Yes you have...

195
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,950
There's not much weight to the azuki (red bean) after all...

196
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,900
He's put it into his mouth

197
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,570
What an annoying mouth...

198
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,660
This isn't that sweet...

199
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,810
It's very slippy...

200
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,580
Have I scooped any?

201
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,580
Yes you have.

202
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,610
He can't even distinguish weight anymore...

203
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,170
You would think it's easy enough to distinguish...

204
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,330
It's so soft!

205
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,510
It doesn't smell at all, does it?

206
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,590
Have I scooped any?

207
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,590
Yes, for crying out loud!!

208
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,590
Tell him, Endo...

209
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,910
Good going, Endo, youngest one.

210
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,800
Idiot

211
00:05:48,890 --> 00:08:18,070
Correct answer is

212
00:05:48,890 --> 00:08:18,070
Nakashima

213
00:05:48,890 --> 00:08:18,070
Shifuku

214
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,010
They all do taste and feel the same in the mouth...

215
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,860
Oh man I don't know...

216
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,430
Oh man I don't know...

217
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,730
Well that's because you haven't tasted any...

218
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,560
If you knew already...

219
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,080
If you already knew, it would be weird...

220
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,300
It would be...

221
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,440
How many times have we done Kiki now?

222
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,670
This is our 31st time...

223
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,280
31 times now...

224
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,990
I can't work with you guys if you're going to be so harsh on me...

225
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,060
Oh man, what should I do..?

226
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,980
Okay, let's go with this one... Kogetsu

227
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:53,120
Currently tasting

228
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:53,120
Gokujou Honmizu

229
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:53,120
Kogetsu

230
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,410
Okay, he took it...

231
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,640
No, this is wrong

232
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,930
It's tough

233
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,640
That was quick...

234
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,200
That was different, huh?

235
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,670
He said it like "This weren't the one"

236
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,780
It wasn't as swe-...

237
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,190
It wasn't this sweet either, the one I tasted...

238
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,140
What did he say?

239
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,050
It didn't have the sweetness...

240
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,050
Like "This weren't the one I had"... (Nagoya dialect)

241
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,380
Are you from Nagoya, sir?

242
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,470
He said, "This weren't the one!"

243
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,280
He's from the mountains of Nagoya...

244
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,280
Oh will you just shut up already!!

245
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:52,290
The one I ate was NOT Kogetsu Gokujou Honmizu!

246
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,830
The one I had wasn't that sweet...

247
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,490
Oh so that one was too sweet?

248
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,150
It was...

249
00:06:59,210 --> 00:06:59,910
Sweet huh?

250
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,900
and it was harder too

251
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,880
sweet huh...

252
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,900
The one before just slipped down my throat...

253
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,030
He did say it was really slippery...

254
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,310
He did say that

255
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,160
This looks like if you put it in your mouth...

256
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,210
That's good information...

257
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,890
It would melt away...

258
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,710
He said it was too hard too...

259
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,850
Currently tasting

260
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,850
Nakajima

261
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,850
Shifuku

262
00:07:13,880 --> 00:08:18,070
Currently tasting

263
00:07:13,880 --> 00:08:18,070
Nakajima

264
00:07:13,880 --> 00:08:18,070
Shifuku

265
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,410
Yeah

266
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,530
He's picked it up...

267
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,460
The taste is similar, but the sweetness is different

268
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,760
The taste is similar, but the sweetness is different

269
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,410
but the one I tried wasn't this sweet

270
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,110
The sweetness... The one over here...

271
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,540
Oh really...

272
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:34,840
Yes

273
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,120
WHAT THE HELL?!

274
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,340
Tanaka... Tanaka, right?

275
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,070
Tanaka... Tanaka, right?

276
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,960
Look, he's talking to you...

277
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,050
Wait, wait wait...

278
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,710
Tanaka, it's you, I've got nothing to do with it...

279
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,730
Me.... Me?!

280
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,390
Was there such a strong taste of azuki in the one I tried?

281
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,880
He sometimes just locks on people...

282
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,380
yup...

283
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,220
And then comes close...

284
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,620
I'm sure it was more slippery...

285
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,900
and then just went down my throat...

286
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,380
Yeah, see... This one is still here...

287
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,780
See...

288
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,330
So... What are we meant to say..?

289
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,490
I have no idea...

290
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,210
It doesn't affect us...

291
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,450
Oh, so it melts..?

292
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,930
It's still in my mouth...

293
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,360
See, and then at the end, this sweetness comes through, it's definitely not this!

294
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,450
The one I ate was NOT Nakajima Taishoudou's Shifuku!

295
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,070
Not even close...

296
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,920
It was this one...

297
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,030
Hamada-san...

298
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,920
No no no no no no!

299
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,920
Come on!

300
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,130
He said it was definitely different.

301
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,470
He said it totally differently...

302
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,990
Oh man...

303
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,620
It wasn't like this at all!

304
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,020
That was so pathetic...

305
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,890
It was this one!

306
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,480
Unfortunately, it was...

307
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:33,710
The second one...

308
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,450
The second one you tried!

309
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,660
I thought you would get it since it was the second one you tried...

310
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,140
It's always like this, the one I try tastes different to the original one...

311
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,160
That was really pathetic...

312
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:40,900
Lame...

313
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,130
He's really angry...

314
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,900
That's good...

315
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,440
Bring the Youkan and come apologize!

316
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,520
Do we need that?

317
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,350
Oh man, this is going to...

318
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,150
Oh my God, are you okay!? Are you okay!?

319
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,120
Oh my God, are you okay!? Are you okay!?

320
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,640
His asshole came off...

321
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,340
His asshole came off for sure...

322
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,100
For real?!

323
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,530
Yes it was...

324
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:05,760
It was this one...

325
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,230
This one melts in your mouth instantly, right?

326
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,730
Yeah it does...

327
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,960
Yes...

328
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,970
It didn't melt before...

329
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,760
Let me eat the one I had first...

330
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,200
No seriously, this one melts quicker...

331
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,570
What the hell..?

332
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,310
They're the same...

333
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,130
What THE hell..?

334
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,460
What THE hell..?

335
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:30,250
Correct answer for Tanaka

336
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:30,250
Mizu Youkan

337
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:30,250
Surugaya

338
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,690
The one chosen for Tanaka is Surugaya's Mizu Youkan

339
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,790
The azuki taste is really strong

340
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,140
The taste of azuki is strong...

341
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,970
You know how everyone has said it melts instantly?

342
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,030
This one doesn't melt instantly...

343
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,650
Oh I see...

344
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,940
You didn't scoop any...

345
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,100
He can't even see and because he didn't scoop any mizu youkan, he just got hit...

346
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,740
He can't even see and because he didn't scoop any mizu youkan, he just got hit...

347
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,540
He can't even see and because he didn't scoop any mizu youkan, he just got hit...

348
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,310
He can't even see and because he didn't scoop any mizu youkan, he just got hit...

349
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,430
Like really hard too...

350
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:52,730
Correct answer is

351
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:52,730
Mizu youkan

352
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:52,730
Surugaya

353
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,530
You all said how it melted instantly...

354
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,730
Yep yep...

355
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,620
It wasn't really like that though...

356
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,750
It was a little tougher and remained in my mouth for a bit longer...

357
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,280
So we chose onethat didn't just melt...

358
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,490
So we chose one that didn't just melt...

359
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,900
That's right, mine was...

360
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,890
a bit tougher and was one

361
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,470
no one has tried yet

362
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,300
I'm going to go for Bunmeido

363
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,690
Go for it...

364
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:17,980
I want to see the difference...

365
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:48,790
Bunmeido Tokyo

366
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:48,790
Currently tasting

367
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:48,790
Mizu youkan

368
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,950
That's what I want to look at first...

369
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,800
It's so slippery...

370
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,150
Well if you use your common sense, they're all slippery.

371
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,360
That's what mizu youkan is...

372
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,040
I can totally tell!

373
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,020
He can "totally tell"...

374
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,140
You ALWAYS say you can tell...

375
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,070
It's different?

376
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,170
I can tell

377
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,190
The way he said, "I can tell"...

378
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,370
My one didn't melt anywhere near this quickly...

379
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,540
Yes!

380
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,700
The one I ate was NOT Bunmeido's Mizu youkan.

384
00:10:53,030 --> 00:12:05,270

The one I tasted

388
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,910
He deduces by the "strong taste" and gets the next one right as well...

389
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,740
2 out of 12 Done

390

392
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,720
The wrong ones will be wrong...

393
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,400

Say the name...

403
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,420
He didn't say the name...

404
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,950
It's in his mouth...

405
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,430
Yes...

406
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,520
You can't choose another one now...

407
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,700
Ahhh yeah, I want it (Hoshi= want it) (Oshii= It's close)

408

Ahhh yeah, I want it (Hoshi= want it) (Oshii= It's close)

409
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,470
You want it?

410
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,340
You mean "it's close" right?

411
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,260
It's close...

412
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,520
What the hell, man?

413
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,760
What do you "want"..?

414
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,580
You're eating it, for crying out loud!!

415
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,450
There wasn't enough sweetness and the azuki taste wasn't...

416
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,310
The one I ate had a stronger taste...

417
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,040
Out of the ones I've tried so far, it was the closest one...

418
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,220
That's not the one you take is it now...

419
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,890
Why are you taking the plate?

420
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,920
It was the closest one so far...

421
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,460
There are still people who did, huh?

422
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,740

He didn't have a clue!

426

You couldn't tell the difference at all!

427
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,380
Pathetic!

428
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,010
It all happened way too quickly!

429
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,000
It was so quick...

430
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,540
Damn, it was that one...

431
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,910
It really hurts by the way...

432
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,450
It does hurt...

433
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,370
It hurts... and it's scary

434
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,320
Poke poke...

435
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,360
That's why gloomy perverts are no good!

436
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,610
That's true

437
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,470
Oh right, he's a gloomy pervert...

438
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,980
He is...

439
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,950
It's really heavy right?

440
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,710
Okay Tanaka-san, take a look at the answer...

441
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,080
It was so quick...

442
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,610
It was this one...

443
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,400
This was the one

444
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,270
You ate the correct one...

445
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,660
I'm sorry...

446
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,420
You ate the correct one, after all...

447
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,410
You know what, I haven't a clue.

448
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,580
You know what, I haven't a clue.

449
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,020
He gave up...

450
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,520
He totally gave up...

451
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,620
Let's choose one.

452
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,880
Right...

453
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:55,900

454
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,890

Imuraya

462
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:13,370
The one chosen for Yamasaki is one that is famous for its azuki flavour and toughness

463
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,940
What's he doing..?

464
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,170
He's eaten it...

465
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,860

466
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,350

468
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:24,880
What are you doing..?

469
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,910
If this was your first appearance, I would back away...

470
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,680
If this was your first appearance, I would back away...

471
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,870
What is wrong with this guy..?

472

You mean when you put it in your mouth?

483
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,930
When I put it in my mouth, I can tell.

484
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,360
Can I just try this one, one of the ones that melt?

No, seriously!

492
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,100
That's what everyone says when they try the first one.

493
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,560
That's true...

494
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,280
It's totally different, I mean...

Jeez... So sad...

498
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,100
If this was your first time, I would back off so far...

499
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,910
You would if it was the first time for sure...

500
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,660

00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,200
You would...

502
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,770
Even if it wasn't our first time, you would back off...

503
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,640
Even if it wasn't our first time, you would back off...

504
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,680
The one I ate wasNOT Nakajima Taishou's mizu youkan.

505
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,110
The one I ate was NOT Nakajima Taishou's mizu youkan.

506
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,450
Now that's out of the way,  we can narrow it down...

507

525
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,110
I went for the one beside it...

526
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,820
So he tried to trick us into thinking he was going for Imuraya...

527
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,130
I guess there was a reason...

528
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,800
But we aren't bothered if he picks Imuraya or not...

529
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,180
It's not like surprising or anything for us...

530
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,760
It's totally different...

531
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,050

The one I ate was NOT Ryouguchi Mizu youkan

534
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,870
It looks like he can clearly distinguish between one another...

535
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,180
I think I will go for Imuraya...

536
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,690
Shall I just go for it...

Currently tasting

557
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,670

558
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:36,670
Canned mizu youkan

559
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:36,670
Currently tasting

560
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:36,670
Imuraya

561
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:03,960
He's touched it...

562
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:04,940
He did...

563
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,690
That's a scary face he's making...

564
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,410
I wonder what's wrong...

565
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,780
What's with that scary face..?

566
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,030
It's totallydifferent

567
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,530
It's totally different

568
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,960
It's wrong!

569
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:35,540
The one I ate was NOT Imuraya's mizu youkan.

570
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,810
Are you kidding me..?

571
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,890
This is just...

572
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,140
impossible...

573
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,370
Seriously guys...

574
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,540
You got to be kidding me...

575
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,650
I thought you would...

576
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,290
The sweetness was totally different though...

577
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,180
I'm telling you, it's different to when you eat it at the front..

578
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,580
Here he comes...

579
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,250
That was not it

580
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,670
Here comes the Buddha...

581
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,660
For now, quit being a comedian!

582
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,470
For now...

583
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,050
It hurts...

584
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,020
It really hurts...

585
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,480
I've seen all four of you get hit, what the hell do I do?

586
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,380
I've seen all four of you get hit, what the hell do I do?

587
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,510
But probability-wise, you should get it!

588
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,250
That's right

589
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,620
You know what, I'm going to be a law breaker here...

590
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,750
You know what, I'm going to be a law breaker here...

591
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,550
Seriously, I am...

592
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,270
A law breaker?

593
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,130
I'm going to down all of it in one go...

594
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,770
I don't really get it but fine...

595
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,690
I'm going to leap over this by daringly ignoring the taste

596
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,390
I'm going to leap over this by daringly ignoring the taste

597
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,730
In the name of my gramps!!

598
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,040
Correct answer for Matsumoto

599
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,040
Mizu youkan

600
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,040
Surugaya

601
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:44,110
The one chosen for Matsumoto was the strong tasting Surugaya's mizu youkan.

602
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,790
So I'm going to just...

603
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,270
What you going to do? What you going to do?

604
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,510
What you going to do? What you going to do?

605
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,930
Of course I'm going to eat it, but...

606
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,610
but I'm not going to actually taste it

607
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,480
but I'm not going to actually taste it

608
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,420
I'm going with a delinquent approach

609
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,340
He went for it!

610
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,860
He ate it all!

611
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,280
Man that was quick!

612
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,060
I went with a delinquent approach

613
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,210
A delinquent approach...

614
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,000
What the hell does he mean by delinquent?

615
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,830
What does delinquent mean?

616
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,000
What does delinquent mean?

617
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,670
We have no idea...

618
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,380
*Nofuuzou is an uncommon term for "rascal"

619
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,380
We have no idea at all...

620
00:18:14,500 --> 00:20:50,530
Correct answer is

621
00:18:14,500 --> 00:20:50,530
Mizu youkan

622
00:18:14,500 --> 00:20:50,530
Surumeya

623
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,960
It was like proper "youkan", I thought I was quite picky with mizu youkans but...

624
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,940
You do eat it the most out of us.

625
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,660
He does indeed.

626
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,500
Out of all of us anyway.

627
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,440
Yeah he probably does...

628
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,950
I think it will be one of the darker ones...

629
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,680
The ones that are closer to youkans, these light ones are definitely wrong.

630
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,020
Right, I'm just going to go for it!!

631
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,500
Of course, please go for it

632
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,100
Please go for it.

633
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,350
By all means

634
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,130
I'm feeling wild!!

635
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,890
I'm feeling wild!!

636
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,630
The me today is  feeling wild

637
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,100
The me today is feeling wild

638
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,340
Oh just shut up

639
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't care about  being nice at all

640
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,600
I don't care about being nice at all

641
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,440
Here I go!

So wild...

647
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,110
So wild...

648
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,520
It's totally different!

649
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,470
So wild...

650
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,600
Amazing!

651
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,780
He's different to us...

652
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,820
It's completely different

653
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,280
You're just shouting, that's it!

654
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,000
Just shut up man!

655
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,690
The one I ate was NOT Imuraya's mizu youkan

656
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,340
See?

657
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,450

670
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,170

671
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,480
He's threatening us

672
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,490
He is...

673
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,580
Why is he threatening us..?

674
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,740
What the hell is this?

675
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,680
You're so bloody loud...

676
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,550
The one I ate was NOT Tokyo youkan

677
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,140

678
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:46,640

681

THIS ONE!!!

689
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,870
You already got it?!

690
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,490
He shouted, "THIS ONE!"

691
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,680
IT'S THIS ONE

692
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:04,710
This one?

693
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,380
You can't taste any more!

You can't taste it anymore...

695
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,640
Have you got it?

696
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,720
Did you actually get it?

697
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,910
It's this one, this one!

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,430

I ate it all...

700
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,400
You did...

701
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,020
Who cares, if that's the one?

702
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,020
It can only be this one...

703
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,260
It can only be this one!

704
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,230

Like actually

709
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,840
I think I might not go for this one

710
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,530
I think I will leave it to when we do it as a team..

711
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,520
We won't be doing that...

You know what, I'm not going to go for this one...

720
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,280
I'm going to be mature here...

721
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,840
and I'm going to back down here.

722
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,350
I'm actually going to back down and not go for this one.

Surugaya

749
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,620
Surugaya-san's...

750
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,150
I'm going for Surugaya's...

751
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,940
It's really close...

752
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,660
But no...

753
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,110
It is really close

754
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,140
But you know, I'm not going to

755
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,070
ever get tricked by your poker faces...

756
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,870
ever get tricked by your poker faces...

757
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,570
I've seen them so many times up until now

758
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,280
I've seen them so many times up until now

759
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,540
Your tricks are just old

760
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,050
Your tricks are just old

761
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,710
Your tricks are old

762
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:01,610
The one I ate was NOT Surugaya's mizu youkan!

763
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,680
It was this one...

764
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,270
I don't want to get casually just hit...

765
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,440
I don't want to get casually just hit...

766
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,540
I don't want to get casually just hit...

767
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:18,800
Here he comes...

768
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:19,460
Here he is...

769
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,440
It really hurts...

770
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,750
It really hurts...

771
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:28,050
Bite your wife's boob really well!

772
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,740
He is really giving it to him...

773
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,450
Bite it well...

774
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,570
That sounded like it his bone...

775
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,810
And also the back of his thigh...

776
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,540
Right on the back of his thigh...

777
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,080
The really painful part...

778
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,150
That would hurt...

779
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,380
That's a really painful area...

780
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,410
The answer was...

781
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,350
Yeah, let's show him the answer

782
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,480
Yes, let's...

783
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,450
The answer was this one...

784
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,100
You also got caught out by this one...

785
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,450
In the past, I was sure they didn't do this, you know

786
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,300
something so cliche, I really didn't want to believe it...

787
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,740
But it's really starting to make me think that it's true...

788
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,180
They change the products in the back...
