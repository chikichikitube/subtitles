Good morning.

17
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,640
Pardon me.

18
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,680
Can... Can you listen for a minute?..

19
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,680

What?

22
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,970
Well... I kind of need to discuss something...

23
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,310
Um...

24
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,850
Lately, I've been struggling financially...

25
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,060
Lately, I've been struggling financially...

26
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,470
Damn, he's really...

27
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,470
He's so direct...

28
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,180
I know it's sad

29
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,470
But seriously, last week, when we finished recording and I jokingly looked in his wallet...

30
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,310
He only had thirty something yen...

31
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,770
For real.

32
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,640
Oh, was it three hundred and something?...

33
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,640
You're kidding!

34
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,310
Yeah it was

35
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,560
No way...

36
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,270
I was surprised.

37
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,270
No, really.

38
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,270
Really?

39
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,890
I just bought a house, you know?

40
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,890
Ah right, yeah.

41
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,310
And the loan re-payments are tough

42
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,180
And I have 2 kids right now

43
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,060
That's right

44
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,100
And to be honest, I want to put them in a private school...

45
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,310
you get me?

46
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,770
That costs a lot..

47
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,560
It does.

48
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,770
You have two girls right?

49
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,770
Yeah...

50
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,180
So why don't you just work really hard?

51
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,140
No, I mean... I am working hard...

52
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,430
But it never changes...

53
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,560
Since I was 28, it's not gone up once!

54
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
My worth!

55
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,560
That can't be!

56
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,560
Honest!

57
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,770
But it's not something to say here, it's something to say at the offices...

58
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,350
Right, yeah.

59
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,310
No, no, that's--

60
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,310
Just tell your wife

61
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,220
Just say it to '******* *******"

62
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,470
OI YOU!!

63
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,310
What was wrong, he should say it to his wife...

64
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,310
To his family, right?..

65
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,430
He shouted 'KORE ME-N' at me... (Note: He meant to say "Kora Omae- OI YOU"

66
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,430
But anyway... Seriously...

67
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,100
I want money...

68
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,220
So I heard that you can get a lot of royalties selling music...

69
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,390
Yeah I've heard that.

70
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,060
I mean yeah, I guess it is true...

71
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,470
Yeah, I heard that you can so...

72
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,060
Wait, are you a rakugouka?.. Why are you taking your jacket off whilst talking...

73
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,720
I was a bit hot

74
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,720
As if he's getting to the good part.

75
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,850
What the hell...

76
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,470
After shouting, I got a bit hot...

77
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,470
Right? So I heard that you can get a lot of royalties when you do stuff...

78
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,220
And you know I have so much talent when it comes to music?

79
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,680
And so...

80
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,850
I actually went and made some music. Seriously.

81
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,850
What? Four songs for us?

82
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,600
Just from your images...

83
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,140
one song each?

84
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,180
And so you guys sing it and burn it onto a CD...

85
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,020
And then.. I would get the royalties from it...

86
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,020
So you composed and wrote the lyrics?..

87
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,020
Right, yeah.

88
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,930
Just for this day, 4 completely original songs

89
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,720
Narrator: Noda Keiichi

90
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,720
were genuinely created from scratch by Yamazaki.

91
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,850
And on top of that, he only had

92
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,720
4 hours to create them, showing his genius.

93
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,600
He was not a comedian whilst working but just a creator

94
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,180
Whilst imagining the singers, he was serious when checking over the melodies and lyrics.

95
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,100
All for the mortgage and the future of his family

96
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,180
Will Yamazaki be able to realise his potential as a music producer

97
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,140
and live his life off royalties like he dreamt?

98
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,350
So singers royaltieswill start at 200,000 yen each

99
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,560
So singers royalties will start at 200,000 yen each

100
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,180
However many we sell, that is set.

101
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,560
That's the contract

102
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,810
I don't know, this is something I've thought from a while back...

103
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,100
But Yamazaki uses Gaki no Tsukai for the privatization of things...

104
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,770
But Yamazaki uses Gaki no Tsukai for the privatization of things...

105
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,390
He really does!

106
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,390
Yeah, he does it a lot

107
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,770
Just for money too...

108
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,850
He really does.

109
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,060
Honestly, he just keeps doing it time after time...

110
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,680
Hamada-san, let's go.

111
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,100
Let's go.

112
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,100
Right now?

113
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,390
M-me!?

114
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,390
Right now.

115
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,770
Wait, right now?

116
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,390
Listen to it, rehearse it and then shoot the real thing

117
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,220
Eh, seriously!?

118
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,220
For real.

119
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,220
Really?

120
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,850
There's no way someone wearing this kind of shirt can pull this off...

121
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,770
Dun-dun!

122
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,270
Seriously!?

123
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,640
Really.

124
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,640
You're kidding!

125
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,100
What the hell...

126
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,720
Damn, this is tough

127
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,930
This is really tough

128
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,770
4 hours later

129
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,220
Thanks for your work!

130
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,560
Alright!

131
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,720
This is a horrible kind of tiredness...

132
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,470
Was it?

133
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,560
It's not like a nice 'tired' feeling...

134
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,180
You might feel like that now...

135
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,640
But you're going to watch what you did now and think "I'm glad I took part in that"...

136
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,100
Really?

137
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,100
You sure?

138
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,270
This is new ground for everyone...

139
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,180
There are loads of things I want to protest about...

140
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,390
Right anyway...

141
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,060
Let's start with Hamada-san's...

142
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,060
Oh me?

143
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,970
Wait, am I actually going to sing?

144

145
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,060

146
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,720
Wait... Why?...

147
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,220
Well.. That's so...

148
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,520
So we make sales...

149
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,770
To sell CD's, you can't muck around...

150
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,770
Please play it then

151
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,140
Why does the song have such a fast tempo?

152
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,060
You could have made it slower...

00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,600
You were literally so bad right from the start...

187
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,390
I'm sorry..

188
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,850
Eh, hold on,

189
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,100
Wait, this is going to take some time...

190
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,850
I mean...

191
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,930
I know I was singing it casually like

192
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,520
♫ Machi no man'naka de ♫

193
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,430
Right.

194
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,890
But sing it like

195
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,890
♫ MACHI no man'naka de ♫

196
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,520

Like a bit faster.

201
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,600
OK, I get it.

202
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,060
And just the last part

203
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,100
OK.

204
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,020
Just at the last part, it's a bit hard because of the lack of characters

205
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,770
Then add some on...

206
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,930
No but, er,

207
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,850

Yes.

00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,600
Oh wait, the dancing...

212
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,060
The dance?

213
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,310
Well you can't be like this...

214
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,180
Oh you mean pose?

215
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,060
Yes

216

Are you sure this is okay?

220
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,720
Isn't it really lame?..

221
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,520
No way...

00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
OK.

236
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,770
"Beach Paddy."

237
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,520
Woah, this is...

238

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,220
Without doubt...

No, no...

298
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,180
It's not?

299
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,180
Totally wrong

300
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,470
I've never of this 'TM'...

301
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,060
Oh really? I was sure it was TM...

302
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,390
It's got to be...

303
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,770
However you look at it, that was TM...

304
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,560
Wait, is it similar?..

305
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,680
TM's Nishikawa-san is very much like that.

306
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,680
Very similar.

307
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,640
Even the outfit.

308
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,140
Even the movements.

309
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,140
No no, that's just...

310
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,140
Actually, Hamada-san was even more

311
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,140
pumped to do it than I thought...

312
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,810
Well he might not be as bad as you but

313
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,060
he is someone who loves royalties...

314
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,060
Oh, so he was thinking about that?

315
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,810
Yeah, he thought about that and got into it...

316
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,020
To try and sell it, huh?

317
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,100
As if that shit will sell...

318
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,470
Of course it will sell!

319
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,810
Really?

320
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,810
Yes!

321
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,060
An by the way, this song is called「BEACH PADDY」。

322
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,100
Right, why?

323
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,020
It's Hamada (in english)

324
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,810
Hamada

325
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,850
Oh really?

326
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,350
That's why

327
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,350
What kind of a title is that?..

328
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,060
But he's like

329
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,810
not said beach paddy once...

330
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,810
It has nothing to do with the song...

331
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,520
I can get if that musician is called it...

332
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,720
But the title of the song shouldn't be that...

333
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,100
No, because Hamada-san sung it...

334
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,270
Did you sing it, Matsumoto-san?

335
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,350
No, I didn't...

336
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,350
You didn't, right?

337
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,850
That's why it's「BEACH PADDY」

338
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,060
Well, I guess I can smack you anytime I want to so it's okay...

339
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,220
Well, I guess I can smack you anytime I want to so it's okay...

340
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,560
Let's go to the next one!

341
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,770
Next is Tanaka...

342
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,770
What was Tanaka's like?

343
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,180
Was the song style different?

344
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,180
Yes, it was

345
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,310
Can we proceed?

346
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,850
Yep.

347
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,310
Right, here is Tanaka's..

348
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,470
This is, uh...

349
00:10:18,810 --> 00:11:11,060
Tanaka's Rehearsal

350
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,350
This is the stage.

351
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,640
This is the stage for my song?

352
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,470
Right, so do it the way

353
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,560
Right.

354
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,560
that you want to.

355
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,270
Okay

356
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,270
Do it like that..

357
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,560
Ok...

358
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,640
he doesn't look at me when he speaks to me at all, huh?

359
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,390
Right, cue music!

360
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,640

00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,640

362
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,430

363
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,930
Through my nose?..

364
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,390

366
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,850

Right by your face...

368
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,930
Like this?..

369
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,560
V sign like this?

370
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,220
Basically as long as it's cute, you can do whatever you want

371
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,220

372

375
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,060
I always think

376
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,060
♫ Itsumo omou no ♫

377
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,970
Hang on, this is Noppo-san!

378
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,390
When I feel you next to me

379
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,390
♫ Anata o soba de kanjita toki ♫

380
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,430
I know, right?

381
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,810
He's gay?..

382
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,140
That's right, this feeling

383
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,140
♫ Sou kono kanji ♫

384
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,930
I thought that would be the best...

385
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,470
This is horrible..

386
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,600
I felt it when I was a child...

387
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,600
♫ Osanai toki no mama yo ♫

388
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,560
I have a lot of things to say about this too...

389
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:50,970
I will come to pick you up on sunny days

390
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:50,970
♫ Hareta hi wa mukae ni kite ♫

391
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,930
He does sing it like...

392
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,220
and wait at the entrance

393
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,220
♫ Mae de matteru wa ♫

394
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,600
It's intentional, I was singing through my nose a bit

395
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,850
Our special sign

396
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,850

♫ Ryoute de buisain ♫

399
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,520
Ah, that's awesome.

400
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,890
I was doing as I was told

401
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,520
And the movements, right?

402
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,520
Yes

403
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,850

♫ Kiita ohanashi ♫

407
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,060

♫ Itsumo wa happii end ♫

409
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,520

♫ Anata wa watashi ni ♫

411
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,100

♫ Ohanashi o tsukuru no ♫

415
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,810
This is just..

416
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,520
This is a song for a woman to sing, surely?

417
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:33,020
For our lovely, that's right, love story...

418
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:33,020
♫ Sutekina sou rabu sutoorii ♫

419

This is some lyrics...

420
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,350
Wow, that was just...

421
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,470
This was really difficult

422
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,640
It was hard to sing it I bet too...

423
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,640
It was.

424
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,640
I was meant to be a 15 year old girl singing

425
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,140
I was meant to be a 15 year old girl singing

426
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,640
Right.

427
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,430
My one, I was meant to be 21...

428
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,520
Right? I was 15...

429
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,180
Oh I see...

430
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,180
A 15 year old girl!

431
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,640
Right now, there are 6 billion people on this planet...

432
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,430
Who benefits from this episode?..

433
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,310
What you mean, some people might listen to the song and it might cheer them up!

434
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,600
What was the title called?

435
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,470
This one is「Riziere Centre」

436
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,220
What does it mean?

437
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,810
It means Tanaka...

438
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,560
In french though...

439
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,970
That's Tanaka in french?

440
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,970
Yes, it is

441
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,310
Is that what it means?

442
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,020
* Shoumurasaki Hiroshisan (Gaki Director)

443
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,020
It's so obvious you made Komu or someone go and search that...

444
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,310
Definitely...

445
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,640
Shall we go with the next one?

446
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,810
OK!

447
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,810
Ok

448
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,310
Right, next up is Endo-kun...

449
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,100
Right, my one was a real problem

450
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,100
This one in itself...

451
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
This was really difficult...

452
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,270
Right, shall we proceed then?

453
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,100
Shall we...

454
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,020
Er...

455
00:13:38,770 --> 00:14:26,270
Endo's Rehearsal

456
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,100
It's all in English isn't it?

457
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,560
But I don't get why...

458
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,180
This isn't about remembering the words...

459
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,180
It's just your soul shouting

460
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,180
Ok

461
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,930
That's too bad

462
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,180
Pardon?

463
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,930
When you say That's too bad, say it like...

464
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,850
"That's too bad!"

465
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,890
"That's too bad!"

466
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,560
"That's too bad!"

467
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,970
Yeah, that's so much better...

468
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,140
Okay...

469
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,100
The interlude is like really long...

470
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,310
Yeah it was..

471
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,310
You're like free to what you want there...

472
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,310
Free?

473
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,560
Sorry producer, can you not like tell me what to do there and stuff?..

474
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,060
So we'll do this like once

475
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,770
Like we have no time

476
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,470
So we're going straight to the real thing...

Lyrics & Composition by Yamasaki Housei
Sung by Endo Shozo

481
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,560
Everything is done by Hosei-san, huh?

482
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,770
What's that about!?

483
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,640
Holy shit...

484
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,100
This is...

485
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,680
Oh damn, this would be tough to do...

486
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,720
Woah, this is...

487
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,850
This is something else...

488
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,350
This is...

489
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,520
I actually think Endo's amazing for doing this..

490
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,720
Yeah, this was really...

491
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,020
You really performed for your seniors...

492
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,850
Your seniors would never do this...

493
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,600
Yeah, Matsumoto and I would never be able to do this

494
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,430
Yeah, we wouldn't...

495
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,020
Yamasaki-san chose like everything with this, including the clothes

496
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,680
This was really tough...

497
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,430
Wow...

498
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,720
Honestly, I applaud you Endo for doing that...

499
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,640
Well to put it simply, that was heavy metal...

500
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,220
No Death Metal, it's Death Metal.

501
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,220
Damn but...

502
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,560
Death metal?..

503
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,810
If you put this into one of those hexagonal graphs...

504
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,890
You know, measuring applause from the crowd and all

505
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,770
It would definitely be close to like a dot in the centre...

506
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,390
Seriously, it wouldn't spread out at all...

507
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,060
Was there a reason for mine being all english?

508
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,310
Well because it's death metal

509
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,310
Oh, so because it's death metal...

510
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,850
You've been like preaching 'death metal, death metal' from before

511
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,390
but what the hell is it?..

512
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,680
It's a song

513
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,640
It's a song from hell

514
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,600
I sang that?..

515
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,390
Then don't make your juniors sing that kind of song...

516
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,810
Right, lastly...

517
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,020
Right.

00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,850
I don't know who Hama-shou is..

676
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,060

Yeah, but like... I forgot who he is

680
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,350
Even though you listened to him so often?..

681
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,640
I don't get it...

682
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,640

You just forgot him?

684
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,890

So that was original.

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,560
All music producers watching this on TV

687
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,020
What is with him being like this?

688
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,600

Yeah, that would be fine

701
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,720
So for example

702
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,470
1 song is fine, right?

703
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,520
Yeah, 1 song is fine

704
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,180
Even just Matsumoto's...

705
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,180
Yeah, that would be fine

706
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:36,100
After watching them, I think only Matsumoto's has a chance...

707
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,890
Ours are like...

708
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,180

the words 'Let it be' came out of my mouth

711
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,640
My mouth is shocked

712
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,600
