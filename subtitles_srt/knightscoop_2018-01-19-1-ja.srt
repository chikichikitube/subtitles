1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,060
Let's get to today's first request.

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:10,940
Yes, our first request comes from the 44 y/o Shintani Kazutaka, a manager of a sports shop, who lives in Osaka.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,620
"Good evening, Detectives."

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,120
"For 10 years, there's been an old man that's constantly on my mind."

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,260
"From my eldest son to my youngest child, it's the old man that has kept passing me by every morning as I drop my child off at the nursery."

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,060
"He sprints down the street every morning, wearing a suit & leather shoes, and carrying a bag."

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,020
"I've never seen him stop or walk at a normal pace."

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:42,920
"If it only happened once in a while, one might think 'Perhaps he's running because he's late?', but every morning for the past 10 years, he's been running fast enough to gasp for air!"

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,880
"Why does he run at full speed every morning?"

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:53,340
"I've meant to ask him before, but he's running so frantically, I can't bring myself to stop him."

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,160
"Now my child will finish kindergarten soon, so I have little time left where I get to see him."

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,120
"Could you please resolve this mystery I've been carrying for 10 years?"

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,720
This request has really got me excited.

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,320
It's been happening every morning ... for 10 years!

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,980
And it's a situation where he can't just approach him.

16
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,620
He doesn't know how it would turn out if he did.

17
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,840
So what is this old man's goal, running continuously for 10 years?

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,900
Well, we had a chat with him, take a look!

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,920
Good morning! - Good morning!

20
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,260
I'm with Tantei Knight Scoop ...

21
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,400
I'm sorry. - Good morning, it's so early!

22
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,480
I'm Ishida. - Good morning!

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,080
Is everyone up already? - The children are still sleeping.

24
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,380
Good morning! Excuse me.

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,760
Good morning. - Have you been up all night?

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,400
It's always this early, honestly. - No way!

27
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,560
Preparing bento! - Ah, please, stop it!

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,680
And what's over here, apples, ah! You're preparing fruits.

29
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,260
How old do you think he is? - Somewhere ... in his late 50s?

30
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,860
And he gets there at 8 ... - Yes, around 8:22.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,680
Everyday? - Yes, everyday.
Seriously? - Yes, I'm serious.

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,060
I recorded him. Should we take a look?

33
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,180
From inside your car? - Yes.

34
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,080
Ah, on such a clear and straight street?

35
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,320
Here you'd easily spot someone running towards you.

36
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,560
He will appear ... is that him? - In just a bit.

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,060
Ah, it's really him.

38
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,340
You just recorded him once? - No, well ... day after day.

39
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,120
2nd day

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,220
There he is! So full of spirit!

41
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,120
It's really true.

42
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,580
He seems a little tired today.

43
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,500
3rd day

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,340
There he is!

45
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,540
It's a different angle, but the same guy.

46
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,580
It was a bit rainy on the 4th day

47
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,700
There he is!

48
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:49,880
5th day

49
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,880
Isn't he like a police detective?

50
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,880
This is like "Bark at the Sun*"!

51
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,880
[*Detective drama running during the 70s and 80s]

52
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,160
Tried to combine it with "Bark at the Sun!"

53
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,360
[Theme song of "Bark at the Sun!"]

54
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,680
Your wife should also see this, this is really good.

55
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:28,900
I see him, too. And our daughter also saw him when she was running late.

56
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,560
That's why in this family ... he often gets brought up.

57
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,760
That's amazing! - It's a mystery.

58
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,580
Everyone in this family has noticed him

59
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,600
So at the dinner table, everyone talks about him? - That's right.

60
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,180
Ah, the kids. Good morning!

61
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,200
You've still got such a sleepy face!

62
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,300
You also saw the running old man, what did you think of him?

63
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,160
I was also running late, so it's like we were colleagues.

64
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,560
Ah, were you running side-by-side? - No, we passed each other.

65
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,380
I see! Do you know why he's running?

66
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,280
I dunno ... - You dunno?

67
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,400
You're still gradually waking up?

68
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,620
Usually, we'd just go there, stop him and go "Excuse me, this is Tantei Knight Scoop ..." ...

69
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,000
Do you reckon we can stop him? - I think if you do that, he'll be late to work.

70
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,920
100%. - Then that's off the table.

71
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:39,620
It might upset him if we just started recording him, so we're going to tail him first and figure out the best timing

72
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:39,620
So we'll only interview the running man ... once he's calmed down .

73
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,480
Then it's time to go to school

74
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,480
Have a nice day! - We're going, see you later!

75
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,620
Get to the scene

76
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,940
On this street? - That's right. - He'll come this way.

77
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,800
The street where he always encounters the runner

78
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,880
Is it here? - Yes, he uses this way.

79
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,880
And in the direction he's running in ... - There's the station.

80
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,360
Ah and over here we saw him in the video.

81
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,860
So over here, we'll make it look like I was interviewing you ...

82
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,740
That's how we'll do it, as we wait for him.

83
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,920
First act like they're doing a street interview, then start tailing him.

84
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,940
What do you think? Will we get him on tape?

85
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,980
Uwaaah... - He'll get here any moment now.

86
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,420
He's there! - No way! Where?

87
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,480
He's there! He's there! There he's running! He's made his appearance!

88
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,060
I'm getting nervous ...

89
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,860
Please come this way ...

90
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,940
"Ah, so that's how it is!" - "Yes."

91
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,500
"So, you really like Knight Scoop, then?"

92
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,680
"That's right." - "Thank you very much, that makes us very happy."

93
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,260
"Do you live in this area?" - "Yes." - "Ah, they have nice houses around here."

94
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,160
He's run past us.

95
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,420
And he's off in an instant.

96
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,760
I'll get going.

97
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,300
Detective in pursuit

98
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,960
Awaiting contact from the Detective

99
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,440
I got a Line message. - What does it say?

100
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:40,660
He got on a train to Umeda.

101
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:40,660
Got to the platform all via stairs-

102
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,500
So then his company is in the Umeda direction, right?

103
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,000
Ah, got another one.

104
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:40,660
Train took off. He's standing at the
door, panting. Window fogging up.

105
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,660
He got off

106
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,700
Got off at the first station?!

107
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,960
Got another one.

108
00:07:45,300 --> 00:08:01,060
Got to the platform all via stairs-

109
00:07:45,300 --> 00:08:01,060
He got off

110
00:07:45,300 --> 00:08:01,060
He got on a train to Umeda.

111
00:07:45,300 --> 00:08:01,060
Train took off. He's standing at the
door, panting. Window fogging up.

112
00:07:45,300 --> 00:08:01,060
Where did he get off? ---

113
00:07:46,160 --> 00:08:01,060
Got off at Okamachi,
reboarded the same train,--
but 2 cars towards the front.

114
00:07:52,380 --> 00:08:01,060
Now, panting, he's reading out
the Nikkei newspaper. ---------------

115
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,420
So he didn't change trains at all? - He didn't.

116
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,460
Mysterious behavior

117
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,460
Ah, got another one.

118
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,600
He's calmed down now
Soon we'll get to Juso

119
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,600
In what area are you now?

120
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,600
Now, panting, he's reading out
the Nikkei newspaper. ---------------

121
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,700
What does it say?

122
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,600
He got off at Nakatsu!

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,960
Seems he's going to Nakatsu.

124
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:22,120
He got off at Nakatsu!

125
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:22,120
He's calmed down now
Soon we'll get to Juso

126
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:22,120
In what area are you now?

127
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:22,120
Now, panting, he's reading out
the Nikkei newspaper. ---------------

128
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,020
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:22,120
He got off at Nakatsu, ran, and re-
boarded the train 1 car to the front.

130
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,060
Gets back on the same train, further towards the front?

131
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,060
Were we exposed? It's as if he was running from someone.

132
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,060
Without switching trains

133
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,300
Did he notice us?

134
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:36,100
Ah, I got it! Is it because the ticket inspector is drawing closer?

135
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,900
Is he moving up the train to avoid ticket inspection?

136
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,840
Because he didn't have time earlier.

137
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,440
Ah, another one.

138
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:57,360
He got off at Nakatsu, ran, and re-
boarded the train 1 car to the front.

139
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:57,360
So we were exposed? --

140
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:57,360
We weren't exposed
He hasn't noticed us at all --
He's reading the newspaper
We've arrived at Umeda
It seems he's going to run

141
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,460
He's in a real rush for his commute. - Ah, another one!

142
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:05,700
He got off at Nakatsu, ran, and re-
boarded the train 1 car to the front.

143
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:05,700
So we were exposed? --

144
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:05,700
We weren't exposed
He hasn't noticed us at all --
He's reading the newspaper
We've arrived at Umeda
It seems he's going to run

145
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,700
He's running!

146
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,660
Breaking into a flat-out run in Umeda during rush hour?!

147
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,520
Ah, wow! I'll read it out.

148
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:21,260
He got off at Nakatsu, ran, and re-
boarded the train 1 car to the front.

149
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:21,260
He's running!

150
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:21,260
So we were exposed? --

151
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:21,260
We weren't exposed
He hasn't noticed us at all --
He's reading the newspaper
We've arrived at Umeda
It seems he's going to run

152
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:21,260
Got off at Umeda, boarded the Mido-
suji Line, got off at Yodobashi and
ran into his company building

153
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,880
Wow.

154
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,020
How was it? - He's a fast runner!

155
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:38,040
Before he got inside, I managed to give him my card and asked if he was ok with doing an interview.

156
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,760
I asked if he could contact me ...

157
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,760
And now we'll wait for his response. - Ah, I see!

158
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,260
Waiting uneasily ...

159
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,260
6 hours pass by

160
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,600
It's the running person for you

161
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,900
Detective Ishida speaking.

162
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,160
We'll meet up?

163
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,140
Thank you so much!

164
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,960
Interview arranged

165
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,220
So, we've gathered everyone from the Shintani family.

166
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,520
So in a few moments, he'll be coming this way. - I really want to meet him.

167
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,660
I wanna see him! - I'm looking forward to it.

168
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,700
I'm looking forward to it. - I'm looking forward to resolve this.

169
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,000
How can he run everyday? - Ah, he's coming this way, running!

170
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,500
He's running!

171
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,640
Stop, stop, stop!

172
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:48,460
Thank you for your hard work! - Thank you very much.

173
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,680
These are my clients, the Shintani family. - We see you all the time!

174
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,440
We noticed you because you always put so much effort into your running.

175
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,560
How old are you now? - 57. - Ah, I'm glad to hear that.

176
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,500
What do you mean? - It's just you don't see it very often close to retirement.

177
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,320
So why do you run every morning?

178
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,420
I'm terribly sorry to say this, but it's because I'm running late.

179
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,160
Even though we were deeply impressed!

180
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Are you serious? - Absolutely.

181
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,660
Couldn't you get up 15min earlier? - Ah, I do get up early.

182
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,300
I just hate wasting time traveling.

183
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,420
At Okamachi, you got off, moved to the front, and got on the train again.

184
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,820
Every morning?

185
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,040
It's because I'm running late.

186
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,180
Showing him what his running looks like

187
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,680
You can spot yourself already

188
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,340
Are you coming in sight? - There I am.

189
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,220
Ah, there you are! You're panting.

190
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,340
Oh man ...

191
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,980
You've been running constantly for 10 years.

192
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,080
Why do you keep this up?

193
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, it's just because I'm running late.
