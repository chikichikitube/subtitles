00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,030
This is Tsukimura, yes...

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,790
2014 Yoshimoto Head Office

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,880
Understood. I'll be there shortly.

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,220
Tsukimura Kacho...

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,100
Yes, what?

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,000
Um, 2 strange old men are here.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,740
2 old men?
- Yes.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,440
Um, what was it.. Downtown.. or something like that

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,690
It's been a while, huh?

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,960
We were just passing by and thought we'd stop in.

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,080
Nearby.

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,520
It's been a while.
- Can we sit?

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,140
Yes.

16
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,760
It's been awhile since our last visit.

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:50,810
Hamada-san?

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,860
Uh-uh.

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,760
Matsumoto-san.

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,940
You've changed quite a lot.

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,960
Have we? No, we haven't changed at all.

22
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,930
We're fine.
- Is that so?

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,090
We are STILL very fine.

24
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,890
By the way...

25
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,400
Shall I say it?

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,980
Well...Um...

27
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,160
We again..well, we haven't worked for a while..., but we are going to start again.

28
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,010
Yes.

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,580
So you've been stopping but

30
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,060
No need to do so anymore.

31
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,370
Stopping what?

32
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,900
Work for us that Yoshimoto has been kindly suspending...

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,050
will be... um...

34
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,230
accepted.
- Please feel free.

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,810
Yes.

36
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,760
Has someone been suspending your work?

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,740
Well...

38
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,220
That's right.
- Certainly.

39
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,040
Has someone? I had no idea.

40
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,120
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,040
We understand.
- You thought it was strange, right?

42
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,320
That's fine, now that you know it.

43
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,880
Is that so?
- Just to let you know.

44
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,120
I understand it.

45
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,960
What shall we start with?

46
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,630
What work shall we start with?

47
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,860
Hey, I heard he is now

48
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,230
a Kacho (Section Chief).

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,220
How many years ago was it? How many years ago did you start working here?

50
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,220
Let me see, it's been 20 years.

51
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,530
20 years?

52
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,560
I recall when you appeared in front of us for the first time.

53
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,630
You were like this, huh?

54
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,450
That's too small!

55
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,430
See?

56
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,160
My arm is not rusty yet.

57
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,760
* This means "Technique is not rusty" in Japanese

58
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,900
Not only his. Neither is mine.

59
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,630
That's wrong!

60
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,560
See.

61
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,100
See? We Still got it.

62
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,900
Let me see...

63
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:01,300
TV shows and stages are full for the time being.

64
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,900
We can't ask for TV shows so suddenly.

65
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,580
Yes.

66
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,300
Stage work should be more flexible.

67
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,100
Yeah.

68
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,500
Right?

69
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,560
Yes...

70
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,210
But stages are yet...

71
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,560
What about customers? I assume you
aren't getting a lot of customers lately.
- Are they satisfied?

72
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,230
Customers? Yes, we have a lot.

73
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,360
Lots of customers.

74
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,560
A lot?

75
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,730
Yes. A lot.

76
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,410
The 2nd floor is full too?

77
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,630
Yes, sure.

78
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,800
The 2nd floor is full too.

79
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,540
How much.. how much do you charge!?

80
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,400
We charge 3,500 yen now.

81
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,300
3,500 yen? And seats are full?
- Yes they are full.

82
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,190
The 2nd floor too?
- Yes.

83
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,240
The 2nd floor is full too.

84
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,440
Yes.

85
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,110
I bet no more standing fans?

86
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,600
Like I said...

87
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,140
Whe had a lot in our times, right?
- Yes, I heard about that. It's still the same.

88
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,500
In front?
- Yes.

89
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,890
Like this?
- Yes.

90
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,960
It's the same.

91
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,000
Hama-chan, how many were there back then?

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,830
Let me think... there were...

93
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,300
600 or something?
- 400 million?

94
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,830
So now ticket costs 3,000 something?

95
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,500
So cheap. It wasn't that cheap in our times, huh?

96
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,830
No no no...

97
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,230
3,500 yen now.

98
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,720
How much was it?

99
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,760
About 400 million yen.

100
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,430
That's too much!

101
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,500
My shoulder is so light.

102
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,520
First of all let us start with a sideshow act.

103
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,560
That sounds good.

104
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,200
We didn't like it back then.
- Yes, I've heart that.

105
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,700
Well... yeah.

106
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,460
Well well well.

107
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,640
Of course we don't go for silly ones.

108
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,560
Yes, yes.

109
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,900
No, we don't.

110
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,120
No, we don't.
- No.

111
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,280
We can't lower ourselves.

112
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,600
But still, there should be something.

113
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,780
This one...

114
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,230
What is it?

115
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,230
Let me see.

116
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,040
Let's hear it just in case.

117
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,980
This?
- Yes.

118
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,300
I know it wont be good but.
- Just say it, you never know.

119
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,900
Just say it.

120
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,560
This sideshow act is at a supermarket.

121
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,100
Supermaket?

122
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,100
Yes.

123
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,300
What do you do?

124
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,430
Selling products of a small company at a cart

125
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,760
in Manzai style. That's what they want you to do.

126
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,760
Not bad.

127
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,830
We should do that kind of work.

128
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,880
Not bad?

129
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,850
Not bad?
- Nope.

130
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,620
It's just like a joke.
- Yeah.

131
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,500
Of course we won't take it seriously,

132
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,230
That's foolish.
- Yes.

133
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,270
We should just do it.

134
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,050
Well but...

135
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,160
Um...what to say, the pay..

136
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,220
We can't take it if it's too cheap.

137
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,140
No, no we can't.

138
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,300
Fans won't be happy.

139
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,850
Uh... so this is no good then.

140
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,900
But how much is it just in case.

141
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,960
This is...

142
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,220
That's OK. Just in case.

143
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,320
That's OK.

144
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,830
You'll receive 10,000 yen per one person.

145
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,630
Not bad.
- Not bad.

146
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:11,960
10,000 yen?

147
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,960
You think it's OK? Oh, is that so?
- No no no that's not too bad.

148
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,630
Don't worry.
- OK.

149
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,160
It's not bad, it'll be fun like a joke.

150
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,360
A joke?
- Of course.

151
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,700
A pro that goes the opposite way.

152
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,960
You're clever.

153
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,100
Purposely? OK, I understand.

154
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,830
Excuse me, I have to leave for a meeting.

155
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,630
I don't have my wallet with me!

156
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,100
Did I drop it!?

157
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,960
Oh, yeah. I saw you drop it.

158
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:44,830
What?

159
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,160
Did you see it?
- Yes.

160
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,500
Shucks! I dropped it.

161
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,310
I don't have mine either.

162
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,230
Oh, both of you don't have?

163
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,480
I'm sorry but can we...

164
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,200
Oh yes...

165
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,700
We can't return home.
- No..

166
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,360
Don't take it in a wrong way.
- No, I don't.

167
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,830
So I'm sorry but this will only be enough to pay
your travel expense, but 5,000 yen each.

168
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,360
That's...

169
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,230
Yes?

170
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,830
This is...

171
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,430
You can't return home?

172
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,760
A matured man would...

173
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,560
So.

174
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,960
10,000 yen each. Should be fine.

175
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,700
Umm...

176
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,560
I only have 22,000 yen...32,000 yen left in my wallet.

177
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,030
I only had like 50,000 yen with me.

178
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,030
I'm sorry. Just borrowing.

179
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,500
OK?
- Yes.

180
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,100
I'm sorry.

181
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,700
I don't have a penny now.

182
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,560
It's just a joke.
- Is it so?

183
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,360
Just joking.
- No no no.

184
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,960
Are you mad? Did we offend you?
- No, I'm not. No.

185
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,830
It seems like we came to borrow money.

186
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,030
Sorry.

187
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:01,760
OK then.

188
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,430
I feel bad, shall I come back tomorrow to repay?

189
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,030
Well, I'll be in Tokyo so I won't be here at the main office.

190
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,160
Are you going?
- Yes.

191
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,630
Even if you come...
- Why are you going there?

192
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,300
I'm visiting Fuji TV.

193
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,300
So then, shall we...go together?

194
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,100
Huh? What?

195
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,230
Can you call?

196
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,960
What for?

197
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,100
To book a hotel room.

198
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,900
Shinpuri (Shinagawa Prince Hotel) is fine.
Ah...ah...

199
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,300
Shinpuri and tickets...

200
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,560
I don't have it here.

201
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,960
Tickets..
- In my bag...

202
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,760
I have them in my bag.
- Just do it now.

203
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,900
Just call.

204
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,360
Just call. Hurry up.
- But actually I won't be staying  there over night.

205
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,830
You can come back. We'll be staying there.

206
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,760
Just call.

207
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
I can't...

208
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,700
YOU GUYS ARE WASHED UP COMEDIANS!

209
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,360
Don't make me say it.

210
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,500
To be continued
