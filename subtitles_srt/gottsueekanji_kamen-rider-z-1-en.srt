00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,900
Isn't there anyone that can help??

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,820
It's a hero!

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,900
"Small..."

5
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,780
I'm sorry...

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,350
THE SIDE OF JUSTICE

7
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,100
I got here before you

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,140
You're Hamada-kun, right?
- Yes

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,580
Do you remember me?
- No...

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,960
Just as I thought... you don't

11
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,530
Well...

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,300
This afternoon, you
called my justice "small"

13
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,300
I almost cried

14
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,500
By looking at me now...
what do you think?

15
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,820
Am I small?

16
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,560
I'm not small, right?

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,420
Not small, but...

18
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,100
"BI"... say it
"BI"

19
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,900
Say it! "BI"

20
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,900
Say it!
Say it with me!

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,620
"BI"... "BIG", right??

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,820
I just wanted you to understand

23
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,820
I came here because
it was bothering me

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,500
I just wanted you to understand that!
- Yes I do

25
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,850
But, I wonder why you
called me "small"?

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,130
Well... you we're small...

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,500
How did you determine...
Damn, this thing is irritating!

28
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,900
How did you determine
that I was "small"?

29
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,500
- How...
You compared me to the monster, right?

30
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,000
- Yes...
But, don't you think that's strange?

31
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,900
You were comparing
me to the monster...

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,500
But what if there was no monster?

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,300
If I was there alone, you would
definitely call me "big", right?

34
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,440
- Yes
Isn't that true?

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,500
That's why it's strange

36
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:24,300
You made up your mind on your own,
what size I was, either big or small

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,300
Makes me want to cry

38
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,360
Yes...

39
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,740
A big apple or a small watermelon...
I wonder which one is "big"??

40
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,620
Do you understand?
- Yes...

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,740
That's the part I really
wanted to make clear

42
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,900
Yes...

43
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,540
Anyway, do you know my name?

44
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,770
No... I don't

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,060
What do you think it is?

46
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,620
"something-man"

47
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,340
Just like I thought...
Damn, this thing is cold!

48
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,800
Just as I thought...
You think I am a hero
like Ultra-man, right?

49
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,540
- Yes...
No, I'm not!

50
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,100
I'm Kamen Rider Z!

51
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,660
Ultra-man can change in size, right?
He can grow...

52
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,660
- Yes
But when I change,
I stay the same size!

53
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,810
I am big for a Kamen Rider!

54
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,970
I want you to understand that
- I understand

55
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,340
Even if I fight with a monster
there is no comparison

56
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,370
Because of my size, the
monster wants to fight me

57
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,570
But, I don't run

58
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,580
Don't you think that's impressive?!

59
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,870
I just want you to know
- I'm sorry

60
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,570
Now do you understand?

61
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,260
Well, I said all that I wanted to say

62
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,740
But it still feels like it's not enough...

63
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,920
You're Hamada-kun, right?
- Yes

64
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,740
Do you have something
that you use up?

65
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,260
Huh?

66
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,490
Something that you use up

67
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,290
I'll say it clearly, "money!"

68
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,780
Isn't money great?

69
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,650
I don't really need money, but...

70
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,120
You hurt my feelings, so...

71
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,580
I want you to take a risk too

72
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,400
I was wondering if you
could give me some money?

73
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,580
Sorry

74
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,860
Can you hurry?

75
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,580
I really don't have much on me...
That's fine, whatever you got

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,700
Are you sure?
Pay me enough to
make yourself feel bad

77
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,780
I only have coins...

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,380
Coins for me is really small money...

79
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,660
Oh ok...

80
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,580
Ok, I won't hold back and accept this

81
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,860
Well, I'll be going
- Ok

82
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,700
Don't tell anyone about this

83
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,980
He's big, but a small human being
