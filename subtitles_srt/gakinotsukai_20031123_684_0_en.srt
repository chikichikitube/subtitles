It must have been quite tough, huh?

What?

45
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,960
You had it quite tough, didn't you Hamada-san?

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,470
Hmmm...

47
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,640
What? Why?

48
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,600
Yeahhhh, well, I was quite a bad dude back in the day

49
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,060
During your student days?

50
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,060
I used to do boxing.

51
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,060
Ohh? I never knew that.

52
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,970
Ahh, and?

53
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,380
I ended up fighting in a match.

54
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,600
What? I never heard of that!

55
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,500
Really? But, Matsumoto-san, you've known him for ages!

56
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah, now that I think of it, I did fight someone.

57
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,220
But...I hadn't really done any proper training, you know?

58
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,310
You know?

59
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,220
I hadn't, you know?

60
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,220
Ohh yeahh okay.

61
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,810
And I did shit like....

62
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,470
punching meat and stuff.

63
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,390
punching meat and stuff.

64
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,400
You were punching meat?

65
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,320
Your story is all over the place, man.

66
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,890
Nooo, I was punching meat and stuff for training.

67
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,280
Why were you training like that?

68
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,760
Some old geaser was telling me to punch meat.

69
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,400
I don't understand your story.

70
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
He was my trainer!

71
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,120
My opponent was super strong. I beat him up real good too though.

72
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,900
I beat him up good, but I got smashed to a pulp too.

73
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,420
Who did you fight?

74
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,390
The champion.

75
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,980
THE CHAMPION!?

76
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,180
You were at that level?

77
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,180
Was it a world championship?

78
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,810
What? Wasn't he the champion?

79
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,120
We don't know! That's what you told us!

80
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,080
Oh...yeah it was the champion then.

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,930
He was strong as fuck. Maan, I got fucked up.

82
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,930
What was the result?

83
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,600
I.....lost. I think?

84
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,640
I.....lost. I think?

85
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
I.....lost. I think?

86
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,800
Maybe I lost?

87
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,480
Oh, wow, you got beat up so badly you can't remember.

88
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,940
Anyway, one thing I do remember

89
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,100
"Adriaaaan!"

90
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,100
I was screaming after the match

91
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,960
Who is that?

92
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,470
The name of my girlfriend at the time.

93
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,220
Oh at the time?

94
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,240
Adrian? Were you dating a non-Japanese person?

95
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,020
She was butt ugly though.

96
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,360
I've known you a long time, but didn't know that story.

97
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
I don't want to do that again.

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,900
So you stopped right after?

99
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,360
That was your one and only boxing fight?

100
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,960
No, I mean I don't want to talk about this anymore.

101
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,880
I seeeee.

102
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,320
It was rough. I didn't think I'd talk about it now.

103
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,400
Ohhh, well I'm glad you let us know about it.

104
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,680
There's a lot we don't know, hey?

105
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,680
I've never heard stories of how you grew up.

106

What's wrong Endo? Did something bad happen to you?

118
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,620
There's a story I wish I would never remember.

119
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,320
Seriously?

120
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,700
I told my story, so you should too.

121
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,920
I don't think you'll believe my story, but just hear me out.

122

Hey man, don't say shit like that.

123
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,060
I'll believe whatever you say, Endo!

124
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,060
Yeah of course!

125
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,580
Well uhh....

126
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,020
I was bullied by monkeys in the past....

127
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,620
Wait, what did you say?

128
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,640
You were bullied by monkeys?

129
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,180
What do you mean? Like dude, I believe you but...

130
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,040
Basically, I had to fly away from Earth.

131
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,930
What?

132
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,940
Fly away from Earth?

133
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,760
Might seem sudden, but basically, my spaceship broke down and...

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,180

Yeah so, I crash landed and...

142
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,640
That's amazing.

143
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,850
....and, that was when I started....

144
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,140
....and, that was when I started....

145
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,600
....and, that was when I started....

146
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,600
....to be bullied by monkeys.

147
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,160
What are you talking about?

148
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,820
I don't get it. Your story just jumps from one place to the next.

149
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,120
Why are you suddenly being bullied by monkeys?

150
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,860
You won't believe me, but you know how Earth is ruled by humans?

151
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,760
Instead, monkeys rule over this other planet.

152
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,680
And...

153
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,850
The Statue of Liberty

154
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,470
The Statue of Liberty

155
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,470
......I saw it there

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
In America?

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,100
And I was like "Woaahh!"

158
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,560
"So this was Earth once upon a time"

159
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,740
....and that's kind of how it ended.

160
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,380
The world is a strange place.

161
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,380
Well yeah, I guess.

162
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,220
It's good you got back safely.

163
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,220
Yes it was.

164
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,680
I was worried what might have happened to you.

165
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,940
I didn't understand a lot of the story though.

166
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,430
But hey, it's hard remembering old stories, isn't it?

167
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,430
It sure is.

168
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,100
You just remember bits and pieces.

169
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,400
Ashita no Jow
(Joe of Tomorrow)

170
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,400
Yabuki Joe

171
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:36,100
"Ashita no Joe"

172
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:36,100
Yabuki Joe

173
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:36,100
Yabuki Joe starts boxing under the guidance of Dange Danpei, and fights against the likes of Rikiishi Tohru and the World Champion.

174
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:36,100
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

175
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
There are heaps of others who haven't spoken yet.

176
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,960
Might be weird for me to bring this up now...

177
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,970
But my name is actually "Joe".

178
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,470
But my name is actually "Joe".

179
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,600
What?

180
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,520
You're already gonna say that?

181
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,220
That far?

182
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,480
You said you used to do boxing, right, Hamada-san?

183
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,970
Yeah.

184
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,400
I used to box as well.

185
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,390
Really?

186
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,400
Why didn't you say before?

187
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,740
Well I didn't want everyone to turn their focus onto me.

188
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,740
Why did you do boxing?

189
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,820
There was this old dude...

190
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,760
...with a, what's it called?

191
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,520
An eye patch.

192
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,140
He said "You got a good punch. You should fight in a match".

193
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,280
I was quite happy like "Oh what? Are you serious?"

194
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,260
And so I fought, but I think a girl came out at some stage...

195
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,580
...or something. Maybe?

196
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,400
What are you saying?

197
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,540
Were you fighting girls?

198
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,180
No, that's not it.

199
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,260
Aren't you just talking about Moriman?

200
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,260
No they weren't girls.

201
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,520
My opponent was....

202
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,720
...that guy, a foreigner.

203
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Jose Mendoza!

204
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,740
I was getting beaten down like this and....

205
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,960
the eyepatch dude kept saying "Stand up! Stand up!"

206
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,120
Because I was sitting down a fair bit.

207
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,640
Oh you were down?

208
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,640
"Stand! Stand up Joe!"

209
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,660
and I was like "Yes! Yes!"

210
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,400
So I tried really hard fighting and.....

211
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,810
...in the end....I died.

212
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,810
...in the end....I died.

213
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,400
Wha?

214
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,020
You died? But you're alive.

215
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,820
In a sense you died, right?

216
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,060
Oh as a boxer, you died?

217
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,120
That's messed up!

218
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,200
In the end I was like this, and all white.

219
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,400
Were you ok?

220
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,160
You skipped a lot in your story.

221
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,080
I didn't want to remember that.

222
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,920
What's up with everyone today? Got a lot of things to get off your chest?

223
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,220
Ikkyu-san

224
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,220
Ikkyu-san

225
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:04,470
"Ikkyu-san"

226
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:04,470
Ikkyu

227
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:04,470
Ikkyu would continuously solve many problems with his quick wit.

228
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:04,470
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

229
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,560
I'd like to hear more about Hamada-san.

230
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,020
Yeah, I'm sure you experienced a lot.

231
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,560
You just told us about you as an adult. How about as a child?

232
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
Oh, yeah, right.

233
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,840
Yeah please tell us something.

234
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,060
When I was little I....

235
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,720
I was made to go to a temple often...

236
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,440
The big-wig of the town at the time was an evil guy.

237
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,160
What the fuck are you talking about?

238
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,320
It doesn't make much sense.

239
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,440
Well, ahh you know...

240
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,890
...he'd make ridiculous demands

241
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,890
that piss people off.

242
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:56,660
Even to little kids, despite him being a grown adult, he'd say all this unreasonable shit.

243
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,460
You know how there's a 'hashi'?

244
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,260
"Hashi", as in bridge?

245
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,640
Yeah, he put a sign on a bridge saying,

246
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
"Crossing the bridge is prohibited".

247
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,720
"Crossing the bridge is prohibited".

248
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,640
"Crossing the bridge is prohibited".

249
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,340
Well that's pretty annoying of him

250
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,140
I crossed it anyway.

251
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,400
But you're not supposed to!

252
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,960
It says you can't cross it.

253
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,400
Hah!

254
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,520
Well it could also mean that you can't

255
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,520
cross the "hashi", meaning "edge"!

256
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,980
What?

257
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,000
I strutted straight down the middle.

258
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,540
You must have been a pain in the ass as a kid.

259
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,520
Yeah a bit annoying.

260
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,600
Bit of a smart ass.

261
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,100
I liked to use my wit.

262
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,340
So I did stuff like that a fair bit.

263
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,340
I did that a lot.

264
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,140
Fuck, it's hot.

265
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,020
Well, we're glad to hear a story from long a go anyway.

266
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,970
So that's the kind of kid you were?

267
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,420
Yeah, that's right. People might not have liked me, I dunno.

268
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,850
Jason

269
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,850
"Friday the 13th"

270
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:24,140
"Friday the 13th"

271
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:24,140
Jason

272
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:24,140
Jason, a serial killer, murders the men and women who come to visit a camping ground, one-by-one.

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:24,140
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

274
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,420
What the fuck...

275
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Ready, set...

276
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,980
Give me a break! Not my memories again!

277
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,540
What's wrong with that? C'mon dude.

278
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,120
Just do a quick version.

279
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,760
Well, I....

280
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,500
...wore an ice hockey mask and...

281
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,470
Who did?

282
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,500
I did.

283
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
When you were a kid?

284
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,770
No, it was...

285
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,060
really recently.

286
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,060
Recently? What for?

287
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,900
I just got really frustrated....

288
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,140
...so I wore an ice hockey mask, got a machete

289
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,180
...and just massacred people.

290
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,640
You can't do that!

291
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,430
I couldn't help it! I was just so pissed off!

292
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,860
Who did you kill!?

293
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,350
Just whoever was there.

294
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,020
Some guy that came to stay over.

295
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,060
Some guy that came to stay over.

296
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,120
Someone you know!?

297
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,060
It happened last month, or like...

298
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,140
on Friday....the 13th.

299
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,140
on Friday....the 13th.

300
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,080
Woah, you're scary, dude.

301
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,660
I'd never wanna stay at your place.

302
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,120
Shiiiit, that's terrifying.

303
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,580
You're fucking scary.

304
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,840
Hoshi Hyuma

305
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,840
Kyojin no Hoshi

306
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:47,360
I heard that Tanaka is actually kind of into baseball?

307
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:55,270
"Kyojin no Hoshi"

308
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:55,270
Hoshi Hyuma

309
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:55,270
Hoshi Tyuma joins the Giants ,thanks to the spartan training methods employed by his father Ittetsu, and competes with rivals using makyuu (magic pitches).

310
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:55,270
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

311
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,620
That's right!

312
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,770
You'd think Endo has more to do with baseball.

313
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,680
But it's actually Tanaka?

314
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,440
Since everyone likes to link Endo with baseball a lot...

315
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,060
I kind of hid it. It was hard to say.

316
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,000
Ahh yeah, I get you.

317
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,850
My old man,

318
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,850
really loved baseball.

319
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,850
really loved baseball.

320
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,300
Yeah some dads are like that.

321
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,890
He was extremely strict too.

322
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,080
Yeah.

323
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,900
When I said I don't want to train anymore

324
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,040
he flipped over the dining table

325
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,430
Wow, he's scary.

326
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,440
He then forces this thing on me.

327
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,120
What?

328
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,140
Springs.

329
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,830
Springs?

330
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,340
He put springs all over my body.

331
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,920
Why?

332
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,120
He made me wear this thing that made it harder to move

333
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,060
so that I could train to throw balls faster than usual...

334
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,380
or something like that.

335
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,720
You should've told someone about that. Didn't anyone speak up for you?

336
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,320
My elder sister was worried for me.

337
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,310
But...all she'd do was peek out.

338
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,040
But...all she'd do was peek out.

339
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,040
..and wouldn't speak out for me.

340
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,840
So I couldn't stop. Anyway....

341
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,680
I eventually joined the Giants.

342
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,740
You were in the team?

343
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,140
That's amazing!

344
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,140
It might not be very well known but...

345
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,600
I had no idea!

346
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,640
The training was effective and I could throw...

347
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,770
"Magical Pitches..."

348
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,740
You what?

349
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,770
Like a magic throw where the ball disappears...type of thing.

350
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,760
Type of thing?

351
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,060
As if it would disappear!

352
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,220
It does disappear! Everyone's shocked, like even...

353
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,220
Ban-kun...

354
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,480
Who the hell is Ban-kun?

355
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
He was the catcher.

356
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,980
The catcher?

357
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,430
There was also a guy called Hanagata.

358
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,020
Who's that?

359
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,680
He might have been a first draft pick of the Tigers.

360
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,680
There wasn't anyone called that.

361
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,560
I'm pretty sure that he did exist.

362
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
He had front teeth like this....

363
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
Front teeth?

364
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,380
I mean his fringe...

365
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,140
Anyway, how do you make the ball disappear?

366
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,380
I stretch out my arms, and jump up...

367
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,560
That's Banba Ban. (different manga)

368
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,270
Anyway, that's the story.

369
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,260
Wow, hadn't heard that before.

370
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,680
Well anyways, maybe we can talk again another time.

371
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,040
Yeah we'd like to hear some more stories.

372
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,500
I'd like to hear a story from Matsumoto-san.

373
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,060
Momotaro

374
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,060
Momotaro

375
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:34,220
"Momotaro"

376
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:34,220
Momotaro

377
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:34,220
Momotaro, born from a peach, is raised by an old man and woman, before leaving for the Demon Island....

378
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:34,220
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

379
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,080
So.....what was it like?

380
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,960
During your early childhood?

381
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,620
Well....

382
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:46,400
...I don't really think this story is suitable for television

383
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,780
Just tell it to us then.

384
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,040
That's right.

385
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,120
Well, I actually....wasn't even born at a hospital.

386
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,860
There was no midwife either.

387
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,780
So you were born at home?

388
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,520
Yeah, well kinda. Nowadays you'd

389
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,680
call it a....cesarean birth.

390
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,020
call it a....cesarean birth.

391
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,860
But it was a really crude version of a cesarean.

392
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,420
What do you mean by that?

393
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,180
Don't worry, you won't believe me.

394
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,580
C'mon! We all told you our stories.

395
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,780
Yeah, well....

396
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:37,020
....I was sort of protected by

397
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,020
a fruit like object...kind of.

398
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
Sorry, what?

399
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,860
What is he on?

400
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,160
Okay, if I say this you'll all find it a bit awkward, but basically

401
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,360
...I was something like an abandoned child.

402
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,020
I was shoved in a fruit like object and...

403
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,740
thrown in to a river.

404
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,320
Yeah, so I must have had some horrible parents.

405
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:05,100
Anyway, a random old lady just happened to pick that up and..

406
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,700
....also, thinking about it now...

407
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,480
...and I might sound mean but...

408
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,080
...she was living with an old man and

409
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,660
when she found me, the old lady was washing clothes in the river

410
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,440
so if you think about it, they were probably homeless or something.

411
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,040
Yeah, well.

412
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,140
That's a possibility.

413
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,520
Aren't...

414
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,390
fables a bit hard to do?

415
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,470
fables a bit hard to do?

416
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,120
Gaki no Tsukai is so much fun!

417
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,720
Gaki-Gaki-kun!

418
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,260
Gaki-Gaki-kun!

419
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,700
Gaki-Gaki-kun!

420
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,180
Gaki-Gaki-kun!

421
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,080
Gari-Gari-kun!

422
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,940
Sorry to bring this up now but...

423
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,380
it has become clear that you will suffer a punishment game.

424
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,900
The staff are busy preparing at the moment.

425
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,640
It should begin very soon though.

426
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,640
What will I be doing?

427
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,420
Errr, you'll be going on an adventure for a while.

428
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,120
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

429
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,020
Should be alright if I apologise twice.

430
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,020
What do you mean, adventure?

431
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:36,000
You'll be returning around....February.

432
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,420
Don't worry, just go all out.

433
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,600
Aww hell no. This ain't Denpa Shonen.

434
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,600
It'll be okay. Don't worry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

435
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,740
Just apologise three times.

436
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,600
I'd always wanted to say this during our talk sessions.

437
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,220
But I just always forgot to mention it.

438
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,240
I see.

439
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,100
It just so happens that I remembered clearly this time.

440
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,100
Oh, then let's hear it.

441
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,520
It's just about something that pisses me off.

442
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,520
Go ahead.

443
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,060
Well, if you don't know the number of a shop, you'd call

444
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,080
1042.

445
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
Yes. Can you find out that way?

446
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,640
Yeah it's a service where you can check numbers.

447
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,640
Oh okay cool.

448
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,980
Do you know how much you get charged, doing that?

449
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,720
Nope.

450
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,320
Surprisingly, almost everyone doesn't know this.

451
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,180
(Roughly 1,5$ in 2003)

452
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,200
You get charged 150 yen!!

453
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,200
Everyone needs to be more outraged by this, don't you think!?

454
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,500
Taken by some old hag!

455
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,820
And the last half is just a machine!

456
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,200
A hundred and fifty fuckin' yen, motherfucker!

457
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,540
Did you know that!?

458
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,720
Most people don't know! Y'all didn't know did you?

459
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,440
Call twice, thats 300 yen! Call three times, that's 450 yen!

460
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,160
Your cost doubles each time! Well, actually it doesn't, but...

461
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,840
This is what I think. So it has been 20 odd years since you created Downtown, yes?

462
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,850
Yes? Yes?

463
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,850
Yeah.

464
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:15,360
Over that time, you would've hit me around 40,000 times on the head.

465
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,850
Well, I don't know about that.

466
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,000
From around next year, I'm going to start charging you 150 yen each time.

467
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,100
I'm sorry.

468
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,700
Don't mean to disrespect.

469
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,880
How can we work then?

470
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,540
Mkay that's 100 yen.

471
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,540
I think I should be allowed to charge that!

472
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,100
Why?

473
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,820
I'm clearly developing injuries from it.

474
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,270
From being hit?

475
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,140
My sense of taste is fucking up a bit...

476
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,140
Bullshit, asshole!

477
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,930
I can taste sweetness, and sourness.

478
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,400
but not sweet-and-sour these days.

479
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,320
You don't even need to know that taste.

480
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,060
Fuck off mate. Sweet-and-sour is essential!

481
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,080
Who cares! You won't eat something that strange anyway!

482
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,420
Sweet-and-sour is important, surely!

483
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,020
Oh that's sweet....Oh that's sour.....

484
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,320
What the fuck is this?

485
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,260
It doesn't matter!

486
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,540
Of course it matters!

487
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,580
There aren't many foods with that flavour anyway!

488
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,580
Yeah there fucking is!

489
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,100
You won't eat much of it, I'm telling you!

490
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,330
You're so intent on convincing me that I won't eat something like that.

491
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,140
Shouldn't you be questioning why I'm charging you 150 yen or something?

492
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,240
150 yen is a large amount!

493
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,180
No one here even agrees with you.

494
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:49,080
Why does it cost so much to get an old hag to tell you a phone number?

495
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,760
Can't they just use machines the whole time if it switches over anyway?

496
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,380
I have no clue what you're saying.

497
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,320
So, you'd speak to a lady first, who says "Please hold a mament"

498
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,140
"Mament?"

499
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,540
....and it changes to a tape after that, right?

500
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,660
Yes it does. It's probably not a tape though.

501
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,810
It's not tape.

502
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,810
Oh, isn't it?

503
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:15,160
It's not tape! Surely it's something more computer-ish!?

504
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,060
She won't be like "Please hold" and go....

505
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,800
(Tape rewinding noise)

506
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,300
You were just doing the actions for recording a tape.

507
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,100
Well it would be strange to be tape, anyway!

508
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:40,640
Yeah, you know what I mean. There's a tape or it's connected to something, somewhere!

509
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,560
It's connected to a place where the voice comes from, right?

510
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,820
Like, you press a button and a voice starts speaking.

511
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,220
What are you imagining?

512
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,060
So there's a list of restaurants and bars in a certain area....

513
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,560
Oh okay, err maybe there is?

514
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,930
and, she'll choose a button from from there.

515
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,940
What!? There'd be shitloads then!

516
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,340
"Please hold for a moment".

517
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,380
What are you doing?

518
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,100
Using a pole or something to press the button.

519
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,620
I didn't mean they're on a wall or something!

520
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,800
You'd have to step back heaps to be able to see!

521
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,430
Don't worry we still have heaps of time to talk.

522
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:26,940
I'm not worried about that, I just thought we could have just let it be a tape, and moved on.

523
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,840
Keeping it plain and simple.

524
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,880
But there is no fucking tape in the first place.

525
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:41,300
What's with you? Repeating "Tape" like you're possessed.

526
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,140
What the fuck is tape, anyway?

527
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,140
Shut up!

528
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,140
Okay, that's 150 yen.
