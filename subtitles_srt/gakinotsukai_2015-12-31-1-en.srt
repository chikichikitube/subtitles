This one is the final one we do...

46
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,550
Whaaaatttt!?

47
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,530
Is that so?

48
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,360
Is it really the final one?

49
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,010
The audience is saying "Whaaat" and all.

50
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,820
But you 4 weren't really saying anything...

51
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,050
But you 4 weren't really saying anything...

52
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,570
That's true...

53
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,090
Let's keep doing it from here on...

54
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,360
Who's the youngest out of us 4 again?

55
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,980

57
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,780
And how old are you two again?

58
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,330
We are 44 years old

59
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,330
We are 44 years old

60
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,140
So young...

61
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,280
Are we really?

62
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,720
You still have ages to go

63
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,880
You're at the age where we started this whole thing...

64
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,200
Oh, you mean yourselves...

65
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,440

Right then, Matsumoto-san...

69
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,080
Why the hell do I have to do this?

Check if the plug hasn't been unplugged

76
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,630
The beginning of it all...

77
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,930
Welcomes the men

78
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,880
The same kind of morning weather...

79
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,520
kindly welcomes the members...

80
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,400
Oh man, it's started raining

81
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,420
Oh, for crying out loud...

82
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,780
It's started to rain just as we're about to start...

83
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,610
Oh man, how's it going to turn out this year?

84
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,250
Oh man, that's really annoying

85
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,000
Why is the weather suddenly so bad?

86
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,150
It's starting to pour down

87
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:35,480
Heeeeey!!

88
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,110
Heeeeey!!

89
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,480
Heeeeey!!

90
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,150
Heeeeey!!

91
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,450
Shut the fuck up, you idiot!

92
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,450
Shut the fuck up, you idiot!

93
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,520
You idiot!

94
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,720
You're so fucking noisy!!

95
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,170
From so far away...

96
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,170
You're all complaining so much

97
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,170
You're the worst, Matsumoto-san...

98
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,190
Yeah...

99
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,330
Why is he walking so fast?

100
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,510
He's just rushed off ahead

101
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,500
He's just such a  forward guy

102
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,570
Really?

103
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,940
What are you dressed as?

104
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,430
Morning, guys

105
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,470
I've seen this character somewhere before though

106
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,210
Over here...

107
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,310
That's fine and all

108
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,610
But can't we do anything about this rain?

109
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,660
Morning, guys...

110
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,380

Fujiwara Hiroshi

112
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,220
You got to be kidding me!?

113
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,020
You guys have no aura at all

114
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,080
Well I mean...

115
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,690
We've never been told to have  an aura really...

116
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,190
If you had told us a bit sooner to have an aura,  maybe we could have...

117
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,630
If you had told us a bit sooner to have an aura,  maybe we could have...

118
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,690
Yeah, we would have...

119
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,800
At this rate, we can't get  any F1 Sous...

120
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,660
At this rate, we can't get  any F1 Sous...

121
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,170
F1 Sou...

122
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:40,840
F1 Sou: A 20-34 year old woman who works in the broadcast industry

123
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,840
How many times you going to say that...?

124
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,840
Do you actually know what a F1 Sou is?

125
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,120
Like what kind of people from which generation they're from...

126
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,010
They're them women...

127
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,560
That's so him...

128
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,300
And because I knew this would happen,

129
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,300
I've invited a special guest

130
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,300
with some serious aura

131
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,590
A guest with aura who even F1 Sous would know!

132
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,990
He's a guest

133
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,760
That's right... A guest!

134
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,120
This has never happened before...

135
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,280
Are you serious?

136
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:57,800
This is a first...

137
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,790
Right, so look over there

138
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,160
Heeeey!!

139
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,360
Heeeey!!

140
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,730
Heeeey!!

141
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,430
Heeeey!!

142
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,850
Straight from the start?

143
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,200
Special Guest Incoming!!

144
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,380
Already?

145
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,500
Someone with aura...

146
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,100
Yeah.....

147
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,370
Who is it?

148
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,570
I wonder who it is...

149
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,800
We can laugh now, right?

150
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Since we haven't started...

151
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,680
He was so far away...

152
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,720
Multiple guests?

153
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,150
We had no idea

154
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,850
What!?

155
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,560
WHAT!?

156
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,960
It's Nakai!!

157
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,820
What the hell is he doing here?

158
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,530
Is it the real one?

159
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,130
Oh shit, it's the real one

160
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,300
Oh shit, it's the real one

161
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:36,300
Oh shit, it's the real  one

162
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,510
It is...

163
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,720
Wait, why???

164
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,630
Our surroundings are kind of shitty and a bloody train's just gone past

165
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,640
Our surroundings are kind of shitty and a bloody train's just gone past

166
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,110
Your timing was just...

167
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,210
Damn,  your timing sucks

168
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,210
Damn, your timing  sucks

169
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,210
Damn, your timing sucks

170
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,110
Your timing really sucked there...

171
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,110
Even though he's a superstar...

172
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:49,110
His entry collides with a train going past

173
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,770
That was just...

174
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,330
The train in the back...

175
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,460
Wait...

176
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,350
I didn't know about these guys behind me until now...

177
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,150
So this is the super guest with aura...

178
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,230
It's SMAP!

179
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,490
Special Guest: Super Idol

180
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,600
But the guys in the back...

181
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,220
The guys in the back aren't...

182
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,590
Wait...

183
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,460
I didn't know anything about these guys...

184
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,260
Kusanagi-kun is really  pissing me off

185
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,930
Kusanagi-kun is really  pissing me off

186
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,610
Yeah...

187
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,440
Hey, Kusanagi-kun...

188
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,400
Where is he looking?

189
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,440
What is he doing?

190
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,800
They just came out of nowhere...

191
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,440
Amazing...

192
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,660
Kusanagi-kun is so funny...

193
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,610
The way Gorou-chan  made his entry  was amazing

194
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,860
So funny

195
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:21,210
The way Gorou-chan  made his entry  was amazing

196
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,950
It was amazing

197
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,710
Damn...

198
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,530
You're right...

199
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,280
Aren't you guys meant to be at the Kouhaku?

200
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,860
That's right

201
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,580
Oh yeah!

202
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Am I okay to be here?

203
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,880
Am I okayto be here?

204
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,200
I haven't heard anything about the dealings between the two companies...

205
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,400
Yeah...

206
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,460
You're meant to be on Kouhaku, right?

207
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,820
You're fine!!

208
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,760
What are you doing here...

209
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,390
SMAP has five members,

210
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,830
so it's fine if Nakai isn't there

211
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,940
But all 5 aren't here...

212
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,330
Kusanagi-kun, where the  hell are you looking?

213
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,720
I know...

214
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,700
I want to ask a lot of things

215
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,970
First of all, where are you looking, Kusanagi-kun?

216
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,940
First of all, where are you looking, Kusanagi-kun?

217
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,230
Where?

218
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,040
Seriously...

219
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,530
Please tell us...

220
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,680
Yeah, please...

221
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,020
I have no idea what he is looking at...

222
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,040
Nakai

223
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,440
It was your dream to go on Gaki, right?

224
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,050
Just go, man!

225
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,050
He is...

226
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,510
Nakai-kun, go on the show

227
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,720
and make sure you don't get your butt slapped, okay?

228
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,530
That was good...

229
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:00,790
He's quite similar...

230
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,120
He's quite similar...

231
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,490
Kusanagi-kun,

232
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,490
what should I do?

233
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,860
Do your best, Nakai-kun

234
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,470
He does not have a voice like that..

235
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,750
He definitely doesn't sound like that...

236
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,360
Not at all...

237
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,470
It's fine for me to go on Gaki and all,

238
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,430
but I wish there was a script or something...

239
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,910
We wish that as well!

240
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,750
So at least we're on the same page about certain things...

241
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,670
Wait, when he said you've been invited...

242
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,510
Wait, are you actually coming  with us?

243
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,580
Yeah, I am, right?

244
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,710
This year,Nakai is  taking part too.

245
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,090
You're kidding me!

246
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,010
This year, Nakai is taking part too.

247
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,760
What, for real?

248
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,080
But seriously, you have to go to Kouhaku, right?

249
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,280
Obviously...

250
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,250
But these 4  have nothing to do with the show...

251
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,890
But these 4  have nothing to do with the show...

252
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,260
I presume...

253
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:43,830
Enter Nakai Masahiro!!

254
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:43,830
The First Ever Guest Player:

255
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,940
Enter Nakai Masahiro, this series' first ever guest player.

256
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,680
Before the start,

257
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,910
a troublesome feeling...

258
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,370
Wait, are these guys coming as well?

259
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,470
No, no, um...

260
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,800
Everyone but Nakai can just go home now

261
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,250
Oh, they're going home?

262
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,810
Hey, Kusanagi!

263
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,050
They've left...

264
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,940
Kusanagi!!

265
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,340
He didn't say anything...

266
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,550
What is wrong with that Kusanagi?

267
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,710
Yeah...

268
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,180
This is amazing

269
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,450
Are you sure this clash with Kouhaku is not a problem?

270
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,850
Are you sure this clash with Kouhaku is not a problem?

271
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,620
It's fine

272
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,790
You keep saying it's fine,

273
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,850
but why are you so confident about that?

274
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,860
and all

275
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,860
He's been saying he wants to come on  Gaki

276
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,900
So since he's managed to get onto his dream show,

277
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,830
let's get Nakai to say a  few words  to us

278
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,600
For 24 hours, as long as it's allowed, I would like to join forces with you guys

279
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,040
For 24 hours, as long as it's allowed, I would like to join forces with you guys

280
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,710
For 24 hours, as long as it's allowed, I would like to join forces with you guys

281
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,310
Our pleasure! Great to be working with you.

282
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,780
That was shit!!

283
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:32,980
That was shit!!

284
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,280
That was shit!!

285
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,050
Can you introduce yourself without any chopsticks or sticks?

286
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:38,820
Oh just forget it;  just line up, will ya?

287
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,990
Oh just forget it;  just line up, will ya?

288
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,790
It's fine..?

289
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,270
I thought he was heading somewhere...

290
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,060
What a weird feeling...

291
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,160
Okay, guys?

292
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,220
Not really...

293
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,400
Today's weather is perfect for a detective

294
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,040
Today's weather is perfect for a detective

295
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,910
How?!

296
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,470
These are the times when  investigations really take off

297
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,310
Hey Hosei!!

298
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,610
I'm wearing  these  glasses

299
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,580
and dressed as a boy  in a blue suit

300
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,110
And 100 per ce... oh shit, it's not 100 percent

301
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,050
And 100 per ce... oh shit, it's not 100 percent

302
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,350
Sorry...

303
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,430
No, I'm sorry, but...

304
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,650
you really are shit at this

305
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,810
Oh, I see...

306
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,560
He actually said sorry  there,

307
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,560
didn't he?

308
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,460
So this part really has no cuts or anything, huh?

309
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,560
So this part really has no cuts or anything, huh?

310
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,530
Yeah

311
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,070
There's loads of this to deal with...

312
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,930
You don't edit  it at all or anything

313
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,430
Nope...

314
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,930
You shouldn't really be apologising to us...

315
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,270
In the end, there is only truth.

316
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,270
This year's theme is Detective

317
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,010
This year's theme is Detective

318
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,610
I am the one who will look after you from here on

319
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,310
My body is  chubby;  my brain is loyal to the job

320
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,580
My body is  chubby; my brain is loyal  to the job

321
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,780
My body is  chubby;  my brain is loyal  to the job

322
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,550
and my name is Detective  Fujiwara

323
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,380
and my name is  Detective Fujiwara

324
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,690
Okay?

325
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,160
What are you on about?

326
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,160
It's just as we thought...

327
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,760
This year's theme is detective

328
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,760
How many fucking times are you going to say that?!

329
00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:01,770
and take part in harsh tasks for 24 hours

330
00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:01,770
The 6 will become detectives

331
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,110
And the 6 will become detectives...

332
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,960
and participate in various activites...

333
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,420
That photo of me is awful...

334
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,710
I said you guys were going to be detectives, so why are you dressed like that?

335
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,340
Well obviously, we had no idea about this...

336
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,310
There are some clothes prepared  for you in the boxes

337
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,150
So go and get changed now, will ya?

338
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:18,790
They get changed into appropriate clothing

339
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:18,790
As they are going
to become detectives

340
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,640
The first step:

341
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,970
They must

342
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,150
change into suitable clothes

343
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,190
Are you guys all ready?

344
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,830
I'm going to get you to come  out in order

345
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,800
You're so cool... you're really fit, huh?

346
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,920
Man, Matsumoto...

347
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,140
You're going to become Japan's most macho detective

348
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,140
Oh, thank you very much...

349
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,010
Super muscular macho detective

350
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,850
You look really awesome

351
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,640
Thanks a lot

352
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,150
What are you so happy about?

353
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,850
Fearless Tsukkomi Detective

354
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,940
Yeah...

355
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,520
Why do you look so happy?

356
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,890
Because it's been a few years since they gave me normal clothes...

357
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,440
That's right

358
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,190
Because it's been a few years since they gave me normal clothes...

359
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,900
Oh I see...

360
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,900
They tampered with his clothes the last couple of years

361
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,100
Yeah, it does make it harder...

362
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,400
Damn, as usual you're looking handsome.

363
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,880
Thank you very much

364
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,440
Handsome re-married detective

365
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,740
You're the handsome detective

366
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,420
I'll do my best...

367
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,970
As usual, you just look skinny as ever...

368
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,350
Skinny, lanky detective

369
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,800
But I guess you'll be a good lanky detective

370
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,220
...Thank you very much...

371
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,440
Oh, aren't you cute

372
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,740
Oh, they gave you normal clothes...

373
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,530
Baby faced detective

374
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,870
It's okay.

375
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,400
I thought Yama-chan was in trouble since he was last

376
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,750
That's what you'd think

377
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,610
That's true

378
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,900
Yeah, because  he was 5th

379
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,830
Yeah me too, but it was all okay...

380
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,900
Which means...

381
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,110
Damn man, it's so tight on you!

382
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:54,050
Nakai's clothing size is too small

383
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,510
The size of the clothes...

384
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,660
It's definitely not the right size...

385
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,170
It's definitely not...

386
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,510
It's a bit weird...

387
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,090
It's far too small

388
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,290
What is that?

389
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,920
Umm... to be honest

390
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,820
I actually really like it

391
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,520
I actually really like it

392
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,030
You're actually  pulling it off

393
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,380
They probably wanted me to say, "What the hell, guys? Why is this so tight?!"

394
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,650
They probably wanted me to say, "What the hell, guys? Why is this so tight?!"

395
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,550
But to be honest, it's really not that bad

396
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:21,000
Do Not Laugh: The Rules

397
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,020
The rules are very simple

398
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:21,000
Be a detective for 24 hours

399
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:21,000
During this time,they cannot laugh

400
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:21,000
If they laugh,they will be severely punished

401
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:18,300
For the next 24 hours, they cannot laugh, no matter what

402
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,870
That is all

403
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,700
In a minute, the bus to the detective agency will arrive.

404
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,640
In a minute, the bus to the detective agency will arrive.

405
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,510
Prepare a fucking taxi, man!

406
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:38,680
The nervousness starts to build

407
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,080
But seriously...

408
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,590
Guys, can you just line up over here?

409
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,590
There's a bus stop here, of all places?

410
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,520
Seriously man, enough with the buses...

411
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,890
Hey, the bus is here

412
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,090
You guys really are going to start at this time in the morning?

413
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,130
Yeah..

414
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,400
I am shocked...

415
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,930
There were pictures of that bus all over Twitter, you know?

416
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,970
There were pictures of that bus all over Twitter, you know?

417
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,000
Already??

418
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,340
Even before we get onto the bus ourselves?

419
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,340
Here it is, guys.

420
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,680
This is the bus to Gaasu Kurobikari Detective Agency

421
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,480
This is the detective agency you're all about to go to

422
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,180
As soon as you take a step onto the bus you're not allowed to laugh

423
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,180
As soon as you take a step onto the bus you're not allowed to laugh

424
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,620
As usual...

425
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,650
Seriously, why aren't we allowed to laugh?

426
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,360
You really do have a point

427
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,360
Can you just tell us what the reason is?

428
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,360
Yeah, explain that to us

429
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
You just can't laugh...

430
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,630
It's a rule!

431
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:30,230
BUS TO

432
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,230
The bus to Gaasuu Kurobikari Detective Agency

433
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,000
On the bus designed for the detective Suga-lock Holmes,

434
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,640
On the bus designed for the detective Suga-lock Holmes,

435
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,280
They will go to the agency

436
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,280
they will make their way to the detective agency

437
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,850
Shall we?

438
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,850
Shall we go?

439
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,780
This must be stressful, every single year...

440
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,320
Since it's a special occasion, Nakai should go first

441
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,580
Since it's a special occasion, Nakai should go first

442
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,550
Me?

443
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,590
The first step...

444
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,820
But you're all coming too...

445
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,090
Of course

446
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,090
Of course

447
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,090
Yes

448
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,660
He's on!

449
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,660
As soon as you get on...

450
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,160
Detectives

451
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,160
Do not laugh

452
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,630
His butt

453
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,630
looks so tight in that...

454
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,370
It's so tight

455
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,370
Let's go on then...

456
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,240
Damn, we've started this again...

457
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,910
I know...

458
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,980
2015...

459
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,680
2015...

460
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,950
There are already others on board

461
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:26,660
Ah~~~, it's begun!!

462
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,620
It's come again this year, huh?

463
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,290
I mean I'm new here, so I'm really looking forward to it

464
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,330
I mean I'm new here, so I'm really looking forward to it

465
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,160
But this is tougher than you think

466
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,970
Are the days before

467
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,970
really horrible?

468
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,470
Oh yeah, I hate it

469
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,100
Like the day before, when we are on our way here and all,

470
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,670
don't you just hate it?

471
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,810
I hate it so much

472
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,440
In my head,

473
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,440
"Donna Donna" starts playing

474
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,150
I feel like I'm getting sold...

475
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:56,050
The bus leaves. What lies ahead?

476
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,550
Finally, the bus leaves for the Detective Agency

477
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,050
What lies ahead?

478
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,460
It's still so weird that Nakai-kun is here

479
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,290
It's still so weird that Nakai-kun is here

480
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,630
Yama-chan, it's been so long huh?

481
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,560
It really has been...

482
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,860
How many years has it been?

483
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:10,740
Haven't met since Hosei went on a program hosted by Nakai 17 years ago

484
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,860
Like... 15 years?

485
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,500
That long?

486
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,500
What?

487
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,910
Do you still have that rabbit?

488
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,040
No, he's not with us anymore

489
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,440
Because... When we last met he...

490
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,210
Rabbits live for like 7 to 8 years

491
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,250
What was his name again?

492
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,080
Ninjin (means carrot in Japanese)

493
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,790
Please stop that

494
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,990
Trying to frame each other and stuff

495
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,860
Here comes the first one...

496
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,670
If you laugh, the black army

497
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,670
smack your butt

498
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,470
Can I take this off? Isn't it boiling in here?

499
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,670
They're just trying to get each other

500
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,400
You're right

501
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,840
Nakai-kun, that's no good

502
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,840
Nakai-kun, your butt

503
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,510
Show us your butt

504
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,080
Oh, shall we stop the cameras once?

505
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,320
Trousers around the butt area tore

506
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,930
Don't say things like "shall we stop the camera".

507
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,360
We're not going to stop the camera for something like that!

508
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,330
Why would we stop it?

509
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,200
Wait, I had nothing to do with that

510
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,140
That rip is seriously quite big though...

511
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,740
We're just going to carry on though...

512
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,840
Yeah, the whole way

513
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,740
Shit, it's really torn

514
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,910
Don't say things like "Let's pause once".

515
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,550
The vehicle where the guys try to get each other...

516
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:37,820
The laughter assassins lie ahead

517
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:37,820
and finally reveal themselves

518
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,860
Now finally, the laughter assassins reveal themselves.

519
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,760
Man, seriously I am so nervous

520
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,630
Arrived at bus stop

521
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,270
Dokonjo Gaeru Theme song

522
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,680
Goriraimo

523
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,680
Himura Yuuki

524
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,680
Kyouko-chan

525
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,680
Ocarina

526
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,120
Have you spoken to Hiroshi about "that thing"?

527
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,750
Have you spoken to Hiroshi about "that thing"?

528
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,950
I haven't got the courage to tell Hiroshi-kun...

529
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,990
Because he would definitely be upset...

530
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,590
If he finds out I only have a month to live...

531
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,600
That might be true, but you have to tell him

532
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:20,670
Dokonjo Gaeru Story

533
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:20,670
Kyouko-chan has only 1 month left to live

534
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,670
But I've actually invited Hiroshi out here...

535
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,770
So you have to tell him when he comes

536
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,200
Hiroshi will be here any minute...

537
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,370
Hiroshi

538
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,370
Yoshikazu Ebisu

539
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,210
Kyouko-chan, it's been a while.

540
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,880
What a face...

541
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,120
Reading the script

542
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,750
Learn it, for God's sake...

543
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,320
What a great face...

544
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,620
You have to learn your lines...

545
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,960
Hiroshi, sit here...

546
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,330
Please don't be surprised and just listen to me...

547
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,130
The truth is I...

548
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,570
I only have 1 month left to live...

549
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,670
What, is that true?

550
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,870
Well, Hiroshi? Listen up.

551
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,040
Kyouko-chan was thinking about you and didn't tell you about her illness

552
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,280
I had no idea that Kyouko-chan was ill

553
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
What should I do...Pyon kichi?

554
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,280
What should I do... Pyon kichi?

555
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,520
Hehehehehehe

556
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,190
Awful

557
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,560
Seriously... What the hell?

558
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,330
Come on, let's do our best

559
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,940
What's wrong, Hiroshi?

560
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,510
Hehehehehe

561
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,240
What's wrong, Hiroshi?

562
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,240
Umm I...

563
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,240
What is it?

564
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,680
Kyouko-chan, the truth is

565
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,610
Kyouko-chan, the truth is

566
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,780
I reallylike you

567
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,450
I really like you,

568
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,720
Kyouko-chan

569
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,520
You said it, well done!

570
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,260
Hehehehehehehe

571
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,490
What the hell is going on?

572
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,860
What's going on?

573
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,870
What the hell?

574
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,870
Please do it properly...

575
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,670
I don't know what's going on... What's wrong with him?

576
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,740
He's not serious at all

577
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,610
Hug her tight, Hiroshi!

578
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,380
Gyuu!

579
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,550
Hehehe

580
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,550
Oh no, Kyouko-chan's condition has...

581
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,850
Kyouko-chan's condition has worsened!

582
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,320
Hiroshi-kun...

583
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:26,890
Dokonjo Gaeru Story

584
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:26,890
Kyouko-chan's condition has drastically changed

585
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,320
I don't want to die!

586
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,690
Kyouko-chan!

587
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,360
Kyouko-channnnn!

588
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,760
This is not the time to be crying, guys!

589
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,330
Gorou

590
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,330
Wakabayashi Masayasu

591
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,330
It's too early to give up

592
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,600
Kyouko-chan

593
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,470
is on the verge of life and death.

594
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,600
Let's make Kyouko-chan's wishes come true

595
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,210
and give her will to carry on living

596
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:47,180
Dokonjo Gaeru Story

597
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:47,180
Make Kyouko-chan's wishes come true

598
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,770
and give her will to carry on living

599
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,780
Let's make a miracle happen!

600
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,680
I want to have my first kiss!

601
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,680
Your first kiss?

602
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,720
Kyouko-chan's wish

603
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,720
She wants to have her first kiss

604
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,980
Her wish is to have her first kiss...

605
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,220
There are 6 guys right in front of us

606
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,060
So out of these 6

607
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,060
Choose who you want to have your first kiss with

608
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,060
Go in front of the guy you want to kiss and close your eyes

609
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,670
And since your life depends on it

610
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:14,470
Method of getting her first kiss

611
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:14,470
Stand in front of the guy she wants to kiss and close her eyes

612
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,000
The guy who you stand in front of with your eyes closed will want to kiss you anyway.

613
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,570
Kyouko-chan, choose your guy

614
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,180
It's your first kiss, so take your time in choosing

615
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,180
Really look at them...

616
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,060
Take your time choosing...

617
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,560
She's looking at him...

618
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,760
She just tipped his hat to the side..

619
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,530
Oh...

620
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,500
She closed her eyes!!

621
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Her first kiss will be with Hamada

622
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,700
It's probably because of his lips

623
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,710
It's probably because of his lips

624
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,440
This guy with the lips will kiss you, I'm sure

625
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,410
This guy with the lips will kiss you, I'm sure

626
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,080
I'm sure he will

627
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,190
She smiled a little bit there...

628
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,690
She smiled a little bit there...

629
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,530
That was great, huh?

630
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,800
Why me?

631
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,930
That's great, huh?

632
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Ouch, that looked bad

633
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,210
I'm so happy for you

634
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,410
Kyouko-chan, you will never get another chance like this

635
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,410
Why don't you kiss one more guy?

636
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,410
But get one with

637
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,550
some real passion

638
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,650
Might as well kiss one more

639
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,220
Close your eyes in front of them again

640
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,660
You're kidding me...

641
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,420
She really does like him...

642
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,160
You got thrown away...

643
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,130
Hey, she's gone over there

644
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,730
Hold on, you don't think...

645
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,470
Hold on...

646
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,470
Has she closed her...

647
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,040
She's locked on...

648
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
It is her second time...

649
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,070
That's right

650
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,880
She's closed her eyes!!

651
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:07,720
2nd kiss will be with Nakai

652
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,830
Her eyes are closed!

653
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,540
Yeah they are

654
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,220
Go for it, bro

655
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:03,890
Yeah

656
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,320
Kiss her for us, please

657
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,410
Her life depends on it

658
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,850
Deeper than the one before

659
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,080
She wants another one, huh?

660
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,950
That's right

661
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,320
Give her a deep kiss

662
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,000
Go for it

663
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,160
That's deep

664
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,970
Give her a deep kiss

665
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,440
That was amazing

666
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,310
You must be so happy

667
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,350
That was something...

668
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,050
Kyouko-chan...

669
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,850
That was amazing

670
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,480
You really did it...

671
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,190
That was amazing, huh?

672
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,720
We received a bit of hope

673
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,090
With this, Kyouko-chan...

674
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,720
Is that enough?

675
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,020
You must have gotten the will to live

676
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,890
You must have gotten the will to live

677
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,500
I...

678
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,300
Kyouko-chan's still saying something...

679
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,160
I want to hear SMAP perform live...

680
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,770
I want to hear SMAP perform live...

681
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:02,870
Kyouko-chan's wish

682
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:02,870
To hear SMAP sing live

683
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,540
You want to hear them live?

684
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,600
But we need SMAP to be here to do that..

685
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,070
We haven't arranged that though...

686
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,640
That's true

687
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,380
What should we do?

688
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,280
Hey guys...

689
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,780
He's here...

690
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,750
He's sitting right in front of us!

691
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,920
SMAP is here!!

692
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,790
SMAP is here!

693
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,020
And it's SMAP's leader who's here!

694
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,450
Oh wow, the leader?!

695
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,190
Please, Kyouko-chan's life de...

696
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,690
Kyouko-chan's life depends on it

697
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,500
Please sit here

698
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,300
And sit next to her

699
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,060
Sit right next to her

700
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,700
And please hug her for us

701
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,770
Please sit right next to her and sing for her...

702
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,040
Please

703
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,770
Music Start!!

704
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,110
Music Start!!

705
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:44,010
Lion Heart - SMAP

706
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:00,330
Fujiwara suddenly cut in

707
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,100
What the hell

708
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,100
You're going to fucking sing it?

709
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,610
This is like a "You're going to sing it?" series...

710
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,250
I knew Fujiwara-san stood up and all...

711
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:18,480
When the hell did you get there?

712
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,350
Okay, here we go

713
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:31,730
Lion Heart - SMAP

714
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,590
God, she's annoying

715
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,100
You can hear everything...

716
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,550
I will sing now...

717
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:57,020
You are always my medicine box

718
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:03,930
SMAP Leader - No volume at all

719
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,120
You heal any pain

720
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,230
That I am in

721
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,630
What can I do with

722
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,500
ordinary love?

723
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,610
To protect you, that's what I was born for

724
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,670
It's not good at all

725
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,170
It's their song as well

726
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,310
Singing it in such a weird way the whole time

727
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,350
I'll be by your side even when you get sick of me

728
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,720
God, he's so shitty

729
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,420
As I watch you sleep, my heart shakes, Lion Heart

730
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,060
He's so shit...

731
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,800
This is the worst

732
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,830
This is just ridiculous

733
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:46,740
Again?

734
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,910
If we ever

735
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,510
Goriraimo now cuts in

736
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,710
have a kid together

737
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,380
He's quite good...

738
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,310
I will tell the kid that it

739
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,850
You're kidding me, right?

740
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:01,250
What world is this?

741
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,980
is the 2nd most precious thing to me in the world

742
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,420
You will also at some point

743
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,030
Gorou now cuts in...

744
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,360
meet someone you love

745
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,860
God, he's shit as well

746
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,200
Just like I did

747
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,770
This is awful...

748
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,230
When I met your mother

749
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,470
This really was bad

750
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,300
A past full of lies

751
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:24,040
Now Hiroshi cuts in

752
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,170
and false love

753
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,340
I'll bury everything

754
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,710
Awful

755
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,080
all those things we lost

756
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:33,550
A SMAP group has been made!!

757
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,420
This is the worst

758
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:36,950
I'll be by your side even if you get sick of me

759
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,590
It's just a party

760
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:45,000
As I watch you sleep, my heart shakes, Lion Heart

761
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,740
Kyouko-chan's life has...

762
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,970
KYOUKO-CHAN!!

763
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,500
KYOUKO-CHAN!

764
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,710
You've gone and done it!

765
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,750
Why the hell is he laughing?

766
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,450
Why is he laughing?

767
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:11,120
Someone's just died!

768
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,890
Yeah, someone died

769
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,890
She just died...

770
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,860
Why did he laugh?

771
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,860
He couldn't hold it in...

772
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,600
If you were the real SMAP,

773
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,730
there's no way Kyouko-chan would have died!

774
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,070
You're a fake idol, aren't you!?

775
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,310
They're going to leave Kyouko-chan?

776
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,240
What's he going to do?

777
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,110
She's not dead at all...

778
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,720
What the hell...

779
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,520
This really is tough...

780
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,920
Yeah this is...

781
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,060
This really is hard...

782
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,290
1 hour since the start

783
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,060
Only 1 hour since the start

784
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:57,170
The smacks keep coming

785
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,100
Due to the number of smacks, the 6 do not crack a smile

786
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,870
Due to the number of smacks, the 6 do not crack a smile

787
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,370
However, the traps which lie ahead of them

788
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,840
However, the traps which lie ahead of them

789
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:03,140
The traps which lie ahead

790
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:03,140
will not go easy on them

791
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,970
will not go easy on them

792
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,540
Well, I guess you had no choice but to sing before

793
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,740
Well, I guess you had no choice but to sing before

794
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,080
Arrived at a bus stop

795
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:13,750
But I'm not sure why the others started to sing...

796
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,920
YOU GUYS, DON'T MOVE

797
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,090
Don't move

798
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,990
Tokyo Metropolitan 1st division: Shiroda Gorou

799
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,990
Kinoshita Takayuki

800
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,990
You're all here, yeah?

801
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,860
The other day, there was a murder case around here...

802
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:29,500
There was a murder nearby

803
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,830
According to witnesses,

804
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,870
there was a man between 40 and 50 years old,

805
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,140
dressed as a detective...

806
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:40,080
The 6 match the criminal's description

807
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,140
They were dressed like you

808
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,010
Come to the police station please

809
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,010
Hang on a minute please

810
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,120
Who the hell are you?

811
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,990
I'm Superintendent Ito of the 7th Division

812
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,120
Takanashi Rin

813
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,120
Tokyo Metropolitan 7th Division- Superintendent Ito Rin

814
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,620
The 7th division will also be taking part in this investigation

815
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,960
The 7th division has nothing to do with this

816
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,260
This is an investigation for the 1st division, so go home! Go home!

817
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:53,860
This is an investigation for the 1st division, so go home! Go home!

818
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,990
This is an investigation for the 1st division, so go home! Go home!

819
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,430
And we're saying we don't trust the 1st division!!

820
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,960
Who the hell are you?

821
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,470
Horikita Maki

822
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,470
Tokyo Metropolitan 7th division: Kinomiya Nagisa

823
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,030
I'm like her, from the 7th division; my name is Kinomiya Nagisa

824
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,670
For real?

825
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,240
They got a serious actress...

826
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:11,810
Seriously?

827
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,610
This is amazing

828
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,880
This is amazing

829
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,690
I'm scared, I'm scared

830
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,150
Kinomiya? I've heard that name before

831
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,790
Kinomiya? I've heard that name before

832
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:29,830
The female detective who uses some special ability to find the culprit, right?

833
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:34,400
When Kinomiya-san takes her headphones off and syncs with a person, she can read your mind.

834
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,770
What the hell are you on about?

835
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:41,540
Detective Kinomiya's special ability

836
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:41,540
She can read people's minds

837
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,370
Anyway, enough about that

838
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,340
I'm going to take these guys to the station, so move out of my way.

839
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:40,400
I got to go

840
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,100
Shiroda-san...

841
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:41,610
What?

842
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,810
You really think these guys are the ones who did it?

843
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,880
Of course they are, however you look at it.

844
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,980
That guy with the blonde hair

845
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,720
He's definitely the one who did it

846
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,500
Well, this would scare anyone...

847
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,330
I have synced...

848
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,330
Wait, what?

849
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:18,910
"Make it the exact same, will ya?"

850
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,880
What the hell you on about?

851
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,980
This guy... This October...

852
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,450
He bought a specially made cake from a store in Shimokitazawa

853
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,320
He bought a specially made cake from a store in Shimokitazawa

854
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,720
You're right, there are witness statements backing that up

855
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,490
You're right, there are witness statements backing that up

856
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,290
This October, at a cute cake shop in Shimokitazawa,

857
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:39,760
an out of place macho man was seen entering and leaving it

858
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,500
And the cake this man ordered...

859
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,430
No no no...

860
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:47,970
It was a full of love:

861
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,070
Please hold on a minute...

862
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,970
a birthday cake with a portrait of himself on it,  which was to be sent to his wife

863
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,000
Please...

864
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,540
Please hold on a minute...

865
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,440
Whaaaat?

866
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,680
It's not how it sounds!!!

867
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:53,980
Wow!!

868
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:58,880
She figured out about how Matsumoto is a loving husband

869
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,650
It's not what it sounds like!!!

870
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,810
That's amazing!

871
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,910
Wow...

872
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,980
Oh, that's why she said at the beginning, "Make it the exact same, will ya?"

873
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,850
Oh right, I get it now

874
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,850
Oh right, that was what it was about

875
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,120
I did not see that happening

876
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,320
That is a shock

877
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,790
I don't want her to look at me

878
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,090
That was unbelievable

879
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,630
Where did they get that information?

880
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,730
The information! Where did you get it from?

881
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,560
And on top of that,

882
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,970
He's been making appearances at Nakano.

883
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,030
You're right

884
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,770
You're right, there are witness statements backing that up

885
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,270
He was at Nakano Broadway

886
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,270
looking for a "Unagiinu" costume for his daughter

887
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:27,640
looking for a "Unagiinu" costume for his daughter

888
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,050
It took him a while, but when he did find it,

889
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,250
there was a huge macho man jumping with joy

890
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,980
there was a huge macho man jumping with joy

891
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:33,580
I'm hot

892
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:33,880
I'm hot

893
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,180
I'm hot

894
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,050
I'm so hot

895
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,190
Seriously, enough now...

896
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,220
No, no, no...

897
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,890
I see...

898
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,720
She is really amazing

899
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:46,030
She figured out how much he loves his child

900
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,890
Yeah, she is

901
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,730
She's amazing

902
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:49,670
This is not good...

903
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,370
Are you okay?

904
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,670
No no, it's not like that...

905
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,940
What was it about?

906
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,700
I'm so hot...

907
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,300
Okay then...

908
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,710
How about this guy?

909
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,940
Isn't this guy the one?

910
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,220

911
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,130

00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,830
"Living in Japan is actually not bad at all."

913
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,030
Haha

914
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,060
Haha

915
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,800
This guy's preferred location is the African forest.

916
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,840
This guy's preferred location is the African forest.

917
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,040

It is a specially-designated dangerous animal that inhabits wetlands of lower altitude areas.

925
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,090
That's what she meant by, "Living in Japan is actually not bad at all."

926
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:49,160
Reads the mind of a wild gorilla

927
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,160
What the hell...

928
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,090
This is a false arrest, right?

929
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,800
If you actually took us in, it'd be a false arrest, right?

930
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,800
That's true.

931
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,000
What about this man, in the middle..?

932
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,540
Is this man the perpetrator?

933
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,380
You're gonna get synced.

934
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,310
She's staring like crazy.

935
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:17,390
I have synced.

936
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,320
Good, good.

937
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,720
"Gee, I'm really fashionable."

938
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,260
"Gee, I'm really fashionable."

939
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,790
What do you mean?

940
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:28,530
This man's private clothes...

941
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,530
He himself thinks they look good,  but it's just

942
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:32,070
a shameless display of him being an ex-delinquent.

943
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,270
That's right, I have it here.

944
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,910
Despite being a super idol,

945
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:38,040
his private clothes are like those of

946
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,040
an unbelievably lame delinquent.

947
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,810
On top of that,

948
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,650
his junior who comes from the same hometown, SU of RIP SLYME,

949
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:46,050
his junior who comes from the same hometown, SU of RIP SLYME,

950
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:46,050
is dissing the lameness of his clothes behind his back.

951
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,150
I wouldn't want...

952
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,150
I wouldn't want this to be revealed at a place like this.

953
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:58,460
Sees through an ex-delinquent's fashion sense

954
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,560
The worst problem is the hat.

955
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,570
The worst problem is the hat.

956
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,240
Miss Kinomiya, this is serious.

957
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,140
This man wraps a bandana around his head and then wears a hat,

958
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,000
This man wraps a bandana around his head and then wears a hat,

959
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,810
a style that's been seen only on

960
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,810
Chage of CHAGE and ASKA.

961
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:14,080
Even on the internet, it's a hot topic

962
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:14,080
that he looks just like Chage.

963
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,150
He looks so similar, seriously.

964
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,480
She synced.

965
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:29,930
Reads his mind and sees through the Chage style

966
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,030
It's not that similar.

967
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,000
I see. In that case,

968
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,970
you have nothing to do with the murder case, but

969
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,230
come to the station with us for a Chage crime!!

970
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,130
come to the station with us for a Chage crime!!

971
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,100
Let's go!!

972
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,370
Come to the station with us. We're gonna question you.

973
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,880
Nakai Masahiro to be questioned by the police for a Chage crime

974
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,340
Let's go.

975
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,010
Wait...

976
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,010
What?

977
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,150
He's gone?

978
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,880
What's going on?

979
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,880
He's already gone?

980
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,650
Everyone, we'll be arriving at the detective agency soon.

981
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,820
Everyone, we'll be arriving at the detective agency soon.

982
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,960
What!?

983
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,960
Seriously?

984
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,930
The bus holding the 5 shows itself.

985
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,900
This, however, is not the finish line.

986
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:10,430
A New Battleground

987
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,400
It is a new battleground.

988
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,370
We're here!!

989
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,010
We're finally here.

990
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,410
The Do Not Laugh venue:

991
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,310
Gaasuu Kurobikari Detective Agency.

992
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:33,660
An epic battle with the laughter assassins begins

993
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:33,660
The detective agency whose foundation is mystery-solving and laughter

994
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,280
At this detective agency, whose foundation is mystery-solving and laughter,

995
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:33,160
an epic battle with the laughter assassins begins.

996
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,230
It's your wife's birthday?

997
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,230
Yeah.

998
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:40,800
Arriving at the detective agency

999
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:40,800
Arriving at the detective agency

1000
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,400
We're here, everyone.

1001
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,800
Then why didn't she...

1002
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,660
She was syncing with you.

1003
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,870
And you were yelling about...

1004
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,600
"This is embarrassing."

1005
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,600
"Stop it," you were saying.

1006
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,570
There is no birthday though.

1007
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,570
There is "no birthday?"

1008
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,570
How can there be no birthday?

1009
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:54,010
What I meant was I was feeling sorry for people who might be tricked into believing that whole thing.

1010
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:55,510
The loving husband completely plays dumb

1011
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,250
Let's go.

1012
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,150
A loving husband.

1013
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,150
That's a good thing.

1014
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,980
That's a good thing, though, really.

1015
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,550
This way.

1016
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,650
This is the detective agency. Take a look at this.

1017
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,720
This is the detective agency. Take a look at this.

1018
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,860
This is the symbol of this detective agency.

1019
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,560
It's impressive, isn't it?

1020
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:15,970
Detective Agency Founder:

1021
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:15,970
Suga-lock Holmes

1022
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,300
This bronze sculpture has

1023
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,500
a really profound legend to it.

1024
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,930
Can you wait there?

1025
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,070
He's not doing an explanation like he always does.

1026
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,210
He's not doing an explanation like he always does.

1027
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,910
Sorry about that.

1028
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:31,880
Transformed into a mini detective

1029
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Sorry to keep you waiting.  I'll be explaining this statue, so make sure you're all listening, alright?

1030
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,390
Who are you?

1031
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,460
It's Fujiwara.

1032
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,460
Come on.

1033
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,300
Fujiwara, you've gotten smaller.

1034
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,990
Yeah, he's a smaller size now.

1035
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:49,770
For some reason, Hamada gets smacked twice

1036
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,300
You hit my hand! What the hell, you fool!?

1037
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,940
This is the sshhhh...

1038
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:52,940
sshhhh...

1039
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:59,480
Gaasuu Kurobikari Detective Agency's

1040
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,480
bronze sculpture of Suga-lock Holmes the First.

1041
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,610
Hol... Director Holmes was

1042
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:18,600
Hol... Director Holmes was

1043
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,250
an American bus... businessman and... I'm sorry

1044
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,020
an American bus... businessman and... I'm sorry

1045
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,920
an American bus... businessman and... I'm sorry

1046
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:15,290
an American bus... businessman and... I'm sorry

1047
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,600
an American bus... businessman and... I'm sorry

1048
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,870
He's really similar to him.

1049
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,100
He's just like Fujiwara.

1050
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:29,810
The mini detective is faithful to the original

1051
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,100
Don't do the "I'm sorry."

1052
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,870
You can do it, you know it.

1053
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,870
You're saying it, you got it.

1054
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,880
You're doing fine, you're doing fine.

1055
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,450
Okay, bye.

1056
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,050
It looked like he changed...

1057
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,950
Transformed back to Fujiwara

1058
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,790
All right, let's go, everyone.

1059
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,790
He's totally different.

1060
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,730
Let's go.

1061
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,230
Their sizes are just...

1062
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,770
Gaasuu Kurobikari Detective Agency.

1063
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:57,770
Agency Entrance

1064
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,600
It's large.

1065
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,540
It's impressive, isn't it?

1066
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,540
Isn't this really large for a detective agency?

1067
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,510
This is the foyer.

1068
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,410
Wow.

1069
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,750
It's spacious.

1070
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,750
You're right. Wow.

1071
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,650
1F Entrance

1072
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,750
A detective agency...

1073
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:21,790
A detective agency within an immense building

1074
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:21,790
A detective agency within an immense building

1075
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:21,790
More traps await in the direction they are heading

1076
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:21,790
More traps await in the direction they are heading

1077
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,790
A detective agency with an unbelievably large property.

1078
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:21,820
Of course, more traps await them in the direction they are heading.

1079
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,460
This will be your waiting room.

1080
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,600
Let's go in.

1081
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,570
Let's go in, everyone.

1082
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,100
Whoa.

1083
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,240
It's started.

1084
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,480
Rookies' Training Room

1085
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,640
It's started.

1086
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,480
Take a look.

1087
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,810
This is

1088
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,810
the world famous masterpiece,

1089
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,450
the Hama Lisa.

1090
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,520
Masterpiece: The Hama Lisa

1091
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,520
Masterpiece: The Hama Lisa

1092
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,550
This painting has a market value in the billions of Yen.

1093
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,090
There are times when his face looks like that.

1094
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,790
He's not laughing that much.

1095
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,160
Uh huh. This is... right.

1096
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:01,100
He's not laughing.

1097
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,800
He's not laughing that much.

1098
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,700
Everyone, can you take a look at this?

1099
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,240
This is a bronze sculpture of the first Great Thief X.

1100
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,340
The first Great Thief X was

1101
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:11,980
The First Great Thief X

1102
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:11,980
The First Great Thief X

1103
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:16,550
the riv... eternal rival of the first director of Gaasuu Kurobikari Detective Agency,

1104
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:27,560
A master thief who was active worldwide

1105
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:27,560
The First Great Thief X

1106
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:27,560
The First Great Thief X

1107
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:27,560
The eternal rival of Detective Suga-lock Holmes

1108
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,080
Suga-lock Holmes.

1109
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,090
Director Suga-lock Holmes

1110
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,320
made this bronze sculpture of the first Great Thief X,

1111
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,820
so that no one would never forget the passion of being a detective.

1112
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,160
He's an enemy, right?

1113
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,890
Right.

1114
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,730
He's wearing a mask, but don't take it off, no matter what.

1115
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:35,770
He's wearing a mask, but don't take it off, no matter what.

1116
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,360
What?

1117
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,770
Don't take off this mask.

1118
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,070
Really?

1119
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,940
Will everyone take a seat?

1120
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,100
I'm gonna quickly go to the bathroom.

1121
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,540
Yeah, me too.

1122
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,740
I wanna go too, and it's hot.

1123
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,740
Also, somehow,

1124
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:50,750
before I knew it, my top has become

1125
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,750
really small...

1126
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,910
We don't really need that.

1127
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:56,220
His coat was secretly switched with Nakai's

1128
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,420
They gave him the wrong one.
That's Nakai's.

1129
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:02,790
They got mixed up.

1130
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,790
That was the one Nakai was wearing.

1131
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,500
Since Nakai was taken to the police station

1132
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,500
for a Chage crime...

1133
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,270
Why didn't you notice?

1134
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,270
During that part, when I took it off, they switched it?

1135
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:18,780
Detective Duty 2nd Hour

1136
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:19,680
10 AM. Material that is a yearly tradition begins.

1137
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,080
So these are the drawers, right?

1138
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,450
Ggff

1139
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,650
Well, according to the usual pattern, yeah.

1140
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,250
You were totally laughing just now.

1141
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,450
No, I wasn't laughing.

1142
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,450
Yes, you were laughing.

1143
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,190
I wasn't laughing.

1144
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,820
It's the drawers, the time for them.

1145
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,790
It's the drawers, the time for them.

1146
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,990
There's a DVD player there, Tanaka, so there's a good chance there'll be a DVD inside.

1147
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:46,170
Airport

1148
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:46,170
DVD Thai kick for 6 years straight

1149
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:46,170
Defense Force

1150
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:46,170
Great Prison Escape

1151
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:46,170
Hotel

1152
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:46,170
Spy

1153
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:46,170
Teachers

1154
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,900
Not this year again. There's been enough of that, come on.

1155
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,900
But I'm actually in pants this year.

1156
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,900
That's right. It breaks from the previous ones...

1157
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,900
Maybe something's different, you know?

1158
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,370
That's right.

1159
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,370
On the 10th year...

1160
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,240
I'm opening it now.

1161
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,610
See?

1162
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,610
It's right from the get-go.

1163
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,980
Mystery DVD 2

1164
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,350
Right from the get-go.

1165
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,250
And it says "2."

1166
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,920
They will just not waver on this one.

1167
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,920
It says "2."

1168
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,820
Nothing.

1169
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,590
Is there a "1?"

1170
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,890
Huh?  Another one?

1171
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,760
There it is: 1, 2.

1172
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,230
Mystery DVD 1

1173
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,760
1.

1174
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,230
And a letter.

1175
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,230
It looks like a letter. What is this?

1176
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,840
What is that?

1177
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,840
There's  money inside.

1178
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,840
5000 Yen?

1179
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,850
One 5000 Yen bill

1180
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,210
He gets to receive money, then.

1181
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:31,510
I get to receive money?

1182
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,590
This is a first, getting to receive money...

1183
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,330
He simply gets to receive it?

1184
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,290
Aaaah!

1185
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:46,160
I've been saying to do it gently!

1186
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,560
He simply gets to receive pocket money?

1187
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,100
I simply get to receive pocket money?

1188
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,670
I simply get to receive pocket money?

1189
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,970
That's what I think.

1190
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:51,770
5000 Yen is realistic, too.

1191
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,400
5000 Yen is realistic, too.

1192
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:56,140
It seems like average allowance money

1193
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,170
It might be an allowance

1194
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:00,580
There might be a time to use it

1195
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,380
Then Matsumoto-san, please go ahead

1196
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,890
Nothing's there

1197
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,020
Oh, you're right

1198
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,360
"only the owner..."

1199
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:24,000
envelope that says "only the owner can look inside"

1200
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:20,560
It says "only the owner can look inside"

1201
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,030
So we can't look at it

1202
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,930
What does it mean by "owner"?

1203
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,640
Only Matsumoto-san can look inside

1204
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,940
Ahh it's one pattern

1205
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,780
Hey, don't look!!

1206
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,690
Challenge letter from Kaijin Nijuu Mensou

1207
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:51,830
Translator's note: Kaijin Nijuu Mensou is a recurring villain in Edogawa Rampo's books

1208
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,700
Starting now, a top secret mission will be assigned to you only.

1209
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,770
Do not leak what is written here to the other members!

1210
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,170
Oh wow...

1211
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,870
In under 10 minutes, led by your own words, make Tanaka-

1212
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,640
You're not allowed to tell us, right?

1213
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:14,320
Matsumoto, who talked about the top-secret mission?

1214
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,620
How confusing!

1215
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,180
What is the mission?

1216
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,120
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

1217
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,830
No no no no

1218
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,090
It's all just plainly written there

1219
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:27,030
If only they

1220
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,830
wrote the mission in red or something

1221
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,830
Yes yes yes

1222
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,530
Well I heard about doing something to me...

1223
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:38,810
Top secret mission's "make Tanaka..." is exposed

1224
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,040
You already heard it

1225
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,400
Right

1226
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,440
That's just

1227
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,340
No it said "make Tanaka..."

1228
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,110
We heard "make Tanaka...", and then you stopped

1229
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,810
"Make Tanaka...", yes

1230
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,680
So what happens to Tanaka?

1231
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:40,880
Yes, yes.

1232
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,750
We also heard something about "10 minutes"

1233
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,350
10 minutes, yes

1234
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:46,820
Don't worry about it,

1235
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:53,620
Matsumoto's own

1236
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:53,620
top-secret mission

1237
00:41:54,020 --> 00:42:12,140
a "big science shock punishment" will be enforced on you.

1238
00:41:54,020 --> 00:42:12,140
Challenge letter from Kaijin Nijuu Mensou

1239
00:41:54,020 --> 00:42:12,140
If you're unable to do it,

1240
00:41:54,020 --> 00:42:12,140
The clock behind you has already started ticking.

1241
00:41:54,020 --> 00:42:12,140
Within the next 10 minutes,

1242
00:41:54,020 --> 00:42:12,140
make Tanaka cry using your own words.

1243
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:21,420
clock behind him starts to count down

1244
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,190
but Tanaka is... but...

1245
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:30,860
Tanaka is really working hard...

1246
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,500
Do you think so?

1247
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,730
You're so insincere

1248
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:40,240
with your animal book

1249
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,200
Oh yes, I released that

1250
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,940
Published by Shougakukan, or...

1251
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,940
Actually it was Gakken

1252
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:47,340
Translator's note: Gakken and Shougakukan are two publishers in Japan.

1253
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,310
Oh, Gakken

1254
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,810
Such attitude!

1255
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,980
They seem like nice orders

1256
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,250
I agree

1257
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,450
Yes

1258
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,320
If I have any idea, I think that

1259
00:42:58,690 --> 00:42:59,990
he wants to compromise

1260
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,290
If Matsumoto hadn't said "make Tanaka...",

1261
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:07,500
he would pull everybody in different directions to make his target unclear

1262
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,060
This is written poorly too

1263
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,400
but, about that encyclopedia with Gakken...

1264
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:16,540
presented by Tanaka

1265
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:12,640
Did you show it? To your kid

1266
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,400
Did you show it? To your kid

1267
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,540
Yes, I showed them

1268
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,870
Oh, what did they think?

1269
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:23,510
They said that their perspective on living things is different

1270
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,820
You don't usually realize that, so

1271
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,880
It seemed like that, yes

1272
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,990
They thought everyone had the same point of view as them

1273
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:33,090
Sure, and when your kids saw your book,

1274
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:38,160
I think it instead changed the way that they look at you

1275
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,900
You mean with that book?

1276
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,730
Seeing your perspective on animals,

1277
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,100
and releasing a book that shows them, "Our dad sees things like this",

1278
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,040
changes the way that your kids

1279
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,310
see their dad, I think

1280
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,780
You figured it out by now, Tanaka

1281
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,980
No I really didn't!

1282
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,550
You definitely knew!

1283
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,790
You knew!

1284
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,290
You found out!

1285
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,660
No no no

1286
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:19,040
It seems like a difficult challenge

1287
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,530
Your face is just telling him to cry

1288
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,140
What a difficult challenge...

1289
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,810
7 minutes have passed....

1290
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:30,550
7 minutes later

1291
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,140
Things like, "Dad works really hard"

1292
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,550
They won't say that to you directly, but I think they're definitely thinking it

1293
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:36,720
Doesn't have an effect on Tanaka's feelings at all

1294
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:36,320
Matsumoto's words don't affect Tanaka at all

1295
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:42,160
Only time passes with such cruelty

1296
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:41,790
Time is passing mercilessly

1297
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:46,030
9 minutes passed

1298
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:49,870
but the Tanaka that's here today...

1299
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,870
you owe some of it to Endo

1300
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,170
Definitely, that's very true,

1301
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:55,500
because Endo told me, "Hey let's do comedy."

1302
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,270
because Endo told me, "Hey let's do comedy."

1303
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:59,380
I was able to become part of this world

1304
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,640
I see, so Endo is remarkable too

1305
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:15,360
10 seconds, 9, 8, 7....

1306
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,380
Endo, say something

1307
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,250
Endo, say something to Tanaka

1308
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,790
Tell him what you're usually thinking!

1309
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:14,260
You work really hard, thank you!

1310
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:17,690
I failed the challenge, idiot!!!

1311
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:20,460
Challenge Failed

1312
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,900
No, I don't know what's going to happen.

1313
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,900
There's some punishment

1314
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:24,900
He's here

1315
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,600
Wait, what is it?

1316
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,140
"Big science shock"

1317
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:29,340
"Big science shock"?

1318
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,740
I'm scared

1319
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:30,810
How scary

1320
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:38,280
*If you're not drinking it, absolutely do not touch the cup

1321
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:38,280
Big Science Shock procedure

1322
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:38,280
Slowly take a drink

1323
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:38,280
You must hold the silver part of the cup.

1324
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,510
Oh wow, it seems scary

1325
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,550
How scary!!

1326
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:40,050
It says he has to drink it

1327
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,720
I would hate to do this

1328
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,390
Am I gonna die?

1329
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,950
It says "shock"

1330
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,260
I wouldn't wanna do this

1331
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,790
Please don't die

1332
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,660
Please, we're asking you

1333
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,500
This is scary...

1334
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,400
I don't know what will happen

1335
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:05,410
*If you're not drinking it, absolutely do not touch the cup

1336
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:05,410
Big Science Shock procedure

1337
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:05,410
Slowly take a drink.

1338
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:05,410
You must hold the silver part of the cup.

1339
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,100
What does it mean by "science shock"?

1340
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:05,310
So first, hold the silver part - wait are you drinking both or just one?

1341
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:09,150
Anybody who is not drinking it can absolutely not touch the cup

1342
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,750
It doesn't specify if you drink one or two cups

1343
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,520
The silver part, right

1344
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:16,520
how scary...

1345
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:19,160
I'm REALLY scared right now

1346
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:19,660
The color bothers me...

1347
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,460
The scent is very minty

1348
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:23,490
Yes

1349
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,260
It's very strong

1350
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,300
"Drink it slowly"

1351
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,500
OWWWW!

1352
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,540
OWWWW!

1353
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,810
OWWWW!

1354
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,440
OUUUUUUCH!!

1355
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:44,650
MY LIPS HURT!!

1356
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,990
MY LIPS HURT! OUCH

1357
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,790
This is the worst!

1358
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,860
My lips hurt! My lips hurt!

1359
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:58,030
Science Shock

1360
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:58,030
very powerful static electricity

1361
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:59,530
MY LIPS HURT!!

1362
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:02,570
They're tingling! My lips really hurt!!

1363
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,970
OW OW OW MY LIPS HURT

1364
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,040
Are they swollen?

1365
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,410
They're swollen, aren't they!?

1366
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,340
My lips are swollen right now, aren't they!?

1367
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,310
OUCH

1368
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,680
They look really swollen!!

1369
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:20,650
What is this?

1370
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,150
What is this?

1371
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:26,320
So it shocked you?

1372
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,660
Like "BANG"

1373
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,420
Yes

1374
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,420
Yes

1375
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,960
My lips are swollen aren't they?

1376
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,830
No seriously, my lips are swollen, aren't they?

1377
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:35,930
No, they're not swollen

1378
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:36,930
Is it naturally like that?

1379
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,530
Right there?

1380
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,440
No, they're just shaped like that

1381
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,670
My lips are super swollen

1382
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:50,450
Then why are there two cups?

1383
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,180
In case you mess up

1384
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,650
Try it then

1385
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,390
Absolutely not

1386
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,390
Absolutely not

1387
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:01,690
Absolutely not

1388
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,360
After seeing that,

1389
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,230
Definitely not!

1390
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:05,230
there's no way we would do it

1391
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,430
He was plainly laughing

1392
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:11,730
It spilled everywhere

1393
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,840
How many years have you been doing this?

1394
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,040
No, so listen

1395
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,170
What exactly was your mission?

1396
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,170
What was it?

1397
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:21,110
In 10 minutes,

1398
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:28,450
In 10 minutes, make Tanaka cry

1399
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:28,450
Top-secret mission:

1400
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:28,450
using your own words

1401
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:23,710
using your own words,

1402
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,710
Yes...

1403
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:25,350
make Tanaka cry

1404
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:26,680
Make him cry?

1405
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:27,320
Make me cry!?

1406
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:31,820
That is very difficult

1407
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:33,990
I thought I got pretty far

1408
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,730
No, I wasn't close at all

1409
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,370
Excuse me, but you weren't close at all

1410
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,500
AAAAHHH!!!

1411
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:53,740
I TOLD YOU TO DO IT GENTLYYYY!!!

1412
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:57,450
They've been on duty for 2 hours and 30 minutes

1413
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:01,150
On duty for 2 hours and 30 minutes

1414
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:01,120
They are still experiencing surprises from the drawers

1415
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,120
I really felt like

1416
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:08,520
it felt like my lips got smashed by a piano lid

1417
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:10,990
Shozo, open yours up

1418
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,430
It's here

1419
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,330
What!?

1420
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:18,030
Again, this pattern

1421
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:22,040
We know everything...

1422
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:25,980
envelope that says "we know everything"

1423
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,810
Look in the other ones

1424
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,940
Every single year, it's this pattern

1425
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:29,350
Especially since we're detectives this year

1426
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,050
Ahh, these ones, right?

1427
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:34,450
"We know everything" pattern?

1428
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,350
Oh yeah, we are detectives

1429
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:35,990
Yes

1430
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:38,850
They've investigated for a year...

1431
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:39,660
Again...

1432
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,560
What is this again?

1433
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:51,630

00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,430
Um, not Monday...

1436
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:44,460
What was it again?

1437
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,700
Monday is M-O-...

1438
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,630
M-O-N-....oh, that's "Mon"

1439
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,940
This is just ridiculous

1440
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,940
Seriously though?

1441
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,440
M-O-N is pronounced, "m-oh-n" right?

1442
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,850
Say it properly

1443
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,850
That's not how you say it

1444
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:03,550
Properly

1445
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:04,450
Say it properly

1446
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:11,250

That's not how you say it

1450

Like the word "massage"*...

1451
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:11,250
*Note: The particular word he uses (momu) with his hand movement suggests a groping-like action

1452
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:11,250
Massaging...

1453
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,720
Hamada-san is laughing too, you know

1454
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,630
How... How did you get that?

1455
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,930
Oh come on... Stop it

1456
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:23,770
Don't make that face, Endo

1457
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,540
I mean, wouldn't you just read it phonetically?

1458
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:29,300
M-O-N is how it's spelled, so isn't it "MOH-nday*"?

1459
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:31,310
*Note: In Japanese, they imitate the Western pronunciation of "Monday", so in the Japanese alphabet, it's actually spelled and pronounced "Mah-n-deh"

1460
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,710

00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:39,920
The full story of Cocorico's Endo's "Joyful Night"

1466
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:40,720
What?

1467
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,020
What??

1468
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,280
Full story?

1469
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,620
Oh, it said "full story"

1470
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,620
Huh? What could it be?

1471
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,320
Well, we should just do it like last year

1472
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,430
Indeed, if no one remembers it...

1473
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:52,030
But for me...

1474
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,560
But see, right there

1475
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,100
Your anxious behavior isn't good

1476
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,800
The folded page right?

1477
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:59,330
Oh, it's this

1478
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:14,280
At the location of "The Legend of Momotaro",

1479
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:14,280
Big scoop!
4 pages in the fold

1480
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:14,280
You can't believe who Cocorico's Endo has targeted!

1481
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:14,280
the Demon of Affairs has appeared!

1482
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:04,210
At the location of "The Legend of Momotaro"...

1483
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,610
The Demon of Affairs has appeared...

1484
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:10,110
You can't believe who Cocorico's Endo has targeted...

1485
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:12,280
The Legend of Momotaro?

1486
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:14,280
Notes: Momotaro is a Japanese folktale from Okayama about a boy defeating demons with his animal friends

1487
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:14,280
Okayama?

1488
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:13,680
Must be Okayama

Who is this person?

1496
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:24,530
Oh right, it's the announcer person, right?

1497
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:25,530
You're in the picture together

1498
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,830

Feature announcer...

1500
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:29,730
Oh, an announcer...

1501
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,100
You exchanged contact info?

1502
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:32,670
Yes

1503
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,570
It was normal, just after work

1504
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,340
At an unexciting dinner meeting,

1505
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,340
The Demon of Affairs falls in love

1506
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,980
Pfft...

1507
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,780
This guy's plainly laughing here

1508
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,610
Hey now

1509
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:46,580
What?

1510
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,420
What is this referring to?

1511
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:52,820
You were seducing her?

1512
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,390
No, I wasn't seducing her

1513
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:54,820
I wasn't seducing her

Who is this?

1521
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,130
You know, I think this is something I shouldn't really say

1522
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:01,060
It says here, "Constantly text messages..."

1523
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:07,640
"But according to Ms. A, she only felt dread towards having dinner with Endo alone."

1524
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,510
"Only felt dread"? It says "dread," but who...

1525
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:13,010
"Only felt dread"...

1526
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,910
It's because you laughed! I only read it!

1527
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:17,010
No no no

1528
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:20,120
But me too, I only... I didn't...

1529
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:20,220
What? What is going on?

1530
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,520
I wasn't being persistent...

1531
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,420
Tell us what happened!

1532
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,850
What are you saying? You know what you did.

1533
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,220
You were seducing her?

1534
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:25,850
I was not seducing her

1535
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:26,960
I was not seducing her

1536
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,960
So annoying

1537
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,360
You were texting them

Actually, at this time

1551
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,910
the staff decided to try and reach out to her to make an appearance, when

1552
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,480
she gathered her courage

1553
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,640
come here on site for us.

1554
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,640
to hastenly

1555
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,710
Without further ado

1556
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:58,450
Ms. A, who Endo tried to seduce

1557
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:51,710
Thank you for coming

1558
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,180
Thank you for having me

1559
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:58,120
Firstly, we'd like to ask you why you agreed to making an appearance.

1560
00:52:58,750 --> 00:52:59,250
Well...

1561
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:04,390
I have my own position in society

1562
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,390
I was very unsure of what to do

1563
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,090
For myself, I thought

1564
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:10,100
For myself, I thought

1565
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,100
that I need to reveal the truth

1566
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,400
I decided to make an appearance

1567
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:12,630
I see

1568
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:14,170
This person seems like a petite and cute lady from this impression

1569
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,840
This person seems like a petite and cute lady from this impression

1570
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,780
Endo, do you prefer petite ladies after all?

1571
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:21,840
That is indeed my type

1572
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:21,840
Thought so

1573
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:29,850
And now, including Endo, the five of them look at the lady on the screen...

1574
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:31,290
They think she's a local broadcasting announcer

1575
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:34,660
They think she's a local broadcasting announcer

1576
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:35,220
But her identity is...

1577
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,290
But her identity is...

1578
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:44,770
Endo's ex-wife, Chiaki

1579
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:58,480
Assuming a female announcer

1580
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:58,510
Answering questions normally

1581
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:58,510
Ex-husband

1582
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:58,510
Ex-wife

1583
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:58,510
Ex-couple's exchange

1584
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:50,210
And now, we have the panicking ex-husband who thinks she's the female announcer,

1585
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:53,410
and we have the ex-wife, who is answering questions as if everything's fine

1586
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:58,110
Please enjoy as this former couple have a conversational exchange

1587
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:02,320
If you'd please, I'd like to go ahead and have a discussion

1588
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,580
What, I didn't hear about this, what is going on?

1589
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:02,920
First of all

1590
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:26,040
Endo Getting Pranked

1591
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:26,040
Thinks female announcer but actually Chiaki

1592
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:06,050
What was your first impression of Endo?

1593
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:06,920
Well...

1594
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,430
I apologize, but

1595
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,430
at first

1596
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:14,660
I thought of him as

1597
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,660
the guy in Cocorico
who isn't Tanaka

1598
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:21,700
In terms of impression

1599
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:21,700
I'd say it was going well

1600
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:22,700
This person says horrible things

1601
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:26,040
My impression was that he's

1602
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,040
a comedian who is actively
shown on TV

1603
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:26,640
She says some awful things

1604
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:27,410
Through work, huh?

1605
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,450
It seems that you exchanged contact details, but...

1606
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:31,210
And that...

1607
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:31,280
Not by text message

1608
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:33,950
It was a LINE* group actually

1609
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:33,950
Note: LINE is Japan's most popular chatting app

1610
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:34,780
Even now, do you still

1611
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:43,260
Endo Getting Pranked

1612
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:43,260
Thinks female announcer but actually Chiaki

1613
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:38,350
Even now, do you still

1614
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:38,350
converse over text?

1615
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:41,290
I think that Endo is

1616
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:41,290
is more of a sensible person

1617
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:43,260
Even now, I get

1618
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:43,260
quite a few texts from him

1619
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:51,900
Exchanges texts with ex-wife every week

1620
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:43,890
Eh~~?

1621
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,700
I don't, I don't, I don't at all

1622
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:50,170
Would it be possible to share with us any of your conversations?

1623
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,430
Yes, um...

1624
00:54:51,900 --> 00:55:02,740
Endo Getting Pranked

1625
00:54:51,900 --> 00:55:02,740
Thinks female announcer but actually Chiaki

1626
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:55,540
I haven't texted her at all, it's on

1627
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:54,840
Socially, well...

1628
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,540
LINE, it's all on there

1629
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:58,440
As a member of society

1630
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,440
In terms of our personal conversations,

1631
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,380
Endo's permission is...

1632
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,380
Sharing with you without

1633
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,740
not good, I think

1634
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,110
Then

1635
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:04,110
Then

1636
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,710
Isn't it okay?

1637
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,910
If it's no big deal

1638
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,710
if it's not something you're ashamed about

1639
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:08,380
It's not something I'm ashamed of...

1640
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,650
It's not really...

1641
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:12,890
How about Daikichi-san looks at it once?

1642
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:15,320
Yes, alright then, then if you could just show me...

1643
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:21,400
Can you promise that

1644
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:21,400
you definitely won't show
this to the public?

1645
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:52,930
Endo Getting Pranked

1646
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:52,930
Thinks female announcer but actually Chiaki

1647
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:17,130
Yes

1648
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,860
I definitely will not show this to the public

1649
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:21,230
She's so concerned that she doesn't want it shown to the public

1650
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:22,330
Then let's see

1651
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:23,330
But I don't think I really...

1652
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:30,540
Daikichi is being shown a text that Endo sent to his daughter

1653
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,930
But you haven't sent those kinds of texts, right?

1654
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,030
No way, I did not

1655
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,500
Are you sure you're not writing things like, "let me train you..."?

1656
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:31,510
No no no, I don't do that anymore, I've matured since then

1657
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,410
Hahaha...

1658
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:34,410
Daikichi-san?

1659
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:34,910
Yes

1660
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:44,950
"I love you" with lots of hearts

1661
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:44,950
Text to his daughter

1662
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,450
What happened? Is it funny?

1663
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:38,280
No, it's uhhh...

1664
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,610
I wouldn't say it's "funny" per say...

1665
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:41,720
It's a bit... um...

1666
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:46,460
There is more or less a

1667
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,460
conflict with the evidence...

1668
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,120
What do you mean by "conflict with the evidence"?

1669
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:48,820
Well, even so, yes

1670
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,930
This is not something to

1671
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:52,930
show to the public for
the sake of both of you

1672
00:55:52,990 --> 00:56:01,670
What a good dad!! It's a favorable impression so we will not show it.

1673
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,160
No, no no, no

1674
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,670
If it's like that, then...

1675
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:01,640
This isn't in a group, you guys are texting directly, right?

1676
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:02,500
I was seriously being deceived here

1677
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,900
It was in a group, but...

1678
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,010
But, um, at first it was just between us

1679
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:08,410
It started just texting with her and it turned into getting dinner and then it became a group chat

1680
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:08,410
Sounding like a real idiot

1681
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:07,610
So desperate

1682
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,750
For example, "Let's get dinner" was something that

1683
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,210
in the female announcer's perspective

1684
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:12,910
"I wonder if he sees me as a woman and is inviting me out"

1685
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:16,220
"I wonder if he sees me as a woman and is inviting me out"

1686
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,720
There's nothing I can do about that

1687
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,660
Directly, it's...

1688
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,520
Well, yeah, that's true

1689
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:24,590
By seeing Daikichi's reaction

1690
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,430
True

1691
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,260
It doesn't seem like that's it though

1692
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:27,230
And so

1693
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:31,030
Would you like to talk directly?

1694
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:31,030
With you, Endo and her

1695
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,630
Oh yes

1696
00:56:31,030 --> 00:57:11,510
Endo Getting Pranked

1697
00:56:31,030 --> 00:57:11,510
Thinks female announcer but actually Chiaki

1698
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,970
Ummm

1699
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:37,770
It's been a while

1700
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,800
Ah hello

1701
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,410
Ah, hello

1702
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:36,410
Hello

1703
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:38,940
It has been quite a while

1704
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:38,940
It has been quite a while

1705
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:42,410
Thanks for before, with um... You know

1706
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:43,580
Ex-couple's unnatural conversation

1707
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:50,690
I have my own position to consider

1708
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,920
Yes, of course

1709
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:50,690
So I can't really say much

1710
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:56,390
For myself

1711
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:56,390
I must speak the truth...

1712
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,390
Yes, that's understandable

1713
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:59,900
"The truth"? What exactly is that?

1714
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:59,530
The truth is... Um, what kind of truth?

1715
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,230
That is how she is, so Endo and everyone else

1716
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:04,400
This time around

1717
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:08,200
With the staff's

1718
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:08,200
earnest persuasion

1719
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,510
We have been given permission

1720
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,510
to show her face

1721
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:11,510
Wait, but this... No no no

1722
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,880
This is pretty bad, isn't it?

1723
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:14,880
Actually the truth is,

1724
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,380
she composed a letter

1725
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:19,310
in regards to your feelings

1726
00:57:16,380 --> 00:58:46,570
Endo Getting Pranked

1727
00:57:16,380 --> 00:58:46,570
Thinks female announcer but actually Chiaki

1728
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,120
It will be read for us in just a moment

1729
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,820
So Endo, please listen carefully

1730
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:25,850
And so, if you could please read the letter

1731
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,390
There's no way, I mean...

1732
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:30,260
This series of events is not right...

1733
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,260
This series of events is not right...

1734
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,260
What the hell are you saying?!

1735
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,430
What are you doing looking so serious?

1736
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:41,800
I apologize for deciding to

1737
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:41,800
make an appearance with solely my own judgement

1738
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:50,550
But there is something I want you to hear

1739
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:50,550
so I have come here to do so

1740
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:58,690
Why are you texting and inviting other

1741
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:58,690
women out when you have a girlfriend?

1742
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,690
This isn't a personal conversation we had...

1743
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:07,200
In general, in society, you should be more settled down

1744
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:07,200
You are a 44-year-old divorcé.

1745
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:12,430
"I've reflected on myself since the divorce and I'm more serious"

1746
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:12,430
Before, you had said

1747
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:17,570
"I'm a changed man"

1748
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:17,570
You've told me

1749
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:23,510
But in the end, in current conditions

1750
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:23,510
even though you hate being seen as a stupid person

1751
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:27,050
What you are doing is completely stupid

1752
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:32,720
From now on, the strength of your

1753
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:32,720
completely exposed heart of stupidity will never change

1754
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:38,330
Because of your carelessness

1755
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:38,330
I got called out to be on "Gaki no Tsukai" this year too

1756
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:41,300
I'm Chiaki

1757
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:41,300
Puu

1758
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,570
What the hell is this?!

1759
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,910
No way no way, what the hell is this

1760
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:53,110
No no no, come on now

1761
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:53,040
Gimme a break

1762
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,310
But you know, I was kind of relieved

1763
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,140
Gimme a break

1764
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:56,310
What the hell is this?

1765
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,920
What the hell is this?

1766
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:00,720
What the hell is this?!

1767
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,450
And now

1768
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,220
Chiaki-san has something to say to you

1769
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:16,330
Endo Getting Pranked

1770
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:16,330
Ex-wife Chiaki with an emergency broadcast

1771
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,720
You cannot leave the

1772
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,390
You cannot leave the

1773
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:07,220
Demon of Ahairs...

1774
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,390
Demon of Ahairs...

1775
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:10,060
You can't leave the...

1776
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:12,630
Chiaki!

1777
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:13,860
Chiaki

1778
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:14,760
Chiaki!

1779
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:17,770
Chiaki, you gotta keep it together

1780
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,470
Oh come on...

1781
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:28,480
Huh, wait, what is it that, what are you trying to say?

1782
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:27,410
Got to bring closure

1783
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:28,410
Bring closure please

1784
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:29,740
You cannot leave the

1785
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:32,650
You cannot leave

1786
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:32,650
the Demon of Affairs to fix itself!!

1787
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:37,450
Endo Getting Pranked

1788
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:37,450
Ex-wife Chiaki with an emergency broadcast

1789
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:37,450
Defeat the Demon

1790
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,450
please!

1791
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:42,720
Defeat the Demon of Affairs, Enforce Punishment

1792
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,630
What, what is happening?

1793
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:50,830
Dog & Pheasant Arrive*

1794
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:50,830
Note: In the story of Momotaro, his animal companions include a dog, pheasant, and monkey.

1795
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:46,530
What what what??

1796
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:48,760
Wait, in the end, I didn't actually have an affair!

1797
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,830
In the end...

1798
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:50,700
What?!? What?!?

1799
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:51,770
What?!? What?!?

1800
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:59,610
Enforcer of the punishment is the Monkey

1801
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:59,540
Whoa whoa whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!! No please, stop!

1802
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:01,510
Ow Ow Ow!

1803
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:04,780
Ow Ow ow!

1804
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:19,060
A monkey's Palm Strike

1805
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:19,060
Punishment for getting rid of the infidelity demon

1806
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:17,960
A Palm Strike, huh?

1807
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,960
A Palm Strike....

1808
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,800
A Palm Strike from a Monkey really does hurt...

1809
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,870
What the hell was that..?

1810
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:27,070
This really hurt...

1811
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,440
They've been Detectives for 3 hours now

1812
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,040
The drawer pranks are still not over!

1813
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:38,950
Oh yeah! Tanaka still has his!

1814
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:47,260
2 DVD's & A 5000 Yen Note

1815
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:47,260
Tanaka's drawer

1816
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:41,050
Go for it Tanaka. You're the only one left

1817
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:46,490
Tanaka's punishment has to be something original

1818
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,520
It seems that way now

1819
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,260
Well, it's a DVD again

1820
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,960
ACHOOO!!

1821
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,230
What's wrong?

1822
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:55,960
ACHOOO!!

1823
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,900
He's way too jumpy

1824
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,470
You're way too jumpy!

1825
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:03,100
Why are you so jumpy, Tanaka?

1826
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:05,540
Way too jumpy!

1827
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:06,710
It was just a sneeze

1828
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,110
How many times have you heard it before?

1829
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:09,940
Hamada's sneeze

1830
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:11,710
It surprised me

1831
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:12,880
I laughed from looking at his face

1832
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,780
Really?

1833
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,520
It's because I was focused on this

1834
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:18,350
Why'd you have to jump like that?

1835
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:19,620
I've seen enough already

1836
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:20,760
Anyways, I'm putting it in now

1837
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:21,490

A Thai Kickboxer comes out and kicks your butt?

01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:51,750

a Thai Kick boxer

When you're in town or at the office or at a ceremony,

1862
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:11,270
Mamoru-kun will protect your butt from any Thai Kick Boxer that you run into

1863
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:12,470
Mamoru-kun

1864

Thai Kick support as pants

1865
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,840
Using Mamoru-kun is totally simple!

1866
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:19,950
All you have to do is secure Mamoru-kun over any pants!

1867
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,120
And with just a pull of the red cord on the side of it

1868
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:29,060
The airbag inflates in an instant!

1869
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:24,950
The airbag

1870
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:29,690
cushions the Thai Kick boxer's attack

1871
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:29,690
The airbag

1872
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,000
Can just the power of air really protect you from a devastating Thai Kick?

1873
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:37,900
Can just the air really protect you?

1874
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:37,800
If there are people watching this thinking that

1875
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:39,100
You don't need to worry about it!

1876
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:39,730
An airbag made with special material

1877
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:43,140
The truth is that Mamoru-kun is made with a special material!

1878
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:43,770
An airbag made with special material

1879
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:43,770
This is terrible

1880
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:48,710
Mamoru-kun's airbag uses the same materials as a firefighter's protective jacket!

1881
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:52,810
Manufactured Country: China

1882
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:52,810
Material: 210 denier nylon

1883
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:52,710
Because it uses 210-denier nylon

1884
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:56,080
You'll be safe, no matter how strong the Thai Kick is!

1885
01:02:56,790 --> 01:03:16,440
This is a personal opinion

1886
01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:00,590
When I put on Mamoru-kun,

1887
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:02,860
the feeling of being safe from a Thai Kick boxer

1888
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:06,260
relieves my stress and lowers my blood pressure.

1889
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,060
I boldly...

1890
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,330
picked the denim type Mamoru-kun.

1891
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,530

If I think he's coming

2001
01:05:57,530 --> 01:05:58,430
Ah there's a note

2002
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:06,610

2004
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:04,070
If a Thai Kick boxer shows up, please pull the cord

01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:10,480
So then

2007
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:08,480
Won't watching the next video be alright?

2008
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,480
Won't watching the next video be alright?

2009
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:11,110
With this it will

2010
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:16,420
Mystery DVD (2)

2011
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:16,420
I wonder what this video's gonna be

2012
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:18,420
But I'm really happy with this!

2013
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:20,150
Mamoru-kun...

2014
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,530
My name is Tanaka Naoki

2015
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,260
I'm just an uninteresting man that works at a detective agency

2016
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:34,770
Today, I'll tell you about a famous detective case

2017
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:43,910
"The Murder of Don Kong"

2018
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:43,910
Animation: Studio House

2019
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:43,910
Character Design: Yuuki Nara

2020
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:43,910
The Famous Detective Animated Series

2021
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,080
YEAH!!

2022
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:51,790
Huh?

2023
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:54,160
Where on earth is my teacher?

2024
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:56,790
The match is just about to start!

2025
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,960
OUT THE WAY!

2026
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:07,140
With the face of a mountain gorilla

2027
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,940
This man is the famous detective I respect

2028
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:11,940
Hamadaichi Kousuke!

2029
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:14,940
Carrying in his hand his trademarked blue pillow

2030
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:18,380
As proof that he has severe hemorrhoids

2031
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:20,950
Sorry, were you waiting?

2032
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,220
Thank you all for waiting for this big event!

2033
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:24,450
From now on

2034
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,190
The World Heavyweight title match will begin!

2035
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,530
Let me introduce you to the reigning champion!

2036
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:34,030
In the red corner!

2037
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:37,070
A real Black Japanese man born in Kyushu!

2038
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,130
The Wild Tonkotsu Engine!

2039
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:41,900
He came from hell like Jason Voorhees!

2040
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:47,580
Sugapro Creed!

2041
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,110
Sugapro!!

2042
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:50,240
Get him!

2043
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:53,350
And now for his challenger!

2044
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:55,250
In the blue corner!

2045
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:57,620
The Japanese Chuck Wilson!

2046
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:00,520
A man that will only drink room temperature water!

2047
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:02,490
He came from the planet Jintan

2048
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:04,490
The blonde hair prince!

2049
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,060
Muscly Matsumoto!

2050
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:11,170
Get him Muscly!

2051
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:17,000
This is ridiculous

2052
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:22,740
This is already too much

2053
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:26,850
Tanaka's chin is also a little too much

2054
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:29,080
Tanaka's chin is also a little too much

2055
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,380
It's a little much

2056
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:33,550
Muscly Matsumoto!

2057
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:35,420
Get him, Muscly!

2058
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,130
And the promoter for this match is

2059
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:41,030
Don Kong!

2060
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,960
DON KONG!!

2061
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,660
OY DON KONG!!!

2062
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:45,200
HURRY UP AND START IT ALREADY!

2063
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,200
Eh? What happened?

2064
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:50,840
Everything went black all of a sudden! Is it a power outage!?

2065
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,680
H-He's dead!

2066
01:08:56,380 --> 01:09:01,420
For some reason Don Kong had blood coming from his head and had collapsed on the stage!

2067
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,150
Master Hamada!

2068
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,290
Can I ask you something?

2069
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,090
Huh?

2070
01:09:06,690 --> 01:09:09,890
The cause of death seemed to be by blunt force

2071
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,890
It appears that he was smashed in the head

2072
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,900
If I were to guess from the circumstances,

2073
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:16,930
I'd say the suspects would be the two people in the ring as well

2074
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:18,030
The champion and the challenger!

2075
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,540
Champion

2076
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,540
Changing Room

2077
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:22,840
And so they went to get some information out of the two

2078
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:28,910
Starting with the world champion gleaming with a black luster of energy

2079
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:30,610
Sugapro Creed!

2080
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:32,450
Why would I do that?

2081
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:33,650
Wouldn't it be-

2082
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:43,320
Those wet tissues...

2083
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,660
Suga-san really loves them, huh?

2084
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:43,320
Suga-san really loves them, huh?

2085
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:47,130
Why would I do that?

2086
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,660
Wouldn't it be dumb if I did it?

2087
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,400
I was at the corner post when it happened

2088
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:53,870
It would be bad for me if the match was held off!

2089
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,670
Challenger

2090
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,670
Changing Room

2091
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:57,340
Next was the man with a suspicious mask and hat

2092
01:09:57,370 --> 01:10:00,610
together with a tight white tanktop,

2093
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,980
Muscly Matsumoto

2094
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:06,510
[note: from mukimuki, which means muscular or brawny; or from muki ni naru,
which means to get angry or worked up over something]

2095
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:04,650
Why?

2096
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:07,820
Why would I have a motive for killing Kong?

2097
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,020
Tomorrow,

2098
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:11,650
my favourite program in the world,

2099
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:14,860
"Tagawa Ebisu Casual Travelling" will be airing

2100
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:22,030
Yousuke Tagawa and Yoshikazu Ebisu travelling all over Japan via buses within a certain time limit]

2101
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:22,030
[note: ref to Local Bus Transit Journey, a program which feature

2102
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:18,160
There's no way I'd do such a sinister thing!

2103
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,830
By the way, if Muscly,

2104
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:21,060
does not use nose drop medicine, his nasal passage will be bad, and it seems, so will his mood.

2105
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,460
does not use nose drop medicine, his nasal passage will be bad,  and it seems, so will his mood.

2106
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:24,470
does not use nose drop medicine, his nasal passage will be bad, and it seems, so will his mood.

2107
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,480
They really look at the small details

2108
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:38,450
That's detailed!

2109
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:39,250
Really detailed.

2110
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:40,180
Super detailed

2111
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:44,920
Hmm...the both of them don't seem to be murderers.

2112
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:47,590
Who the hell's the culprit?

2113
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:51,630
It appeared!

2114
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:54,160
Hamadaichi-sensei's dirty dandruff!

2115
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,900
To have produced so much dirty dandruff means

2116
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,370
the start of great Detective Hamadaichi Kousuke's

2117
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:01,200
renowned reasoning!

2118
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,200
Footage of the crime scene!

2119
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:06,610
We should just replay the footage from the scene of the crime!

2120
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:09,110
That's right, we do have that option.

2121
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:10,780
Thus,like sensei had suggested,

2122
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,180
Thus, like sensei had suggested,

2123
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:15,150
we replayed the footage of the crime scene during the blackout

2124
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:18,750
And so,

2125
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:19,950
the decisive moment

2126
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:22,690
when the crime was committed was shown in the footage!

2127
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,030
The culprit is Tanaka!

2128
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:30,900
The culprit is Tanaka!

2129
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:34,370
We are the police. Move aside!

2130
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,000
Police Chief, if you please.

2131
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:39,410
Tanaka Naoki, for being a murder suspect, you are sentenced to receive a Thai Kick!

2132
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:42,110
Tanaka Naoki, for being a murder suspect, you are sentenced to receive a Thai Kick!

2133
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,120
But now...

2134
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:53,420
But now you can use it

2135
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:53,790
Please wait a moment.

2136
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,590
Let me pull the cord

2137
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:56,420
okay?

2138
01:11:58,490 --> 01:11:59,330
Oh~ it's here

2139
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:00,330
it's here

2140
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:01,500
Small, it's small

2141
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:03,360
Mamoru-kun is so small

2142
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,500
The airbag is smaller than expected.

2143
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,700
Wait a bit.
What happened?

2144
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,540
It hurts! Arghhh!!

2145
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:08,540
It hurts! Arghhh!!

2146
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:11,370
It hurts! Arghhh!!

2147
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:11,370
It hurts! Arghhh!!

2148
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:21,380
What's wrong?

2149
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,120
What happened?

2150
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,520
What's wrong?

2151
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:26,420
Are you okay?

2152
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:27,360
Are you okay?

2153
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:28,590
Are you okay?

2154
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:30,590
It reached the front

2155
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:32,560
Are you okay?

2156
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:33,660
Are you okay? Tanaka?

2157
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:34,530
It really hurt

2158
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,460
The kick reverberated to the front

2159
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,330
It hurts the most when a little time has passed

2160
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:39,770
It hurts a lot

2161
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:44,470
What the hell?

2162
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:48,510
Don't open your thighs so widely!

2163
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,180
Don't be so dramatic, you!

2164
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:51,510
Don't open your thighs so widely!

2165
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:51,880
That's...

2166
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:57,390
That's also no good, right?

2167
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:56,120
This...

2168
01:12:57,690 --> 01:12:59,420
What happened?

2169
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:00,760
Mamoru-kun is really small

2170
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:02,420
It's super small

2171
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:04,930
It's different from the one they were selling..showing in the video

2172
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:04,890
Whaat!?

2173
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:06,360
Whaat!?

2174
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,640
Matsumoto-san was the one who laughed the most...

2175
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,100
Yeah!

2176
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,270
This is no good...

2177
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:21,680
That's a defective product

2178
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:22,110
This is  no good!

2179
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,650
Even though the airbag they showed in the video was so big

2180
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:27,210
Why not call them up again?

2181
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:27,420
A complaint

2182
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:30,180
Definitely a  complaint

2183
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,020
That's...

2184
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,750
I should tell them right.

2185
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,420
Yes, it's better to tell them

2186
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:32,020
This is a little...

2187
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:34,020
I had better tell them about this

2188
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,460
tell them to  shape up

2189
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:34,790
Right.

2190
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:37,320
It's better if you use Osaka dialect. Really.

2191
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:39,030
This is terrible.

2192
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,130
Oh, they've picked up

2193
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:44,600
Operator

2194
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:44,600
Hello, this is Gaasuu Direct Sales.

2195
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:45,130
I just boughtyour company's product,  but...

2196
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:47,270
I just bought your company's product, but...

2197
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,200
Yes.

2198
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:48,670
This is awful. It was a defective product

2199
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:50,500
This is awful. It was a defective product

2200
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:50,500
Mamoru-kun

2201
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,570
I see.

2202
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:53,470
It's completely  defective.I wasn't protected at all.

2203
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:54,210
It's completely defective. I wasn't protected at all.

2204
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:55,810
It's completely defective.  I wasn't protected at all.

2205
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:56,240
Air... The airbag did not inflate completely.

2206
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,380
Air... The airbag did not inflate completely.

2207
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:57,380
Yes

2208
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,580
Air... The airbag did not inflate completely.

2209
01:13:59,310 --> 01:13:59,910
Please excuse us, would you tell us your name, please?

2210
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,620
Operator

2211
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:01,620
Please excuse us, would you tell us your name, please?

2212
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:04,750
I am Tanaka Naoki of Cocorico

2213
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:10,860
Mr. Tanaka you ordered "Mamoru-kun Mini", right?

2214
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:10,860
Operator

2215
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:10,860
Mr. Tanaka you ordered "Mamoru-kun Mini", right?

2216
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:13,860
No no...Not "Mamoru-kun Mini"

2217
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:21,770
Gaasuu Direct Sales' excuse

2218
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:21,770
Tanaka's order was for  "Mamoru-kun Mini"

2219
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:15,000
No no no...

2220
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:15,360
He did not say that

2221
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:17,530
He ordered a normal one...

2222
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,500
Not the Mini, not the Mini

2223
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,700
What's she talking about?

2224
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,940
A normal sized one...the regular size.

2225
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:21,770
I see.

2226
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:22,940
Our deep apologies.A new one will be sent to you shortly. Please wait a moment

2227
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:26,040
Operator

2228
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:26,040
Our deep apologies. A new one will be sent to you shortly. Please wait a moment

2229
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:28,480
so there was also a Mini

2230
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:28,010
so there was also a Mini

2231
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:29,840
Yes, yes, yes

2232
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:31,180
Isn't this good?

2233
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:32,480
Well, well

2234
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:37,720
We did not think there even was a Mini

2235
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:39,790
We were not informed of the Mini

2236
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,420
They've absolved themselves of responsibility

2237
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:41,220
Yeah, we were not informed

2238
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:46,060
Good!!

2239
01:14:46,230 --> 01:14:48,560
It's being delivered anyway, right?

2240
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,030
That's right. Yes, it's here

2241
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:50,330
Mr. Tanaka

2242
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:52,330
Well, I don't think it's the deliveryman's fault

2243
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:53,870
As for money...ah

2244
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:56,070
It's an exchange

2245
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,440
An exchange will do?

2246
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:56,440
Yes, that's right

2247
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:57,240
So a Mini and a normal one costs the same

2248
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:57,770
So a Mini and a normal one costs the same

2249
01:14:57,770 --> 01:14:59,740
So a Mini and a normal one costs the same

2250
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:01,210
Then, there would be hardly anyone buying the Mini, huh?

2251
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:03,410
Then, there would be hardly anyone buying the Mini, huh?

2252
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:10,420
The Thai kick's already over though

2253
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:10,420
Yeah, that's true

2254
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:12,820
I think there'll be no more...well, the appearance...

2255
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:17,190
The "Mamoru-kun" this time

2256
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:14,420
We can't confirm...

2257
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:15,860
I can't see the difference between the regular and the Mini from just the appearances

2258
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:17,420
I can't see the difference between the regular and the Mini from just the appearances

2259
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:18,560
No, but...

2260
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:19,960
I wonder why blue's the only colour left...

2261
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:21,030
Will the airbag

2262
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:23,600
Will the airbag really work...?

2263
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,070
Probably...

2264
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,400
If it works, will it feel totally different?

2265
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:28,070
I think so.

2266
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:28,740
Oh... that's good.

2267
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:30,970
It's just,  the Thai Kick...

2268
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,710
It's just, the Thai Kick...

2269
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:34,440
Yes, there are no more DVDs though.

2270
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:34,010
Yeah

2271
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:36,410
Mr. Tanaka...

2272
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:40,110
What is it?

2273
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:40,780
Delivery;  presenting a gift of apology from Gaasuu Direct Sales

2274
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:41,250
No, no, I didn't...

2275
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:42,620
Delivery; presenting a gift of apology from Gaasuu Direct Sales

2276
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:49,190
A gift of apology from Gaasuu Direct Sales

2277
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:46,390
Well,

2278
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:48,390
that's to be expected

2279
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:49,260
Thank you.

2280
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:51,590
They've made a mistake after all

2281
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,730
A gift of apology?

2282
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:55,200
Isn't that good?

2283
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:55,530
Yeah

2284
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,200
Hmm?

2285
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:06,910
What's with this mini fan?

2286
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:06,370
Fan?

2287
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,140
A letter came with it.

2288
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:08,980
Portable fan "Tsumujimaru"

2289
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,280
Portable fan "Tsumujimaru"

2290
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:14,050
Portable fan "Tsumujimaru"

2291
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:14,050
[tsumuji means a whorl or a swirl]

2292
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,410
Tsumujimaru?

2293
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:14,550
That's nice

2294
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:15,680
Seems like it's okay to sit here and

2295
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:19,690
just  push the red button

2296
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,320
well, it's a gift, it's like that

2297
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:21,190
I'm going to push the button.

2298
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:33,870
Wow! Cool!

2299
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,940
Awesome!

2300
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:36,300
Tanaka, Tanaka...this, this

2301
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:39,110
Mamoru-kun, Mamoru-kun

2302
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:40,040
Ah!  It came out from the front

2303
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,280
Ah! It came out from the front

2304
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,010
No no no

2305
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:44,580
It's the other way around.

2306
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:47,350
The airbag inflated in front

2307
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:45,910
What happened? You put it on the wrong way around

2308
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:48,150
Mamoru-kun's not supposed to be protecting that area

2309
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:48,720
Why did you put it on the other way around?

2310
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,820
Arggghhhh it hurts!!

2311
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:53,350
Too much

2312
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:55,460
That's gotta hurt

2313
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,920
We can see your crotch

2314
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:01,900
The place to protect is wrong

2315
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:01,400
Why!?

2316
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:07,070
Plus this too?

2317
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,870
And  now you're hitting me?

2318
01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:13,140
you're all worn-out

2319
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,510
Now it's inflated in front

2320
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,280
It's now a version for the front

2321
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:18,680
I did not put it on wrongly, right?

2322
01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:18,980
Yeah

2323
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,650
After all, the placement of the cord's the same

2324
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:20,510
Was it?

2325
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:21,480
It's in the same place as the previous one

2326
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:24,720
Then. it's a defective product  too

2327
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,680
Defective product?

2328
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:24,120
Yup, a defective product

2329
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:27,320
Even if you call,  there's no point

2330
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:28,290
Enough. I won't call.

2331
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,390
Isn't it better to call them up?

2332
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,560
No, I won't call them again.

2333
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:31,860
You should at least tell them that it blew up in the front

2334
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,160
You should at least tell them that it blew up in the front

2335
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:35,030
How terrible

2336
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:37,030
This is terrible

2337
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:38,330
I wonder why...

2338
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,340
Operator

2339
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:41,340
Hello, this is Gaasuu Direct Sales

2340
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,470
Um...The product and gift of apology arrived

2341
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:43,940
Ah. Might you be Mr. Tanaka?

2342
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:49,110
Operator

2343
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:45,040
Well, it's okay...

2344
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:46,610
Ah. Might you be Mr. Tanaka?

2345
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,610
Ah, yes, that's right.

2346
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:49,110
Our deepest apologies.

2347
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:51,680
The regular size "Mamoru-kun" was delivered

2348
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:52,950
The regular size "Mamoru-kun" was delivered

2349
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:55,550
The airbag activated in the front instead

2350
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:57,720
The airbag activated in the front instead

2351
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:01,290
Can we confirm if you are Mr. Tanaka?

2352
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:05,060
Operator

2353
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:01,290
Yes, this is Tanaka

2354
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:05,060
You ordered the "Mamoru-kun Front" right?

2355
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:13,570
Gaasuu Direct Sales' excuse

2356
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:13,570
Tanaka's order was for "Mamoru-kun Front"

2357
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:08,200
Was there such a thing?

2358
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,600
I didn't even know there was such a version of the product in the first place.

2359
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,670
I really thought it was a regular one, because of the Thai Kicks

2360
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:16,370
Our apologies.

2361
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:20,670
Operator

2362
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:18,140
We will now review your order again, so

2363
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,670
would you please hold and wait for a moment?

2364
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:22,680
They'll deliver again

2365
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:21,910
Wait

2366
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:26,850
No no, what does she mean by "review"?

2367
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,550
How the hell do you use the Front version?

2368
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,020
yeah, since Thai Kicks are always from the back

2369
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,590
Click

2370
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:34,390
She hung up

2371
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:36,390
She ran away.

2372
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,990
She ran away.

2373
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:38,190
We got fooled

2374
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:42,530
We got fooled

2375
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:42,860
This is terrible

2376
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:43,400
We totally got fooled

2377
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:44,400
This is awful

2378
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,500
Awful.

2379
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,130
Awful.

2380
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:46,800
Gaasuu Direct Sales is awful.

2381
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:47,470
5000yen got taken

2382
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:48,600
Yeah, they totally took that 5000yen

2383
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:52,170
Messing around like this...

2384
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:54,070
What is this? Seriously?

2385
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:57,340
It has been 4 hours of detective work since the start.

2386
01:18:56,110 --> 01:19:01,080
Detective work 4th hour

2387
01:18:57,340 --> 01:19:01,080
The newbies have no time to rest.

2388
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,520
Okay, everyone?

2389
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:09,720
Now, in order to deepen friendships between fellow detectives,

2390
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:09,720
a recreation convention will be held so

2391
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,930
Change into these jerseys  I'm handing out

2392
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:12,930
and we'll go

2393
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:16,060
Recreation?

2394
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:24,710
Recreation participation

2395
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:24,710
To deepen the friendship between fellow detectives

2396
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:20,200
Recreation among fellow detectives

2397
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,570
What is the meaning behindhaving jerseys of different colours?

2398
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:25,010
What is the meaning behind having jerseys of different colours?

2399
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:29,310
This is somewhat  scary.

2400
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:27,510
Meeting Hall

2401
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:29,710
Meeting Hall

2402
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:30,710
This is somewhat scary.

2403
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:31,850
What's this? I don't have a good feeling about this

2404
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,450
What's this? I don't have a good feeling about this

2405
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:34,620
Um... from now on, it's okay to laugh so please

2406
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:35,680
Um... from now on, it's okay to laugh  so please

2407
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,120
Um... from now on, it's okay to laugh so please

2408
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:36,250
During Recreation, it's OK to laugh!!

2409
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:36,250
Special Rule

2410
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:39,950
During Recreation, it's OK to laugh!!

2411
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:39,950
Special Rule

2412
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:37,890
A lot?

2413
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,220
Yes.

2414
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:39,890
So please enjoy yourselves a lot.

2415
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:46,390
We've waited for you!!

2416
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:49,400
We've waited for you, everyone.

Here, come over here.

2418
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,400
Come over here

2419
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,970
So that's what the colour of jerseys meant!?

2420
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:58,040
Come over here!

2421
01:19:59,140 --> 01:19:59,810
Oh

2422
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:03,880
I don't think that team is much better than ours...

2423
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:05,580
We won't lose!

2440
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:15,190
the curtains will rise to the challenge of an earnest game battle

2441
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:18,390
Captain, are you feeling okay?

2442
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,430

2443
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:19,260

2445
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,900
Exceptional promotion!

2446
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,430
Are you a detective?

2447
01:20:24,430 --> 01:20:26,230
He is a detective

2448
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:29,270
A few years ago, you were over there (as MC)

2449
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:28,740
Yes I was

2450
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,070
Don't mention my obvious demotion!!

2451
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:32,140
Don't mention my obvious demotion!!

2452
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:34,110
You couldn't prove yourself

2453
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:34,110
Yes, and

2454
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:36,780
There is also no HAPPY BOY this year

2455
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:37,580
Probably next year I won't be here!!

2456
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,580
Probably next year I won't be here!!

2457
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,320
The first event is

2458
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:45,790
Assistant

Train your disguising ability

2467

Changing Faces: 20 Looks!!

2468
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:50,820
Train your disguising ability

2469
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:50,820
Good!!

2470
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:50,820
I'm good at this!

2471
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:50,820
Yes!!

2472
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:56,060
In order to protect their identities, detectives must be good at disguising themselves

2473
01:20:56,230 --> 01:21:00,270
You will participate in a game that will challenge your ability to disguise yourselves

2474
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:07,310
The chosen representative from each team will have

to make 20 faces, with 2 seconds between each face

2475
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:19,750
Rules

2476
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,040
The representative from each team will,

2477
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,640
along with the sound of the shutter every 2 seconds,

2478
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,740
have to make 20 different faces

2479
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:11,280
They will not be allowed to look sideways or use their hands

2480
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:11,410
You cannot use your hands or look sideways

2481
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,850
Junior-san will compare the photos and judge which representative

2482
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:19,750
Junior will decide which representative

had the most variation

2483
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:18,190
had the most variation between their faces

2484
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:18,790
It's up to me to judge, right?

2485
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:19,290
Yes

2486
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:19,690
Understood

2487
01:21:19,690 --> 01:21:22,320
With that, let the battle begin!

2488
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:22,260
Winning team gets 10 points!

2489
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:24,320
CAPTAIN BATTLE!

2490
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:29,300
Miyasako Hiroyuki

2491
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:29,300
Okada Keisuke

2492
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:28,860
Thank you

2493
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:31,770
Miyasako can go first

2494
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:34,300
You can definitely beat Okada

2495
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:35,540
He (Miyasako) is pretty skilled

2496
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:38,140
He (Miyasako) is pretty skilled

2497
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:40,210
I have 2000 patterns

2498
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:41,540
He's saying he has "2000 patterns"

2499
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:42,510
How many patterns do you have?!

2500
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:47,280
I heard it as "2000 rocks"

2501
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:47,980
Matsumoto heard "ishi" instead of "ichi", making "patterns" into "rocks"

2502
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:52,920
First up

2503
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:52,920
Miyasako Hiroyuki

2504
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:50,180
Changing Faces 20 Looks

2505
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:52,720
First up is Miyasako

2506
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:55,990
Miyasako-san is very strong!!

01:21:53,090 --> 01:21:58,290
Practice Room

2508
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:57,420
Yeah, he is pretty strong

2509
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:57,420
I agree!

2510
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:58,860
They're all funny

2511
01:21:58,290 --> 01:22:01,400
Our captain isn't gonna lose though

2512
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:01,330
I can do it too, right?

2513
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,830
I don't really see you doing different facial expressions

2514
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,430
I do do it!

2515
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:06,130
For example, like what?

2516
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:06,130
For example,

2517
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:07,230
for example

2518
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:08,870
Oooh wow!

2519
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:12,310
you can't use your hands!

2520
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:12,470
Don't mess around!!

2521
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:14,740
That's a move!

2522
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,810
It's only your face! You can't use hands!

2523
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:18,550
So strict!!

2524
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:18,580
Do it like this!

2525
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:23,180
Actually I need my hands

2526
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:24,850
What's wrong with him?

2527
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:27,190
Miyasako-san, how are you?

2528
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:29,490
Okay, perfect!!

2529
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:29,960
Do your best!

2530
01:22:29,290 --> 01:22:30,960
Once again, here is Miyasako-san!

2531
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:31,760
How's your confidence?

2532
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:32,530
I am confident!

2533
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:33,560
Oh, he has it!

2534
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:35,900
What if you have to look like a certain celebrity?

2535
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,260
Yes, I have it

2536
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,670
And if you had to guess who that would be?

2537
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:41,200
And if you had to guess who that would be?

2538
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,500
I would say Jurie

2539
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,970
Sawada Kenji-san

2540
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:47,980
With that, let's get started. Changing Faces 20 Looks starts...

2541
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:49,210
Gaasuu Kurobikari Detective Office

2542
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:59,650
What about Jurie?

2543
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:01,660
Did he revert?

2544
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,160
You don't have many looks

2545
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,730
He had some

2546
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:08,530
There are 4000

2547
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,630
Oh, again again

2548
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:13,300
It's (Antonio) Inoki

2549
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:13,900
Inoki was a pro-wrestler

2550
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:17,000
Not enough faces!

2551
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,010
No no no no

2552
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:23,010
They're starting to look the same!

2553
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:31,350
This guy is terrible!

2554
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:33,750
We've seen these!

2555
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:36,090
Finally!

2556
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:38,090
Thank you very much!

2557
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:41,500
He made too many gorilla faces

2558
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:44,160
They're all different

2559
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:46,000
If you look at them you'll see

2560
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
What about Jurie??

2561
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:48,700
You used Jurie so quickly

2562
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:54,540
For Jurie, I wanted to use him later but it was impossible

2563
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:55,340
Just now, there weren't even 8 faces

2564
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:58,180
Just now, there weren't even 8 faces

2565
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:01,010
Please look at the photos

2566
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:03,020
They're completely different

2567
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:03,450
Let's take a look then, shall we?

2568
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,020
This way!

2569
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:07,020
Okay, good

2570
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:10,120
Completely different

2571
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:13,430
We already saw these

2572
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,530
Gorilla!

2573
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:19,400
That one was good!

2574
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:21,940
Very good

2575
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:24,240
Good good!

2576
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:26,710
Amazing development

2577
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:29,340
See, look at this one!

2578
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:31,610
There's barely any difference

2579
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:34,680
1 and 5 are exactly the same

2580
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:37,680
Please look at 1 and 5

2581
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,990
No, no

2582
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:44,090
5 is Kitamura Lawyer

2583
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:46,860
This deserves 0 points

2584
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:50,460
4 and 12 are also very similar

2585
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:54,270
The tongue!!

2586
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:54,270
They're different!

2587
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:56,040
That is a Okinawan Lion (statue),

2588
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,170
whether or not you're opening your mouth

2589
01:24:58,170 --> 01:25:00,170
These are COMPLETELY different

2590
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:04,180
That's Horiemon

2591
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:05,450
And, with that

2592
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:07,450
chance

2593
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:07,410
Captain Okada!

2594
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:12,790
Okada Keisuke

2595
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:12,790
Second up

2596
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:11,790
Don't mess this up!

2597
01:25:11,790 --> 01:25:13,520
He's our leader!

2598
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:16,720
His face isn't that interesting

2599
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:18,790
Please do your best

2600
01:25:17,390 --> 01:25:19,160
Go practise

2601
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:19,160
Go-

2602
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,130
What the hell?

2603
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:22,360
That's our leader!!

2604
01:25:22,530 --> 01:25:25,100
Are you okay? Leader?

2605
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:26,630
What is it?

2606
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:28,030
Does he have something?

2607
01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:32,240
That's just the guy next door

2608
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:35,880
Did he think that first one was funny?

2609
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,910
You can't hide the ones that aren't funny

2610
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,110
Are you ready, Captain Okada?

2611
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:41,820
He can do it!

2612
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:43,680
No, he definitely can't

2613
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,920
Hey Okada-kun,

2614
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:47,420
what approach will you take?

2615
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:49,820
The expressions are based on four emotions

2616
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:52,630
I just need to express those emotions

2617
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:55,000
What is there besides those emotions?

2618
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,600
Okay, with that...

2619
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,060
FOCUS!!

2620
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:00,730
Changing Faces 20 Looks... ready...

2621
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:10,540
The timing is completely off

2622
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:12,550
That's his normal face

2623
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:14,150
Can he even do this?

2624
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:16,450
Oh that one's good!

2625
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:25,060
That one is good

2626
01:26:26,190 --> 01:26:27,430
CHANGE IT!!

2627
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:28,560
PLEASE CHANGE IT!!

2628
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,570
I seriously wanna beat him up

2629
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:34,570
You can't turn your face

2630
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:36,570
I'm seriously gonna hit him

2631
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:39,510
Is this a joke?

2632
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:40,970
Are you kidding

2633
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:42,980
You already used that!!

2634
01:26:43,810 --> 01:26:45,210
No no you're kidding!

2635
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:47,210
I'm scared I'm scared

2636
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:50,420
That's 3 patterns

2637
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:54,120
Only the direction of his neck changed

2638
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,360
I got really nervous

2639
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:58,360
But you know, right?

2640
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:02,260
Thank you for everything this year

2641
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:04,560
But you tried

2642
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:09,340
You're definitely not going to get paid

2643
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:09,300
So let's check his faces

2644
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,300
This way

2645
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:13,310
This is his normal face

2646
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:15,310
It's his normal face

2647
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:18,610
Around 6 they're all the same

2648
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,950
He already did this

2649
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:21,280
You had this

2650
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:23,550
We saw ALL of these

2651
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:25,550
You did this

2652
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:27,550
So normal

2653
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:29,760
This is so bad

2654
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:32,490
You had ALL of these

2655
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:34,930
You did this, you did this

2656
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,400
You didn't change your face at all

2657
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:43,840
You're only moving from left to right

2658
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:47,070
Even early on, 2 and 3 are the same

2659
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:49,080
I'm so shocked

2660
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:51,950
17 and 18 too

2661
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:55,250
You didn't do anything between them

2662
01:27:56,650 --> 01:28:01,550
He didn't do anything for 4 seconds

2663
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:05,530
Do you have a gag along with this face?

2664
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:07,860
YOU...

2665
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:09,900
You don't have one!

2666
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,270
You're REALLY not going to get paid

2667
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:16,270
Now, Junior-san, please announce the winner

2668
01:28:16,270 --> 01:28:18,910
the winner is Miyasako-san!!

2669
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:24,410
Winner Team Miyasako gets 10 points

2670
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:24,410
Team Miyasako will now receive 10 points

2671
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:26,510
Let's put a limit

2672
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:29,980
I bet Junior is also pretty bad

2673
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:29,850
The second challenge is...

2674
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:32,450
Please demonstrate for us

2675
01:28:33,150 --> 01:28:36,390
J-san, please show us an example

2676
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:38,430
I bet it's gonna be funny

2677
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,630
Watch Junior-san

2678
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:39,990
No no, that's not-

2679
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:42,200
He can do anything

2680
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:47,400
I can't explain enough how much talent I've been saving up to today

2681
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:49,900
Up until now, it's just been the introduction

2682
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:51,810
He is a star from the same era, after all

2683
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:52,940
Right

2684
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:56,240
He's making one more anyway

2685
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:56,280
I agree

2686
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,250
He's into it

2687
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:03,550
Changing Faces 20 Looks, Junior version... ready... start!

2688
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:15,130
They're all the same!

2689
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,730
Scary scary!!

2690
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,440
BLEHH!!

2691
01:29:27,310 --> 01:29:28,910
Open your mouth!!

2692
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:36,520
This is-

2693
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:38,790
Why don't you change your face!?

2694
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:41,290
He was making kissing faces

2695
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:43,360
This is a game of changing your face

2696
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,360
Did you know the rules?

2697
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:48,960
Okada-kun, you're pretty good

2698
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,870
He even said that hands don't matter but he's doing this...

2699
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,700
I was about to throw up

2700
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:58,610
He tried to be cute

2701
01:29:59,370 --> 01:30:02,180
He wanted to be cute

2702
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:04,940
Who were you doing that for?

2703
01:30:03,610 --> 01:30:06,680
Yeah, what's with the trying to be cute?

2704
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:06,680
And who were you doing it for?

2705
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,550
Who was I doing it for?

2706
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:11,850
My wife!!

2707
01:30:12,090 --> 01:30:14,590
Right, let's check the pictures now, here they are!

2708
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:16,790
I don't really even want to see them...

2709
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:18,490
Wow...

2710
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:20,490
They're all the same!

2711
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:23,230
All of them!

2712
01:30:23,230 --> 01:30:25,230
Shit, that's scary!

2713
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,770
Damn, that's scary

2714
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:34,170
Damn!

2715
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:36,180
It's not changing!

2716
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,180
This is not good...

2717
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:40,710
It's all the same...

2718
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:40,710
Yeah you're right...

2719
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:44,320
It just looks like a curtain design

2720
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:44,950
It just looks like a curtain design

2721
01:30:44,950 --> 01:30:46,690
It just looks like a curtain design

2722
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:51,990
4 and 5 are amazing

2723
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,730
And 2 and 3...

2724
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:57,000
This is a commemorative photo

2725
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:57,460
It's so bad!

2726
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:59,070
It's actually amazing though

2727
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:01,600
It is right?

2728
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:01,630
Yeah, he literally has not moved positions...

2729
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,270
I did move!

2730
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:05,310
Please hold on a second...

2731
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:05,710
4, 5 and 7 please!!

2732
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:06,070
4, 5 and 7 please!!

2733
01:31:06,070 --> 01:31:08,370
4, 5 and 7 please!!

2734
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:10,480
It's the exact same!

2735
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:12,980
It's the 3 brothers!

2736
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:15,920
Their numbers increased by one!

2737
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:18,280
They're triplets!

2738
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:19,320
I don't understand the "expression" of that face...

2739
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,820
I don't understand the "expression" of that face...

2740
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:23,360
Next up is...

2741
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:29,030
Try and find out who is talking under the sweater!

2742
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,430
Find the man

2743
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,430
speaking under

2744
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,430
the sweater!

2745
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:40,710
Everyone on one team hides their mouth with a turtleneck sweater.

2746
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:40,710
One person speaks the prompt doing an impression.

2747
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:55,390
Rules

2748
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:36,270
One team hides their mouths

2749
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:41,110
and one of them has to say the word that is given to them

2750
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:55,390
If they are correct, they earn 10 points. If they are incorrect, 10 points go to the prompted team.

2751
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:55,390
The opposing team guesses who was speaking.

2752
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:44,780
The other team then has to guess who said it

2753
01:31:44,780 --> 01:31:47,850
and if they get it right, they get 10 points.

2754
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:54,950
If they get it wrong, the other team gets 10 points

2755
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:58,220
OK then, first up is Team Okada!

2756
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:00,960
Decide who is going to say the word...

2757
01:31:58,890 --> 01:32:03,500
First up: Team Okada

2758
01:31:58,890 --> 01:32:03,500
First up:Team Okada

2759
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,960
We will decide now then...

2760
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,960
This will be so easy...

2761
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,570
Bobby will be too easy to guess...

2762
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:11,840
So we can take two of them out of the equation...

2763
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,710
Captain Okada?

2764
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,710
Have you decided,

2765
01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:18,910
You have? Okay, if the other team could turn around for a second.

2766
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:20,250
Now then

2767
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:21,650
The person who will talk, please reveal yourself

2768
01:32:21,650 --> 01:32:22,820
The person who will talk, please reveal yourself

2769
01:32:23,150 --> 01:32:28,990
Person to speak: Bobby Ologon

2770
01:32:23,150 --> 01:32:28,990
Team Okada

2771
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:26,420
OK guys, turn around.

2772
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:31,930
Right then, Team Okada's subject will be this...

2773
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:34,790
It's Sakana-kun.

2774
01:32:34,490 --> 01:33:27,010
Sakana-kun

2775
01:32:34,490 --> 01:33:27,010
Subject

2776
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:38,260
Right then, let's get on with it...

2777
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:41,900
3..2..1 go!

2778
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:45,170
*&*&^£&£*£$&...

2779
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:47,840
Damn their voice is small!!

2780
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:49,680
I couldn't really hear...

2781
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:51,140
It's got to be Hosei-san or Matsumoto-san...

2782
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:55,150
It's got to be Hosei-san or Matsumoto-san...

2783
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:53,150
Please can you say it louder..?

2784
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:55,450

2785
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:59,490

2786
01:32:58,150 --> 01:33:00,490

Arigyato gyozaimasu!

2788
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:08,830
Bobby?

2789
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:14,270
We all have different opinions

2790
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:14,530
That's great, they're not sure at all!

2791
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:17,170
One more time

2792
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:19,110
OK, please do it once more!

2793
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:22,980
Arigyato gozaimasu.

2794
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:27,450

2798
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:39,790
Right

2799
01:33:39,790 --> 01:33:41,930
Who was the one speaking then?

2800
01:33:41,490 --> 01:33:43,830
And it was...

2801
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:45,830
BOBBY!!

2802
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:52,440

Bobby Ologon

2805
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:48,970
Bobby, you were awesome!

2806
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:50,670
It was Bobby...

2807
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:52,670
He did so well

2808
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:54,310
Yeah he was really good.

2809
01:33:54,410 --> 01:33:56,240
I was so nervous!!

2810
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:58,810
He was good, wasn't he?

2811
01:33:58,910 --> 01:34:01,210
WASN'T HE!?

2812
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:04,380
What is he on about?..

2813
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:06,050
Right, Team Miyasako, please decide who will speak for you

2814
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:14,060
Medama Oyaji

2815

01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:14,060
Team Miyasako

01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:13,630
He will speak as Medama Oyaji from Gegege no Kitaro.

2820
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:45,930
Medama Oyaji

2821
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:45,930
Subject

2822
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:17,430
Right then, the subject is Medama Oyaji

2823
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:19,670
You can't cheat and speak together, okay?

2824
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,530
Yeah

2825
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:21,970
Right then, Medama Oyaji in

2826
01:34:21,970 --> 01:34:25,170

2827
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:33,450
You're meant to be Medama Oyaji...

Medama Oyaji please

2830
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:39,150
We have to be able to hear what you're saying..

2831
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:41,520
...rou

2832
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,760
Only one person is meant to speak, you know?..

2833
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,930
More than one person just spoke!!

2834
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:46,730
HEY!!

2835
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:48,700
That's not right!!

2836
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:51,730
Hey, you!

2837
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:54,230
What the hell are you doing!?

2838
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:56,340
What the hell are you doing!?

2839
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:56,340
This guy...

2840
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:58,500
This guy wasn't the person who was meant to talk

2841
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,440
and he just accidentally spoke...

2842
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:02,980
Damn...

2843
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:06,280
Hamada-san!

2844
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:08,480
Please get yourself together!!

2845
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:10,850
Damn, that was a shock!

2846
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:12,950
He wasn't meant to say anything

2847
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:12,950
And they knew it was you speaking...

2848
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:13,750
Yeah, I thought straight away "It's Hamada"...

2849
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:16,960
Yeah, I thought straight away "It's Hamada"...

2850
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:21,060
He just said  "rou"..

2851
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:27,500
Funashii

2852
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:27,500
Subject:

2853
01:35:21,690 --> 01:35:24,760
The guys get themselves together, Fujimoto will now speak

2854
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:27,500
Person to speak : Fujimoto Toshifumi

2855
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:27,500
Team Miyasako

2856
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:27,430
His subject is funashii

2857
01:35:27,500 --> 01:36:04,400
Funashii

2858
01:35:27,500 --> 01:36:04,400
Subject

2859
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:33,210
OK then, let's hear Funashii then...

2860
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:36,410
I think it was Fujimon...

2861
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:38,810
I think it was Fujimon...

2862
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:41,310
Can you speak a little bit more...

2863
01:35:40,350 --> 01:35:41,310
Yeah okay

01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:42,150
Please say "Nashijiru Bushaa"

2865
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:44,650
Please say "Nashijiru Bushaa"

2866
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:47,350
Okay, go ahead!

2867
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,830
Hamada-san just

2868
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:54,830
don't bother trying...

2869
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:55,430
No one thinks at all that you're doing it!!

2870
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:57,960
No one thinks at all that you're doing it!!

2871
01:35:59,370 --> 01:36:01,370
We don't need your little tricks...

2872
01:36:00,530 --> 01:36:02,030
Yeah, it's never going to be him...

2873
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:03,670
Right then, are we good?

2874
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:05,340
You've decided?

2875
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:08,040
Fujimon

2876
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:14,810
Team Okada get 10 points!

2877
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:19,020
Team Okada get 10 points

2878
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:17,450
I mean...

2879
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:19,450
Because of Hamada-san's slip up...

2880
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:24,060
I don't think anything we would have done would have worked...

2881
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:30,900
12:30pm- 4 hours 30 minutes since the start

2882
01:36:35,570 --> 01:36:37,140
Guys

2883
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:41,870
Our chief inspector

2884
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:40,840

2885
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:41,870

2886
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:43,280
So let's all go and say hello to him

2887
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:46,750
The chief, huh?

2888
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:54,250
The legendary detective

2889
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:54,250
They will now go and greet him

2890
01:36:47,950 --> 01:36:51,450
They now go to see the legendary detective

2891
01:36:51,450 --> 01:36:54,250
Who is this person?

2892
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,890
This is the chief's room right here.

2893
01:36:56,890 --> 01:37:00,230
Don't be rude to him, okay?

2894
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:00,560
Here we go then...

2895
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,730
Excuse us

2896
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:06,330
Can you guys just go and line up over there..?

2897
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:10,170
Chief's room

2898
01:37:08,230 --> 01:37:10,540
Oh, over here?

2899
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:16,310
Hmm, it seems he hasn't returned yet...

2900
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:26,690
Ishizaka Kouji

2901
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:26,690
Kindaichi Kosuke

2902
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:29,260
Sorry for

2903
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:29,260
making you wait...

2904
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:34,660
No way...

2905
01:37:32,230 --> 01:37:36,300
I mean yeah, he's meant to be a legendary detective...

2906
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:36,300
Yeah of course...

2907
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:38,260
Damn

2908
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:40,130
He's a legendary detective...

2909
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:44,970
I mean I guess yeah...

2910
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,870
He's the legendary detective...

2911
01:37:43,470 --> 01:37:44,970
Yup...

2912
01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:48,610
Since you came here...

2913
01:37:48,610 --> 01:37:51,080
I don't want to say it's my speciality or anything...

2914
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:53,750
I would like to do a bit of Reasoning

2915
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:59,650
Chief Kindaichi's speciality: Reasoning

2916
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:59,890
First up is Endo-san...

2917
01:37:59,890 --> 01:38:02,090
You are a comedian but in March this year...

2918
01:38:02,090 --> 01:38:04,460
You are a comedian but in March this year...

2919
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:06,230
Just to make a profit, you made a songand released it on CD, right?

2920
01:38:06,230 --> 01:38:08,130
Just to make a profit, you made a song and released it onCD, right?

2921
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:10,700
Right?

2922
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:11,900
I believe the title was "Someday of Stardom"

2923
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:12,930
I believe the title was "Someday of Stardom"

2924
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:15,000
I believe the title was "Someday of Stardom"

2925
01:38:15,170 --> 01:38:25,380
Someday of Stardom

2926
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:20,570
That was the film Tanaka was in

2927
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:23,510
and they asked me to sing a song...

2928
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:25,380
I see, so you took part in that

2929
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:25,510
Yes I did...

2930
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:26,980
And that song got downloaded once on iTunes

2931
01:38:26,980 --> 01:38:27,750
And that song got downloaded once on iTunes

2932
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:28,980
And that song got downloaded once on iTunes

2933
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:30,120
And got 1 download on a smartphone...

2934
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:30,720
And got 1 download on a smartphone...

2935
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:32,620
And got 1 download on a smartphone...

2936
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:33,190
And got 1 download on a mobile phone

2937
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:34,490
And got 1 download on a mobile phone

2938
01:38:34,490 --> 01:38:35,960
So in the 9 months since March, it's been downloaded 3 times...

2939
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:37,260
So in the 9 months since March, it's been downloaded 3 times...

2940
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:41,860
So in the 9 months since March, it's been downloaded 3 times...

2941
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,800
I felt awful there...

2942
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:46,470
3 downloads in 9 months?

2943
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:49,200
3 downloads in 9 months?

2944
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:55,510
Damn, I really do need to do better...

2945
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:01,980
When we think of Matsumoto-san, excuse me here...

2946
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:04,550
What magnificent blond hair you have...

2947
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:07,520
What magnificent blond hair you have...

2948
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,660
But in the past, when a comedian dyed his hair blond

2949
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:11,860
But in the past, when a comedian dyed his hair blond

2950
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:14,430
did you not label him as scum?

2951
01:39:16,530 --> 01:39:19,700
and I've also heard this story from one of your juniors

2952
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:24,570
That you went to Sanrio Land

2953
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:24,570
with your daughter this one time

2954
01:39:24,570 --> 01:39:26,440
And you were in the car, trying to get your daughter all excited

2955
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:29,210
And you were in the car, trying to get your daughter all excited

2956
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:33,050
Every time you saw a factory, you'd say

2957
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:33,050
Hey, is that Sanrio Land?

2958
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:36,920
And when you saw some laundry, you'd say

2959
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:36,920
"Are those Kitty's clothes?"

2960
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:41,990
You are the person they call "The God of Laughter", right?

2961
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:47,530
I do understand you were trying to get her excited but

2962
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:47,530
your performance is just so...

2963
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:52,900
This is really horrible...

2964
01:39:59,810 --> 01:40:02,380
And here we have...

2965
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:03,340
Let's see

2966
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:07,380
This is actually a story I heard from your son

2967
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:08,350
Your wife said, "I made meat stir fry, so heat it up and eat it"

2968
01:40:08,350 --> 01:40:10,020
Your wife said, "I made meat stir fry, so heat it up and eat it"

2969
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:12,420
Your wife said, "I made meat stir fry, so heat it up and eat it"

2970
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:13,420
So then you heated up the meat stir fry

2971
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:15,860
So then you heated up the meat stir fry

2972
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:16,490
Eventually, as you wandered around here and there...

2973
01:40:16,490 --> 01:40:18,960
Eventually, as you wandered around here and there...

2974
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:21,030
you got hungry

2975
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:24,030
"Why isn't there a side dish for the rice!?" you say

2976
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:28,770
*Note: Egg over rice is just raw egg on rice, usually with soy sauce. It's known for being a poor or lazy meal

2977
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:28,770
And then you ate egg over rice*

2978
01:40:28,130 --> 01:40:29,370
You had meat stir fry, didn't you?

2979
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:31,400
You even heated it

2980
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:31,440
I beg of you...

2981
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:32,670
You even microwaved it

2982
01:40:33,210 --> 01:40:35,370
What happened, Hamada-san?

2983
01:40:35,710 --> 01:40:36,880
It's because you were tired

2984
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:37,980
That's exactly right

2985
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:43,820
How disappointing...

2986
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:45,250
"How disappointing"???

2987
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:45,820
Thank you very much

2988
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:48,890
Thank you very much

2989
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:48,890
Thank you very much

2990
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:48,890
Thank you very much

2991
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:48,890
Thank you very much

2992
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:48,890
Thank you very much

2993
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:51,460
Five hours into their detective duties

2994
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:55,530
Detective Duties: 5 hours

2995
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:54,260
It's time for lunch and everyone's been looking forward to it, but

2996
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:57,800
Well, with that, I think I can keep saying it

2997
01:40:57,700 --> 01:40:58,400
Is that so

2998
01:40:59,200 --> 01:40:59,870
Alright everyone

2999
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:02,470
I'm sure you're getting hungry right about now...

3000
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:04,240
I'm sure you're getting hungry right about now...

3001
01:41:04,170 --> 01:41:04,640
Here it is

3002
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:05,770
At this detective's agency

3003
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:05,810
Ah, this again

3004
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:07,540
For those that can do it, a gourmet meal

3005
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:09,610
For those that can do it, a gourmet meal

3006
01:41:08,810 --> 01:41:10,310
I hate this one the most

3007
01:41:09,610 --> 01:41:11,840
For any deadbeats, a shabby meal

3008
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,280
We've had enough...

3009
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:14,610
For any deadbeats, a shabby meal

3010
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:13,980
I suck at this

3011
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:15,250
This is what I hate the MOST

3012
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:15,850
The food you get will be based on how well you do

3013
01:41:15,150 --> 01:41:16,850
I really suck at this

3014
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:18,820
The food you get will be based on how well you do

3015
01:41:16,450 --> 01:41:17,720
This is the one I forgot to mention

3016
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:18,720
It's that time, huh?

3017
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:21,190
This person will be in charge

3018
01:41:21,190 --> 01:41:21,790
Come in please!

3019
01:41:21,690 --> 01:41:22,490
It's that person, right?

3020
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:22,960
It's that one guy with the same name as the bullet train stop, right?

3021
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,330
It's that one guy with the same name as the bullet train stop, right?

3022
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:24,990
Here he is

3023
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:25,560
Good job everyone

3024
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:29,130
Seriously, stop coming every single year

3025
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:30,360
Shinagawa Hiroshi

3026
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:30,360
Shinagawa Shoji

3027
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:30,400
Note: "Shinagawa" is one of the stops that the bullet train makes in Tokyo, thus Matsumoto's joke

3028
01:41:28,690 --> 01:41:30,630
Your face doesn't change at all

3029
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:30,900
Seriously

3030
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:31,800
Always the same, every year

3031
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:33,770
It's the bullet train station guy

3032
01:41:33,770 --> 01:41:34,900
I always get a weird sweat because of your damn segment

3033
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:36,640
I always get a weird sweat because of your damn segment

3034
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:38,870
And so, in this challenge, you will be betting your wunch... Lunch for...!!

3035
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:39,640
And so, in this challenge, you will be betting your wunch... Lunch for...!!

3036
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:39,870
And so, in this challenge, you will be betting your wunch... Lunch for...!!

3037
01:41:39,870 --> 01:41:43,880
And so, in this challenge, you will be betting your wunch... Lunch for...!!

3038
01:41:40,910 --> 01:41:43,880
Huh?

3039
01:41:41,710 --> 01:41:43,240
You can't even speak right

3040
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:47,950
Really, what's wrong with you?

3041
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:48,550
Hamada-san, please...

3042
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:51,720
We aren't in a normal place!!

3043
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:52,920
What a pain in the ass

3044
01:41:53,490 --> 01:41:54,920
We aren't in a normal place

3045
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:57,760
He's become someone who laughs so easily

3046
01:41:56,660 --> 01:41:57,520
Is this fun for him maybe?

3047
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:00,790
Are you having fun?

3048
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:00,890
No no no

3049
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:01,290
Are you just plainly having fun?

3050
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:03,500
Are you just plainly having fun?

3051
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,030
No no no

3052
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:07,170
He fumbled his words so...

3053
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:06,900
Are you just plainly having fun?

3054
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:09,240
Well, at that time, I...

3055
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:13,010
Go over to Lumine the Yoshimoto!!

3056
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:13,010
Note: Lumine the Yoshimoto is a comedy theater in Tokyo where an audience can watch live performances

3057
01:42:10,170 --> 01:42:10,970
Eh?

3058
01:42:10,970 --> 01:42:11,270
Eh?

3059
01:42:11,270 --> 01:42:12,970
Eh?

3060
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:17,140
Me?

3061
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:18,840
Me too?!

3062
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:18,580
What is going on?

3063
01:42:17,710 --> 01:42:20,150
You can't help but laugh...

3064
01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:22,050
Really, you, the limit...

3065
01:42:19,950 --> 01:42:22,150
Downtown, what's going on with you guys?

3066
01:42:23,450 --> 01:42:24,320
Gently, alright?!

3067
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:27,090
Do it gently, okay?

3068
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:27,820
Then let's get going

3069
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:31,260
As of now, in this challenge, you will be betting your lunch for this...

3070
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:31,990
I don't want to do this...

3071
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:39,830
Praise it!

3072
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:35,130
Praise it! Sing it! Culinary Improv Idol Parody Song!

3073
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:39,830
Sing it!

3074
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:39,830
Culinary Improv

3075
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:39,830
Idol Parody Song

3076
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:39,830
From the Showa era*

3077
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:39,830
Note: The Showa era spans from 1926 to 1989

3078
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:37,730
Idol... Song...?

3079
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:39,730
This year is idol songs!

3080
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:47,370
Shinagawa will designate one of the five and

3081
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:47,370
a card with a name of a dish will be presented

3082
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:56,150
Praise By Improv Idol Song

3083
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:41,500
The rules are

3084
01:42:41,570 --> 01:42:43,900
Hamada-san!

3085
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:44,500
Shinagawa will designate one out of the five guys and

3086
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:47,370
Ramen

3087
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:47,370
Ramen

01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:46,770
a card with a name of a dish will be presented

3089
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:56,150
The designated person, with the melody of a certain idol song,

3090
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:56,150
must praise that dish by improvisational performance

3091
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,540
The designated person, with the melody of a certain idol song,

3092
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:51,740
The designated person, with the melody of a certain idol song,

3093
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:55,450
must give praise to that dish through a song performance

3094
01:42:56,580 --> 01:42:57,480
As an example, Fujiwara will perform

3095
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:59,320
As an example, Fujiwara will perform

3096
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,850
The theme song will be Tahara Toshihiko's hit song,

3097
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:06,530

01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:28,550
Broiled eel over rice

3105
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:28,550
Ahh I become so energetic, when I eat eel, in an instant

3106
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:28,550
The sauce with the secret formula... Uh... Um, goes well with rice... Errr... I'm sorry...

3107
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:26,180
You suck, you really suck

3108
01:43:27,310 --> 01:43:29,720
That was awful; can't you do it properly?

3109
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:29,680
Please do it properly

3110
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:31,180
That's just cruel!!

3111
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:32,520
How could you forget how to do the example?

3112
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:36,060
There is no damn reason to get hit because of this!!

3113
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:36,620
This year's is terrible!!

3114
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:37,390
This is terrible!

3115
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:38,620
This year's is terrible!!

3116
01:43:37,490 --> 01:43:39,290
Why do I gotta suffer for this?

3117
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:42,630
Apologies

3118
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:44,200
This goes to show how difficult it is

3119
01:43:42,630 --> 01:43:44,430
Do it properly!!

I love you so love you don't let go of me, mmm... I love you

3124
01:43:44,730 --> 01:44:20,170
Waiting on the balcony by the shore, before long, the morning wraps the two of us with a veil of mist

3125
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:48,100
The first theme song is "Nagisa no Balcony" (Balcony by the Shore)

3126
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:50,800
Let's first listen to the original

3127
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:08,050
This is fairly long

3128
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:09,390
So damn long!

3129
01:44:12,190 --> 01:44:13,030
This is pretty long

3130
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:14,430
We don't need this part

3131
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:18,600
Wow, so long

3132
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:19,900
Too long!

3133
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:22,530
Starting with Tanaka!! If you would please

3134
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:21,630
Here it is!

3135
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:23,870
Go, Tanaka

3136
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:25,200
Here I go!!

3137
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:26,540
Let's do it perfectly

3138
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,640
Music start!!

3139
01:44:27,810 --> 01:44:59,940

Tsukemen! (Dipping ramen noodles)

3142
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:59,940
Tsukemen

3143
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:59,940
With all my heart, I want to dip, smoothly scooping, want to use my left hand smoothly too, both hands smoothly scooping

3144
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:36,280
This is good

3145
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:44,260
This is pretty good

3146
01:44:46,130 --> 01:44:59,940
Tomorrow, today, day after tomorrow I'll eat mmm... I love you

3147
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:48,530
He's completely...

3148
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:50,430
Terrible at singing, isn't he?

3149
01:44:51,630 --> 01:44:52,300
Yes!

3150
01:44:57,800 --> 01:44:59,240
What the hell is that?

3151
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:00,740
The last... The last... You didn't change the last bit at all

3152
01:45:01,810 --> 01:45:02,910
The last bit didn't change

3153
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:06,380
It was good, right?

3154
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:05,610
This passes

3155
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:06,410
No way!

3156
01:45:06,710 --> 01:45:08,880
It passes!!

3157
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:09,420
"I love you"?!

3158
01:45:08,850 --> 01:45:09,820
Doing it like this is okay?!

3159
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:10,320
But wait!

3160
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:13,050
But wait, it was fine, right?!

3161
01:45:12,690 --> 01:45:13,290
Gently, okay?

3162
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,490
The lyrics didn't stick to me

3163
01:45:15,490 --> 01:45:19,360
There's an issue with your singing capabilities!!

3164
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:16,860
That's right

3165
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:19,360
Singing capabilities are a different matter!!

3166
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,630
This is the level of quality that we're maintaining this year, right?

3167
01:45:20,630 --> 01:45:21,830
This is the level of quality that we're maintaining this year, right?

3168
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,160
Well, this was very...

3169
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:23,800
Right?!

3170
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:26,200
The feeling from "Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, I want to eat"

3171
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:25,600
It was good, wasn't it?

3172
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:30,340
When you say, "you," just who are you talking to?

3173
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:28,030
Tsukemen!!

3174
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:30,340
Tsukemen!!

3175
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:34,710
You completely talked casually just now!!

3176
01:45:30,770 --> 01:45:32,000
No! That was not what it was...

3177
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:34,740
No, not at all

3178
01:45:35,170 --> 01:45:36,240
You said, "Tsukemen! Tsukemen!"

3179
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:38,980
You're way too excited!!

3180
01:45:39,650 --> 01:45:42,080
Why is it just me?

3181
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,480
You're really excited

3182
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:44,750
You were laughing...

3183
01:45:43,650 --> 01:45:45,050
My junior talks to me casually and I get the out

3184
01:45:45,050 --> 01:45:45,950
My junior talks to me casually and I get the out

3185
01:45:47,050 --> 01:45:47,720
GENTLY!!

3186
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:49,360
I SAID GENTLY, DIDN'T I?!

Cold tofu

3196
01:45:59,430 --> 01:46:30,430
Please grill my tofu, just for me, grill my cold tofu, I beg of y...

3197
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:03,070
Why the hell

3198
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:07,270
Grilled cold tofu...

3199
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:10,110
No no no

3200
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:12,580
That's not right

3201
01:46:13,710 --> 01:46:14,810
I don't get it

3202
01:46:14,610 --> 01:46:30,430
You and I, with soy sauce mmm... Let's eat cold tofu

3203
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:16,250
What does that even mean?

3204
01:46:17,850 --> 01:46:19,650
Don't understand it from the beginning

3205
01:46:30,330 --> 01:46:31,400
That is an out

3206
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:32,460
That's an out!

3207
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:33,730
What the hell is he even saying?

3208
01:46:33,670 --> 01:46:35,130
Grilled cold tofu?

3209
01:46:34,570 --> 01:46:37,070
What do you mean by "Grilled"?

3210
01:46:35,830 --> 01:46:36,870
You don't heat it

3211
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:41,240
From the opening, it completely became a song about grilled tofu

3212
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:43,510
From the opening, it completely became a song about grilled tofu

3213
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:43,410
Yeah, seriously

3214
01:46:43,510 --> 01:46:44,140
What are you saying?

3215
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:45,710
What are you saying?

3216
01:46:45,810 --> 01:46:50,720
Matsuda Seiko - 1982

3217
01:46:45,810 --> 01:46:50,720
Matsumoto Hitoshi

Theme Song

01:46:46,410 --> 01:46:48,210
Next up for the challenge is Matsumoto

3221
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:50,280
But before that

3222
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:52,720
I say this every year, but

3223
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:54,520
Putting the name of the dish in the song is pretty lame!!

3224
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:55,690
Putting the name of the dish in the song is pretty lame!!

3225
01:46:55,690 --> 01:46:57,990
Putting the name of the dish in the song is pretty lame!!

3226
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:58,220
Yes, I agree

3227
01:46:57,990 --> 01:47:00,390
What do you mean by "pretty lame"?

3228
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:00,360
By that logic,

3229
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:00,790
Even if you say that

3230
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:01,890
You make it so that you know what dish it is without the dish name in the song

3231
01:47:01,890 --> 01:47:03,960
You make it so that you know what dish it is without the dish name in the song

3232
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:04,100
Yes, just like that

3233
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:04,630
Logically, okay?

3234
01:47:05,060 --> 01:47:05,660
I'd like it done like that

3235
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:07,130
Even in famous songs, there are times when the title isn't in it

3236
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:09,370
Even in famous songs, there are times when the title isn't in it

3237
01:47:09,670 --> 01:47:10,100
So then

3238
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:11,140
Matsumoto-san, you must feel very confident about this

3239
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:11,800
And now, Matsumoto-san

3240
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:15,010
Matsumoto-san, you must feel very confident about this

3241
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:12,600
That's right, huh?

3242
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:13,870
Let's not include the title

3243
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:15,470
Such confidence

01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:51,380

01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:51,380
Shower me with that endless thick gravy, dripping from my shoulder, drip drip from the back of my neck, you should shower in it too, shower

3249
01:47:29,050 --> 01:47:30,990
That's not right

3250
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:35,290
What the hell are you saying?

3251
01:47:34,690 --> 01:47:51,380
Crab omelette on rice, crab omelette on rice, crab omelette on rice, crab omelette on rice... Drink up the gravy til it's gone

3252
01:47:36,530 --> 01:47:37,830
He said it, he just said it

3253
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,260
Crab omelette on rice?!

3254
01:47:38,430 --> 01:47:39,400
He said it 3 times

3255
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:40,170
Said it 3 times

3256
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:51,340
PERFECTION

3257
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:55,710
Perfection, thank you!!

3258
01:47:56,450 --> 01:47:58,150
That is an OUT

3259
01:48:02,090 --> 01:48:02,690
Perfection, thank you!!

3260
01:48:02,690 --> 01:48:05,520
Perfection, thank you!!

3261
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:05,390
That was no good, right, Shinagawa-san?

3262
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:06,360
What do you mean by, "Perfection, thank you!!"...?

3263
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:06,990
Well... You know

3264
01:48:06,990 --> 01:48:07,630
"Crab omelette on rice" was said four times!!

3265
01:48:07,630 --> 01:48:10,960
"Crab omelette on rice" was said four times!!

3266
01:48:08,630 --> 01:48:09,360
That's right!

3267
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,100
I wonder if you were singing from the perspective of the crab omelette on rice...

3268
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:12,330
Exactly

3269
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:15,300
I wonder if you were singing from the perspective of the crab omelette on rice...

3270
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,200
For crab omelette on rice, the eggs are poured over...

3271
01:48:13,930 --> 01:48:14,670
That's a good point

3272
01:48:14,270 --> 01:48:15,530
And then becomes the omelette...

3273
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:16,670
Why are you showering yourself with the crab omelette gravy?

3274
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:19,100
Why are you showering yourself with the crab omelette gravy?

3275
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:21,570
Because I couldn't think of a damn thing!

3276
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:25,740
It wasn't bad

3277
01:48:26,110 --> 01:48:29,480
Let's not make it tense here...

3278
01:48:30,580 --> 01:48:34,590
This heated battle for lunch gets even more fierce in the second half

3279
01:48:30,950 --> 01:48:35,620
Detective Duties: 5 hours 15 minutes

3280
01:48:35,620 --> 01:49:10,960
Praising to the melody of

3281
01:48:35,620 --> 01:49:10,960
TOKIO
Sawada Kenji - 1980

3282
01:48:35,620 --> 01:49:10,960
Theme Song

3283
01:48:35,950 --> 01:49:10,960
Fan the flames, tear through the darkness, the super city comes soaring in

3284
01:48:35,950 --> 01:49:10,960
Flying in the sky, the city is flying, pierce through the clouds becoming a star

3285
01:48:35,950 --> 01:49:10,960
TOKIO TOKIO while embracing the two of us, TOKIO TOKIO is flying in the sky

3286
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:37,620
The theme song is

3287
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:39,830
Sawada Kenji's hit

3288
01:48:41,990 --> 01:48:42,630
It's TOKIO

3289
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:46,100
It's so fast

3290
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:50,700
So fast

3291
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:52,570
The song itself is difficult too

3292
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:54,170
It's long

3293
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:54,170
It really was

3294
01:48:56,010 --> 01:48:57,240
This part, here

3295
01:48:56,170 --> 01:48:56,940
This part's so good

3296
01:48:57,310 --> 01:48:59,240
This part, it'd be great if you could make your song really good here

3297
01:49:07,850 --> 01:49:08,650
This is damn hard

3298
01:49:08,650 --> 01:49:10,960
This is damn hard

3299
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:10,660
The tempo's gone up

3300
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:15,930
Hamada Masatoshi

3301
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:15,930
Sawada Kenji - 1980

3302
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:15,930
TOKIO

3303
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:15,930
Theme Song

3304
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:12,790
First is Hamada

3305
01:49:13,390 --> 01:49:15,330
Can he keep up with the faster tempo?

3306
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:48,860
Subject

3307
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:19,300
Pork cutlet rice bowl!

3308
01:49:18,430 --> 01:49:48,860
Pork cutlet rice bowl

3309
01:49:20,830 --> 01:49:48,860
There is pork cutlet, the coating is sealed with the egg, the pot is... Uh... It's there

3310
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:48,860
What's it, what's it, whaaat is this? What... What is this? Pork cutlet rice bowl, this is pork cutlet rice bowl bowl

3311
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:43,690
Come on, hurry

3312
01:49:44,590 --> 01:49:45,520
Open the door, open it

3313
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:46,330
Get the hell out, get out

3314
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:47,390
This is an out, right?

3315
01:49:48,490 --> 01:49:49,290
Yes!

3316
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,360
What are you doing??

3317
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,330
That was just... Amazing...

3318
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:54,400
What is this movement?

3319
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:54,970
What are you trying to do?

3320
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:57,140
That was amazing

3321
01:49:57,370 --> 01:50:00,540
I don't know what the hell is going on!

3322
01:50:01,740 --> 01:50:02,940
That was terrible

3323
01:50:02,870 --> 01:50:05,780
What the hell was with the "I'm doing it"..?

3324
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:08,810
I was going from the perspective of a server

3325
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:11,220
A server?

3326
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:11,220
"W~hat is this"

3327
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:14,450
W~hat is this?

3328
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:14,450
A server!?

3329
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:18,360
That's really weird!

3330
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:20,890
A server!?

3331
01:50:20,890 --> 01:50:22,890
A server would make something and say "What is this"?

3332
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:28,600
A server would never say "What is this"

3333
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:26,330
This is bad!

3334
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:28,600
W~hat is this

3335
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,670
How many times are you gonna say it!?

3336
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:34,810
A server

3337
01:50:31,870 --> 01:50:34,810
makes the food

3338
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:34,810
then says "What is this"?

3339
01:50:38,110 --> 01:50:39,080
Don't get sucked in

3340
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:41,850
There's no server on earth that's like that!!

3341
01:50:41,150 --> 01:50:43,850
W~hat is this~

3342
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:43,780
W~hat is this~

3343
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:46,150
Whose line is that?

3344
01:50:44,980 --> 01:50:46,150
The manager!

3345
01:50:46,150 --> 01:50:49,660
A manger would say that?

3346
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:49,660
Even though he made it?

3347
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:49,660
Isn't that fucked up?

3348
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:53,560
Him in the store going "W~hat is this~"

3349
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:55,690
Even though he made it

3350
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:57,830
He suddenly forgot what he made

3351
01:50:57,830 --> 01:51:00,830
Just in the store

3352
01:50:57,930 --> 01:50:59,400
Enough already!

3353
01:50:59,430 --> 01:51:00,830
Loitering around

3354
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:03,570
The first part was just...

3355
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,570
I know...

3356
01:51:03,570 --> 01:51:06,170
What an amazingly

3357
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:06,170
stupid server!

3358
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:08,940
He was saying "What is this" and then

3359
01:51:08,940 --> 01:51:12,540
at the end says "It's this"...

3360
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:12,140
I know...

3361
01:51:15,250 --> 01:51:18,250
He just suddenly got his sanity back

3362
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:21,320
His memory just went a bit...

3363
01:51:21,150 --> 01:51:22,920
Oh, so he remembered it at the end?

3364
01:51:24,490 --> 01:51:25,020
That's it!

3365
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:26,890
Damn, age is scary...

3366
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:28,190
But that does happen I guess...

3367
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:31,500
He remembers the recipe!

3368
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:31,500
Put bread crumbs on the pork

3369
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:35,600
Then dips it in the egg.. Then "Wait, what is this"

3370
01:51:35,930 --> 01:51:38,070
Please stop!

3371
01:51:40,810 --> 01:51:42,270
I can't do this

3372
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:44,340
He was doing so well...

3373
01:51:44,510 --> 01:51:47,950
That sound has just been going off nonstop!!

3374
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:53,290
My stomach hurts!!

3375
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:56,690
My brain's taking serious damage here...

3376
01:51:57,560 --> 01:51:59,290
He just forgot the name

3377
01:51:59,290 --> 01:52:02,460
And as he danced, he started to remember more and more...

3378
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:04,630
And hence remembered...

3379
01:52:10,570 --> 01:52:12,900
And you're just like "I never asked for you"...

3380
01:52:15,170 --> 01:52:16,240
Yeah I guess

3381
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:20,150
So he's dancing and comes out

3382
01:52:17,610 --> 01:52:20,150
and you're just like "I never asked for you"...

3383
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:24,180
I can't do this...

3384
01:52:24,420 --> 01:52:26,420
What the hell should I do?

3385
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:28,390
I'm in serious trouble

3386
01:52:28,390 --> 01:52:31,020
I'm getting sucked into trouble...

3387
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:31,990
HELP ME

Just Cucumber is fine

3421
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:44,730

Cucumber

3423
01:53:44,660 --> 01:53:53,140

Yeah..

3434
01:53:59,510 --> 01:54:01,950
the only think you can roll is the cucumber...

3435
01:54:01,950 --> 01:54:04,020
So you can't roll the Kappa maki..

3436
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:09,650
You only really said "roll it" too...

3437
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:08,150

01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:48,590
Roll the paella!

3450
01:54:42,650 --> 01:54:44,460
He's out right, Shinagawa?!

3451
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:45,660
Obviously...

3452
01:54:45,660 --> 01:54:46,560
Of course he is

3453
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:47,390
He's out, right?

3454
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:48,830
What's poemo?

3455
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:48,960
What is poemo?

3456
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:50,800
What is poemo?

3457
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:52,800
You said it so many times...

3458
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,230
Did he say "Wrap the paella"?

3459
01:54:53,930 --> 01:54:54,830
It was so bad

3460
01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:57,270
What is "Roll the Pae"?

3461
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:59,500
Did you mistaken it with something else?..

3462
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:04,240
He got dragged into saying "Roll it"

3463
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:04,240
That's true

3464
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:06,440
Sawada Kenji - 1980

3465
01:55:04,910 --> 01:55:08,850
And then it's Matsumoto's challenge! How will he fare?

3466
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:10,550
MUSIC START

3467
01:55:11,450 --> 01:55:12,780
Fox Udon!

3468
01:55:11,450 --> 01:55:41,980
Fox Udon

3469
01:55:13,690 --> 01:55:41,980
I haven't eaten it!

3470
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:41,980
Last week too!

3471
01:55:17,090 --> 01:55:41,980
Last week Tuesday I didn't eat it!

3472
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:41,980
Fox

3473
01:55:22,490 --> 01:55:25,860
What is he doing..?

3474
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:41,980
The fox's... wife I will go to the town they live in

3475
01:55:28,270 --> 01:55:41,980
The town

3476
01:55:31,270 --> 01:55:41,980
the wife and the fox will live in

3477
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:41,980
Let's live with foxes!!!!

3478
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:38,610
It's so bad...

3479
01:55:38,610 --> 01:55:39,840
OUT

3480
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:46,050
That's what happens, right?

3481
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:46,350
So embarassing...

3482
01:55:47,490 --> 01:55:50,020
Wait, Let's take a photo together!!

3483
01:55:49,490 --> 01:55:50,020
Together?

3484
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:54,090
This is so hard to do...

3485
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:01,500
Next is Yamaguchi Momoe's 1977 hit song!

3486
01:55:57,230 --> 01:56:39,800
Ah, Ah, Ah Imitation Gold, Ah, Ah, Ah my bare skin burns

3487
01:55:57,230 --> 01:56:39,800
Ah, Ah, Ah, Imitation Gold, the people this year who think you're young

3488
01:55:57,230 --> 01:56:39,800
I'm sorry, I'm comparing you to people of last year

3489
01:55:57,230 --> 01:56:39,800
Imitation Gold

3490
01:55:57,230 --> 01:56:39,800
Sing to the melody!

3491
01:55:57,230 --> 01:56:39,800
The voice is different, The years are different, The dreams are different

3492
01:55:57,230 --> 01:56:39,800
Yamaguchi Momoe - 1977

3493
01:55:57,460 --> 01:55:58,800
This is the next song

3494
01:56:21,220 --> 01:56:22,720
This is too hard

3495
01:56:22,790 --> 01:56:25,320
This is so long!

3496
01:56:26,190 --> 01:56:27,590
Man, this is long!

3497
01:56:36,970 --> 01:56:38,240
Damn, this is going to be hard!

3498
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:39,000
Yeah it is...

3499
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:39,800
There's like 3 parts to it...

3500
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:44,910
Hamada will now try to praise to this song

3501
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:46,140
Right, Hamada!

3502
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:47,350
MUSIC START

3503
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:48,280
I'm counting on you, man, I'm counting on you!

3504
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:49,250
SARA UDON!

3505
01:56:48,280 --> 01:57:31,460
Note that the noodles in this dish are hard and covered in a hot gooey sauce

3506
01:56:48,280 --> 01:57:31,460
Sara Udon

3507
01:56:50,420 --> 01:57:31,460
This is

3508
01:56:52,380 --> 01:57:31,460
AH my mouth hurts

3509
01:56:55,990 --> 01:57:31,460
It stabs me The udon stabs me

3510
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:31,460
Even though it's udon, it's not soft

3511
01:57:06,430 --> 01:57:07,230
Amazing!

3512
01:57:07,330 --> 01:57:31,460
I don't know why but

3513
01:57:10,270 --> 01:57:31,460
the noodles are deep-frying!

3514
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:31,460
AH It hurts! AH It hurts AH It's stabbing! AH It's stabbing!

3515
01:57:20,810 --> 01:57:31,460
Sorry~ It's thick Mmm Mmmm

3516
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:34,760
"It stabs me"

3517
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:35,890
The noodles?

3518
01:57:36,630 --> 01:57:38,730
The hard noodles, right?

3519
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:38,730
Do they really stab you in the mouth like that though?

3520
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:42,530
There's no way they can stab you that hard...

3521
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:45,570
He said it hurt when it stabs his mouth...

3522
01:57:45,570 --> 01:57:48,510
It's amazing that a dish

3523
01:57:47,540 --> 01:57:48,510
like that still exists in this day and age...

3524
01:57:49,010 --> 01:57:52,210
To sum it all up these are the final results!

3525
01:57:52,210 --> 01:57:55,380
Shinagawa deemed that Hosei came last...

3526
01:57:55,450 --> 01:57:56,820
Thank you very much!

3527
01:57:56,380 --> 01:58:00,320
They get their lunchbox according to their ranking

3528
01:57:56,820 --> 01:58:00,320
And now they get a bento depending on their results

3529
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:03,720
1st Place

3530
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:03,720
Three stage lunchbox + Boatload of Sashimi

3531
01:58:03,860 --> 01:58:07,090
2nd Place

3532
01:58:03,860 --> 01:58:07,090
Lunchbox

3533
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:06,090
I guess we are of age...

3534
01:58:07,190 --> 01:58:10,360
3rd Place

3535
01:58:07,190 --> 01:58:10,360
Seaweed Bento Box

3536
01:58:09,690 --> 01:58:10,360
Yeah...

3537
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:15,670
4th Place

3538
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:15,670
Endo Family portrait print Bento Box

3539
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,860
Damn, this bentobox pisses me off...

3540
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:21,170
Dried Potato

3541
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:21,170
Last place

3542
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:23,740
Damn, that was tiring

3543
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:27,410
My tooth came out

3544
01:58:27,450 --> 01:58:30,010
Apparently whilst eating his dried potato,

3545
01:58:28,450 --> 01:58:30,010
his tooth fell out...

3546
01:58:30,050 --> 01:58:30,850
WHAT!?

3547
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:32,680
You're kidding me

3548
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:33,380
No...

3549
01:58:33,450 --> 01:58:36,020
But dried potatoes are soft though!

3550
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:39,020
Which tooth?

3551
01:58:37,390 --> 01:58:39,020
This....

3552
01:58:39,020 --> 01:58:43,900
The back tooth

3553
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:43,900
has a filling in there but

3554
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:47,830
But now

3555
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:47,830
There's a dried potato in there instead

3556
01:58:49,830 --> 01:58:51,340
Give me a break...

3557
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:56,070
You say OUT but

3558
01:58:56,070 --> 01:58:58,280
obviously we are going to laugh...

3559
01:58:58,280 --> 01:59:01,610
His filling came out and instead

3560
01:59:01,850 --> 01:59:04,780
There's dried potato in there!!

3561
01:59:05,780 --> 01:59:11,660
It's 1:30 in the afternoon and something is bothering the 5 members

3562
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:11,660
5 and a half hours since the start

3563
01:59:13,190 --> 01:59:15,690
He said "Don't take that mask off whatever happens", right?...

3564
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:17,130
Yeah I know, It's been bugging me for ages...

3565
01:59:15,990 --> 01:59:19,400
First Generation

3566
01:59:15,990 --> 01:59:19,400
Phantom Thief X statue

3567
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:19,130
Yeah, he did say that

3568
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:22,200
But wait, it is what I think it is, right?

3569
01:59:22,670 --> 01:59:24,600
What do you mean?

3570
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:27,110
Isn't it Hamada?

3571
01:59:27,210 --> 01:59:27,770
Really?

3572
01:59:27,770 --> 01:59:30,480
It's probably Hamada...

3573
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:35,880
First generation Phantom Thief

3574
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:35,880
Look's like Hamada?

3575
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:33,040
Take it off, Tanaka...

3576
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:35,810
What, if we're going to do that, you take it off, Hosei...

3577
01:59:36,610 --> 01:59:37,620
Shall we do Rock Paper Scissors?

3578
01:59:38,620 --> 01:59:39,480
Shall we?

3579
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:40,120
Let's do it

3580
01:59:40,190 --> 01:59:41,320
"1 loser" Rock Paper Scissors?

3581
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:42,320
Yeah?

3582
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:42,350
Yup...

3583
01:59:42,650 --> 01:59:45,160
Wait, hold on... What is "1 loser" Rock Paper Scissors?

3584
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:47,460
So whoever is alone as rock, paper or scissors loses...

3585
01:59:47,960 --> 01:59:50,600
So we're not doing it until the last person loses but

3586
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:55,600
"1 loser" rock paper scissors

3587
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:55,600
The 5 do rock papers scissors and whoever has different choice to everyone else loses.

3588
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:52,660
we do rock, paper or scissors, and whoever is by themselves...

3589
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:52,660
Yeah, yeah

3590
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:55,030
That way, It'll probably be decided after 3 or 4 times

3591
01:59:58,400 --> 01:59:59,840
Rock, Paper, Scissors...

3592
02:00:02,170 --> 02:00:03,170
Ah, this...

3593
02:00:03,410 --> 02:00:04,080
Two...

3594
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:05,680
we have two people, Hamada and Endo

3595
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:07,180
Hamada put out scissors so it's Hamada's loss

3596
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:11,120
Hamada put out scissors so it's Hamada's loss

3597
02:00:09,250 --> 02:00:09,950
Thanks

3598
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:19,460
Shouldn't this mean we'd have to play again?

3599
02:00:20,260 --> 02:00:22,460
This is Rock-Paper-Scissors, after all.

3600
02:00:24,700 --> 02:00:26,200
In the end, we're playing rock-paper-scissors so

3601
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:28,370
it's good that it's fair

3602
02:00:27,470 --> 02:00:29,570
Yes, we completed it in one round

3603
02:00:28,070 --> 02:00:29,570
It's Hamada-san

3604
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:32,100
Let's do this the next time,

3605
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:34,170
then we'll forgive it just that one time

3606
02:00:34,170 --> 02:00:36,370
It's this sort of rule

3607
02:00:34,940 --> 02:00:36,640
Why?

3608
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:39,240
We'll do it according to the rule

3609
02:00:39,180 --> 02:00:41,810
How gentle

3610
02:00:39,180 --> 02:00:41,810
We're playing again?

3611
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:41,810
Gentlemanly

3612
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:45,580
This is a gentle order

3613
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:45,580
Macchan you said it well!!

3614
02:00:43,850 --> 02:00:45,580
"1-loser" Rock-Paper-Scissors

3615
02:00:45,580 --> 02:00:49,390
Once 2 people are left,

3616
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:49,390
we can then  move to play normal Rock-Paper-Scissors

3617
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:54,630
"1-loser" Rock-Paper-Scissors

3618
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:57,600
No, this is different...

3619
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:00,400
It becomes 1 person win

3620
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:00,870
No, no, this is 1-loser...

3621
02:01:00,570 --> 02:01:01,670
Yes, 1-loser

3622
02:01:01,170 --> 02:01:02,570
Not 1-winner

3623
02:01:02,070 --> 02:01:03,170
No, no

3624
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:06,970
That's strange!

3625
02:01:06,970 --> 02:01:08,570
I put out Scissors, and you guys put out Paper

3626
02:01:08,610 --> 02:01:08,670
Normally, it'd be my win

3627
02:01:08,670 --> 02:01:08,710
Normally, it'd be my win

3628
02:01:08,710 --> 02:01:08,770
Normally, it'd be my win

3629
02:01:08,770 --> 02:01:08,810
Normally, it'd be my win

3630
02:01:08,810 --> 02:01:08,840
Normally, it'd be my win

3631
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:12,210
Normally, it'd be my win

3632
02:01:10,210 --> 02:01:12,210
But Matsumoto-san was the one who said it

3633
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:13,280
That it's over when 1 person is left

3634
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:14,950
It's a loss if one person's left

3635
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:20,390
Please!!

3636
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:20,390
Yes, please!

3637
02:01:20,750 --> 02:01:21,620
You were the only one left

3638
02:01:21,950 --> 02:01:22,750
This...

3639
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:24,220
This year too, we're watching this in the studio, right?

3640
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:27,790
This year too, we're watching this in the studio, right?

3641
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:27,660
Yes, we'll all watch together

3642
02:01:27,790 --> 02:01:30,930
The guests will draw back, I believe

3643
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:30,860
Why?

3644
02:01:30,930 --> 02:01:33,360
I put out scissors,

3645
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:33,360
you guys put out paper;

3646
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:34,900
why am I the loser?

3647
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:39,870
The meaning, "only 1 person using a particular sign",

3648
02:01:38,270 --> 02:01:39,870
was hidden in the rule we decided

3649
02:01:40,610 --> 02:01:42,470
Endo, decide for us

3650
02:01:40,610 --> 02:01:42,470
The rule

3651
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:46,640
Shall we go with naming it 1-person-left Rock-Paper-Scissors

3652
02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:46,640
instead?

3653
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:46,640
1-person-left Rock Paper Scissors

3654
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:48,910
We played 1-person-left Rock-Paper-Scissors

3655
02:01:48,910 --> 02:01:50,250
What did you think we played?

3656
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:52,720
1-loser Rock-Paper-Scissors

3657
02:01:51,250 --> 02:01:52,750
1-loser Rock-Paper-Scissors?

3658
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:56,290
So shall we make the previous game invalid?

3659
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:54,950
Yeah

3660
02:01:54,650 --> 02:01:55,750
1-loser Rock-Paper-Scissors?

3661
02:01:55,650 --> 02:01:56,850
I said "1-loser Rock-Paper-Scissors" just now

3662
02:01:56,850 --> 02:01:58,060
we'll move to "1-person-left Rock-Paper-Scissors"

3663
02:01:56,850 --> 02:01:58,160
He said it

3664
02:01:58,160 --> 02:01:58,960
so...

3665
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:03,760
Do over with "1-person-left Rock-Paper-Scissors"

3666
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:07,400
1-person-left Rock-Paper-Scissors!

3667
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:13,840
What to do in this situation...

3668
02:02:11,870 --> 02:02:12,570
It's you

3669
02:02:12,370 --> 02:02:13,070
It's you

3670
02:02:12,870 --> 02:02:13,770
Is it okay for me?

3671
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:15,940
It was a pretty pattern

3672
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:15,940
where only 1 person was left

3673
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:22,450
It has been decided that Endo will be the one to remove the mask

3674
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:17,280
Shall I remove it?

3675
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:20,380
Yes, take it off

3676
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:22,380
Why do I have to be the one to take it off when I'm the one who does not want to do it the most..?

3677
02:02:23,650 --> 02:02:25,050
You have to do it gently

3678
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:26,450
I'm scared

3679
02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:34,130
As expected...

3680
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:34,760
As expected...

3681
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:35,860
It's Hamada-san

3682
02:02:34,990 --> 02:02:35,890
This is clearly Hamada-san!!

3683
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:38,060
This is clearly Hamada-san!!

3684
02:02:36,890 --> 02:02:39,060
How old is this, Hamada-san?

3685
02:02:40,970 --> 02:02:41,900
Just so clear that it's  Hamada-san

3686
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:44,600
Just so clear that it's Hamada-san

3687
02:02:43,470 --> 02:02:44,670
Phantom Thief X the First

3688
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:46,970
As expected, it was like that

3689
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:48,510
With the eyes uncovered,  it suddenly became Hamada-san

3690
02:02:48,510 --> 02:02:50,380
With the eyes uncovered,  it suddenly became Hamada-san

3691
02:02:49,870 --> 02:02:50,880
That's right

3692
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:52,880
I thought it was Hamada-san

3693
02:02:53,880 --> 02:02:55,550
For an instant, I wondered

3694
02:02:55,850 --> 02:02:57,450
but once the eyes were revealed...

3695
02:02:57,450 --> 02:02:58,250
Look,

3696
02:02:58,850 --> 02:02:59,850
if you do this,

3697
02:02:59,850 --> 02:03:00,950
no one will know who this is

3698
02:03:01,950 --> 02:03:02,950
Yeah, seriously.

3699
02:03:02,950 --> 02:03:03,860
Really?

3700
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:03,860
Yes

3701
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:03,860
Yes

3702
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:03,860
Yes

3703
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:07,660
It's the eyes

3704
02:03:09,860 --> 02:03:10,860
Fujiwara

3705
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:13,560
This, do you know who this is?

3706
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:22,570
It's me! No matter how you look...

3707
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:25,910
Say something...

3708
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:27,550
At least say something

3709
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:39,690
A Hamada lookalike statue of Phantom Thief X the First

3710
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:39,690
The 5 did not know, but this statue will later create a great storm of trouble

3711
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:39,690
will later cause a great storm of trouble!!

3712
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:41,560
Everyone, okay?

3713
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:42,630
From now, um... our

3714
02:03:42,630 --> 02:03:43,090
From now, um... our

3715
02:03:43,090 --> 02:03:43,560
From now, um... our

3716
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:44,760
From now, um... our

3717
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:45,030
Black...Gaasuu Kurobikari Detective

3718
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:47,100
Black... Gaasuu Kurobikari Detective

3719
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:49,600
Handed down the generations in Gaasuu Kurobikari Detective Agency

3720
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:51,000
Handed down the generations in Gaasuu Kurobikari Detective Agency

3721
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,570
Is training of the basic physical ability needed by detectives

3722
02:03:52,570 --> 02:03:53,910
Is training of the basic physical ability needed by detectives

3723
02:03:53,910 --> 02:03:58,440
So put on your outer coats and let's go

3724
02:03:53,910 --> 02:03:58,440
Special training ...we're going

3725
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:07,990
Basic physical ability needed by Detectives

3726
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:07,990
Special training to build that up

3727
02:04:02,180 --> 02:04:03,750
Basic physical ability?

3728
02:04:05,450 --> 02:04:07,150
Basic physical ability?

3729
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:11,360
Everyone, board the bus

3730
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:12,420
They board the bus and head towards the training center

3731
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:12,420
What awaits them..?

3732
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:21,000
They board the bus and head towards the training center

3733
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:21,000
They board the bus and start their journey. What awaits at their destination?

3734
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:21,000
What awaits them..?

3735
02:04:23,670 --> 02:04:23,970
the five's new battle

3736
02:04:23,770 --> 02:04:24,000
curtain rises

3737
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:24,170
The five's new

3738
02:04:23,870 --> 02:04:31,680
The curtain rises on the five's new battle

3739
02:04:32,010 --> 02:04:38,880
After a journey of 15 minutes

3740
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:41,990
Everyone, we're almost at the special training facility

3741
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:49,960
Gaasuu Kurobikari Physical Training Center

3742
02:04:43,120 --> 02:04:46,120
The Detective Agency's pride, the physical center

3743
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:47,860
Certainly,

3744
02:04:48,230 --> 02:04:49,860
in their minds,

3745
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,660
unpleasant memories surface

3746
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:55,930
We're here, let's go

3747
02:04:57,370 --> 02:04:58,100
Everyone, let's go

3748
02:04:58,770 --> 02:04:59,600
Over here

3749
02:05:00,170 --> 02:05:01,610
we're here...

3750
02:05:02,270 --> 02:05:03,610
we're here...

3751
02:05:03,610 --> 02:05:05,480
This, huh..?

3752
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:13,380
Countdown to Hell

3753
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:13,380
The special training's full particulars will be made clear

3754
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:14,850
Everyone, over here

3755
02:05:17,660 --> 02:05:20,760
The training room's suddenly so old

3756
02:05:17,860 --> 02:05:18,560
Here

3757
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:23,490
Training Center waiting room

3758
02:05:22,430 --> 02:05:23,360
Over here

3759
02:05:24,130 --> 02:05:25,260
You can't move around easily in those clothes so

3760
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:26,630
You can't move around easily in those clothes so

3761
02:05:26,630 --> 02:05:30,230
Change into these training clothes here

3762
02:05:30,230 --> 02:05:31,400
there's no time so hurry up and change

3763
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:32,840
there's no time so hurry up and change

3764
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:35,110
What do you mean there's no time!?

3765
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:44,650
Before physical training,

3766
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:44,650
They clad themselves in training clothes and prepare for the special training. Then...

3767
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:44,650
they change into clothes which are easier to move around in

3768
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:50,890
A

3769
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:50,890
alarm

3770
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:50,890
goes

3771
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:50,890
off

3772
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:50,890
sudden

3773
02:05:52,790 --> 02:05:52,890
Black Oni intrudes

3774
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:56,430
Black Oni intrudes

3775
02:05:54,260 --> 02:05:55,560
What is it?

3776
02:05:57,560 --> 02:06:00,060
Really, what the hell!?

3777
02:06:00,670 --> 02:06:03,170
So many came in

3778
02:06:03,170 --> 02:06:04,600
Your mouth's open

3779
02:06:03,570 --> 02:06:04,600
What's this?

3780
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:08,410
So many?

3781
02:06:06,770 --> 02:06:07,810
Your mouth's open

3782
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:10,710
The Black Oni squad

3783
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:10,710
carried Matsumoto away

3784
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:12,980
Feels like we'd bang into the wall the way you're carrying me

3785
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:15,110
The Black Oni squad

3786
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:15,110
carried Matsumoto away

3787
02:06:16,010 --> 02:06:19,420
At that time, if we had stopped them,

3788
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:19,420
we wouldn't need to do this tag game?

3789
02:06:19,420 --> 02:06:21,850
To save that guy,

3790
02:06:19,420 --> 02:06:21,850
we have to run around, right?

3791
02:06:22,220 --> 02:06:24,390
Let's go

3792
02:06:23,490 --> 02:06:25,260
Finally...

3793
02:06:23,490 --> 02:06:25,260
Okay

3794
02:06:26,690 --> 02:06:30,430
Shouldn't there be an age limit or something

3795
02:06:28,860 --> 02:06:30,430
for this?

3796
02:06:30,430 --> 02:06:32,560
Something like a Senior class

3797
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:33,400
Until 45 years old

3798
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:35,270
Until 45 years old...

3799
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:40,270
The stage where they will be using for basic physical training is...

3800
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:41,810
Wah!

3801
02:06:41,910 --> 02:06:42,070
It's vast!!

3802
02:06:42,070 --> 02:06:43,710
It's vast!!

3803
02:06:42,670 --> 02:06:43,710
Yeah, it's spacious

3804
02:06:43,710 --> 02:06:45,710
Really spacious place

3805
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:45,710
Spacious

3806
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:46,710
Wow, spacious

3807
02:06:46,910 --> 02:06:48,150
Wow, spacious

3808
02:06:47,950 --> 02:06:50,050
We don't need such a vast space

3809
02:06:49,780 --> 02:06:51,120
It's a baseball field !!

3810
02:06:51,550 --> 02:06:59,990
94m by 94m Baseball field

3811
02:06:52,550 --> 02:06:59,990
This large and spacious 94m by 94m baseball field tells of the harshness of the training

3812
02:06:52,550 --> 02:06:59,990
tells of the harshness

3813
02:07:00,020 --> 02:07:01,360
Can you guys line up here?

3814
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:04,900
How spacious!

3815
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:07,000
Now, the special training you will undergo is this!!

3816
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:07,700
Now, the special training you will undergo is this!!

3817
02:07:10,030 --> 02:07:10,870
You sure never get sick of this segment, huh!?

3818
02:07:10,870 --> 02:07:13,740
You sure never get sick of this segment, huh!?

3819
02:07:11,270 --> 02:07:13,740
Yeah, every year, every year

3820
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:14,840
From now, it's okay to laugh but

3821
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:16,240
From now, it's okay to laugh but

3822
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:19,210
chasing after you,

3823
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:19,210
if you get caught by the Oni

3824
02:07:19,210 --> 02:07:23,110
a harsh punishment  will be meted out

3825
02:07:21,080 --> 02:07:23,080
We know that already

3826
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:23,080
Why?!

3827
02:07:23,780 --> 02:07:27,520
Several Oni will enter play at the start

3828
02:07:23,780 --> 02:07:27,520
Together with the start, several will enter play

3829
02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:31,520
The number will continue to increase every 20 minutes

3830
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:36,960
Absolutely No Getting Caught

3831
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:36,960
Detectives

3832
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:36,960
The curtains rise on Absolutely No Getting Caught: Detectives

3833
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:37,700
And so

3834
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:43,230
If it's only you guys who are

3835
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:43,230
old men, it can't be considered training

3836
02:07:41,570 --> 02:07:42,900
Then just don't conduct this training

3837
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:46,070
Yeah, we know we're old

3838
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:48,210
so we called in a special guest

3839
02:07:47,810 --> 02:07:48,210
Special guest?

3840
02:07:48,210 --> 02:07:49,070
It's this person!!

3841
02:07:49,070 --> 02:07:50,310
Please enter!!

3842
02:07:52,940 --> 02:07:53,110
Helper

3843
02:07:52,940 --> 02:07:53,110
Yagira Yuuya

3844
02:07:53,110 --> 02:07:58,220
Helper

3845
02:07:53,110 --> 02:07:58,220
Yagira Yuuya

3846
02:07:55,350 --> 02:07:56,550
It's Yagira!

3847
02:07:56,550 --> 02:07:58,550
I'm Yagira Yuuya. Nice to meet you.

3848
02:07:58,550 --> 02:07:59,820
Nice to meet you

3849
02:07:58,550 --> 02:08:00,450
Nice to meet you

3850
02:08:00,050 --> 02:08:01,650
Nice to meet you

3851
02:08:01,150 --> 02:08:02,950
Why are you here?

3852
02:08:02,250 --> 02:08:04,590
An awesome person has appeared

3853
02:08:04,590 --> 02:08:06,920
I'm a big fan of Gaki no Tsukai

3854
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:08,030
Though I'm feeling nervous, please take care of me

3855
02:08:08,030 --> 02:08:09,230
Though I'm feeling nervous, please take care of me

3856
02:08:09,230 --> 02:08:10,060
No, no, no

3857
02:08:10,860 --> 02:08:12,300
Yeah

3858
02:08:10,860 --> 02:08:12,330
You're not a person who should participate in this sort of program

3859
02:08:12,330 --> 02:08:13,860
You're not a person who should participate in this sort of program

3860
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:16,100
Do you know what it is we're doing here?

3861
02:08:15,530 --> 02:08:16,030
Yes, I know. I watch every year.

3862
02:08:16,030 --> 02:08:19,670
Yes, I know. I watch every year.

3863
02:08:17,070 --> 02:08:18,800
Seriously?

3864
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:20,810
No, no, no

3865
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:21,540
Seriously? An amazing person has arrived...

3866
02:08:22,010 --> 02:08:27,950
Actor Yagira Yuuya is taking part. He will later get to know the scariness of variety shows.

3867
02:08:22,010 --> 02:08:27,950
First appearance on a variety program

3868
02:08:22,010 --> 02:08:27,950
Yagira Yuuya participates!!

3869
02:08:27,950 --> 02:08:28,850
Thus,

3870
02:08:29,050 --> 02:08:31,220
I will now explain the specifics of the Special Training

3871
02:08:31,220 --> 02:08:33,480
Firstly, look over there

3872
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:34,190
There!

3873
02:08:34,190 --> 02:08:36,190
Ah, he's already there

3874
02:08:35,190 --> 02:08:37,150
Matsumoto-san

3875
02:08:37,390 --> 02:08:37,620
While running from the Oni, they need to find the key to the confinement room

3876
02:08:37,620 --> 02:08:45,860
While running from the Oni, they need to find the key to the confinement room

3877
02:08:37,620 --> 02:08:45,860
While running from the appearing Oni, they need to find the key to the confinement room, and rescue Matsumoto

3878
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:46,330
Matsumoto will get punished if the wrong key is used.

3879
02:08:46,330 --> 02:08:52,200
Matsumoto will get punished if the wrong key is used.

3880
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:53,700
Explanation's finished?

3881
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:53,700
Ready?

3882
02:08:53,740 --> 02:08:55,110
Yagira-kun

3883
02:08:55,110 --> 02:08:57,210
Please say a few words of enthusiasm

3884
02:08:57,340 --> 02:08:58,080
I'll find the key!!

3885
02:08:57,370 --> 02:08:58,110
I'll find the key!!

3886
02:08:57,410 --> 02:08:57,940
I'll find the key!!

3887
02:08:57,880 --> 02:08:58,710
I'll find the

3888
02:08:57,910 --> 02:08:58,710
I'll find the

3889
02:08:57,940 --> 02:08:59,180
I'll find the key!!

3890
02:08:58,710 --> 02:09:00,040
Oh~ good.

3891
02:09:00,310 --> 02:09:01,210
Let's find the key!

3892
02:09:01,310 --> 02:09:02,250
Let's end this quick

3893
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:03,880
Training... start!

3894
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:06,150
It's coming! What will be the first one?

3895
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:07,590
Start of the Physical Training

3896
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:11,560
Wah! Run!

3897
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:31,540
Slipper

3898
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:17,230
Wait a bit...

3899
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:20,330
Wait wait

3900
02:09:20,330 --> 02:09:21,170
I said wait

3901
02:09:21,170 --> 02:09:23,230
Okay okay Hamada-san got caught

3902
02:09:23,230 --> 02:09:24,270
You said "Okay okay", you...

3903
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:28,240
This was a serious blow

3904
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:29,010
Definitely

3905
02:09:29,010 --> 02:09:30,610
It was a serious blow this time as well.

3906
02:09:30,010 --> 02:09:32,610
It hurts!

3907
02:09:34,380 --> 02:09:38,550
This year too,
Matsumoto is relaxing alone

3908
02:09:36,680 --> 02:09:38,550
No such thing as "relaxing"

3909
02:09:38,850 --> 02:09:41,950
Again...I can't take it?

3910
02:09:40,350 --> 02:09:41,950
How was it, Hamada-san?

3911
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:42,450
Really, this is super painful

3912
02:09:42,450 --> 02:09:43,820
Really, this is super painful

3913
02:09:43,820 --> 02:09:46,390
This'll cause a concussion

3914
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:46,390
Seriously?

3915
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:50,390
The second Oni enters

3916
02:09:50,390 --> 02:09:52,660
Harisen (Paper fan) is coming!

3917
02:09:50,660 --> 02:09:58,870
Harisen

3918
02:09:52,660 --> 02:09:54,630
Run!!

3919
02:09:52,860 --> 02:09:54,630
It'd be really painful, really painful

3920
02:09:54,630 --> 02:09:56,300
Hard to escape from that...

3921
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:59,270
Hard to escape

3922
02:09:57,500 --> 02:09:58,870
Hard to escape

3923
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:13,320
Harisen

3924
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:02,670
No

3925
02:10:03,940 --> 02:10:04,880
Hosei-san!

3926
02:10:05,180 --> 02:10:05,880
Hosei-san!

3927
02:10:06,010 --> 02:10:06,540
Your hat!

3928
02:10:08,350 --> 02:10:08,910
Your hat!

3929
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:12,280
That's going to hurt... That is going to hurt.

3930
02:10:11,620 --> 02:10:12,580
That really hurts...

3931
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:14,450
That's going to hurt... That is going to hurt.

3932
02:10:14,450 --> 02:10:15,090
Damn, that hurts...

3933
02:10:15,090 --> 02:10:16,450
It really hurts!

3934
02:10:17,090 --> 02:10:19,960
Yagira-kun, be careful, okay, because they're going to come out, one after another

3935
02:10:20,360 --> 02:10:22,860
What shall we do, if we don't go forward?

3936
02:10:22,890 --> 02:10:24,500
We will only be able to run around this area

3937
02:10:23,190 --> 02:10:23,830
That's true

3938
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:25,560
That's true

3939
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:26,060
Uh-oh, here comes a Harisen

3940
02:10:26,060 --> 02:10:27,060
Uh-oh, here comes a Harisen

3941
02:10:27,260 --> 02:10:56,890
Harisen

3942
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:34,570
Right, he's locked on!

3943
02:10:34,570 --> 02:10:37,440
Locked on Yagira

3944
02:10:35,810 --> 02:10:36,640
He's seen him

3945
02:10:38,180 --> 02:10:39,180
Yagira-kun has been targeted!

3946
02:10:41,650 --> 02:10:42,810
Damn he's fast

3947
02:10:42,810 --> 02:10:44,720
Damn, he's not like us...

3948
02:10:43,650 --> 02:10:45,080
So different to us...

3949
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:45,950
Oh wow, he's fast...

3950
02:10:45,950 --> 02:10:47,380
Wow, he's fast...

3951
02:10:47,380 --> 02:10:49,650
Uh-oh, but he's in trouble!

3952
02:10:49,650 --> 02:10:51,020
He got caught

3953
02:10:53,190 --> 02:10:53,790
It's going to hurt!

3954
02:10:56,190 --> 02:10:58,600
Poor thing...

3955
02:10:58,600 --> 02:10:59,830
He's like Japan's upcoming actor...

3956
02:10:59,830 --> 02:11:02,430
He's like Japan's upcoming actor...

3957
02:11:02,430 --> 02:11:04,030
Let's go about this with good teamwork...

3958
02:11:04,030 --> 02:11:06,100
I saw before, like you...

3959
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:08,110
Can I say this?

3960
02:11:06,140 --> 02:11:08,070
shoved Tanaka towards them...

3961
02:11:08,110 --> 02:11:13,640
Hosei sold Tanaka out

3962
02:11:08,140 --> 02:11:09,940
When the Harisen came out just now...

3963
02:11:10,140 --> 02:11:11,680
Hosei shoved me so hard towards them...

3964
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:14,040
towards the Harisen...

3965
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:15,710
Did you push him?

3966
02:11:14,350 --> 02:11:15,710
Yes

3967
02:11:16,180 --> 02:11:18,220
He admitted it straight away

3968
02:11:18,220 --> 02:11:19,250
I thought if he got hit, I would be safe

3969
02:11:19,250 --> 02:11:20,990
I thought if he got hit, I would be safe

3970
02:11:20,990 --> 02:11:23,350
Let's not do that kind of thing...

3971
02:11:23,750 --> 02:11:24,560
Can I do it though when it's something I really don't want to do?

3972
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:27,520
Can I do it though when it's something I really don't want to do?

3973
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:29,460
What an amazing face...

3974
02:11:29,460 --> 02:11:31,460
Just amazing...

3975
02:11:30,060 --> 02:11:32,530
But if we start thinking like that, we all don't want certain things...

3976
02:11:33,230 --> 02:11:35,400
That's what I hate about being in a group, personally...

3977
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:36,200
But seriously, we need to find a place to hide

3978
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:38,470
But seriously, we need to find a place to hide

3979
02:11:37,770 --> 02:11:39,000
That's true

3980
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:41,470
Sorry guys, I'm splitting up from you guys.

3981
02:11:40,770 --> 02:11:42,310
Okay, let's find the key

3982
02:11:41,340 --> 02:11:44,140
Look at him by himself, trying so desperately,

3983
02:11:41,470 --> 02:11:45,440
Hosei goes to hide himself

3984
02:11:44,410 --> 02:11:47,480
because he doesn't want to get caught, I really want people like him to get caught...

3985
02:11:47,610 --> 02:11:49,810
I do not want to become a senpai like him...

3986
02:11:49,480 --> 02:11:52,120
So true, I hate Hosei-san when he's like this...

3987
02:11:52,180 --> 02:11:54,050
Go run in different directions!!

3988
02:11:54,850 --> 02:11:56,420
Hamada-san, a Oni has just come...

3989
02:11:56,550 --> 02:12:01,490
Oni is going from behind to get Hosei

3990
02:11:56,550 --> 02:12:48,270
Harisen

3991
02:11:57,250 --> 02:11:58,720
Go and scatter yourselves!

3992
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:00,720
Please try and find the key yourself too!

3993
02:12:00,120 --> 02:12:01,430
Yeah...

3994
02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:03,430
Yes yes yes...

3995
02:12:02,230 --> 02:12:03,330
Good good good...

3996
02:12:03,460 --> 02:12:05,460
But seriously...

3997
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:07,430
Are you going to be okay by yourself?

3998
02:12:07,430 --> 02:12:08,630
There's one coming, isn't there!?

3999
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:09,430
I could tell by your eyes!

4000
02:12:09,430 --> 02:12:11,700
I could tell by your eyes!

4001
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:14,810
Damn, he found out!

4002
02:12:14,810 --> 02:12:16,370
I could tell by your eyes!!

4003
02:12:16,370 --> 02:12:18,040
There was one coming just now, wasn't there!?

4004
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:19,040
I got it!!

4005
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:20,680
How the hell did he find out!?

4006
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:22,710
I figured it out

4007
02:12:21,710 --> 02:12:22,710
from your line of sight!

4008
02:12:26,150 --> 02:12:27,250
It's coming over here

4009
02:12:27,250 --> 02:12:27,550
It's coming here

4010
02:12:27,550 --> 02:12:28,420
It's coming here

4011
02:12:28,420 --> 02:12:30,150
It's coming here

4012
02:12:29,750 --> 02:12:30,920
Please, man...

4013
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:34,090
Uh-oh...

4014
02:12:33,960 --> 02:12:34,890
They're in trouble

4015
02:12:34,790 --> 02:12:35,860
They're in big trouble

4016
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:36,460
They're in serious trouble

4017
02:12:37,230 --> 02:12:39,630
The Harisen guy looks quite tired...

4018
02:12:40,230 --> 02:12:40,970
Oh, he's been caught

4019
02:12:40,970 --> 02:12:42,930
Oh, he's been caught

4020
02:12:43,230 --> 02:12:45,100
He gets caught because he does that kind of shit

4021
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:45,170
Exactly

4022
02:12:48,870 --> 02:12:50,370
That's karma...

4023
02:12:50,370 --> 02:12:53,040
like what comes around goes around...

4024
02:12:54,010 --> 02:12:55,810
Hamada-san suddenly started talking...

4025
02:12:55,810 --> 02:12:57,780
Hamada-san suddenly started talking...

4026
02:12:57,780 --> 02:12:59,780
Unnaturally...

4027
02:12:59,580 --> 02:13:00,220
Really..?

4028
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:00,990
Hamada-san...

4029
02:13:01,220 --> 02:13:03,850
He was trying to speak to take my mind off it

4030
02:13:03,850 --> 02:13:04,920
and trick me

4031
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:06,460
Yeah, Endo was next to me going:

4032
02:13:06,460 --> 02:13:08,960
"There's one coming... There's one coming..."

4033
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:10,330
I was like "Oh right"

4034
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:13,630
But seriously, I think we need to improve our teamwork...

4035
02:13:12,900 --> 02:13:14,600
That was a bit crap of all of us...

4036
02:13:14,530 --> 02:13:16,130
What's wrong with your ear?

4037
02:13:16,130 --> 02:13:18,100
Umm, I... I'm really sorry but

4038
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:19,570
Umm, I... I'm really sorry but

4039
02:13:19,570 --> 02:13:21,670
I don't think I can carry on...

4040
02:13:21,670 --> 02:13:23,110
My ear got whacked by the Harisen...

4041
02:13:23,110 --> 02:13:25,040
My ear got whacked by the Harisen...

4042
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:25,840
He used the same shit excuse 16 or 17 years ago...

4043
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:28,310
He used the same shit excuse 16 or 17 years ago...

4044
02:13:28,310 --> 02:13:30,280
That was also the Oni Gokko in the Gymnasium...

4045
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:32,680
He said the EXACT same thing!

4046
02:13:32,680 --> 02:13:34,020
But this could be serious...

4047
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:37,090
What? When he hit it?

4048
02:13:34,120 --> 02:13:35,120
Nothing's wrong with it...

4049
02:13:36,990 --> 02:13:38,620
Yeah, it hit my ear

4050
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:40,890
and my ear is ringing right now...

4051
02:13:40,890 --> 02:13:43,460
Maybe your ear drum just went...

4052
02:13:43,460 --> 02:13:44,960
Oh definitely...

4053
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:46,830
I seriously can't hear anything, nothing at all

4054
02:13:46,830 --> 02:13:48,330
I seriously can't hear anything, nothing at all...

4055
02:13:47,630 --> 02:13:49,230
For real..?

4056
02:13:48,330 --> 02:13:50,400
Yeah yeah...

4057
02:13:49,230 --> 02:13:50,400
But you're replying really well...

4058
02:13:50,570 --> 02:13:54,240
Hosei's lie quickly gets figured out

4059
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:52,840
What a crap trick...

4060
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:53,740
What are you on about..?

4061
02:13:52,870 --> 02:13:54,740
to get figured out with

4062
02:13:57,540 --> 02:14:13,220
The Skating Princess appears!!

4063
02:13:57,540 --> 02:14:13,220
The terrifying Oni Gokko...

4064
02:14:13,220 --> 02:14:15,090
But we need to get over there

4065
02:14:15,090 --> 02:14:16,060
and find the treasure chest...

4066
02:14:16,060 --> 02:14:17,530
and find the treasure chest...

4067
02:14:17,530 --> 02:14:19,830
Tanaka, go to the stands

4068
02:14:19,830 --> 02:14:22,900
and see if the treasure chest is there

4069
02:14:22,900 --> 02:14:26,170
Tanaka goes to the stands alone

4070
02:14:23,130 --> 02:14:24,600
Go, we'll let you know if a Oni comes...

4071
02:14:24,740 --> 02:14:25,440
Please do!

4072
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:28,540
It might take a while by himself

4073
02:14:29,210 --> 02:14:30,770
So Yuuya, can you go from the other side?

4074
02:14:30,770 --> 02:14:32,780
That's true

4075
02:14:32,210 --> 02:14:35,750
Yagira goes to the other side of the stands

4076
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:35,680
Go check the other side of the stands for the treasure chest

4077
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:46,590
Matsumoto is confused by the sudden greetings

4078
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:48,660
Okay, Hamada-san

4079
02:14:47,560 --> 02:14:48,560
It is weird though, right?

4080
02:14:48,830 --> 02:14:51,460
I'm going to go over there...

4081
02:14:49,160 --> 02:14:52,000
Like it wasn't really the time or place...

4082
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:53,930
Endo goes to see the outer stands

4083
02:14:52,460 --> 02:14:53,660
Yeah, you never know

4084
02:14:54,900 --> 02:14:55,570
Man, I'm quite hot...

4085
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:57,570
I'm going to leave it here...

4086
02:14:58,640 --> 02:14:59,400
I'm going to leave it with you

4087
02:15:03,510 --> 02:15:06,980
Coincidentally sees a Oni on his break

4088
02:15:07,210 --> 02:15:22,330
Baseball bat

4089
02:15:07,310 --> 02:15:08,510
You're kidding me!!

4090
02:15:08,510 --> 02:15:09,910
Is this seriously happening!?

4091
02:15:09,910 --> 02:15:11,010
You're kidding me!!

4092
02:15:12,950 --> 02:15:14,320
Surely this isn't happening!

4093
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:16,390
There was one over there?

4094
02:15:15,890 --> 02:15:16,650
I guess it was hiding...

4095
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:17,860
It was hiding...

4096
02:15:18,260 --> 02:15:19,860
The Oni was also like "what?"...

4097
02:15:21,830 --> 02:15:22,830
Damn, that hurts...

4098
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:25,930
Damn, that hurts...

4099
02:15:25,700 --> 02:15:26,760
Damn that made such a loud sound!

4100
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:28,570
Oh shit, that hurts!

4101
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:30,030
Guys!!

4102
02:15:31,140 --> 02:15:34,300
I have found a treasure chest!!

4103
02:15:34,340 --> 02:15:40,910
They find a key

4104
02:15:34,770 --> 02:15:36,740
Finally, they find a key

4105
02:15:36,770 --> 02:15:37,840
There it is

4106
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:40,940
They make their way to Matsumoto

4107
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:41,680
Matsumoto-san

4108
02:15:41,910 --> 02:15:43,380
Matsumoto-san

4109
02:15:42,410 --> 02:15:44,080
We've found the key

4110
02:15:43,410 --> 02:15:44,520
This is this year's guest...

4111
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:45,080
The guest..

4112
02:15:45,550 --> 02:15:48,490
Nice to meet you, my name is Yagira Yuuya

4113
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:48,490
Oh, hello there...

4114
02:15:49,020 --> 02:15:50,520
I'm counting on you...

4115
02:15:50,550 --> 02:15:51,020
Open it up for him

4116
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:52,120
Go for it...

4117
02:15:51,460 --> 02:15:52,620
You hadn't met up close yet...

4118
02:15:52,620 --> 02:15:53,890
Let's get this over with quickly...

4119
02:15:52,860 --> 02:15:54,360
If this just opens, we're done with it...

4120
02:15:54,890 --> 02:15:56,660
Yeah, it'll be the end

4121
02:15:58,100 --> 02:15:58,560
Oh dear... It's the wrong one

4122
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:00,160
Oh dear... It's the wrong one

4123
02:16:00,160 --> 02:16:01,030
You're saying it like it's no big deal: "Oh, it was the wrong one"...

4124
02:16:01,030 --> 02:16:02,370
You're saying it like it's no big deal: "Oh, it was the wrong one"...

4125
02:16:02,370 --> 02:16:05,270
Matsumoto to receive punishment

4126
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:03,630
Yuuya, just come down

4127
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:05,270
He's going to receive his punishment now

4128
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:10,070
Again this year...

4129
02:16:09,570 --> 02:16:11,010
Oh man, this sucks...

4130
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:55,890
Obachan

4131
02:16:13,640 --> 02:16:15,010
It's tough to even look back

4132
02:16:15,010 --> 02:16:17,980
It's tough to even look back

4133
02:16:18,080 --> 02:16:19,020
There she is...

4134
02:16:19,350 --> 02:16:21,790
Hip-shaking Obachan...

4135
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:22,520
I don't want to

4136
02:16:24,220 --> 02:16:25,020
look behind me...

4137
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:25,960
There she goes. She's shaking it...

4138
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:28,930
She's still got it

4139
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:29,760
Still on active duty

4140
02:16:29,890 --> 02:16:31,090
She's a grandma, you know..?

4141
02:16:31,090 --> 02:16:32,860
Amazing...

4142
02:16:33,060 --> 02:16:37,500
An actor who's participated in the Cannes Film Festival gets excited

4143
02:16:33,060 --> 02:16:37,500
by the live Obachan

4144
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:39,700
What the hell is with this moment..?

4145
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:43,970
This is harsh...

4146
02:16:44,070 --> 02:16:45,980
So gentle...

4147
02:16:46,740 --> 02:16:50,150
Punishment is a nose lick

4148
02:16:47,580 --> 02:16:48,410
The nose...

4149
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:48,910
She's started with the nose...

4150
02:16:49,810 --> 02:16:51,880
He got his nose licked pretty hard...

4151
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:53,550
It's warm though...

4152
02:16:53,820 --> 02:16:55,890
Still on active duty

4153
02:16:56,020 --> 02:16:57,150
How's the nose?

4154
02:16:57,420 --> 02:16:58,720
She licked my nose...

4155
02:16:59,120 --> 02:16:59,860
Um...

4156
02:17:00,360 --> 02:17:00,990
She really does smell of someone who has lived a long time

4157
02:17:00,990 --> 02:17:02,430
She really does smell of someone who has lived a long time

4158
02:17:02,430 --> 02:17:04,060
She really does smell of someone who has lived a long time

4159
02:17:04,060 --> 02:17:05,700
He won't say it clearly... But I bet it stinks

4160
02:17:05,700 --> 02:17:07,930
He won't say it clearly... But I bet it stinks

4161
02:17:08,730 --> 02:17:10,330
Guys, seriously

4162
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:10,700
This is weird...

4163
02:17:11,030 --> 02:17:13,270
Like let's finish this in the next one or two goes...

4164
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:15,270
Of course, that's what we are aiming for...

4165
02:17:13,940 --> 02:17:14,870
Of course...

4166
02:17:14,970 --> 02:17:16,110
Of course

4167
02:17:15,540 --> 02:17:18,180
As soon as you guys found that key...

4168
02:17:18,180 --> 02:17:20,080
I could hear noise from behind there

4169
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:23,210
I could hear noise from behind there

4170
02:17:21,480 --> 02:17:22,780
The Obachan was getting ready...

4171
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:22,680
Yeah...

4172
02:17:22,950 --> 02:17:24,010
We get it...

4173
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:27,920
20 minutes since the start...

4174
02:17:28,050 --> 02:17:30,290
We are increasing the number of Oni...

4175
02:17:28,090 --> 02:17:31,420
More Oni come out

4176
02:17:31,420 --> 02:17:35,230
They search outside the baseball field...

4177
02:17:31,820 --> 02:17:33,060
Shall we go over there?

4178
02:17:33,790 --> 02:17:35,090
Where are you, treasure chest?

4179
02:17:34,760 --> 02:17:35,960
This went on for ages...

4180
02:17:35,660 --> 02:17:37,930
It wouldn't be in the bus, would it..?

4181
02:17:38,030 --> 02:17:38,860
Check it, just in case...

4182
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:49,140
I will go ahead

4183
02:17:49,170 --> 02:17:49,740
Okay...

4184
02:17:54,650 --> 02:17:55,610
That's freaky...

4185
02:17:57,480 --> 02:17:58,250
You're kidding me...

4186
02:17:58,320 --> 02:17:59,550
You would react like that...

4187
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:02,050
What the hell..?

4188
02:18:02,050 --> 02:18:04,050
What the hell is this..?

4189
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:05,020
He got caught inside the bus!

4190
02:18:04,020 --> 02:18:05,060
He got caught inside the bus!

4191
02:18:05,060 --> 02:18:07,620
Hosei-san did...

4192
02:18:07,620 --> 02:18:10,890
Hosei-san got...

4193
02:18:10,960 --> 02:18:11,830
Wait...

4194
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:12,960
What was it?

4195
02:18:12,630 --> 02:18:12,830
Hamada-san!

4196
02:18:12,830 --> 02:18:14,630
Hamada-san!

4197
02:18:14,770 --> 02:18:15,500
Balloon festival..?

4198
02:18:15,830 --> 02:18:42,890
Balloon festival

4199
02:18:15,930 --> 02:18:16,930
Balloon festival?

4200
02:18:16,530 --> 02:18:17,800
Yeah, it says balloon festival

4201
02:18:17,830 --> 02:18:18,540
For real?

4202
02:18:18,640 --> 02:18:19,100
Yeah...

4203
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:20,000
Wait...

4204
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:23,240
But it's a "festival" so it might be something fun

4205
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:26,980
Oh yeah, you never know, it might be something fun...

4206
02:18:27,510 --> 02:18:29,650
What is that?

4207
02:18:30,210 --> 02:18:33,220
Holy shit, what a fatty...

4208
02:18:30,310 --> 02:18:31,950
Holy shit, what a fatty...

4209
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:33,120
Balloon festival...

4210
02:18:33,250 --> 02:18:36,850
300 balloons...

4211
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:34,020
What is this?

4212
02:18:37,590 --> 02:18:38,160
What is this?

4213
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:39,120
He's going to float away..?

4214
02:18:39,360 --> 02:18:39,790
What?

4215
02:18:40,190 --> 02:18:41,390
Wait, this is actually scary...

4216
02:18:44,090 --> 02:18:45,730
Oh, I get it...

4217
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:46,760
It's, like, his thing, something he has to take with him as he runs

4218
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:50,200
It's, like, his thing, something he has to take with him as he runs

4219
02:18:49,230 --> 02:18:50,830
Oh, I get it!

4220
02:18:51,370 --> 02:18:52,740
They'll know where you are straight away

4221
02:18:52,740 --> 02:18:54,870
Oh damn, man...

4222
02:18:52,770 --> 02:19:02,280
Balloons make him easier to find

4223
02:18:54,370 --> 02:18:55,970
This is so annoying...

4224
02:18:56,840 --> 02:18:57,670
Please don't come near us

4225
02:18:58,440 --> 02:18:59,510
Otherwise they'll know where we are!

4226
02:18:59,640 --> 02:19:00,680
What is this?!

4227
02:18:59,640 --> 02:19:00,740
They'll find out our location too!

4228
02:19:00,810 --> 02:19:02,380
Please wait for me!

4229
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:03,710
No, otherwise they'll know where we are

4230
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:05,520
Hosei-san!

4231
02:19:05,220 --> 02:19:08,120
This is to make sure they know where you are...

4232
02:19:07,380 --> 02:19:08,450
Yeah, that's right

4233
02:19:08,650 --> 02:19:09,750
The branches, the branches...

4234
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:10,790
It's going to hit

4235
02:19:11,820 --> 02:19:15,390
They caught onto the branches...

4236
02:19:14,220 --> 02:19:15,260
This is the worst!

4237
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:17,160
It really is

4238
02:19:17,190 --> 02:19:17,960
It is

4239
02:19:17,690 --> 02:19:19,060
It's seriously the worst

4240
02:19:19,260 --> 02:19:20,700
Oh, but seriously...

4241
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,100
Shall we head back to the grounds?

4242
02:19:26,300 --> 02:19:30,940
Hosei hides himself among the balloons

4243
02:19:26,500 --> 02:19:28,970
That's not a bad idea...

4244
02:19:29,610 --> 02:19:30,740
and you're going to try and trick them?

4245
02:19:31,210 --> 02:19:35,250
What the hell is Hosei-san doing..?

4246
02:19:35,250 --> 02:19:37,280
It's impossible though I guess, while Hosei-san has that on

4247
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:39,950
I see, you're going to hide among the balloons?

4248
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:45,020
Secret move: Hiding among balloons

4249
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:44,920
He's hiding himself among the balloons

4250
02:19:45,820 --> 02:19:48,490
I can use this to my advantage...

4251
02:19:48,490 --> 02:19:50,930
I'm going to hide...

4252
02:19:50,930 --> 02:19:51,930
Oh shit...

4253
02:19:51,930 --> 02:19:53,900
There's something there

4254
02:19:54,630 --> 02:19:56,300
Worst case scenario, when I can't run away...

4255
02:19:56,430 --> 02:19:57,770
But if you do it too much...

4256
02:19:58,470 --> 02:19:59,800
It'll just explode...

4257
02:19:58,500 --> 02:19:59,440
Loads will just burst and then...

4258
02:20:05,710 --> 02:20:06,480
Who is it?

4259
02:20:06,480 --> 02:20:08,250
Who is it?

4260
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:08,040
What does it say?

4261
02:20:08,250 --> 02:20:08,610
Who is this?

4262
02:20:08,610 --> 02:20:08,880
Who?

4263
02:20:08,880 --> 02:20:09,580
Who?

4264
02:20:09,580 --> 02:20:10,350
Who, what is it?

4265
02:20:10,110 --> 02:20:27,900
Panda

4266
02:20:10,350 --> 02:20:11,750
It says panda...

4267
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:12,250
Wait what, what is panda?

4268
02:20:12,250 --> 02:20:13,080
Wait what, what is panda?

4269
02:20:13,080 --> 02:20:13,880
Wait what, what is panda?

4270
02:20:13,880 --> 02:20:15,090
There's another panda which has just arrived

4271
02:20:15,090 --> 02:20:16,290
Oh I see, panda...

4272
02:20:16,290 --> 02:20:17,750
Oh, this is quite tough...

4273
02:20:19,720 --> 02:20:21,460
Tanaka always has this done to him...

4274
02:20:20,990 --> 02:20:22,590
Yeah, again this year...

4275
02:20:22,330 --> 02:20:23,090
Yeah...

4276
02:20:23,090 --> 02:20:25,760
I would hate this so much...

4277
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:26,930
What a pain in the ass...

4278
02:20:28,300 --> 02:20:29,470
That is awful...

4279
02:20:29,700 --> 02:20:30,930
This face thing has become...

4280
02:20:30,930 --> 02:20:33,940
This face thing has become literally like my thing

4281
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:34,770
Every single year...

4282
02:20:36,170 --> 02:20:38,710
Your balloons are useless!

4283
02:20:37,810 --> 02:20:38,940
You didn't hide...

4284
02:20:39,010 --> 02:20:41,750
I did hide!!

4285
02:20:41,810 --> 02:20:43,380
I did hide!

4286
02:20:43,610 --> 02:20:46,480
Let's not fight...

4287
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:47,420
Sorry...

4288
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:49,420
He gets angry so quickly, like this year, you have been...

4289
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:48,190
No no no...

4290
02:20:48,690 --> 02:20:51,350
Yeah, what's wrong, man?

4291
02:20:49,350 --> 02:20:54,190
You're so grumpy!

4292
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:55,290
That's not true; I'm sorry!

4293
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:54,960
Yeah, seriously...

4294
02:20:54,190 --> 02:20:55,430
I'm so sorry

4295
02:20:55,430 --> 02:20:56,730
Please go find it, the treasure box

4296
02:20:56,730 --> 02:20:58,530
Please go find it, the treasure box

4297
02:20:57,390 --> 02:20:59,000
Okay, let's seriously look for it

4298
02:20:58,500 --> 02:21:00,130
We probably need to go around and over there

4299
02:20:59,930 --> 02:21:01,160
Okay, let's go

4300
02:21:00,130 --> 02:21:01,830
We probably need to go around and over there

4301
02:21:01,160 --> 02:21:01,830
Okay, let's go

4302
02:21:01,570 --> 02:21:02,930
That's true, I guess...

4303
02:21:01,700 --> 02:21:05,040
They resume their search

4304
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:04,100
Let's go over there

4305
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:08,070
It's really not anywhere we have looked for it...

4306
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:11,070
How's it going?

4307
02:21:08,070 --> 02:21:09,070
Nope...

4308
02:21:09,070 --> 02:21:09,840
Not here, nope

4309
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:10,570
Not here, nope

4310
02:21:10,010 --> 02:21:27,790
Harisen

4311
02:21:10,570 --> 02:21:11,070
Nothing here

4312
02:21:11,340 --> 02:21:13,940
Holy shit, they're really coming after us

4313
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:15,980
They're really running towards us

4314
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:17,010
It looks like they're coming, they're coming

4315
02:21:17,010 --> 02:21:17,450
It looks like they're coming, they're coming

4316
02:21:17,450 --> 02:21:18,280
It looks like they're coming, they're coming

4317
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:20,080
They're coming

4318
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:20,520
There's still more of them..?

4319
02:21:20,280 --> 02:21:21,280
Harisen and slipper!

4320
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:23,290
Harisen and slipper!

4321
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:27,790
Slipper

4322
02:21:23,890 --> 02:21:24,860
This is bad

4323
02:21:27,790 --> 02:22:09,030
Slipper

4324
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:35,230
Secret move: Balloon hiding jutsu!

4325
02:21:33,360 --> 02:21:34,560
It's not something to go "Ohhh" about...

4326
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:35,830
What the hell, you guys..?

4327
02:21:36,630 --> 02:21:38,900
Definitely not something to "Ohhh" about...

4328
02:21:38,270 --> 02:21:42,510
The Oni is bewildered

4329
02:21:39,400 --> 02:21:40,500
Wow, amazing

4330
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:44,940
What is Hosei-san doing?

4331
02:21:43,370 --> 02:21:45,410
What the hell is he doing..?

4332
02:21:44,940 --> 02:21:45,710
He's fighting him...

4333
02:21:45,710 --> 02:21:46,740
He's properly fighting him...

4334
02:21:46,740 --> 02:21:49,480
He's fighting him so he doesn't get smacked...

4335
02:21:48,280 --> 02:21:49,980
He's using the balloons to desperately try and save himself...

4336
02:21:49,980 --> 02:21:51,980
He's using the balloons..?

4337
02:21:50,450 --> 02:21:52,380
Man he's really fighting...

4338
02:21:53,580 --> 02:21:54,680
He got away!!

4339
02:21:54,680 --> 02:21:56,190
He got away!!

4340
02:21:56,590 --> 02:21:58,090
It's a rare animal...

4341
02:21:57,420 --> 02:22:01,120
Of course he will get caught again...

4342
02:22:00,090 --> 02:22:01,490
Damn that's amazing...

4343
02:22:02,430 --> 02:22:04,630
He's doing well

4344
02:22:04,390 --> 02:22:04,960
He's serious

4345
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:07,260
Hosei-san is serious...

4346
02:22:07,260 --> 02:22:09,030
Balloons are popping one after another...

4347
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:09,670
And his face!!

4348
02:22:09,870 --> 02:22:10,800
His face...

4349
02:22:10,600 --> 02:22:13,240
His face...

4350
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:11,640
His face...

4351
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:14,240
His face is really something!

4352
02:22:13,240 --> 02:22:14,640
His face!

4353
02:22:14,240 --> 02:23:05,420
Slipper

4354
02:22:14,300 --> 02:22:15,610
His face...

4355
02:22:16,170 --> 02:22:17,770
His face is so funny

4356
02:22:17,810 --> 02:22:19,510
He's got the string wrapped around himself

4357
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:23,180
The look of desperation

4358
02:22:22,150 --> 02:22:24,110
Damn, that's scary

4359
02:22:24,110 --> 02:22:26,120
Wow, this is really amazing

4360
02:22:25,480 --> 02:22:26,980
It really is amazing

4361
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:28,420
Come on!!

4362
02:22:28,420 --> 02:22:29,750
Come on, Hosei-san!

4363
02:22:29,950 --> 02:22:31,350
Great fight, great fight!

4364
02:22:31,350 --> 02:22:32,520
Come on, come on!

4365
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:34,060
Do your best!

4366
02:22:33,860 --> 02:22:34,960
One after another popping...

4367
02:22:34,690 --> 02:22:35,290
And here comes the backup...

4368
02:22:35,290 --> 02:22:36,560
Here comes the backup...

4369
02:22:36,990 --> 02:22:39,200
Hosei-san, another one has arrived

4370
02:22:37,230 --> 02:23:05,420
Baseball bat

4371
02:22:39,560 --> 02:22:40,760
This is awful

4372
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:44,630
They really are popping one after another

4373
02:22:43,300 --> 02:22:44,600
They're popping one after another!

4374
02:22:46,940 --> 02:22:47,670
This is amazing

4375
02:22:48,270 --> 02:22:49,470
What the hell is this..?

4376
02:22:48,310 --> 02:22:50,540
It's like a gun fight...

4377
02:22:50,810 --> 02:22:52,110
Wow...

4378
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:54,140
What the hell is this?

4379
02:22:54,640 --> 02:22:56,110
They're double-teaming you!

4380
02:22:55,910 --> 02:22:56,850
I literally have no idea

4381
02:22:56,850 --> 02:22:58,150
I literally have no idea

4382
02:22:58,380 --> 02:23:00,150
I don't know what to look at right now...

4383
02:23:00,150 --> 02:23:01,080
It's like a fireworks display...

4384
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:02,320
It's like a fireworks display...

4385
02:23:01,750 --> 02:23:03,050
It's just fireworks...

4386
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:04,120
He's...

4387
02:23:02,690 --> 02:23:05,420
It's a fireworks display

4388
02:23:03,890 --> 02:23:05,520
He's dead

4389
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:10,290
That was amazing

4390
02:23:09,890 --> 02:23:11,330
Hosei-san...

4391
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:16,370
Damn, that's scary...

4392
02:23:17,970 --> 02:23:19,470
What an ugly sight...

4393
02:23:24,370 --> 02:23:27,310
That is scary...

4394
02:23:27,580 --> 02:23:28,380
Great fight, it was a great fight

4395
02:23:28,380 --> 02:23:30,050
Great fight, it was a great fight

4396
02:23:29,010 --> 02:23:30,680
Yeah it was...

4397
02:23:29,080 --> 02:23:31,210
Damn, you were fighting so hard, huh?

4398
02:23:30,680 --> 02:23:32,580
We were supporting you from the bottoms of our hearts

4399
02:23:32,180 --> 02:23:35,820
I nearly got away...

4400
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:34,680
Yeah that's right

4401
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:35,950
If it was just against the slipper guy...

4402
02:23:35,950 --> 02:23:37,550
Shall we split up once...

4403
02:23:37,550 --> 02:23:38,990
and find the treasure box?

4404
02:23:38,990 --> 02:23:40,520
Okay, then we will also...

4405
02:23:38,990 --> 02:23:41,060
Some of you go over there...

4406
02:23:41,060 --> 02:23:43,060
Okay, here I go...

4407
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:43,160
Okay I will go this way...

4408
02:23:46,100 --> 02:23:48,370
It really was like that anime DVD from before...

4409
02:23:47,430 --> 02:23:49,530
So you do actually do that...

4410
02:23:49,230 --> 02:23:51,030
Just as the anime said...

4411
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:52,270
I feel a bit of spite about this...

4412
02:23:52,570 --> 02:23:54,200
Where could it be..?

4413
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:55,040
Yeah, we really can't find it...

4414
02:23:57,070 --> 02:23:58,010
What the hell is that?

4415
02:23:58,910 --> 02:24:00,180
What?

4416
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:00,580
Why?

4417
02:24:00,580 --> 02:24:02,110
Why?

4418
02:24:01,180 --> 02:25:58,630
Time Bomb

4419
02:24:01,650 --> 02:24:03,050
It said "Time Bomb"

4420
02:24:02,110 --> 02:24:02,910
Hang on a second...

4421
02:24:02,910 --> 02:24:05,250
What the hell is "Time Bomb"?

4422
02:24:04,150 --> 02:24:05,580
Seriously, what the hell!?

4423
02:24:05,580 --> 02:24:07,280
Oh, he's taking the balloons off him

4424
02:24:06,750 --> 02:24:07,980
Maybe he's a good guy

4425
02:24:08,320 --> 02:24:09,720
It says "Time Bomb" though...

4426
02:24:09,790 --> 02:24:11,520
Here comes another one...

4427
02:24:10,250 --> 02:24:11,120
Oh shit...

4428
02:24:12,690 --> 02:24:13,960
That's scary, man...

4429
02:24:13,160 --> 02:24:14,660
That is...

4430
02:24:14,660 --> 02:24:15,890
WHAT THE FUCK!?

4431
02:24:16,060 --> 02:24:17,360
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE

4432
02:24:18,460 --> 02:24:19,760
Now THIS, I cannot do! I can't do this!

4433
02:24:19,730 --> 02:24:21,430
Now THIS, I cannot do! I can't do this!

4434
02:24:21,430 --> 02:24:22,470
This is seriously bad...

4435
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:23,700
I don't want a time bomb!!

4436
02:24:22,470 --> 02:24:23,930
This is really bad...

4437
02:24:23,700 --> 02:24:24,930
Wait!

4438
02:24:23,930 --> 02:24:24,930
They're setting it up...

4439
02:24:24,930 --> 02:24:26,270
Guys, please...

4440
02:24:26,270 --> 02:24:27,740
Be by my side...

4441
02:24:27,740 --> 02:24:28,970
Die with me...

4442
02:24:28,370 --> 02:24:31,070
This is bad, they're setting the time bomb

4443
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:32,110
Please die with me!

4444
02:24:32,610 --> 02:24:34,140
Please be next to me at the end,

4445
02:24:34,140 --> 02:24:36,850
I beg you!

4446
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:36,480
No way...

4447
02:24:37,110 --> 02:24:38,450
you're going to explode...

4448
02:24:38,450 --> 02:24:39,950
You're definitely going to blow up!

4449
02:24:39,950 --> 02:24:41,990
Hosei-san, I'm sorry!

4450
02:24:42,020 --> 02:24:44,890
Please!

4451
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:47,560
You've only got one minute!

4452
02:24:47,560 --> 02:24:48,430
Oh yeah!

4453
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:52,230
Hosei-san, I'm so sorry!

4454
02:24:50,890 --> 02:24:51,860
Hey!

4455
02:24:52,130 --> 02:24:53,400
Hey!

4456
02:24:52,560 --> 02:24:53,500
No way.

4457
02:24:53,500 --> 02:24:55,230
No way!

4458
02:24:53,530 --> 02:24:54,630
Hey

4459
02:24:54,630 --> 02:24:56,870
Please!

4460
02:24:57,100 --> 02:24:58,440
Help me!

4461
02:24:58,570 --> 02:24:59,200
Help me!!

4462
02:24:59,470 --> 02:25:00,900
Endo!

4463
02:25:00,070 --> 02:25:01,040
I'm sorry!

4464
02:25:00,900 --> 02:25:01,740
This is my once-in-a-lifetime wish!

4465
02:25:02,070 --> 02:25:02,740
Please!

4466
02:25:02,740 --> 02:25:03,740
Come here!

4467
02:25:02,810 --> 02:25:04,570
I'm so sorry, Hosei-san, but...

4468
02:25:04,370 --> 02:25:05,210
Please!

4469
02:25:04,710 --> 02:25:06,080
I'm sorry!!

4470
02:25:08,580 --> 02:25:10,810
You'll end up getting blown up too...

4471
02:25:10,510 --> 02:25:11,180
Wait...

4472
02:25:11,950 --> 02:25:14,920
You don't know what's going to happen
so damn, that would be scary...

4473
02:25:13,780 --> 02:25:14,780
Only 25 seconds left!

4474
02:25:14,780 --> 02:25:16,320
25 seconds left!

4475
02:25:16,590 --> 02:25:17,920
25 seconds?!

4476
02:25:18,350 --> 02:25:19,690
Another 25 seconds?

4477
02:25:21,360 --> 02:25:22,030
No, I can't!

4478
02:25:22,030 --> 02:25:22,960
They got me!

4479
02:25:22,660 --> 02:25:24,160
Go over there!

4480
02:25:23,160 --> 02:25:23,790
My foot!

4481
02:25:23,790 --> 02:25:25,330
My foot!!

4482
02:25:24,330 --> 02:25:25,600
Don't come towards me!

4483
02:25:26,130 --> 02:25:28,300
My foot!

4484
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:29,070
How many more seconds?!

4485
02:25:28,300 --> 02:25:29,700
My foot!!

4486
02:25:28,830 --> 02:25:30,200
How many more seconds??

4487
02:25:29,630 --> 02:25:30,430
You're walking fine

4488
02:25:30,270 --> 02:25:31,800
What the hell is wrong with you..?

4489
02:25:31,430 --> 02:25:33,170
He's definitely lying...

4490
02:25:32,340 --> 02:25:33,870
It's going to explode...

4491
02:25:33,170 --> 02:25:34,570
Stop shouting "my foot"!

4492
02:25:35,070 --> 02:25:37,670
Damn that's scary

4493
02:25:35,740 --> 02:25:37,440
Like 10 seconds or so

4494
02:25:36,540 --> 02:25:37,440
No no no, that's so scary

4495
02:25:37,440 --> 02:25:38,640
No no no, that's so scary

4496
02:25:39,010 --> 02:25:40,910
That's so scary...

4497
02:25:40,410 --> 02:25:41,610
How many more seconds?!

4498
02:25:42,580 --> 02:25:43,650
Oh shit!

4499
02:25:48,950 --> 02:25:50,850
What the hell..?

4500
02:25:51,290 --> 02:25:52,560
What is this..?

4501
02:25:52,520 --> 02:25:53,690
It would be scary though...

4502
02:25:53,490 --> 02:25:55,730
That pisses me off...

4503
02:25:55,190 --> 02:25:56,530
You would be scared...

4504
02:25:56,530 --> 02:25:58,230
That's so annoying!

4505
02:25:59,330 --> 02:26:00,700
Time since the beginning of the training

4506
02:26:00,700 --> 02:26:02,630
40 minutes

4507
02:26:02,530 --> 02:26:05,800
More Oni appear

4508
02:26:02,630 --> 02:26:04,630
Increasing the number of Oni

4509
02:26:04,630 --> 02:26:06,640
Increasing the number of Oni

4510
02:26:13,640 --> 02:26:15,380
Hamada-san, please come here...

4511
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:23,290
Endo's Mom

4512
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:16,380
Oh, them again...

4513
02:26:15,380 --> 02:26:16,910
Hamada-san, please come here...

4514
02:26:16,280 --> 02:26:17,280
Here we go again...

4515
02:26:17,410 --> 02:26:19,280
I don't know what they actually did to you...

4516
02:26:18,380 --> 02:26:20,350
Please come and relax...

4517
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:23,420
You just went with them...

4518
02:26:23,450 --> 02:26:24,550
Yeah, you just went with her...

4519
02:26:24,350 --> 02:26:25,520
Hamada-san just...

4520
02:26:25,390 --> 02:26:28,220
Got kidnapped..?

4521
02:26:29,460 --> 02:26:32,400
Hamada-san just got caught

4522
02:26:30,690 --> 02:26:32,360
Yeah, he got kidnapped

4523
02:26:32,630 --> 02:26:35,270
He just went in though with no fight...

4524
02:26:35,300 --> 02:26:36,500
Maybe he wasn't kidnapped then...

4525
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:37,600
They took me in!!

4526
02:26:36,430 --> 02:26:38,430
There was a woman

4527
02:26:38,330 --> 02:26:40,640
It might have been a female

4528
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:44,010
Oh, hello there!

4529
02:26:40,800 --> 02:28:26,440
Endo Family

4530
02:26:44,010 --> 02:26:47,180
Welcome!

4531
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:47,340
You're here again!?

4532
02:26:47,340 --> 02:26:49,150
You're here again!?

4533
02:26:47,480 --> 02:26:49,080
Yes we are...

4534
02:26:49,180 --> 02:26:50,080
How are you..?

4535
02:26:49,310 --> 02:26:54,720
First things first, greetings after 1 year apart

4536
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:51,750
Hello...

4537
02:26:50,110 --> 02:26:51,480
Hello there...

4538
02:26:51,750 --> 02:26:54,720
You've really been great to us and all...

4539
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:54,720
No no no, not at all...

4540
02:26:55,350 --> 02:26:58,590
You must be tired today...

4541
02:26:56,290 --> 02:26:58,620
I mean, yes of course...

4542
02:26:58,020 --> 02:26:59,560
Please... Sit down here...

4543
02:26:58,590 --> 02:27:00,320
Please...

4544
02:26:59,560 --> 02:27:00,960
Please do

4545
02:27:04,730 --> 02:27:08,900
Your legs are so tense...

4546
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:08,800
Well I have just been running around...

4547
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:12,840
Have you gotten thinner?

4548
02:27:10,100 --> 02:27:12,740
Umm, no I don't think so...

4549
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:15,670
I know you're relaxing and all and it is a bit rude but...

4550
02:27:15,670 --> 02:27:18,370
I want to talk to you about something...

4551
02:27:18,610 --> 02:27:19,910
Shozo really isn't getting along

4552
02:27:19,910 --> 02:27:21,340
with Hirunandesu's

4553
02:27:21,340 --> 02:27:22,680
Nanchan at all...

4554
02:27:22,680 --> 02:27:25,150
She really doesn't like him apparently...

4555
02:27:24,450 --> 02:27:25,950
What the hell is this..?

4556
02:27:25,320 --> 02:27:28,750
Mother worries about her 44-year-old son

4557
02:27:25,950 --> 02:27:27,550
Really?

4558
02:27:27,150 --> 02:27:29,950
Why is she always so worried about me..?

4559
02:27:28,750 --> 02:27:29,920
You know, Tanaka Na-chan is on that program LIFE...

4560
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:34,990
You know, Tanaka Na-chan is on that program LIFE...

4561
02:27:35,190 --> 02:27:36,460
with Uh-chan...

4562
02:27:35,830 --> 02:27:38,490
I believe that's with Uh-chan...

4563
02:27:36,860 --> 02:27:38,130
Yes...

4564
02:27:38,490 --> 02:27:39,660
and since he's good friends with Uh-chan...

4565
02:27:39,660 --> 02:27:41,700
and since he's good friends with Uh-chan...

4566
02:27:41,700 --> 02:27:47,400
I was thinking maybe she should work with Uh-chan instead of Nanchan...

4567
02:27:47,170 --> 02:27:49,170
This is ridiculous!

4568
02:27:49,610 --> 02:27:50,970
So ridiculous...

4569
02:27:50,770 --> 02:27:53,780
I think he's fine, being on Hirunandesu...

4570
02:27:53,010 --> 02:27:54,780
Do you think so?

4571
02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:55,010
Thank you so much...

4572
02:27:54,710 --> 02:27:54,910
YOSHA!!

4573
02:27:54,910 --> 02:27:56,080
YOSHA!

4574
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:57,280
Hamada-san! To End...

4575
02:27:57,280 --> 02:27:58,580
Hamada-san! To End...

4576
02:27:58,580 --> 02:28:00,880
I will massage

4577
02:28:00,880 --> 02:28:03,490
between your legs!!

4578
02:28:01,050 --> 02:28:03,490
OW OW OW OW!!!!!

4579
02:28:04,490 --> 02:28:06,220
GYA-GYA-GYA-GYA-GYA!!

4580
02:28:06,490 --> 02:28:07,620
What the hell..?

4581
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:09,590
What the hell was that..?

4582
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:12,830
He's getting beaten the shit out of...

4583
02:28:12,830 --> 02:28:14,830
GYA-GYA-GYA-GYA-GYA!!

4584
02:28:18,300 --> 02:28:20,600
YOSHA!!!

4585
02:28:20,840 --> 02:28:22,810
What the hell is with your family?

4586
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:23,970
ONE DOWN!!

4587
02:28:22,470 --> 02:28:23,470
Seriously...

4588
02:28:24,940 --> 02:28:27,240
They really are something...

4589
02:28:27,610 --> 02:28:27,940
Here he comes...

4590
02:28:27,940 --> 02:28:28,140
Here he comes...

4591
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:28,240
Here he comes...

4592
02:28:28,240 --> 02:28:28,610
Here he comes...

4593
02:28:28,610 --> 02:28:28,750
Here he comes...

4594
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:30,110
Great job...

4595
02:28:29,710 --> 02:28:30,650
Great job...

4596
02:28:30,510 --> 02:28:32,380
They appeared...

4597
02:28:31,480 --> 02:28:32,120
They appeared..?

4598
02:28:31,480 --> 02:28:32,120
They appeared..?

4599
02:28:32,380 --> 02:28:34,350
They appeared again...

4600
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:34,920
They appeared again..?

4601
02:28:34,920 --> 02:28:36,920
Your...

4602
02:28:38,820 --> 02:28:40,660
Again?!

4603
02:28:40,720 --> 02:28:43,460
Tell them, man!

4604
02:28:42,060 --> 02:28:43,160
Seriously...

4605
02:28:43,460 --> 02:28:44,730
I'm scared of my family...

4606
02:28:44,930 --> 02:28:48,670
Meanwhile...

4607
02:28:52,540 --> 02:28:56,840
Matsumoto waits...

4608
02:28:57,040 --> 02:29:03,210
The oldie gets sick of waiting...

4609
02:29:02,010 --> 02:29:03,650
So this is how it is...

4610
02:29:02,910 --> 02:29:04,480
Damn, that's scary!!

4611
02:29:03,350 --> 02:29:07,520
Front of the locker rooms

4612
02:29:04,450 --> 02:29:05,980
So that's how it is in there...

4613
02:29:05,980 --> 02:29:08,280
Damn, that was scary...

4614
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:11,190
Yagira searches the locker room

4615
02:29:16,490 --> 02:29:18,260
Damn, this looks scary

4616
02:29:17,530 --> 02:29:18,560
Yeah it is...

4617
02:29:18,900 --> 02:29:20,400
I've found it!!

4618
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:21,860
I've found it!!

4619
02:29:21,860 --> 02:29:23,670
I've found it, awesome!

4620
02:29:23,670 --> 02:29:25,230
Awesome!!

4621
02:29:24,430 --> 02:29:34,440
Slipper

4622
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:26,640
AHHHHH!!!

4623
02:29:26,070 --> 02:29:27,600
Damn that's scary!

4624
02:29:26,640 --> 02:29:27,500
AAHHHH!!

4625
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:29,440
AAAAHHH!!

4626
02:29:29,310 --> 02:29:30,670
Of course you would be shocked...

4627
02:29:31,610 --> 02:29:32,310
AAAAAHHHH!!!

4628
02:29:32,610 --> 02:29:34,280
Damn, that would've hurt

4629
02:29:34,840 --> 02:29:35,040
AAAHHHH!!

4630
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:36,280
AAAHHHH!!

4631
02:29:36,180 --> 02:29:37,450
Someone just got...

4632
02:29:37,450 --> 02:29:38,180
Who was that??

4633
02:29:37,750 --> 02:29:39,250
That was...

4634
02:29:39,050 --> 02:29:39,550
Damn, that hurt!

4635
02:29:39,450 --> 02:29:40,680
So that's the kind of noise he makes

4636
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:41,620
He's going like AAAAA-N!

4637
02:29:41,620 --> 02:29:42,450
He's going like AAAAA-N!

4638
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:45,720
I've found it!

4639
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:48,460
They found a key!

4640
02:29:45,820 --> 02:29:46,660
Right then...

4641
02:29:46,660 --> 02:29:48,660
They found a second key

4642
02:29:48,660 --> 02:29:50,660
And run back to Matsumoto...

4643
02:29:50,590 --> 02:29:52,300
Matsumoto-san...

4644
02:29:52,300 --> 02:29:54,560
We found it

4645
02:29:52,700 --> 02:29:53,560
We found it

4646
02:29:53,560 --> 02:29:55,530
Here I go!

4647
02:29:56,100 --> 02:29:58,530
Oh, it fits

4648
02:29:56,930 --> 02:29:58,600
It fits!

4649
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:00,670
It should open

4650
02:30:00,840 --> 02:30:01,400
Shouldn't it?

4651
02:30:02,210 --> 02:30:02,970
DAMN IT!

4652
02:30:04,370 --> 02:30:05,740
It didn't work

4653
02:30:04,370 --> 02:30:07,710
Matsumoto remains
in punishment

4654
02:30:05,740 --> 02:30:07,740
You know what...

4655
02:30:07,740 --> 02:30:09,750
That didn't work either

4656
02:30:09,050 --> 02:30:11,210
Hasn't it been enough!?

4657
02:30:13,780 --> 02:30:16,020
Isn't this the worst?

4658
02:30:16,890 --> 02:30:20,020
This is going to mess you up

4659
02:30:20,020 --> 02:30:44,610
Okada Ijiri

4660
02:30:20,760 --> 02:30:22,990
This is going to mess with you

4661
02:30:24,090 --> 02:30:26,060
His movements are incredible

4662
02:30:28,830 --> 02:30:31,230
Rapid Licking

4663
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:35,270
Isn't this the WORST?

4664
02:30:35,670 --> 02:30:37,270
Even the footage is disgusting

4665
02:30:42,680 --> 02:30:44,450
It's really amazing

4666
02:30:46,920 --> 02:30:48,550
It's seriously been enough

4667
02:30:48,550 --> 02:30:50,550
It's seriously, really...

4668
02:30:50,550 --> 02:30:54,260
They aren't covering that with music, are they?

4669
02:30:54,260 --> 02:30:57,160
No, we understand

4670
02:30:55,220 --> 02:30:58,590
We're also doing our best

4671
02:30:58,590 --> 02:31:01,460
No, it's definitely much easier on your part

4672
02:31:01,460 --> 02:31:04,070
Why is he saying it like that?

4673
02:31:04,070 --> 02:31:06,070
Why does he have to say it like that?

4674
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:08,970
Oh it doesn't work

4675
02:31:16,180 --> 02:32:07,930
Egashira

4676
02:31:18,920 --> 02:31:20,750
Oh no no no no

4677
02:31:20,750 --> 02:31:22,750
Are you kidding me?!

4678
02:31:24,450 --> 02:31:25,560
You're kidding!

4679
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:28,660
What what what?

4680
02:31:30,060 --> 02:31:31,860
Why?

4681
02:31:30,890 --> 02:31:32,700
Egashira-san got you

4682
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:34,700
Egashira-san is here!

4683
02:31:34,700 --> 02:31:36,430
What is it, Egashira-san?

4684
02:31:35,730 --> 02:31:38,870
I did it, I did it, I did it!

4685
02:31:38,330 --> 02:31:40,040
What what what what

4686
02:31:39,270 --> 02:31:41,370
This is gonna be bad!

4687
02:31:40,700 --> 02:31:42,140
This is bad this is bad

4688
02:31:41,740 --> 02:31:43,070
It's terrible

4689
02:31:43,070 --> 02:31:44,640
IT'S THE ANNUAL

4690
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:47,380
EGA-CHAN FESTIVAAALLL!!!

4691
02:31:47,380 --> 02:31:49,380
HERE IT GOOOOES

4692
02:31:52,220 --> 02:31:56,920
Devil's Descent

4693
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:56,890
Seriously the devil descended

4694
02:31:56,890 --> 02:31:59,460
It's the devil

4695
02:32:01,660 --> 02:32:03,430
I can't watch

4696
02:32:02,390 --> 02:32:07,930
The Devil's Nose-Licking Hell

4697
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:08,600
This is really bad!

4698
02:32:15,940 --> 02:32:17,910
This was really painful

4699
02:32:20,980 --> 02:32:22,710
Wow... Unbelievable

4700
02:32:21,880 --> 02:32:23,780
Are you okay?

4701
02:32:24,480 --> 02:32:28,380
It stinks!

4702
02:32:28,380 --> 02:32:30,120
Did you see the annual Egashira festival?

4703
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:34,160
It stinks!!

4704
02:32:37,930 --> 02:32:39,660
WHY DIDN'T HE DO THAT TO HIM (MATSUMOTO)?

4705
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:41,000
WHY DID IT HAPPEN TO ME!?

4706
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:44,870
That must be horrible

4707
02:32:45,430 --> 02:32:48,700
For some reason,
the devil returned

4708
02:32:45,540 --> 02:33:44,630
Egashira

4709
02:32:46,270 --> 02:32:47,500
Are you serious!?

4710
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:49,540
You're kidding!

4711
02:32:49,540 --> 02:32:51,940
What is this? What is this?

4712
02:32:52,780 --> 02:32:54,140
Yuuya-kun!!

4713
02:32:54,640 --> 02:32:59,780
Yagira is Targeted

4714
02:32:55,110 --> 02:32:57,210
Get away get away get away!!

4715
02:32:57,280 --> 02:32:58,180
Watch out!

4716
02:32:58,180 --> 02:32:59,520
Run quick!

4717
02:32:59,980 --> 02:33:03,150
Ega-chan is getting tired...

4718
02:33:03,820 --> 02:33:06,420
He tripped

4719
02:33:08,860 --> 02:33:09,860
He got him

4720
02:33:09,860 --> 02:33:13,100
This is harsh...

4721
02:33:11,460 --> 02:33:13,060
Ah he caught him

4722
02:33:16,730 --> 02:33:18,430
It's here

4723
02:33:20,770 --> 02:33:21,770
This is the worst

4724
02:33:24,840 --> 02:33:26,940
It's truly the worst

4725
02:33:26,940 --> 02:33:28,780
He's seriously the devil

4726
02:33:28,780 --> 02:33:30,780
It's the festival

4727
02:33:31,880 --> 02:33:33,320
He's doing it

4728
02:33:33,080 --> 02:33:35,420
His first variety debut is...

4729
02:33:35,420 --> 02:33:37,420
This is a terrible first variety experience

4730
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:39,390
Oh, it's time for work

4731
02:33:39,390 --> 02:33:40,860
Oh, it's time for work

4732
02:33:44,390 --> 02:33:45,860
How was it?

4733
02:33:45,030 --> 02:33:46,230
Yagira-kun

4734
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:47,430
Yuuya, this is what Gaki is like

4735
02:33:47,430 --> 02:33:50,870
Yuuya, this is what Gaki is like

4736
02:33:50,870 --> 02:33:54,540
Once it dries, it's going to smell really bad

4737
02:33:54,540 --> 02:33:56,740
Are you crying?

4738
02:33:56,740 --> 02:33:57,940
He's crying

4739
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:01,140
Oh man he's crying

4740
02:34:00,480 --> 02:34:09,190
A Taste of Hell

4741
02:34:00,480 --> 02:34:09,190
Variety       33 years

4742
02:34:00,480 --> 02:34:09,190
Variety       new

4743
02:34:01,710 --> 02:34:03,880
It would make you cry

4744
02:34:03,880 --> 02:34:06,220
Were you scared?

4745
02:34:06,220 --> 02:34:08,220
If that kind of thing happened to you...

4746
02:34:08,220 --> 02:34:09,190
Wow

4747
02:34:09,950 --> 02:34:11,420
60 minutes since

4748
02:34:11,420 --> 02:34:13,420
the start of the training

4749
02:34:13,060 --> 02:34:16,330
Onis Increase

4750
02:34:13,420 --> 02:34:16,330
The onis will increase

4751
02:34:16,330 --> 02:34:18,590
Oh something's coming

4752
02:34:17,990 --> 02:35:27,530
Queen of Ice

4753
02:34:24,300 --> 02:34:25,840
What?

4754
02:34:26,440 --> 02:34:29,670
Queen of Ginza

4755
02:34:27,570 --> 02:34:29,670
Queen of Ice

4756
02:34:29,670 --> 02:34:31,670
Ginza...

4757
02:34:31,770 --> 02:34:32,940
It's Queen of Ice

4758
02:34:33,180 --> 02:34:37,180
If it was Queen of Ginza, it'd be a good thing

4759
02:34:34,940 --> 02:34:35,780
What...

4760
02:34:35,780 --> 02:34:37,780
Is it related to ice skating?

4761
02:34:37,780 --> 02:34:40,820
So you mean there's something past this?

4762
02:34:40,820 --> 02:34:42,820
This is a first

4763
02:34:41,320 --> 02:34:43,190
Covered it so we wouldn't go in

4764
02:34:43,050 --> 02:34:44,620
What?

4765
02:34:44,620 --> 02:34:45,720
Seriously...

4766
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:47,190
Amazing

4767
02:34:47,190 --> 02:34:49,190
What should I do?

4768
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:54,400
Ando Miki

4769
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:54,400
Queen of Ice

4770
02:34:51,630 --> 02:34:53,200
Wow

4771
02:34:53,800 --> 02:34:56,030
Whoa

4772
02:34:57,100 --> 02:34:58,470
I didn't know about this

4773
02:34:58,470 --> 02:35:00,470
In such a slippery place

4774
02:35:00,540 --> 02:35:02,710
Is this part of a pattern of rewards?

4775
02:35:02,710 --> 02:35:05,340
She's just circling around him

4776
02:35:05,340 --> 02:35:07,610
Amazing

4777
02:35:06,810 --> 02:35:07,580
Oh?

4778
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:10,910
No, this isn't a reward

4779
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:16,020
That fan doesn't suit her

4780
02:35:21,020 --> 02:35:25,360
Unexpected Hit

4781
02:35:23,990 --> 02:35:25,490
I bet that really hurt

4782
02:35:26,900 --> 02:35:29,930
He couldn't escape, so

4783
02:35:29,930 --> 02:35:32,130
That was pretty powerful

4784
02:35:31,430 --> 02:35:32,270
That hurt

4785
02:35:32,270 --> 02:35:34,900
She was laughing a lot

4786
02:35:34,900 --> 02:35:36,910
She's an S (sadist)

4787
02:35:35,540 --> 02:35:36,940
She was laughing?

4788
02:35:36,140 --> 02:35:37,570
Laughing a lot

4789
02:35:37,570 --> 02:35:39,680
She was peeking through the eye area

4790
02:35:39,880 --> 02:35:44,510
Ice Queen is
Highly Visible

4791
02:35:40,710 --> 02:35:41,880
Seriously?

4792
02:35:41,880 --> 02:35:43,080
So that's what you meant

4793
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:45,080
That's incredible

4794
02:35:45,080 --> 02:35:47,080
Damn... Is there still more?

4795
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:49,050
Damn it

4796
02:35:48,220 --> 02:35:51,050
There's too much space

4797
02:35:51,050 --> 02:35:53,060
Please let this be over

4798
02:35:54,260 --> 02:36:05,600
Outline

4799
02:35:58,190 --> 02:35:59,630
Definitely not

4800
02:35:59,630 --> 02:36:03,000
You've got to be kidding

4801
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:03,930
He's been targeted

4802
02:36:03,930 --> 02:36:05,940
You can't run away

4803
02:36:05,940 --> 02:36:07,670
This is scary

4804
02:36:08,300 --> 02:36:10,110
This thing... wow

4805
02:36:10,110 --> 02:36:12,110
Wait a minute

4806
02:36:10,840 --> 02:36:12,480
This is terrifying

4807
02:36:12,880 --> 02:36:14,580
What the hell?

4808
02:36:14,580 --> 02:36:16,580
You can't do this

4809
02:36:14,580 --> 02:37:43,030
Outline

4810
02:36:16,680 --> 02:36:20,920
They're gonna use that shovel to get you

4811
02:36:18,510 --> 02:36:20,920
What the hell?

4812
02:36:20,920 --> 02:36:23,750
Isn't the bottom going to go through the machine?

4813
02:36:21,080 --> 02:36:22,920
You're full of lies

4814
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:25,990
You're kidding!

4815
02:36:24,250 --> 02:36:25,720
Since it's "outline"

4816
02:36:25,320 --> 02:36:29,330
Shovel will outline the two of them

4817
02:36:25,690 --> 02:36:27,090
No way!

4818
02:36:27,320 --> 02:36:29,360
This isn't right!

4819
02:36:29,360 --> 02:36:31,590
Don't say things like that!

4820
02:36:31,590 --> 02:36:33,600
Wait, what's going to happen?

4821
02:36:32,930 --> 02:36:35,400
We don't really know, but

4822
02:36:34,460 --> 02:36:35,770
Don't raise your face!!

4823
02:36:35,770 --> 02:36:37,770
It's okay if it's lowered?

4824
02:36:35,770 --> 02:36:37,770
So I can't raise my head?

4825
02:36:37,770 --> 02:36:38,770
Do NOT raise your face

4826
02:36:38,730 --> 02:36:40,640
I'm safe if my face is lowered?

4827
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:43,710
If it gets really bad, I'll raise my hand

4828
02:36:43,710 --> 02:36:45,170
We can't help you though

4829
02:36:44,810 --> 02:36:47,240
No, it's dangerous if he does that

4830
02:36:47,240 --> 02:36:49,250
Don't raise your hand, don't move!

4831
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:52,150
Scary scary scary

4832
02:36:55,350 --> 02:36:57,650
This is so wrong!

4833
02:36:56,520 --> 02:36:59,160
Don't raise your head!

4834
02:37:04,290 --> 02:37:05,660
Wooww this is really scary

4835
02:37:05,660 --> 02:37:07,430
Wow wow wow

4836
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,970
Look! This
terrified face!

4837
02:37:09,900 --> 02:37:11,030
Of course you'd be scared

4838
02:37:14,440 --> 02:37:17,410
Look! This
hideous face!

4839
02:37:17,970 --> 02:37:18,740
AAAAHH!!

4840
02:37:19,740 --> 02:37:22,180
AAAAAAAHHHH!!!

4841
02:37:24,180 --> 02:37:26,120
You barely made it

4842
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:28,120
It was really close

4843
02:37:35,320 --> 02:37:37,090
Oh my God

4844
02:37:38,030 --> 02:37:40,260
Oh my God...

4845
02:37:40,260 --> 02:37:42,260
Bad bad this is bad

4846
02:37:41,030 --> 02:37:43,430
That explosion was unnecessary

4847
02:37:43,430 --> 02:37:45,430
If they got this wrong..

4848
02:37:44,130 --> 02:37:45,800
Thank you

4849
02:37:45,800 --> 02:37:48,000
Is this something you do to someone who's never properly taken part in variety before?

4850
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:49,970
Is this something you do to someone who's never properly taken part in variety before?

4851
02:37:49,970 --> 02:37:53,180
Is this something you do to someone who's never properly taken part in variety before?

4852
02:37:53,180 --> 02:37:58,210
Like you said before, I think it requires a lot of guts

4853
02:37:55,340 --> 02:37:57,210
I think it takes too much guts

4854
02:37:56,080 --> 02:37:58,550
This is so unusual

4855
02:37:57,410 --> 02:37:58,510
You did it

4856
02:37:58,510 --> 02:38:00,520
He probably hates Gaki now

4857
02:38:00,520 --> 02:38:02,350
Oh, he's here

4858
02:38:02,350 --> 02:38:04,150
This is about that real key you're looking for

4859
02:38:04,150 --> 02:38:07,020
This is about that real key you're looking for

4860
02:38:07,020 --> 02:38:07,820
I thought about it but I had a spare the whole time

4861
02:38:07,820 --> 02:38:10,390
I thought about it but I had a spare the whole time

4862
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:11,330
Every year...

4863
02:38:10,390 --> 02:38:11,530
With this, let's go rescue Matsumoto

4864
02:38:11,530 --> 02:38:14,400
With this, let's go rescue Matsumoto

4865
02:38:15,530 --> 02:38:18,100
At last, they get the real key in their hands,

4866
02:38:17,230 --> 02:38:20,800
Training is Over

4867
02:38:18,600 --> 02:38:20,770
and their training is over

4868
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:24,770
What kind of training is this?

4869
02:38:24,770 --> 02:38:31,710
7 hours 30 minutes since starting

4870
02:38:27,310 --> 02:38:30,810
It's been 7 hours and 30 minutes since the start of their duty

4871
02:38:31,810 --> 02:38:38,350
The five men return to detective's office

4872
02:38:32,450 --> 02:38:34,920
The five men who will rest soon

4873
02:38:34,920 --> 02:38:37,750
return to the detective's office

4874
02:38:41,320 --> 02:38:42,690
Wow, we're back

4875
02:38:42,690 --> 02:38:44,190
Ahh we're back

4876
02:38:44,660 --> 02:38:48,300
Wow "all of the drawers' contents have been reset"

4877
02:38:47,230 --> 02:38:48,800
They've been reset!

4878
02:38:48,530 --> 02:38:50,800
Seriously?

4879
02:38:49,330 --> 02:38:50,930
They don't need to reset it

4880
02:38:50,930 --> 02:38:53,400
Alright let's go!!

4881
02:38:53,640 --> 02:38:55,800
The drawers'...

4882
02:38:55,800 --> 02:38:58,740
contents

4883
02:38:58,740 --> 02:39:01,410
It doesn't matter where we start

4884
02:39:01,410 --> 02:39:03,410
Let's start with mine?

4885
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:05,380
So opposite direction

4886
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:06,380
Go ahead

4887
02:39:06,380 --> 02:39:11,050
First up is Endo

4888
02:39:10,620 --> 02:39:13,960
"All of the drawers' contents have been reset", here we go

4889
02:39:16,490 --> 02:39:22,730
Envelope with Puzzle

4890
02:39:17,390 --> 02:39:18,390
A secret?

4891
02:39:18,390 --> 02:39:20,160
I don't know, let me check

4892
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:21,530
Isn't it another secret?

4893
02:39:21,530 --> 02:39:22,730
Wait, something's in there?

4894
02:39:22,730 --> 02:39:24,730
Wait wait wait but

4895
02:39:24,730 --> 02:39:25,970
the previous

4896
02:39:25,630 --> 02:39:28,970
I saw something familiar in there

4897
02:39:25,970 --> 02:39:27,970
one was about my secrets

4898
02:39:30,510 --> 02:39:31,140
Look,

4899
02:39:31,140 --> 02:39:33,140
it's a Wii

4900
02:39:31,770 --> 02:39:37,010
Nintendo "Wii U" and Puzzle Game

4901
02:39:33,380 --> 02:39:36,010
Wow, what is this?

4902
02:39:36,010 --> 02:39:38,880
Should we read it?

4903
02:39:37,310 --> 02:39:39,110
Why the hell!?

4904
02:39:39,110 --> 02:39:42,820
Work together to clear one stage: WHAAAT?

4905
02:39:39,110 --> 02:39:44,320
Challenge Letter from Kaijin Nijuu Mensou
Work together to clear one stage

4906
02:39:43,720 --> 02:39:46,020
First me, then Hamada-san,

4907
02:39:46,020 --> 02:39:48,020
Tanaka, Hosei-san, then Matsumoto-san

4908
02:39:49,430 --> 02:39:51,060
It's getting more and more-

4909
02:39:50,290 --> 02:39:52,960
Wait a minute though

4910
02:39:52,960 --> 02:39:54,260
For me and Hosei, this can get stressful, right?

4911
02:39:54,260 --> 02:39:55,930
For me and Hosei, this can get stressful, right?

4912
02:39:55,930 --> 02:39:57,030
For me and Hosei, this can get stressful, right?

4913
02:39:57,030 --> 02:39:59,440
That's true.

4914
02:39:57,030 --> 02:39:59,440
These 3 are just

4915
02:39:59,440 --> 02:40:02,300
crazy ba at video games.

4916
02:40:02,970 --> 02:40:06,040
Crazy ba?

4917
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:06,580
Crazy ba.

4918
02:40:07,880 --> 02:40:09,410
Don't you say crazy ba?

4919
02:40:09,410 --> 02:40:11,410
It's a dialect.

4920
02:40:12,480 --> 02:40:13,450
Crazy ba.

4921
02:40:13,450 --> 02:40:14,880
Crazy bad, sure.

4922
02:40:14,950 --> 02:40:16,790
I don't know "crazy ba."

4923
02:40:15,380 --> 02:40:18,020
Aaah!!

4924
02:40:16,820 --> 02:40:18,020
Gently, ok?

4925
02:40:18,020 --> 02:40:19,020
It's an expression from the rural area my mom's from.

And

4937

the game that the five will play is...

4938
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:36,710
Will it connect from here?

4939
02:40:38,170 --> 02:40:40,440
It's Mario.

4944
02:40:46,620 --> 02:40:48,880
You can do this.

4945
02:40:47,920 --> 02:40:48,880
Nice.

4946
02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:50,520
You can totally do this.

4947
02:40:49,490 --> 02:40:50,520
You're good.

4948

You can go slowly, Endo.

4949

4950
02:40:58,360 --> 02:41:00,960
Yeah, Endo is awful.

4951
02:41:01,230 --> 02:41:01,560
Stop

4952
02:41:01,560 --> 02:41:01,830
Stop

4953
02:41:01,830 --> 02:41:02,060

02:41:03,900 --> 02:41:05,300
Stop.

4958
02:41:04,070 --> 02:41:05,300
It's my turn.

4959
02:41:04,630 --> 02:41:05,800
Nice pause.

4960
02:41:05,300 --> 02:41:07,000
Okay, then...

4961
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:07,800
We do this until we clear it?

4962
02:41:07,800 --> 02:41:09,000
Yes, so, now,

4963
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,270
Hamada, clear this stage.

4964
02:41:11,270 --> 02:41:12,840
It's in the middle, um... I've done ku...

4965
02:41:12,840 --> 02:41:17,510
It's in the middle, um... I've done ku...

4966
02:41:20,080 --> 02:41:22,550
It's because you repeated it.

4967
02:41:22,550 --> 02:41:23,520
Your words are messed up.

4968
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:25,520
Your words are messed up.

4969
02:41:25,520 --> 02:41:27,290
You don't need to repeat it.

4970
02:41:31,490 --> 02:41:33,530
It's to clear 1 stage with everyone.

You, how was I supposed to know that you stopped it there?

4981
02:41:53,980 --> 02:41:55,980
All right already.

4982
02:41:58,820 --> 02:42:02,090
Didn't you see it? The mushroom moving towards you.

4983
02:42:00,620 --> 02:42:02,090
I didn't see it.

4984
02:42:02,090 --> 02:42:03,890
I thought I was all the way on the side.

4985
02:42:03,890 --> 02:42:06,260
Why would Mario just stand still there?

4986
02:42:06,260 --> 02:42:08,060
You're up, Tanaka. Hurry up.

4987
02:42:08,060 --> 02:42:09,930
This... Yamazaki and I are gonna have to do this.

4988

4990
02:42:11,930 --> 02:42:12,900

4997
02:42:22,950 --> 02:42:24,450
You can just bypass it.

4998
02:42:24,450 --> 02:42:26,250
The turtle, the turtle!

4999
02:42:26,250 --> 02:42:28,820
Right, right.

5000

You don't need to run away.  That won't come back at you.

5001
02:42:29,990 --> 02:42:31,820
What if you hit it?

5002
02:42:30,750 --> 02:42:31,820
The question mark.

5003
02:42:31,820 --> 02:42:32,960
Wait, wait.

5004
02:42:32,960 --> 02:42:35,060
Whoa. You get bigger.

02:42:35,490 --> 02:42:36,890

02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:44,630
Don't go backwards.

5010
02:42:44,730 --> 02:42:46,700
Why were you looking at the pipe?

5011
02:42:47,840 --> 02:42:49,570
I don't know if I can do this.

5012
02:42:48,500 --> 02:42:49,570
You can.

5013
02:42:49,570 --> 02:42:52,240
Go all out and you can do it.

5014
02:42:50,940 --> 02:42:52,240
Tanaka's smiling a little bit.

5015
02:42:52,240 --> 02:42:53,540
What about the coin, Tanaka?

5016
02:42:53,540 --> 02:42:55,280
You can't get that, right?

5017
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:55,310
Don't need it.

02:42:57,510 --> 02:42:58,480
There's a squid.

5021
02:42:58,480 --> 02:42:59,950
You can make it.

5022
02:42:59,010 --> 02:42:59,950

5023
02:42:59,950 --> 02:43:01,320

5024
02:43:00,820 --> 02:43:02,920
No, then, what am I supposed to do?

Forward, go forward.

5026
02:43:03,320 --> 02:43:05,320
Go this way.

5027
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:07,820
Go under the squid.

5028
02:43:12,360 --> 02:43:13,730
Were there squids in this, back then?

5029
02:43:13,730 --> 02:43:16,270
Were there squids in this, back then?

5030
02:43:16,270 --> 02:43:19,840
I don't think there were

This might've been made just for this.

5033
02:43:21,900 --> 02:43:23,610
It's "Super Mario Maker",

5034
02:43:23,610 --> 02:43:25,610
so it's a game that has all the previous things in it.

5035
02:43:26,910 --> 02:43:27,640
It came out recently.

5036

In front?

5081

5082
02:44:43,050 --> 02:44:48,720

02:45:00,900 --> 02:45:02,870
Next, Hamada.

5092
02:45:05,170 --> 02:45:06,540
You're kidding me.

5093
02:45:06,610 --> 02:45:08,410
And then, Tanaka.

5094
02:45:08,410 --> 02:45:10,350
Why do you go back?

5095
02:45:10,350 --> 02:45:11,280
Watch out!

5096
02:45:11,280 --> 02:45:12,680
What are you doing?

5097
02:45:12,880 --> 02:45:15,020
You're too bad at this.

5098
02:45:15,250 --> 02:45:19,720
Beginner-level failures one after another

5099
02:45:16,350 --> 02:45:19,820
Basic-level failures one after another.

5100
02:45:19,960 --> 02:45:26,130
Hope rests on experienced gamer, Hosei

5101
02:45:19,960 --> 02:45:26,130
Hope rests on experienced gamer, Hosei

5102
02:45:20,390 --> 02:45:25,390
Will there be a comeback? Hope rests on the experienced gamer, Hosei.

5103
02:45:26,130 --> 02:45:47,180
Challenge Sent from Kaijin Nijiuu Mensou

5104
02:45:26,130 --> 02:45:47,180
Clear a course from "Super Mario Maker"

5105
02:45:26,560 --> 02:45:28,760
This part is all easy.

5106
02:45:29,130 --> 02:45:31,900
Right, you should just go up, quickly.

5107
02:45:30,330 --> 02:45:31,900
I see.

5108
02:45:31,900 --> 02:45:33,900
Can you break those blocks?

5109
02:45:35,800 --> 02:45:37,170
Nice.

5110
02:45:37,270 --> 02:45:39,310
Nice.

5111
02:45:37,440 --> 02:45:39,310
Nice, nice.

5112
02:45:40,380 --> 02:45:40,980
That was nice.

5113
02:45:40,980 --> 02:45:42,380
There are, like, those question marks. Whoa.

5114
02:45:42,380 --> 02:45:43,980
A squid came out! What?

5115
02:45:46,480 --> 02:45:47,980
You fell so far!

5116
02:45:47,980 --> 02:45:49,950
You nose-dived really far.

5117
02:45:49,450 --> 02:45:50,920
Come on.

5118
02:45:52,420 --> 02:45:55,820
I feel sorry for Mario.

5119
02:45:53,820 --> 02:45:55,820
Mario was big and he just...

5120
02:45:55,960 --> 02:45:56,690
What was that..?

5121
02:45:56,690 --> 02:45:58,330
I've never seen a stage like that.

5122
02:46:00,730 --> 02:46:04,470
Do you wanna take a break here for now?

5123
02:46:02,160 --> 02:46:04,130
Let's stop for a bit.

5124
02:46:04,130 --> 02:46:06,130
Cool down for a bit.

5125
02:46:04,630 --> 02:46:10,810
The game is put on hold. To the desk drawers.

5126
02:46:05,330 --> 02:46:06,130
Yes.

5127
02:46:06,900 --> 02:46:09,140
Do something different first.

5128
02:46:07,900 --> 02:46:09,140
Yes. Do these in order.

5129
02:46:09,140 --> 02:46:11,140
Come back to these now.

5130
02:46:11,140 --> 02:46:13,140
Let's cool down.

5131
02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:13,140
Yes.

5132
02:46:29,960 --> 02:46:31,430
Then...

5133
02:46:34,400 --> 02:46:36,500
Oh, I have nothing.

5134
02:46:37,730 --> 02:46:39,000
What?

5135
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:42,900
What... What is this?

5136
02:46:41,770 --> 02:46:45,070
There's no way there's nothing.

5137
02:46:44,170 --> 02:46:45,770
It's big.

5138
02:46:45,640 --> 02:46:48,610
What is this?

5139
02:46:47,610 --> 02:46:48,740
It's duralumin.

5140
02:46:48,740 --> 02:46:50,110
This is scary.

5141
02:46:51,180 --> 02:46:55,680
A mysterious duralumin case.

5142
02:46:51,580 --> 02:46:53,020
Is it heavy?

5143
02:46:53,020 --> 02:46:56,280
Well, it's not that heavy.

5144
02:47:01,160 --> 02:47:02,390
The electric shock that startles you is awful.

5145
02:47:02,390 --> 02:47:04,860
The electric shock that startles you is awful.

5146
02:47:06,700 --> 02:47:08,200
I'm gonna open it.

5147
02:47:12,700 --> 02:47:16,710
They're eyeglasses.

5148
02:47:15,870 --> 02:47:17,410
Eyeglasses.

5149
02:47:20,140 --> 02:47:21,440
What's this?

5150
02:47:21,340 --> 02:47:23,950
Could you try them on

5151
02:47:21,340 --> 02:47:23,950
just once?

5152
02:47:35,190 --> 02:47:37,660
These are amazing.

5153
02:47:36,760 --> 02:47:37,860
Amazing.

5154
02:47:36,790 --> 02:47:40,860
Super realistic novelty eyeglasses

5155
02:47:37,860 --> 02:47:39,590
Wow, amazing.

5156
02:47:42,230 --> 02:47:43,830
These are crazy.

5157
02:47:44,330 --> 02:47:48,100
He hasn't changed that much, but...

5158
02:47:48,100 --> 02:47:51,940
These are eyeglasses for Hamada, right?

5159
02:47:50,040 --> 02:47:52,040
No way.

5160
02:47:52,410 --> 02:47:53,710
If you...

5161
02:47:53,710 --> 02:47:57,550
wore those and went home,

5162
02:47:55,110 --> 02:47:57,550
that would freak out everyone.

5163
02:48:03,990 --> 02:48:05,720
They're really funny.

5164
02:48:05,720 --> 02:48:06,620
Amazing.

5165
02:48:06,620 --> 02:48:08,420
They're really funny.

5166
02:48:07,290 --> 02:48:08,420
These are amazing.

5167
02:48:08,420 --> 02:48:10,430
Such a sketchy face.

5168
02:48:10,890 --> 02:48:13,500
The color of the skin is the same.

5169
02:48:16,900 --> 02:48:18,900
Right, it's the color of Hamada's skin.

5170
02:48:18,900 --> 02:48:20,900
They actually matched the colors.

5171
02:48:20,900 --> 02:48:23,410
You don't know that.  Someone try them on.

5172
02:48:22,800 --> 02:48:26,880
5 kinds of novelty eyeglasses

5173
02:48:23,410 --> 02:48:24,670
Endo, try one.

5174
02:48:24,670 --> 02:48:27,240
I don't think it's for us.

5175
02:48:25,740 --> 02:48:27,240
Try them on.

5176
02:48:28,110 --> 02:48:29,680
I don't think it'll match.

5177
02:48:30,910 --> 02:48:33,150
Whoa, that's scary.

5178
02:48:32,610 --> 02:48:36,050
Endo makes that face sometimes.

5179
02:48:34,520 --> 02:48:36,550
It's Endo.

5180
02:48:37,490 --> 02:48:39,190
The difference is so subtle.

5181
02:48:39,190 --> 02:48:40,920
It's not that different?

5182
02:48:40,920 --> 02:48:41,660
It's so subtle, I'm telling you.

5183
02:48:41,660 --> 02:48:44,030
It's so subtle, I'm telling you.

5184
02:48:42,990 --> 02:48:45,190
There's no difference.

5185
02:48:44,190 --> 02:48:45,190
My face is like this sometimes?

5186
02:48:45,190 --> 02:48:46,700
Yeah, like that.

5187
02:48:48,100 --> 02:48:49,430
Ow, man, my leg.

5188
02:48:49,430 --> 02:48:51,430
That's really subtle.

5189
02:48:51,430 --> 02:48:54,000
It's really subtle.

5190
02:48:52,600 --> 02:48:54,000
Will it work for everyone?

5191
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
Try one of them, Hosei.

5192
02:49:00,640 --> 02:49:02,910
Hello.

5193
02:49:05,210 --> 02:49:07,280
Hello.

5194
02:49:05,910 --> 02:49:07,280
Hello.

5195
02:49:08,080 --> 02:49:11,120
This is actually like Yama.

5196
02:49:11,890 --> 02:49:13,320
That's amazing.

5197
02:49:13,320 --> 02:49:15,620
It's not weird to see him with a face like that.

5198
02:49:15,620 --> 02:49:17,260
Amazing.

5199
02:49:17,260 --> 02:49:19,060
There are times when Hosei's face is like that.

5200
02:49:19,060 --> 02:49:20,660
Right?

5201
02:49:20,660 --> 02:49:22,400
It matches you.

5202
02:49:22,400 --> 02:49:24,400
It's funnier when it's subtler.

5203
02:49:24,400 --> 02:49:26,400
Is each one matched for a specific person?

5204
02:49:26,400 --> 02:49:27,440
It totally matched you.

5205
02:49:27,440 --> 02:49:30,140
Tanaka, you haven't put one on yet.

5206
02:49:29,640 --> 02:49:32,870
I'm kinda scared of this one.

5207
02:49:32,870 --> 02:49:33,940
Hello.

5208
02:49:33,940 --> 02:49:35,310
Hello.

5209
02:49:34,580 --> 02:49:35,310
Hello.

5210
02:49:35,310 --> 02:49:37,210
It's Tanaka.

5211
02:49:37,210 --> 02:49:39,110
It doesn't feel out of place at all.

5212
02:49:39,980 --> 02:49:41,950
Tanaka, those aren't funny at all.

5213
02:49:41,950 --> 02:49:45,320
That's the worst outcome.

5214
02:49:45,990 --> 02:49:48,990
We had a good flow of laughs going one after another, right?

5215
02:49:48,190 --> 02:49:51,060
You're right, everyone was laughing so much, yeah.

5216
02:49:49,190 --> 02:49:51,060
Yeah, everyone was laughing.

5217
02:49:51,490 --> 02:49:53,090
Even though you guys laughed that much for me

5218
02:49:52,960 --> 02:49:55,130
Maybe these are each of our eyes

5219
02:49:54,100 --> 02:49:55,830
"Oh, it's Tanaka" and that's it

5220
02:49:54,930 --> 02:49:55,800
Wait, are you serious?

5221
02:49:55,960 --> 02:49:58,070
No no no, it's not even...

5222
02:49:58,200 --> 02:49:58,970
That's definitely Tanaka

5223
02:50:00,570 --> 02:50:01,600
It didn't change at all

5224
02:50:01,670 --> 02:50:02,800
There's a mirror here, a mirror

5225
02:50:03,470 --> 02:50:05,510
When Tanaka put them on...

5226
02:50:04,870 --> 02:50:06,880
Why do only Tanaka's not look any different at all?

5227
02:50:05,770 --> 02:50:07,210
This isn't any different

5228
02:50:06,940 --> 02:50:07,810
Tanaka, look this way

5229
02:50:07,310 --> 02:50:08,010
Are you serious?

5230
02:50:08,010 --> 02:50:08,740
That's Tanaka

5231
02:50:09,310 --> 02:50:10,180
That is Tanaka

5232
02:50:10,180 --> 02:50:10,610
Try this

5233
02:50:11,610 --> 02:50:12,110
Pardon me

5234
02:50:12,410 --> 02:50:15,250
If it's this one, I think it'd be different

5235
02:50:13,780 --> 02:50:14,180
Yes

5236
02:50:13,780 --> 02:50:14,350
You think so?

5237
02:50:16,890 --> 02:50:17,850
Greetings

5238
02:50:17,690 --> 02:50:18,150
Good morning

5239
02:50:18,150 --> 02:50:18,620
Good morning

5240
02:50:19,590 --> 02:50:20,290
This right here...

5241
02:50:20,590 --> 02:50:21,990
So scary

5242
02:50:22,190 --> 02:50:23,990
This one

5243
02:50:24,390 --> 02:50:25,460
This one's the one

5244
02:50:25,890 --> 02:50:26,490
This one

5245
02:50:26,530 --> 02:50:27,760
This is just...

5246
02:50:27,260 --> 02:50:28,060
So amazing...

5247
02:50:27,460 --> 02:50:28,830
This is the very bad Tanaka

5248
02:50:29,500 --> 02:50:30,500
Very bad

5249
02:50:30,370 --> 02:50:30,930
Is it?

5250
02:50:31,030 --> 02:50:31,800
That's our Tanaka

5251
02:50:31,830 --> 02:50:33,670
"Tanaka's such a bad guy!" is what people would say

5252
02:50:33,670 --> 02:50:35,340
"Tanaka's such a bad guy!" is what people would say

5253
02:50:34,570 --> 02:50:35,400
Really?

5254
02:50:36,340 --> 02:50:37,340
Oh, so it's this one

5255
02:50:37,670 --> 02:50:38,440
I'm this one

5256
02:50:37,740 --> 02:50:38,810
This one is Hamada-san's

5257
02:50:38,670 --> 02:50:40,110
Oh so that's why there's five of them

5258
02:50:39,070 --> 02:50:40,480
That's mine?

5259
02:50:39,940 --> 02:50:40,580
This is Hamada-san's

5260
02:50:40,780 --> 02:50:43,680
They may each be ours respectively

5261
02:50:42,010 --> 02:50:42,740
Each of ours

5262
02:50:43,180 --> 02:50:43,980
Just perhaps!

5263
02:50:44,010 --> 02:50:44,810
Matching

5264
02:50:44,250 --> 02:50:47,150
Since there's five of them

5265
02:50:45,880 --> 02:50:47,680
They'd probably all suit Hamada pretty well

5266
02:50:47,050 --> 02:50:47,880
Here, Matsumoto-san's

5267
02:50:47,350 --> 02:50:50,090
Hamada-san would probably look the best by a mile

5268
02:50:50,350 --> 02:50:51,450
This one... I don't know whose

5269
02:50:51,990 --> 02:50:55,820
This is the best selection, I believe

5270
02:50:53,560 --> 02:50:54,720
Best for the each of us

5271
02:50:53,820 --> 02:50:54,520
You serious?

5272
02:50:54,920 --> 02:50:57,130
See, Endo's doesn't look very different

5273
02:50:56,190 --> 02:50:57,230
It really doesn't

5274
02:50:56,860 --> 02:50:57,590
This is the best

5275
02:50:57,890 --> 02:50:58,690
This is the best selection

5276
02:51:03,800 --> 02:51:04,530
Hello

5277
02:51:07,440 --> 02:51:08,440
This is...

5278
02:51:08,840 --> 02:51:10,010
Tanaka's...

5279
02:51:09,800 --> 02:51:10,940
That's no good

5280
02:51:11,510 --> 02:51:12,640
Tanaka's is too funny

5281
02:51:12,840 --> 02:51:13,980
This is pretty amazing

5282
02:51:13,410 --> 02:51:15,040
This is amazing

5283
02:51:15,640 --> 02:51:17,010
Tanaka's is just...

5284
02:51:21,480 --> 02:51:23,950
Tanaka, really though, you look like a really bad dude

5285
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:24,650
If you go home like that,

5286
02:51:24,650 --> 02:51:25,590
"This year's 'No Laughing' must've been really stressful" is what they'll think

5287
02:51:25,590 --> 02:51:29,460
"This year's 'No Laughing' must've been really stressful" is what they'll think

5288
02:51:29,190 --> 02:51:30,460
It'd be like...

5289
02:51:32,660 --> 02:51:33,660
You're right

5290
02:51:34,060 --> 02:51:35,830
"What happened at this year's gathering?"

5291
02:51:35,930 --> 02:51:36,930
Amazing

5292
02:51:36,100 --> 02:51:37,830
They'd ask, "Did something happen?"

5293
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:39,130
This is amazing, seriously

5294
02:51:38,530 --> 02:51:39,900
Take that home with you

5295
02:51:39,130 --> 02:51:40,300
Are you serious?

5296
02:51:40,940 --> 02:51:42,240
What's going on..?

5297
02:51:42,070 --> 02:51:44,470
They'll think that you were deceived

5298
02:51:44,010 --> 02:51:45,170
Because you're bringing home that negative feeling from work

5299
02:51:45,170 --> 02:51:47,580
Because you're bringing home that negative feeling from work

5300
02:51:47,910 --> 02:51:51,110
Tanaka, that's a good one for you

5301
02:51:49,640 --> 02:51:51,710
But... Oh, so it's this kind of pattern

5302
02:51:51,110 --> 02:51:53,580
You should take this with you

5303
02:51:52,450 --> 02:51:53,580
Oh, it's that powerful?

5304
02:51:53,320 --> 02:51:54,180
Yeah, because...

5305
02:51:53,580 --> 02:51:55,050
When you're scolding your kid

5306
02:51:55,280 --> 02:51:56,550
Like, "Come over here for a moment"

5307
02:51:56,580 --> 02:51:58,220
Yeah, when you scold your kid or something

5308
02:51:58,290 --> 02:51:59,920
At those moments when you're like, "Knock it off!"

5309
02:51:59,990 --> 02:52:02,060
When you tell them to stop it and they do it anyway

5310
02:52:05,860 --> 02:52:09,630
I heard from your mother

5311
02:52:09,630 --> 02:52:11,130
What do you think you're doing?

5312
02:52:13,900 --> 02:52:15,400
Is this okay?

5313
02:52:14,700 --> 02:52:16,270
This is definitely good

5314
02:52:16,540 --> 02:52:18,240
They'll definitely start crying

5315
02:52:19,040 --> 02:52:20,310
It's so good

5316
02:52:23,180 --> 02:52:24,680
Tanaka, that's really good

5317
02:52:23,240 --> 02:52:24,680
That is amazing

5318
02:52:25,350 --> 02:52:26,720
But I'm so jealous of Hamada-san!

5319
02:52:26,820 --> 02:52:27,450
So good

5320
02:52:26,820 --> 02:52:27,780
Well, yeah

5321
02:52:27,920 --> 02:52:29,480
Yes, this is a very fun item

5322
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:30,350
Right because all of them were Hamada-san's

5323
02:52:30,920 --> 02:52:33,090
Alright then, Matsumoto-san

5324
02:52:36,830 --> 02:52:38,460
Nothing

5325
02:52:40,930 --> 02:52:43,200
Something's there

5326
02:52:42,530 --> 02:52:43,260
There's something

5327
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:46,170
A DVD for Matsumoto-san?

5328
02:52:44,830 --> 02:52:45,230
No...

5329
02:52:45,330 --> 02:52:46,230
No, it's paper

5330
02:52:45,700 --> 02:52:47,100
It's a paper envelope

5331
02:52:46,170 --> 02:52:50,340
Mysterious Envelope

5332
02:52:49,070 --> 02:52:50,140
Again, it's...

5333
02:52:49,940 --> 02:52:50,970
That's probably it

5334
02:52:52,770 --> 02:52:53,210
Nothing else

5335
02:52:53,210 --> 02:52:54,080
A pattern of one item

5336
02:52:53,940 --> 02:52:54,680
One-item pattern

5337
02:52:54,640 --> 02:52:55,310
Then I'm going to take a look

5338
02:52:55,310 --> 02:52:57,210
Then I'm going to take a look

5339
02:52:55,910 --> 02:52:56,610
I wonder what it is

5340
02:52:57,350 --> 02:52:58,480
Is it the Science Shock?

5341
02:53:01,650 --> 02:53:05,590
It looks like it's a command

5342
02:53:02,750 --> 02:53:03,550
Really?

5343
02:53:03,390 --> 02:53:04,150
Is it big?

5344
02:53:04,350 --> 02:53:05,450
Isn't it...

5345
02:53:06,860 --> 02:53:08,960
I wonder if this follows the pattern where only Matsumoto-san can look at it

5346
02:53:09,490 --> 02:53:20,600
10 Minute Joint Liability Card

5347
02:53:09,490 --> 02:53:20,600
10 minute

5348
02:53:09,490 --> 02:53:20,600
Joint Liability Card

5349
02:53:13,860 --> 02:53:15,360
Is it so difficult that you have to read it that carefully?

5350
02:53:15,700 --> 02:53:17,100
Your understanding will suffer...

5351
02:53:16,900 --> 02:53:17,500
Yes, that's right

5352
02:53:17,500 --> 02:53:19,370
It's really um... Yeah

5353
02:53:19,570 --> 02:53:20,500
Are we not allowed to look at it?

5354
02:53:22,270 --> 02:53:23,710
Should be okay for you guys to look, shouldn't it?

5355
02:53:23,910 --> 02:53:31,480
10 Minute Joint Liability Card

5356
02:53:23,910 --> 02:53:31,480
Explanation of the Rules

5357
02:53:24,910 --> 02:53:26,780
The item that came from Matsumoto's drawer

5358
02:53:27,110 --> 02:53:29,440
is the 10 Minute Joint Liability Card

5359
02:53:29,910 --> 02:53:31,350
Let us explain the rules

5360
02:53:31,980 --> 02:53:48,760
10 Minute Joint Liability Card Rules

5361
02:53:32,080 --> 02:53:48,760
Matsumoto

5362
02:53:32,110 --> 02:53:48,760
Endo

5363
02:53:32,110 --> 02:53:48,760
Hamada

5364
02:53:32,110 --> 02:53:48,760
Hosei

5365
02:53:32,110 --> 02:53:48,760
Tanaka

5366
02:53:32,150 --> 02:53:48,760
Card User

5367
02:53:33,180 --> 02:53:34,780
If this card is used

5368
02:53:35,480 --> 02:53:37,720
If any of the members except Matsumoto

5369
02:53:37,550 --> 02:53:48,760
LOL

5370
02:53:38,390 --> 02:53:40,090
Even if one person laughs

5371
02:53:40,620 --> 02:53:48,760
Punishment

5372
02:53:40,620 --> 02:53:48,760
Punishment

5373
02:53:40,620 --> 02:53:48,760
Punishment

5374
02:53:40,620 --> 02:53:48,760
Punishment

5375
02:53:41,690 --> 02:53:43,760
As part of a joint liability, all four of them will receive punishment

5376
02:53:43,760 --> 02:53:47,100
As part of a joint liability, all four of them will receive punishment

5377
02:53:48,760 --> 02:53:51,900
For example, let's say Matsumoto-san uses this...

5378
02:53:51,900 --> 02:53:53,840
If Hamada-san laughs by himself, we also get the punishment

5379
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:57,510
If Hamada-san laughs by himself, we also get the punishment

5380
02:53:55,440 --> 02:53:57,840
So therefore, none of us should laugh. However,

5381
02:53:57,710 --> 02:54:06,110
If Matsumoto himself laughs,

5382
02:53:57,710 --> 02:54:06,110
Supplemental Rule

5383
02:53:57,710 --> 02:54:06,110
he receives a punishment, as usual

5384
02:54:00,910 --> 02:54:01,710
Oh, I see

5385
02:54:01,080 --> 02:54:02,640
So I'm just the stand-alone

5386
02:54:01,940 --> 02:54:02,710
Yes, you're the stand-alone

5387
02:54:02,940 --> 02:54:04,150
Yes, but this...

5388
02:54:04,580 --> 02:54:05,880
In terms of probability, this isn't good

5389
02:54:06,250 --> 02:54:07,480
Then this card, I'll

5390
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:08,720
use this when I please for the 10-minute duration

5391
02:54:08,720 --> 02:54:10,190
use this when I please for the 10-minute duration

5392
02:54:10,990 --> 02:54:19,290
A certain man will experience hell

5393
02:54:10,990 --> 02:54:19,290
The use of the card causes

5394
02:54:11,250 --> 02:54:13,590
Later on, when the card is triggered

5395
02:54:14,160 --> 02:54:15,260
A certain man

5396
02:54:15,990 --> 02:54:18,190
will experience hell

5397
02:54:19,690 --> 02:54:21,100
4:30 PM

5398
02:54:20,160 --> 02:54:24,770
Detective Duties: 8 hours and 30 minutes

5399
02:54:21,560 --> 02:54:24,370
Right when everyone feels anxious about when that card will be used

5400
02:54:29,470 --> 02:54:30,040
Maybe I should use it

5401
02:54:30,040 --> 02:54:31,810
Maybe I should use it

5402
02:54:31,810 --> 02:54:38,180
10 Minute

5403
02:54:31,810 --> 02:54:38,180
10 Minute Joint Liability Card

5404
02:54:31,810 --> 02:54:38,180
Joint Liability Card

5405
02:54:34,040 --> 02:54:36,710
So no matter who laughs, all of you get... Right?

5406
02:54:38,850 --> 02:54:40,680
Maybe right around now is the time to use it...

5407
02:54:40,720 --> 02:54:42,450
Huh?

5408
02:54:43,590 --> 02:54:45,550
Alright now

5409
02:54:46,590 --> 02:54:48,760
A new mission just came in

5410
02:54:49,860 --> 02:54:51,160
Truth is, from now, we're going to investigate a certain facility, but

5411
02:54:51,160 --> 02:54:53,900
Truth is, from now, we're going to investigate a certain facility, but

5412
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:56,730
Within the group, only the most superior person

5413
02:54:57,070 --> 02:55:05,240
Special Mission

5414
02:54:57,070 --> 02:55:05,240
Superior Detective Alone Will Do an Infiltration Investigation

5415
02:54:57,600 --> 02:54:58,500
may enter

5416
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:00,100
So...

5417
02:55:00,300 --> 02:55:01,100
Only one person...?

5418
02:55:01,340 --> 02:55:01,970
Only one person

5419
02:55:02,540 --> 02:55:04,270
Even if you say "superior", I think everyone...

5420
02:55:03,670 --> 02:55:04,310
Hosei, that means you!!

5421
02:55:04,310 --> 02:55:05,240
Hosei, that means you!!

5422
02:55:06,040 --> 02:55:07,780
You have to prepare, so could you come over here?

5423
02:55:07,840 --> 02:55:09,310
Wait a minute please

5424
02:55:09,310 --> 02:55:10,450
Why is it me?

5425
02:55:10,450 --> 02:55:11,880
You're the most superior one, so you're going to the next mission

5426
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:13,250
You're the most superior one, so you're going to the next mission

5427
02:55:13,250 --> 02:55:15,580
I am?

5428
02:55:14,220 --> 02:55:14,650
Yep

5429
02:55:16,680 --> 02:55:19,820
What kind of investigation is it?

5430
02:55:18,650 --> 02:55:19,550
Yes, that's right

5431
02:55:19,820 --> 02:55:22,090
Whatever, just come. Let's go

5432
02:55:22,090 --> 02:55:25,260
No, I can't

5433
02:55:23,790 --> 02:55:24,460
It's okay, Hosei

5434
02:55:26,660 --> 02:55:27,160
Let's go

5435
02:55:30,530 --> 02:55:31,230
Good luck...

5436
02:55:31,300 --> 02:55:32,200
Hurry up, let's go

5437
02:55:34,040 --> 02:55:38,770
I'm only getting a bad feeling about this

5438
02:55:39,410 --> 02:55:40,540
Well, it's not like...

5439
02:55:41,240 --> 02:55:41,980
What is...

5440
02:55:41,510 --> 02:55:42,640
He's got a point there

5441
02:55:43,110 --> 02:55:44,310
Getting called out alone

5442
02:55:46,710 --> 02:55:47,520
What the hell

5443
02:55:47,380 --> 02:55:50,180
Didn't he just laugh?

5444
02:55:48,680 --> 02:55:49,750
He definitely did

5445
02:55:49,120 --> 02:55:49,950
Yes, he did laugh just then

5446
02:55:50,180 --> 02:55:53,190
Tanaka, you laughed too

5447
02:55:51,520 --> 02:55:52,890
No no, I should be safe

5448
02:55:52,490 --> 02:55:53,250
Tanaka laughed too

5449
02:55:53,090 --> 02:55:55,490
No, I'm safe, but Hosei-san laughed just then...

5450
02:55:56,060 --> 02:55:57,390
There's no way he'll be like, "I'm glad I went!"

5451
02:55:57,390 --> 02:56:00,300
There's no way he'll be like, "I'm glad I went!"

5452
02:55:58,430 --> 02:55:59,590
Yes, that's absolutely right

5453
02:55:59,360 --> 02:56:00,130
In the past...

5454
02:56:00,500 --> 02:56:03,500
Just what the hell?

5455
02:56:03,670 --> 02:56:09,770
The Superior Detective's Infiltration Investigation Entails...

5456
02:56:03,800 --> 02:56:05,300
What is it that makes me "superior"?

5457
02:56:04,830 --> 02:56:08,500
The superior detective Hosei's infiltration investigation entails...

5458
02:56:10,040 --> 02:56:12,310
What is this?

5459
02:56:12,740 --> 02:56:13,140
Once you change, go back to the room

5460
02:56:13,140 --> 02:56:16,810
Once you change, go back to the room

5461
02:56:17,080 --> 02:56:18,450
On the other hand, right at this moment

5462
02:56:19,010 --> 02:56:24,090
The 4 of them are resuming their game

5463
02:56:20,550 --> 02:56:22,380
In the room, they are resuming their game

5464
02:56:24,090 --> 02:57:37,060
21st Attempt

5465
02:56:24,090 --> 02:57:37,060
Clear one course on "Super Mario Maker"

5466
02:56:24,090 --> 02:57:37,060
Kaijin Nijuu Mensou's Written Challenge

5467
02:56:24,090 --> 02:57:37,060
Tanaka Naoki

5468
02:56:24,450 --> 02:56:25,520
Aghhh

5469
02:56:26,220 --> 02:56:26,990
Get up there

5470
02:56:27,390 --> 02:56:28,460
Right now, you can go

5471
02:56:27,420 --> 02:56:28,260
Ahh!

5472
02:56:28,660 --> 02:56:29,320
Good good

5473
02:56:29,390 --> 02:56:30,760
Wait a minute... Okay okay

5474
02:56:31,190 --> 02:56:31,860
Go now

5475
02:56:31,330 --> 02:56:31,890
JUMP!!

5476
02:56:31,960 --> 02:56:33,700
If you get to the next part...

5477
02:56:33,260 --> 02:56:36,560
Not that way, just keep going down, oh look at what you did

5478
02:56:36,760 --> 02:56:38,030
Land... Jump!

5479
02:56:38,270 --> 02:56:39,430
There's land down there, land

5480
02:56:40,540 --> 02:56:41,570
Whoa, looking good

5481
02:56:41,670 --> 02:56:45,170
Surprisingly, the newbie Tanaka establishes a new record

5482
02:56:46,270 --> 02:56:47,310
This part is what scares me

5483
02:56:46,940 --> 02:56:48,040
Just ignore them, ignore

5484
02:56:50,010 --> 02:56:50,750
Get up, get up!

5485
02:56:51,010 --> 02:56:52,110
There's still more to it

5486
02:56:51,580 --> 02:56:52,410
That looked like the end

5487
02:56:52,110 --> 02:56:53,050
What are you supposed to do here?

5488
02:56:53,450 --> 02:56:54,480
Oh man!!

5489
02:56:54,850 --> 02:56:55,650
Fire!!

5490
02:56:57,190 --> 02:56:57,650
Now...

5491
02:56:58,690 --> 02:56:59,650
Ah, you should've went

5492
02:57:00,250 --> 02:57:01,720
Where... What is the timing?

5493
02:57:02,460 --> 02:57:02,890
Now!

5494
02:57:02,990 --> 02:57:03,860
Oh, I'm sorry

5495
02:57:03,960 --> 02:57:04,990
One more time, one more time...

5496
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:08,530
Now!!

5497
02:57:11,770 --> 02:57:12,900
Oh, that thing!

5498
02:57:12,100 --> 02:57:13,870
Get on that thing and go up!

5499
02:57:14,940 --> 02:57:16,040
What's this? Ah!!

5500
02:57:16,570 --> 02:57:18,170
That's dangerous! Watch out, they're coming!

5501
02:57:17,710 --> 02:57:18,710
Jump, big jump!

5502
02:57:19,140 --> 02:57:19,870
Just like that

5503
02:57:20,010 --> 02:57:20,810
The bullets are there!

5504
02:57:20,980 --> 02:57:21,340
Big jump!

5505
02:57:21,340 --> 02:57:22,680
Yes yes... The bullet!

5506
02:57:22,180 --> 02:57:24,610
JUMP!!

5507
02:57:22,180 --> 02:57:24,610
JUMP!!

5508
02:57:23,580 --> 02:57:24,150
What do I do?!

5509
02:57:24,050 --> 02:57:26,050
Over there, you go...

5510
02:57:24,910 --> 02:57:26,080
Bullet, bullet, BULLET!!

5511
02:57:26,480 --> 02:57:28,080
Go that way, that way!!

5512
02:57:26,480 --> 02:57:28,080
You can jump on the bullet too, whichever

5513
02:57:26,950 --> 02:57:27,950
Go down

5514
02:57:28,620 --> 02:57:29,420
Bullet!!

5515
02:57:28,850 --> 02:57:29,880
You can jump on the bullet too

5516
02:57:30,050 --> 02:57:31,150
Why don't you go down there?

5517
02:57:31,150 --> 02:57:32,020
Hold on, down there?

5518
02:57:31,520 --> 02:57:33,490
Down... Below there

5519
02:57:33,490 --> 02:57:34,290
Hurry and get it...

5520
02:57:35,020 --> 02:57:36,690
What are you doing?!

5521
02:57:36,860 --> 02:57:38,030
That was so important

5522
02:57:39,860 --> 02:57:40,530
My bad

5523
02:57:42,030 --> 02:57:43,500
You were so close

5524
02:57:42,560 --> 02:57:44,300
I think I might've laughed

5525
02:57:44,570 --> 02:57:47,000
You were so close

5526
02:57:44,730 --> 02:57:45,930
Yes, I made it pretty far

5527
02:57:45,670 --> 02:57:47,200
No, but really, I can see what you have to do now

5528
02:57:47,670 --> 02:57:49,940
How did everyone get so good?

5529
02:57:49,140 --> 02:57:50,840
Just, like, give me a little break...

5530
02:57:51,140 --> 02:57:52,510
Yeah well, just now

5531
02:57:52,770 --> 02:57:54,010
I think I got too fired up

5532
02:57:54,240 --> 02:57:54,880
Alright then you're up, Hamada

5533
02:57:54,880 --> 02:57:57,950
Alright then you're up, Hamada

5534
02:57:56,810 --> 02:57:59,110
Please, I think that was the homestretch

5535
02:57:57,080 --> 02:57:58,810
So, just like how he did before

5536
02:57:59,280 --> 02:58:04,320
22nd Attempt

5537
02:57:59,280 --> 02:58:04,320
Clear one course on "Super Mario Maker"

5538
02:57:59,280 --> 02:58:04,320
Hamada Masatoshi

02:57:59,280 --> 02:58:04,320
Kaijin Nijuu Mensou's Written Challenge

5540
02:57:59,950 --> 02:58:01,450
I wonder why...

5541
02:58:04,890 --> 02:58:06,120
You didn't do anything!!

5542
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:09,320
You didn't do anything at all!!

5543
02:58:11,130 --> 02:58:11,830
Never play this again

5544
02:58:11,590 --> 02:58:12,430
You're kidding, right?

5545
02:58:13,230 --> 02:58:15,560
Never touch the damn game again!!

5546
02:58:17,630 --> 02:58:20,400
For reals, never play this again, damnit

5547
02:58:21,040 --> 02:58:23,300
Is it still gonna take a while?

5548
02:58:23,500 --> 02:58:25,710
But gradually...

5549
02:58:24,540 --> 02:58:25,210
But I think we made it through a lot of it, I think

5550
02:58:25,210 --> 02:58:27,080
But I think we made it through a lot of it, I think

5551
02:58:26,170 --> 02:58:26,940
Oh, yes, I agree

5552
02:58:27,080 --> 02:58:28,410
About 80% of it?

5553
02:58:27,640 --> 02:58:29,240
We should've got there...

5554
02:58:28,410 --> 02:58:30,210
I definitely got 80% of it

5555
02:58:34,720 --> 02:58:40,090
Infiltration Investigation as Kekko Kamen

5556
02:58:34,720 --> 02:58:43,860
Notes: Kekko Kamen was originally a manga serialized in Shonen Jump in 1974. This hero is actually a girl who wears nothing but a mask, gloves, and boots and fights the teachers at her school who torture students for sexual pleasure

5557
02:58:53,570 --> 02:58:54,340
He's laughing

5558
02:58:57,940 --> 02:58:58,740
They made you look horrible

5559
02:58:58,570 --> 02:59:00,070
Why do you look like you're crying?

5560
02:59:01,410 --> 02:59:02,480
That's just cruel

5561
02:59:08,480 --> 02:59:10,250
If you don't mind me asking, what happened to you?

5562
02:59:10,250 --> 02:59:12,020
If you don't mind me asking, what happened to you?

5563
02:59:12,020 --> 02:59:13,420
What happened to me? This happened to me

5564
02:59:13,450 --> 02:59:14,360
I was told that I'm the superior one so go in this room

5565
02:59:14,360 --> 02:59:15,920
I was told that I'm the superior one so go in this room

5566
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:18,430
You're superior so please get changed

5567
02:59:18,760 --> 02:59:20,230
We are detectives so...

5568
02:59:20,230 --> 02:59:22,730
We are detectives so...

5569
02:59:22,730 --> 02:59:25,370
I don't get it either, you know

5570
02:59:28,600 --> 02:59:29,100
I don't understand the concept at all

5571
02:59:29,100 --> 02:59:31,640
I don't understand the concept at all

5572
02:59:33,780 --> 02:59:36,510
Aren't you cold?

5573
02:59:35,010 --> 02:59:36,080
I feel very cold

5574
02:59:36,510 --> 02:59:38,010
If you laugh now, it's going to be a terrible situation for you

5575
02:59:38,010 --> 02:59:40,380
If you laugh now, it's going to be a terrible situation for you

5576
02:59:38,980 --> 02:59:39,510
Yeah, definitely

5577
02:59:40,350 --> 02:59:41,220
How does your backside look?

5578
02:59:42,550 --> 02:59:43,850
Just completely naked

5579
02:59:47,020 --> 02:59:47,990
But this time

5580
02:59:49,660 --> 02:59:50,420
Even if you laugh, no one will know

5581
02:59:50,420 --> 02:59:53,030
Even if you laugh, no one will know

5582
02:59:55,130 --> 02:59:58,930
If you wear

5583
02:59:55,630 --> 02:59:58,930
those glasses from earlier,

5584
02:59:57,500 --> 02:59:58,930
you'll be hidden

5585
02:59:58,930 --> 03:00:00,740
I guess you're right

5586
02:59:59,370 --> 03:00:00,740
Wait... What glasses?

5587
03:00:01,900 --> 03:00:04,170
Won't it be bad if you talk with them?

5588
03:00:01,900 --> 03:00:09,910
Hiding his eyes with funny glasses

5589
03:00:04,170 --> 03:00:06,170
It'll be fine if I don't say anything!

5590
03:00:06,970 --> 03:00:10,650
But is it really alright to be hide both his eyes and mouth?

5591
03:00:10,650 --> 03:00:14,450
I think it'll be great if he can hide his mouth and his eyes

5592
03:00:17,150 --> 03:00:19,320
SCARY!!

5593
03:00:19,550 --> 03:00:21,160
Damn that's scary!

5594
03:00:21,120 --> 03:00:21,690
Scary!

5595
03:00:22,620 --> 03:00:24,960
This is way too scary!

5596
03:00:25,690 --> 03:00:26,030
BAD!

5597
03:00:26,030 --> 03:00:26,360
BAD!

5598
03:00:26,360 --> 03:00:26,760
BAD!

5599
03:00:26,760 --> 03:00:28,360
This is bad!

5600
03:00:28,360 --> 03:00:29,730
That's so scary!

5601
03:00:31,530 --> 03:00:34,370
Alright quit it for a bit, Hosei!

5602
03:00:34,370 --> 03:00:35,770
Let's stop this, Hosei!

5603
03:00:35,770 --> 03:00:37,770
What was that?

5604
03:00:36,500 --> 03:00:37,770
Let's stop that!

5605
03:00:38,670 --> 03:00:40,980
Let's stop with that!

5606
03:00:39,540 --> 03:00:40,980
Well... Honestly....

5607
03:00:41,040 --> 03:00:43,740
What if we make him a different person?

5608
03:00:42,440 --> 03:00:43,680
Yeah, let's change him

5609
03:00:44,710 --> 03:00:46,250
The compatibility just isn't there

5610
03:00:46,250 --> 03:00:47,450
This character is no good!

5611
03:00:48,550 --> 03:00:51,850
This is

5612
03:00:49,220 --> 03:00:51,850
honestly so scary

5613
03:00:51,850 --> 03:00:53,220
But one of these has to match

5614
03:00:53,220 --> 03:00:56,820
His pervert level

5615
03:00:54,960 --> 03:00:56,820
really has increased

5616
03:00:55,260 --> 03:00:56,190
You've got that right

5617
03:01:11,040 --> 03:01:12,170
Japan is finished

5618
03:01:16,840 --> 03:01:18,310
Enough, Yamazaki!

5619
03:01:18,450 --> 03:01:19,680
There's no reason for this

5620
03:01:21,480 --> 03:01:23,380
Endo is laughing again

5621
03:01:23,380 --> 03:01:24,320
Damn this pisses me off!

5622
03:01:27,050 --> 03:01:27,890
Please stop it, Hosei!

5623
03:01:29,060 --> 03:01:30,020
Please stop it!

5624
03:01:30,190 --> 03:01:32,460
I couldn't handle it anymore

5625
03:01:33,900 --> 03:01:37,630
What the hell is the deal with

5626
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,630
that figure?

5627
03:01:36,160 --> 03:01:37,630
This is no good!

5628
03:01:39,100 --> 03:01:42,340
We're supposed to be

5629
03:01:40,030 --> 03:01:42,340
detectives

5630
03:01:45,810 --> 03:01:48,810
Isn't this guy a little hopeless?

5631
03:01:49,210 --> 03:01:51,080
Yeah just a bit

5632
03:01:57,490 --> 03:02:02,490
Shit, this is bad!

5633
03:02:02,990 --> 03:02:04,560
ALRIGHT!!

5634
03:02:06,430 --> 03:02:07,330
This is terrible!

5635
03:02:07,330 --> 03:02:11,370
I'm going to use my 10-minute Joint Liability card!

5636
03:02:10,030 --> 03:02:10,560
This is bad!

5637
03:02:11,670 --> 03:02:19,970
Room Announcer

5638
03:02:12,700 --> 03:02:13,800
Please wait a second!

5639
03:02:13,170 --> 03:02:16,800
For the next 10 minutes, the Joint Liability Card will be active

5640
03:02:16,940 --> 03:02:19,970
For the 10 minutes you will all have Joint Liability

5641
03:02:20,210 --> 03:02:20,680
Wait a sec!

5642
03:02:22,310 --> 03:02:24,280
From now on, if any of us laugh...

5643
03:02:24,350 --> 03:02:26,610
Wait wait wait! It's fine!

5644
03:02:24,550 --> 03:02:37,530
From now on, whenever Hamada, Hosei, Endo, or

5645
03:02:24,550 --> 03:02:37,530
Joint Liability Rule

5646
03:02:24,550 --> 03:02:37,530
Tanaka laugh, all 4 of them are punished

5647
03:02:27,180 --> 03:02:30,750
Why are you trying to make me laugh!?

5648
03:02:33,220 --> 03:02:35,260
It's really not that funny

5649
03:02:35,260 --> 03:02:36,060
It'll be fine!

5650
03:02:36,060 --> 03:02:38,130
This one laughs all the time though!

5651
03:02:38,130 --> 03:02:40,660
Honestly, it wasn't

5652
03:02:38,830 --> 03:02:40,660
that funny

5653
03:02:41,330 --> 03:02:43,660
Please just wait a second!

5654
03:02:44,270 --> 03:02:46,170
Won't the glasses be really bad?

5655
03:02:46,170 --> 03:02:47,100
It'll be fine!

5656
03:02:53,010 --> 03:02:55,010
W-Wait...

5657
03:02:55,140 --> 03:02:57,510
He's already laughing like it's nothing!

5658
03:02:59,650 --> 03:03:00,250
WHY!?

5659
03:03:00,980 --> 03:03:02,020
WHY!?

5660
03:03:02,550 --> 03:03:04,390
W-WAIT A SECOND!

5661
03:03:04,390 --> 03:03:04,790
WHY!?

5662
03:03:04,790 --> 03:03:07,120
So this is what it does!!

5663
03:03:06,020 --> 03:03:07,150
I'M NOT LAUGHING!

5664
03:03:07,150 --> 03:03:09,560
NO ONE WAS LAUGHING!

5665
03:03:09,560 --> 03:03:11,490
W-WAIT!

5666
03:03:11,490 --> 03:03:11,530

AHHHHH!!

5668
03:03:20,030 --> 03:03:21,170
I can't do this!

5669
03:03:21,200 --> 03:03:22,840
I can't deal with this!

5670
03:03:23,040 --> 03:03:24,110
Stop it!

5671
03:03:25,470 --> 03:03:27,610
If you yell it that loud!

5672
03:03:27,610 --> 03:03:29,680
We can't handle it if you yell!

5673
03:03:29,880 --> 03:03:31,050
PLEASE JUST TRY TO HOLD THROUGH!

5674
03:03:32,350 --> 03:03:32,380
AHHH!!

5675
03:03:32,380 --> 03:03:32,410

T-This is terrible!

5746
03:03:42,360 --> 03:03:43,820
My ass is gonna be destroyed!!

5747
03:03:43,820 --> 03:03:45,660
If you keep yelling,

5748
03:03:44,530 --> 03:03:45,660
we won't be able to hold it in!

5749
03:03:45,660 --> 03:03:46,860
My ass...

5750
03:03:48,730 --> 03:03:48,760
AHHH!!

5751
03:03:48,760 --> 03:03:48,800
AHHH!!

5752
03:03:48,800 --> 03:03:48,830
AHHH!!

5753
03:03:48,830 --> 03:03:48,860
AHHH!!

5754
03:03:48,860 --> 03:03:49,830
AHHH!!

5755
03:03:52,570 --> 03:03:53,130
It must hurt!

5756
03:03:53,130 --> 03:03:55,240
That joint liability card is amazing

5757
03:03:53,470 --> 03:03:55,200
I can't do this!

5758
03:03:56,500 --> 03:03:59,870
This is just evil!

5759
03:04:00,410 --> 03:04:01,840
Give me a break...

5760
03:04:02,210 --> 03:04:04,210
Honestly,

5761
03:04:02,710 --> 03:04:04,210
my ass is gonna be destroyed!

5762
03:04:06,050 --> 03:04:08,720
Don't look anymore!

5763
03:04:09,180 --> 03:04:11,650
Let's just all calm down

5764
03:04:10,150 --> 03:04:11,650
with your violin!

5765
03:04:11,650 --> 03:04:14,260
Enough!

5766
03:04:12,290 --> 03:04:14,260
Make sure you don't look!

5767
03:04:19,830 --> 03:04:20,430
Wait a second!

5768
03:04:21,700 --> 03:04:22,600
This is bad!

5769
03:04:23,200 --> 03:04:24,070
Wait a second!

5770
03:04:24,300 --> 03:04:24,900
Seriously!

5771
03:04:25,170 --> 03:04:25,570
impossible!

5772
03:04:25,170 --> 03:04:27,070
This is

5773
03:04:25,570 --> 03:04:25,830
impossible!

5774
03:04:25,830 --> 03:04:27,070
impossible!

5775
03:04:27,470 --> 03:04:28,440
This is seriously impossible!

5776
03:04:28,900 --> 03:04:30,070
This is impossible!

5777
03:04:30,270 --> 03:04:30,300
AAHHH!!

5778
03:04:30,300 --> 03:04:30,340
AAHHH!!

5779
03:04:30,340 --> 03:04:30,440
AAHHH!!

5780
03:04:30,440 --> 03:04:30,570
AAHHH!!

5781
03:04:30,570 --> 03:04:30,810
AAHHH!!

5782
03:04:30,810 --> 03:04:31,440
AAHHH!!

5783
03:04:31,440 --> 03:04:32,140
AAHHH!!

5784
03:04:32,140 --> 03:04:32,240
AAHHH!!

5785
03:04:36,010 --> 03:04:36,710
This is...

5786
03:04:36,710 --> 03:04:37,910
This is terrible!

5787
03:04:37,910 --> 03:04:38,450
This is bad!

5788
03:04:38,450 --> 03:04:40,780
It's hell...

5789
03:04:38,950 --> 03:04:40,780
Hell!

5790
03:04:39,650 --> 03:04:40,950
This is honestly impossible!

5791
03:04:40,950 --> 03:04:41,720
Why?

5792
03:04:41,820 --> 03:04:43,420
My ass is seriously....

5793
03:04:43,450 --> 03:04:46,920
Well, I don't know but it hasn't been 10 minutes yet!

5794
03:04:47,090 --> 03:04:48,860
It'd be a waste...

5795
03:04:47,560 --> 03:04:49,160
Wait a sec!

5796
03:04:49,460 --> 03:04:52,890
Rather than that one use this one!

5797
03:04:51,790 --> 03:04:52,890
Let's all calm down now!

5798
03:04:54,830 --> 03:04:58,630
This is the time to play your violin!

5799
03:04:56,030 --> 03:04:58,630
I just want to see you play it!

5800
03:04:58,630 --> 03:05:00,870
You'd better not laugh!

5801
03:05:02,300 --> 03:05:05,010
If you guys laugh,

5802
03:05:03,170 --> 03:05:05,010
I'll be really pissed!

5803
03:05:04,370 --> 03:05:05,010
Got it!

5804
03:05:05,010 --> 03:05:07,540
Promise me!

5805
03:05:05,840 --> 03:05:07,540
I promise!

5806
03:05:05,840 --> 03:05:07,540
I promise!

5807
03:05:12,010 --> 03:05:12,650
What the hell is this?

5808
03:05:30,970 --> 03:05:31,700
It's no good

5809
03:05:32,900 --> 03:05:34,170
Wait, really!?

5810
03:05:34,170 --> 03:05:35,770
Stop it already!

5811
03:05:35,770 --> 03:05:36,340
Stop!

5812
03:05:36,340 --> 03:05:37,040
Stop!

5813
03:05:38,170 --> 03:05:38,210
AHHHH!!

5814
03:05:38,210 --> 03:05:38,240
AHHHH!!

5815
03:05:38,240 --> 03:05:38,310
AHHHH!!

5816
03:05:38,310 --> 03:05:38,410
AHHHH!!

5817
03:05:38,410 --> 03:05:38,540
AHHHH!!

5818
03:05:38,540 --> 03:05:38,710
AHHHH!!

5819
03:05:38,710 --> 03:05:38,870
AHHHH!!

5820
03:05:38,870 --> 03:05:39,440
AHHHH!!

5821
03:05:44,040 --> 03:05:46,780
I can't do this! I can't do this anymore!

5822
03:05:45,450 --> 03:05:46,780
This is impossible!

5823
03:05:46,780 --> 03:05:47,720
He keeps yelling

5824
03:05:47,720 --> 03:05:50,580
When he yells, I can't hold it in anymore!

5825
03:05:49,420 --> 03:05:50,420
Ouch!

5826
03:05:50,780 --> 03:05:52,450
It would be nice if we could put this to rest

5827
03:05:52,650 --> 03:05:53,820
Pufufuu

5828
03:05:59,090 --> 03:06:00,130
WHO LAUGHED!?

5829
03:06:00,930 --> 03:06:02,560
It was Endo!

5830
03:06:04,730 --> 03:06:06,170
WHY THE HELL DID YOU LAUGH!?

5831
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,400
AHHH

5832
03:06:07,770 --> 03:06:09,400
HAHAHA

5833
03:06:12,110 --> 03:06:15,540
Wait!

5834
03:06:12,870 --> 03:06:15,540
This is really bad!

5835
03:06:16,040 --> 03:06:17,080
I'm honestly sorry!

5836
03:06:17,910 --> 03:06:20,980
His ass is really

5837
03:06:19,150 --> 03:06:20,980
not that well liked!

5838
03:06:20,980 --> 03:06:23,720
Endo, you have to hold it together!

5839
03:06:21,880 --> 03:06:23,720
I'm honestly sorry!

5840
03:06:24,120 --> 03:06:26,920
Speaking of that, I don't think you're doing too well

5841
03:06:29,920 --> 03:06:33,730
Attention

5842
03:06:33,730 --> 03:06:38,500
It's been quite a while...

5843
03:06:35,360 --> 03:06:38,500
Has 10 minutes passed yet?

5844
03:06:38,570 --> 03:06:39,970
How much time is left?

5845
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:44,440
WHO LAUGHED!?

5846
03:06:44,440 --> 03:06:44,470
WHO LAUGHED!?

5847
03:06:44,470 --> 03:06:44,510
WHO LAUGHED!?

5848
03:06:44,510 --> 03:06:46,110
WHO LAUGHED!?

5849
03:06:47,170 --> 03:06:48,440
WHO LAUGHED!?

5850
03:06:48,580 --> 03:06:50,580
It was Tanaka!

5851
03:06:48,940 --> 03:06:50,480
It was because of this!

5852
03:06:50,480 --> 03:06:51,310
WHY WERE YOU LAUGHING!?

5853
03:06:51,310 --> 03:06:53,310
Because he was wearing the glasses

5854
03:06:53,310 --> 03:06:54,480
How many minutes are left?

5855
03:06:53,350 --> 03:06:54,150
I'm sorry!

5856
03:06:54,550 --> 03:06:55,020
Sorry!

5857
03:06:55,320 --> 03:06:59,050
AHHHHH

5858
03:06:56,050 --> 03:06:59,050
HAHAHA

5859
03:06:56,420 --> 03:06:57,790
I'm sorry!

5860
03:06:59,050 --> 03:07:00,820
I'm sorry, Hosei!

5861
03:07:00,820 --> 03:07:02,020
I'm sorry too!

5862
03:07:02,020 --> 03:07:03,990
Enough! This is honestly impossible!

5863
03:07:03,260 --> 03:07:04,120
I'm sorry!

5864
03:07:03,990 --> 03:07:06,590
Enough! This is honestly impossible!

5865
03:07:07,390 --> 03:07:08,200
Sorry!

5866
03:07:07,830 --> 03:07:10,530
I don't need the 10 minutes anymore!

5867
03:07:09,100 --> 03:07:10,530
So you can stop it now!

5868
03:07:12,130 --> 03:07:14,500
Can you tell me how many minutes are left?

5869
03:07:14,500 --> 03:07:16,970
Wait a second....

5870
03:07:18,410 --> 03:07:19,870
How many minutes..?

5871
03:07:19,970 --> 03:07:21,310
This was pretty tough huh?

5872
03:07:22,980 --> 03:07:23,910
Who laughed?

5873
03:07:24,380 --> 03:07:24,580
No!

5874
03:07:24,580 --> 03:07:25,050
Who was it?

5875
03:07:26,650 --> 03:07:27,820
IT WAS MATSUMOTO!?

5876
03:07:27,820 --> 03:07:29,150
W-Wait a second!

5877
03:07:31,550 --> 03:07:33,850
AHHHH!!

5878
03:07:34,360 --> 03:07:36,390
Wait! This is honestly impossible!

5879
03:07:36,920 --> 03:07:37,930
This is honestly impossible!

5880
03:07:38,530 --> 03:07:39,160
Wait!

5881
03:07:40,930 --> 03:07:41,700
Wait!

5882
03:07:43,330 --> 03:07:46,100
People from Nippon TV

5883
03:07:46,170 --> 03:07:46,800
Wait...

5884
03:07:49,240 --> 03:07:52,070
This is honestly impossible!

5885
03:07:53,670 --> 03:07:56,180
Don't pull it!

5886
03:07:54,310 --> 03:07:56,180
Definitely don't pull it!

5887
03:08:00,610 --> 03:08:02,480
This is bad

5888
03:08:04,450 --> 03:08:04,990
This is bad!

5889
03:08:04,990 --> 03:08:05,690
Wait a second!

5890
03:08:05,950 --> 03:08:06,750
So pitiful!

5891
03:08:06,750 --> 03:08:07,660
This is...

5892
03:08:12,890 --> 03:08:14,730
Ahhh...

5893
03:08:14,760 --> 03:08:16,760
Uehh....

5894
03:08:23,640 --> 03:08:24,670
That face.

5895
03:08:31,450 --> 03:08:32,980
That damn face!

5896
03:08:33,280 --> 03:08:35,480
I think you should probably cool your ass off

5897
03:08:34,450 --> 03:08:35,480
This is impossible...

5898
03:08:35,480 --> 03:08:35,820
Alright!

5899
03:08:37,550 --> 03:08:38,850
That's not what I had in mind...

5900
03:08:38,850 --> 03:08:42,890
What are you doing to the fridge?

5901
03:08:43,620 --> 03:08:47,130
Just by

5902
03:08:44,830 --> 03:08:47,130
sticking your ass to the fridge

5903
03:08:45,690 --> 03:08:47,130
won't cool it off

5904
03:08:47,160 --> 03:08:49,000
My ass..

5905
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:51,000
Put some cold water on this

5906
03:08:51,170 --> 03:08:52,900
Wait... Seriously...

5907
03:08:52,930 --> 03:08:54,100
Just wait a second!

5908
03:08:54,170 --> 03:08:57,100
Has your 10 minutes been up yet?

5909
03:08:55,870 --> 03:08:57,100
Has it been up yet, huh?

5910
03:08:57,100 --> 03:08:59,110
It doesn't feel like it has

5911
03:08:57,770 --> 03:08:59,110
I'm being serious

5912
03:09:00,370 --> 03:09:03,140
Lie down with your face on the ground

5913
03:09:01,510 --> 03:09:02,280
Alright!

5914
03:09:05,450 --> 03:09:06,710
Let me move your cloak first

5915
03:09:07,650 --> 03:09:09,080
AHHH!!

5916
03:09:10,320 --> 03:09:12,990
It's a little cold but...

5917
03:09:12,990 --> 03:09:15,590
No more laughing, alright?

5918
03:09:15,590 --> 03:09:18,230
We've already climbed over the difficult part

5919
03:09:18,230 --> 03:09:20,390
Is there no ice in there?

5920
03:09:19,430 --> 03:09:20,530
Ice...

5921
03:09:20,530 --> 03:09:22,260
I can use this...

5922
03:09:21,900 --> 03:09:26,900
The fridge's shelf is cold

5923
03:09:22,760 --> 03:09:25,300
This is cold... Hosei, I'm gonna put it on

5924
03:09:25,600 --> 03:09:27,600
Here we go!

5925
03:09:27,970 --> 03:09:28,870
Ah, it hurts!

5926
03:09:29,670 --> 03:09:31,810
It's sticking on me a bit!

5927
03:09:37,980 --> 03:09:39,180
It hurts!

5928
03:09:45,090 --> 03:09:45,820
It stuck on it, huh?

5929
03:09:45,820 --> 03:09:47,020
AH IT HURTS~~!!

5930
03:09:49,320 --> 03:09:59,300
Room Announcer

5931
03:09:50,460 --> 03:09:54,660
There are 5 seconds left for the 10-minute Joint Liability Card

5932
03:09:52,890 --> 03:09:53,960
Finally!

5933
03:09:54,130 --> 03:09:55,400
It's ending

5934
03:09:54,660 --> 03:09:55,660
There are 4 seconds left for the 10-minute Joint Liability Card

5935
03:09:54,660 --> 03:09:55,960
It's over!

5936
03:09:55,400 --> 03:09:56,760
It's ending, it's ending

5937
03:09:55,660 --> 03:09:56,530
There are 3 seconds left for the 10-minute Joint Liability Card

5938
03:09:55,960 --> 03:09:57,970
It's over!

5939
03:09:56,530 --> 03:09:57,430
There are 2 seconds left for the 10-minute Joint Liability Card

5940
03:09:56,760 --> 03:09:57,300
It's ending

5941
03:09:57,430 --> 03:09:58,330
There are 1 seconds left for the 10-minute Joint Liability Card

5942
03:09:58,330 --> 03:09:59,300
There are 0 seconds left for the 10-minute Joint Liability Card

5943
03:09:59,330 --> 03:10:03,270
End

5944
03:10:00,500 --> 03:10:01,100
Ah good

5945
03:10:01,400 --> 03:10:02,800
You don't need this?

5946
03:10:02,770 --> 03:10:04,810
It's painful, painful

5947
03:10:03,800 --> 03:10:04,910
It hurts?

5948
03:10:03,800 --> 03:10:04,910
It's sticking to my skin

5949
03:10:04,910 --> 03:10:07,410
It's scary to excel

5950
03:10:07,410 --> 03:10:08,910
Because he was excellent, he was forced to dress like that...

5951
03:10:08,910 --> 03:10:10,110
The stake which sticks out gets hammered in was what happened

5952
03:10:08,910 --> 03:10:14,310
[note: a Japanese proverb; someone who sticks out excessively will get brought back into line]

5953
03:10:10,110 --> 03:10:14,310
The stake which sticks out gets hammered in was what happened

5954
03:10:15,720 --> 03:10:20,420
Detective work 9th hour

5955
03:10:15,720 --> 03:10:20,420
It's 5 in the evening, and Hosei's hellish infiltration investigation has ended

5956
03:10:20,420 --> 03:10:22,120
Only the game is left

5957
03:10:20,620 --> 03:10:20,850
Tanaka shows remarkable progress while struggling with the game

5958
03:10:20,850 --> 03:10:27,330
Tanaka shows remarkable progress while struggling with the game

5959
03:10:26,330 --> 03:10:27,330
I was able to get to a good place

5960
03:10:27,330 --> 03:10:41,740
35th try

5961
03:10:27,330 --> 03:10:41,740
Challenge from Kaijin Nijuu Mensou

5962
03:10:27,330 --> 03:10:41,740
Clear 1 course in "Super Mario Maker"

5963
03:10:27,330 --> 03:10:41,740
Tanaka Naoki

5964
03:10:29,100 --> 03:10:30,630
This is really long

5965
03:10:30,630 --> 03:10:31,900
You went far in the previous round

5966
03:10:31,900 --> 03:10:33,600
You awakened

5967
03:10:32,800 --> 03:10:33,600
Hosei-san

5968
03:10:33,600 --> 03:10:35,000
That was an amazing expression

5969
03:10:34,400 --> 03:10:35,800
Yeah, Tanaka's...

5970
03:10:35,800 --> 03:10:36,770
Look look look

5971
03:10:37,300 --> 03:10:40,110
Tanaka's really awakened.

5972
03:10:37,810 --> 03:10:38,610
Almost...

5973
03:10:39,910 --> 03:10:40,770
Eh, seriously?

5974
03:10:40,770 --> 03:10:41,740
Awesome

5975
03:10:42,080 --> 03:11:08,540
35th try

5976
03:10:42,080 --> 03:11:08,540
Challenge from Kaijin Nijuu Mensou

5977
03:10:42,080 --> 03:11:08,540
Clear 1 course in "Super Mario Maker"

5978
03:10:42,080 --> 03:11:08,540
Tanaka Naoki

5979
03:10:42,410 --> 03:10:43,410
Oh! It's going well

5980
03:10:43,710 --> 03:10:44,310
Ah! Hammers!

5981
03:10:44,310 --> 03:10:45,410
Here.

5982
03:10:44,710 --> 03:10:46,380
The problem is this point

5983
03:10:49,120 --> 03:10:50,380
What happens after entering?

5984
03:10:50,750 --> 03:10:51,720
Need to enter

5985
03:10:51,720 --> 03:10:52,790
There are probably Koopas

5986
03:10:53,220 --> 03:10:54,520
Okay, jump

5987
03:10:54,760 --> 03:10:55,460
Go go go

5988
03:10:55,460 --> 03:10:56,860
Yes, yes, yes

5989
03:10:56,360 --> 03:10:57,360
There's fire coming

5990
03:11:11,070 --> 03:11:17,410
Tragedy of clearing the game himself and getting a Thai Kick

5991
03:11:11,210 --> 03:11:12,210
I was quite surprised by this

5992
03:11:13,210 --> 03:11:13,940
This is...

5993
03:11:13,940 --> 03:11:15,080
This is...

5994
03:11:16,010 --> 03:11:17,410
This is...

5995
03:11:17,410 --> 03:11:19,750
Tanaka here, come here

5996
03:11:19,750 --> 03:11:20,850
Moreover, Tanaka...

5997
03:11:21,150 --> 03:11:24,150
I got goosebumps!!

5998
03:11:22,120 --> 03:11:24,150
Even though he cleared it himself...

5999
03:11:24,150 --> 03:11:26,120
Even though he worked that hard on it

6000
03:11:30,820 --> 03:11:31,730
This is the 3rd kick

6001
03:11:40,900 --> 03:11:42,500
This is really...

6002
03:11:42,840 --> 03:11:45,110
This is super ridiculous

6003
03:11:44,100 --> 03:11:46,510
I don't know what to say to Tanaka about this...

6004
03:11:48,840 --> 03:11:52,410
This is too sad, this ending

6005
03:11:50,840 --> 03:11:52,410
Really sad

6006
03:11:53,750 --> 03:11:58,420
Detective work 10th hour

6007
03:11:53,750 --> 03:11:58,420
It is 6pm and a murder has occurred in the Agency!

6008
03:11:59,320 --> 03:12:06,760
In order to study how to infer a criminal, they head to the scene of the crime

6009
03:11:59,320 --> 03:12:06,760
Within the Agency, a murder has happened!!

6010
03:12:07,130 --> 03:12:10,700
Shouldn't that be handed over to the police already?

6011
03:12:11,800 --> 03:12:13,730
Over here

6012
03:12:13,730 --> 03:12:15,500
We're going to investigate the scene now

6013
03:12:15,500 --> 03:12:17,500
Investigate the scene...

6014
03:12:15,500 --> 03:12:19,170
Party Room

6015
03:12:17,100 --> 03:12:19,170
This is a murder case

6016
03:12:19,170 --> 03:12:22,710
Tatsumi Takuro

6017
03:12:19,170 --> 03:12:26,550
Police Detective

6018
03:12:20,210 --> 03:12:22,110
Can you guys line up here?

6019
03:12:22,710 --> 03:12:26,550
Wakabayashi Go

6020
03:12:23,310 --> 03:12:24,080
Hamada, Hosei...

6021
03:12:27,150 --> 03:12:29,250
Everyone, work hard and do some inference

6022
03:12:28,920 --> 03:12:30,150
Inference...

6023
03:12:32,020 --> 03:12:34,860
Wakabayashi-san

6024
03:12:33,420 --> 03:12:34,860
Were there fingerprints?

6025
03:12:35,260 --> 03:12:37,390
Fingerprints were hard to find

6026
03:12:40,390 --> 03:12:44,530
Azuma Chizuru

6027
03:12:40,390 --> 03:12:44,530
Victim's wife

6028
03:12:42,500 --> 03:12:44,500
Ma'am!

6029
03:12:46,500 --> 03:12:48,300
Ma'am, please calm down

6030
03:12:48,300 --> 03:12:50,300
It was amazing

6031
03:12:48,300 --> 03:12:50,300
Overdoing it

6032
03:12:50,640 --> 03:12:54,310
Ma'am, calm down...

6033
03:12:56,040 --> 03:12:57,540
Who is this person?

6034
03:12:58,050 --> 03:12:59,550
The victim's wife, Chizuru-san

6035
03:12:59,550 --> 03:13:01,050
The victim's wife, Chizuru-san

6036
03:13:07,750 --> 03:13:13,160
Furuhata Ninzaburo enters the scene on a bicycle

6037
03:13:07,750 --> 03:13:13,160
[note: "Furuhata Ninzaburo" is a police detective drama which aired periodically from '94 to '06]

6038
03:13:12,530 --> 03:13:14,460
You are... Furuhata-san?

6039
03:13:13,660 --> 03:13:16,600
Furuhata Ninzaburo

6040
03:13:13,660 --> 03:13:16,600
Rola

6041
03:13:14,830 --> 03:13:15,900
Tatsumi-kun,

6042
03:13:19,030 --> 03:13:22,770
could you help me put this bicycle

6043
03:13:20,170 --> 03:13:22,770
away somewhere?

6044
03:13:22,100 --> 03:13:23,770
Right.

6045
03:13:27,010 --> 03:13:29,380
Super

6046
03:13:27,010 --> 03:13:29,380
lousy

6047
03:13:28,010 --> 03:13:29,380
Lousy

6048
03:13:29,110 --> 03:13:30,410
This is bad...

6049
03:13:29,710 --> 03:13:30,980
This is no good

6050
03:13:29,880 --> 03:13:36,020
Impression not at all complete

6051
03:13:32,610 --> 03:13:34,310
This is...

6052
03:13:34,310 --> 03:13:35,320
We need to get psyched

6053
03:13:35,420 --> 03:13:36,720
I will explain the situation here

6054
03:13:36,980 --> 03:13:42,390
Receives a report from police detective Tatsumi

6055
03:13:37,820 --> 03:13:41,390
Victim is male, in his 50s. Time of death is 15:10.

6056
03:13:41,520 --> 03:13:42,290
The perp

6057
03:13:42,390 --> 03:13:43,360
used a knife to stab the victim in the abdomen...

6058
03:13:43,360 --> 03:13:45,160
used a knife to stab the victim in the abdomen...

6059
03:13:46,060 --> 03:13:49,530
As a dying message,

6060
03:13:47,560 --> 03:13:49,530
the victim left the letter "W"

6061
03:13:50,030 --> 03:13:50,700
At the scene,

6062
03:13:51,100 --> 03:13:54,300
one of the victim's leather gloves
came off and...

6063
03:14:02,880 --> 03:14:08,880
The serious acting hits Furuhata's sense of humour

6064
03:14:05,310 --> 03:14:06,980
Your laughter made us laugh!

6065
03:14:06,910 --> 03:14:09,980
This is a terrible incident...

6066
03:14:11,120 --> 03:14:14,390
At the scene,there's a leather glove

6067
03:14:14,390 --> 03:14:14,990
That lea...

6068
03:14:15,060 --> 03:14:16,690
That leather glove has blood on it?

6069
03:14:16,690 --> 03:14:17,690
That leather glove has blood on it?

6070
03:14:18,060 --> 03:14:19,190
fuhehehe

6071
03:14:19,190 --> 03:14:20,960
That's no good

6072
03:14:20,960 --> 03:14:22,460
That's no good

6073
03:14:22,660 --> 03:14:24,030
That leather gl... text

6074
03:14:24,060 --> 03:14:25,470
That leather glove has blood on it

6075
03:14:25,470 --> 03:14:26,030
That leather glove has blood on it

6076
03:14:25,900 --> 03:14:27,030
Hahahahaha

6077
03:14:33,240 --> 03:14:35,310
If you're doing an impression,

6078
03:14:33,240 --> 03:14:35,310
do it properly

6079
03:14:42,180 --> 03:14:44,120
With this, the case has been solved.

6080
03:14:44,120 --> 03:14:45,990
With this, the case has been solved.

6081
03:14:45,990 --> 03:14:48,320
Huh?

6082
03:14:45,990 --> 03:14:48,320
Solved?

6083
03:14:46,350 --> 03:14:48,320
Huh?

6084
03:14:52,430 --> 03:14:53,390
The perp has made 1 huge mistake.

6085
03:14:53,390 --> 03:14:55,630
The perp has made 1 huge mistake.

6086
03:14:55,630 --> 03:14:56,800
Here at the scene, one big clue left behind

6087
03:14:56,800 --> 03:15:02,740
Here at the scene, one big clue left behind

6088
03:14:59,570 --> 03:15:00,800
pointed to evidence of the perp's guilt

6089
03:15:00,800 --> 03:15:02,740
pointed to evidence of the perp's guilt

6090
03:15:02,740 --> 03:15:04,710
The theme of the keywords are a single leather glove and "M"

6091
03:15:04,710 --> 03:15:06,440
The theme of the keywords are a single leather glove and "M"

6092
03:15:06,440 --> 03:15:15,080
The theme of the keywords are a single leather glove and "M"

6093
03:15:08,240 --> 03:15:12,410
hehe... a bloody "W"left behind

6094
03:15:12,410 --> 03:15:15,080
hehe... a bloody "W"left behind

6095
03:15:15,080 --> 03:15:17,520
This was Furuhata Ninzaburo

6096
03:15:17,520 --> 03:15:19,520
[note: Rola was doing a parody impression of Furuhata's reasoning]

6097
03:15:22,060 --> 03:15:23,720
No idea what you're talking about

6098
03:15:25,660 --> 03:15:27,690
You only did a self-introduction

6099
03:15:29,860 --> 03:15:32,970
So it's not solved yet, right?

6100
03:15:33,830 --> 03:15:36,540
These rookie detectives... Their faces have turned pale.

6101
03:15:36,540 --> 03:15:37,300
These rookie detectives... Their faces have turned pale.

6102
03:15:37,300 --> 03:15:38,640
These rookie detectives... Their faces have turned pale.

6103
03:15:39,170 --> 03:15:40,670
Everyone's changed

6104
03:15:41,110 --> 03:15:43,510
I heard Furuhata-san is good at doing impressions...

6105
03:15:42,780 --> 03:15:47,550
Furuhata's hidden talent

6106
03:15:42,780 --> 03:15:47,550
Good at doing impressions

6107
03:15:45,510 --> 03:15:47,450
So, does anyone have any requests?

6108
03:15:48,450 --> 03:15:50,120
How about Bruce Lee?

6109
03:15:48,680 --> 03:16:02,130
Bruce Lee impression

6110
03:15:50,420 --> 03:15:52,720
Ah I can do it!!

6111
03:15:55,290 --> 03:15:55,320
Acho--

6112
03:15:55,320 --> 03:15:55,360
Acho--

6113
03:15:55,360 --> 03:15:56,220
Acho--

6114
03:15:58,020 --> 03:15:59,690
I might not be able to do it...

6115
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:06,700
If you can't do it, then don't do it...

6116
03:16:05,100 --> 03:16:06,200
She couldn't do it

6117
03:16:06,670 --> 03:16:08,600
You said you "could do it"

6118
03:16:07,570 --> 03:16:08,870
Because you said you could do it...

6119
03:16:12,910 --> 03:16:15,280
Everyone, ensure that this type of thing won't happen to you,

6120
03:16:15,510 --> 03:16:18,040
so please live well

6121
03:16:18,040 --> 03:16:19,480
so please live well

6122
03:16:18,040 --> 03:16:22,080
[note: Rola is using a casual type of speech here]

6123
03:16:20,810 --> 03:16:22,320
Using such a tone to speak to us?

6124
03:16:23,380 --> 03:16:25,350
As expected of Furuhata-san

6125
03:16:25,350 --> 03:16:28,320
Please hurry and find the culprit

6126
03:16:28,620 --> 03:16:30,120
Hurry!

6127
03:16:30,490 --> 03:16:32,290
Calm down, madam

6128
03:16:32,290 --> 03:16:33,230
Calm down, madam

6129
03:16:34,030 --> 03:16:35,300
He's touching her a lot

6130
03:16:34,330 --> 03:16:36,300
Yeah

6131
03:16:38,430 --> 03:16:42,600
It's troubling to us if you just come in like that

6132
03:16:42,600 --> 03:16:45,410
Who are you ?

6133
03:16:45,410 --> 03:16:49,180
Famous detective Poirot

6134
03:16:45,410 --> 03:16:49,180
I'm Nishioka "Poirot" Tokuma

6135
03:16:45,410 --> 03:16:49,180
Nishioka Tokuma

6136
03:16:45,410 --> 03:16:49,180
[note: Poirot is a detective character in Agatha Christie's Poirot book series]

6137
03:16:49,180 --> 03:16:50,010
Excuse me

6138
03:16:50,010 --> 03:16:52,310
Wait, wait, what are you touching?

6139
03:16:50,010 --> 03:16:54,680
Nishioka starts his inference

6140
03:16:52,350 --> 03:16:54,710
The stab wound in the back,

6141
03:16:55,020 --> 03:16:58,220
a knife which has been wiped clean of fingerprints,

6142
03:16:58,220 --> 03:17:01,420
and a dying message, the letter "W"

6143
03:17:01,490 --> 03:17:04,160
A single glove

6144
03:17:06,730 --> 03:17:08,160
What's so funny?

6145
03:17:08,160 --> 03:17:10,060
The problem is this

6146
03:17:12,100 --> 03:17:14,900
The bits of skin left behind in the victim's nails

6147
03:17:12,930 --> 03:17:18,240
Inferring the culprit important point #1

6148
03:17:12,930 --> 03:17:18,240
Skin left behind in the nails of the victim

6149
03:17:18,240 --> 03:17:23,780
The perp's neck will

6150
03:17:20,570 --> 03:17:23,780
definitely have scratch wounds left behind

6151
03:17:23,410 --> 03:17:24,780
Hmm... I see.

6152
03:17:24,780 --> 03:17:25,480
Someone!

6153
03:17:25,950 --> 03:17:28,280
Send this skin to forensics!!

6154
03:17:27,110 --> 03:17:29,980
No, no, no need for that

6155
03:17:30,750 --> 03:17:32,650
I have always have had a good nose

6156
03:17:32,650 --> 03:17:35,490
I have always have had a good nose

6157
03:17:36,460 --> 03:17:37,620
This room has something of a certain smell

6158
03:17:37,620 --> 03:17:40,760
This room has something of a certain smell

6159
03:17:40,760 --> 03:17:42,100
That smell is this

6160
03:17:42,100 --> 03:17:43,330
That smell is this

6161
03:17:43,330 --> 03:17:44,100
Ointment

6162
03:17:44,230 --> 03:17:52,870
Inferring the culprit important point #2

6163
03:17:44,230 --> 03:17:52,870
Smell of ointment wafting around the scene

6164
03:17:45,500 --> 03:17:52,010
I'm certain the perp used this ointment
to dress his wounds

6165
03:17:53,340 --> 03:17:54,910
Isn't that so, Wakabayashi-san?

6166
03:17:54,910 --> 03:17:56,410
Isn't that so, Wakabayashi-san?

6167
03:17:58,280 --> 03:18:00,350
The dying message, "W",

6168
03:18:00,710 --> 03:18:02,680
is from Wakabayashi's "W"

6169
03:18:02,680 --> 03:18:03,720
is from Wakabayashi's "W"

6170
03:18:04,350 --> 03:18:06,890
What nonsense are you talking about?

6171
03:18:07,120 --> 03:18:08,120
Then,

6172
03:18:08,260 --> 03:18:10,060
your throat, show it to everyone

6173
03:18:10,060 --> 03:18:12,290
your throat, show it to everyone

6174
03:18:12,290 --> 03:18:13,230
Wakabayashi-san...

6175
03:18:24,040 --> 03:18:27,470
Definite proof that he is the culprit

6176
03:18:26,040 --> 03:18:27,410
You are...?

6177
03:18:28,580 --> 03:18:31,540
I married when I was young

6178
03:18:31,880 --> 03:18:38,350
I only focused on my job as police detective so

6179
03:18:34,610 --> 03:18:38,350
I did not pay attention to my family

6180
03:18:38,620 --> 03:18:40,720
She escaped

6181
03:18:41,490 --> 03:18:46,260
Years later, I

6182
03:18:43,660 --> 03:18:46,260
met a lady who looked like my wife

6183
03:18:46,260 --> 03:18:49,060
That lady was you

6184
03:18:49,060 --> 03:18:53,200
That lady was you

6185
03:18:51,500 --> 03:18:52,400
Me?

6186
03:18:53,600 --> 03:18:55,100
Then,

6187
03:18:55,500 --> 03:18:57,900
your husband became an obstacle so I killed him

6188
03:18:57,900 --> 03:18:59,670
your husband became an obstacle so I killed him

6189
03:19:00,540 --> 03:19:03,510
It's all over

6190
03:19:04,740 --> 03:19:06,250
With this, I will end everything

6191
03:19:06,250 --> 03:19:09,820
With this, I will end everything

6192
03:19:10,120 --> 03:19:11,020
Azuma-san...

6193
03:19:12,720 --> 03:19:14,350
Let us meet in heaven

6194
03:19:18,360 --> 03:19:24,730
Come, now sleep. Lay down

6195
03:19:18,360 --> 03:19:24,730

03:19:18,360 --> 03:20:00,970
*Note: The song is (Madonna-tachi no Lullaby) Lullaby of the Virgin Mary, released by Iwasaki Hiromi in 1982

6197
03:19:24,760 --> 03:19:29,940
karada wo nagedashite

6198
03:19:24,760 --> 03:19:29,940
your tired body.

6199
03:19:29,970 --> 03:19:34,610
Let my lips gently

6200
03:19:29,970 --> 03:19:34,610
aoi sono mabuta wo

6201
03:19:34,610 --> 03:19:44,320
kuchibiru de sotto fusagimashou

6202
03:19:34,610 --> 03:19:44,320
seal your pale eyelids.

6203
03:19:44,320 --> 03:19:47,690
Ah, if it's possible,

6204
03:19:44,320 --> 03:19:47,690
ah dekirunonara

6205
03:19:44,720 --> 03:19:46,620
She dodged really well

6206
03:19:45,390 --> 03:19:51,160
She dodges the knife by a hair's breadth

6207
03:19:47,690 --> 03:19:54,130
I would want to be reincarnated as your mother

6208
03:19:47,690 --> 03:19:54,130
umarekawari anata no haha ni natte

6209
03:19:54,530 --> 03:19:55,300
She dodged this too

6210
03:20:03,540 --> 03:20:05,810
What is he (Nishioka) doing?

6211
03:20:08,640 --> 03:20:10,840
That guy's irrelevant!!

6212
03:20:09,280 --> 03:20:10,680
From the start, he's irrelevant

6213
03:20:11,610 --> 03:20:13,150
Why is he just circling around so much?

6214
03:20:15,020 --> 03:20:17,120
How many times are you going to dodge?

6215
03:20:17,550 --> 03:20:18,520
She really can dodge

6216
03:20:22,590 --> 03:20:25,930
She keeps getting away from him

6217
03:20:26,690 --> 03:20:28,400
Maybe he'll get her next time

6218
03:20:28,400 --> 03:20:30,530
Nope, she dodged it

6219
03:20:31,030 --> 03:20:32,100
She can really dodge!

6220
03:20:33,300 --> 03:20:35,800
She's just barely dodging these hits

6221
03:20:35,800 --> 03:20:38,940
What is he (Nishioka) doing?

6222
03:20:37,700 --> 03:20:38,770
Ahh, it's dangerous

6223
03:20:39,770 --> 03:20:41,270
Ahh be careful

6224
03:20:41,270 --> 03:20:42,340
That's dangerous

6225
03:20:42,340 --> 03:20:43,180
Oh, this is bad

6226
03:20:43,540 --> 03:20:44,310
It's impossible

6227
03:20:44,380 --> 03:20:46,280
This time he'll definitely get her

6228
03:20:46,280 --> 03:20:47,650
Ahh he's gonna get her

6229
03:20:48,110 --> 03:20:48,650
She dodged it

6230
03:20:49,520 --> 03:20:50,120
She dodged again!

6231
03:20:50,350 --> 03:20:51,790
He can't get her at all!

6232
03:20:53,790 --> 03:20:55,390
He keeps missing

6233
03:20:56,690 --> 03:20:58,460
Wow

6234
03:20:59,430 --> 03:21:01,860
What is Tokuma

6235
03:21:00,090 --> 03:21:01,860
even doing!?

6236
03:21:02,430 --> 03:21:03,860
What could he be doing?

6237
03:21:03,930 --> 03:21:04,730
Oh she's a goner

6238
03:21:05,070 --> 03:21:06,300
Ahh her face!

6239
03:21:12,810 --> 03:21:13,510
She got the knife!

6240
03:21:15,280 --> 03:21:15,810
Instead...

6241
03:21:15,580 --> 03:21:19,010
The knife is stabbed into Wakabayashi's stomach...

6242
03:21:20,250 --> 03:21:21,310
No no no

6243
03:21:21,580 --> 03:21:22,720
Of course we're out...

6244
03:21:22,120 --> 03:21:23,380
That's fine, but...

6245
03:21:23,720 --> 03:21:26,190
Please watch for us

6246
03:21:28,590 --> 03:21:30,860
She was really dodging

6247
03:21:31,990 --> 03:21:33,790
11th hour of detective duty

6248
03:21:34,790 --> 03:21:37,960
Good news for the 5 men who have been working hard since morning...

6249
03:21:38,930 --> 03:21:39,630
What is it?

6250
03:21:43,170 --> 03:21:44,300
I'm sure you guys are getting tired.

6251
03:21:44,300 --> 03:21:46,710
I'm sure you guys are getting tired.

6252
03:21:46,840 --> 03:21:47,670
Um,

6253
03:21:47,670 --> 03:21:51,950
you guys really need a breather

6254
03:21:49,310 --> 03:21:50,310
Seriously!

6255
03:21:50,710 --> 03:21:51,950
You need a breather, so

6256
03:21:51,950 --> 03:21:52,750
let's go see something nice

6257
03:21:52,750 --> 03:21:55,480
let's go see something nice

6258
03:21:54,810 --> 03:21:55,380
Something nice?

6259
03:21:55,950 --> 03:21:57,680
We're watching something?

6260
03:21:57,680 --> 03:21:59,790
Something nice?

6261
03:21:59,790 --> 03:22:02,120
Is it really something nice?

6262
03:22:02,720 --> 03:22:06,630
Auditorium

6263
03:22:03,590 --> 03:22:08,090
He calls it a breather, but,

6264
03:22:05,130 --> 03:22:08,090
if it makes us laugh, it's really gonna wear me out

6265
03:22:07,560 --> 03:22:08,630
Okay, we enter through here

6266
03:22:11,500 --> 03:22:12,870
What!?

6267
03:22:12,930 --> 03:22:13,530
Whoa?

6268
03:22:15,570 --> 03:22:23,640
Downtown Deluxe Set

6269
03:22:15,840 --> 03:22:16,670
What is this?

6270
03:22:17,370 --> 03:22:18,670
It's the Downtown Deluxe set

6271
03:22:18,970 --> 03:22:20,170
It's exactly the same

6272
03:22:20,470 --> 03:22:21,710
It's just like Deluxe

6273
03:22:22,340 --> 03:22:23,610
Wait, what is this really?

6274
03:22:23,640 --> 03:22:26,150
Are we supposed to watch?

6275
03:22:26,150 --> 03:22:27,350
This means that somebody will replace Downtown?

6276
03:22:27,350 --> 03:22:28,210
We're supposed to watch?

6277
03:22:27,350 --> 03:22:29,220
This means that somebody will replace Downtown?

6278
03:22:30,320 --> 03:22:31,920
You're kidding...

6279
03:22:32,950 --> 03:22:35,720
This is a first, isn't it?

6280
03:22:34,490 --> 03:22:35,320
Amazing

6281
03:22:35,920 --> 03:22:36,620
How refreshing

6282
03:22:36,620 --> 03:22:39,590
Who's gonna do it?

6283
03:22:39,590 --> 03:22:41,260
Who's gonna do it?

6284
03:22:41,260 --> 03:22:43,500
I'm getting a weird feeling

6285
03:22:43,500 --> 03:22:44,700
The sound is the same... what is this!?

6286
03:22:44,700 --> 03:22:46,670
The sound is the same... what is this!?

6287
03:22:59,380 --> 03:23:00,080
Be quiet!

6288
03:23:01,480 --> 03:23:02,080
Quiet!

6289
03:23:02,280 --> 03:23:03,380
Matsumoto-san!

6290
03:23:04,080 --> 03:23:04,350
No!!

6291
03:23:04,350 --> 03:23:04,620
No!!

6292
03:23:04,620 --> 03:23:06,020
Is this even allowed?

6293
03:23:06,090 --> 03:23:06,820
What?

6294
03:23:06,350 --> 03:23:09,760
Downtown

6295
03:23:06,350 --> 03:23:09,760
Hamada Masatoshi

6296
03:23:06,350 --> 03:23:09,760
Matsumoto Hitoshi

6297
03:23:07,550 --> 03:23:09,290
Well, Matsumoto-san,

6298
03:23:09,890 --> 03:23:10,920
in the blink of an eye,

6299
03:23:11,520 --> 03:23:12,460
a year has passed

6300
03:23:13,230 --> 03:23:14,290
I agree

6301
03:23:15,360 --> 03:23:16,360
No no no... Anyway, Hamada is-

6302
03:23:16,360 --> 03:23:19,000
No no no... Anyway, Hamada is-

6303
03:23:18,430 --> 03:23:19,330
What kind of year was it?

6304
03:23:19,000 --> 03:23:19,570
You have a necktie just like that

6305
03:23:19,570 --> 03:23:23,000
You have a necktie just like that

6306
03:23:21,730 --> 03:23:22,370
It was bad

6307
03:23:24,240 --> 03:23:25,240
Your voice is so small, Matsumoto-san

6308
03:23:24,740 --> 03:23:26,710
What are you gonna do next year?

6309
03:23:25,240 --> 03:23:26,940
Your voice is so small, Matsumoto-san

6310
03:23:27,110 --> 03:23:28,340
Oh next year, well

6311
03:23:29,710 --> 03:23:30,540
I'm gonna take a bath,

6312
03:23:30,680 --> 03:23:31,480
take a bath,

6313
03:23:31,510 --> 03:23:32,880
eat some food,

6314
03:23:33,550 --> 03:23:34,880
and do some laundry.

6315
03:23:35,180 --> 03:23:36,780
Yes, that's right!

6316
03:23:37,280 --> 03:23:38,520
ALRIGHT, let's get on with it

6317
03:23:39,150 --> 03:23:39,950
Not funny at all, Downtown-san

6318
03:23:39,950 --> 03:23:41,120
Not funny at all, Downtown-san

6319
03:23:41,120 --> 03:23:42,320
They are not funny at all, Downtown-san

6320
03:23:42,320 --> 03:23:43,990
Wait a minute

6321
03:23:44,690 --> 03:23:47,390
Wait wait I'm exhausted

6322
03:23:48,130 --> 03:23:50,430
This isn't funny at all

6323
03:23:52,530 --> 03:23:53,570
Wow, this-

6324
03:23:53,630 --> 03:23:55,940
What part of this is a breather?

6325
03:23:54,770 --> 03:23:56,870
I don't understand

6326
03:23:55,940 --> 03:23:57,600
We have to do our best

6327
03:23:57,600 --> 03:23:58,440
This is tough

6328
03:23:58,670 --> 03:24:01,570
Welcome tonight's guest!

6329
03:24:00,610 --> 03:24:00,940
Who?

6330
03:24:00,940 --> 03:24:01,140
Who?

6331
03:24:01,140 --> 03:24:01,610
Who?

6332
03:24:01,610 --> 03:24:02,680
Who?

6333
03:24:04,280 --> 03:24:10,480
Tonight's guests

6334
03:24:04,440 --> 03:24:05,210
Wow, amazing

6335
03:24:05,410 --> 03:24:11,620
Natsuki Yoko

6336
03:24:06,510 --> 03:24:12,720
Mikihisa Azuma

6337
03:24:07,510 --> 03:24:13,720

Kikuchi Ami

6342
03:24:12,290 --> 03:24:13,690
What is this?

6343
03:24:13,220 --> 03:24:19,430
Animal
Hamaguchi

6344
03:24:19,830 --> 03:24:20,960
No no no

6345
03:24:21,330 --> 03:24:22,300
This is incredible

6346
03:24:22,830 --> 03:24:24,100
What the hell is this?

6347
03:24:23,530 --> 03:24:25,670
What are they trying to do?

6348
03:24:27,300 --> 03:24:29,370
This is as good as the original Deluxe

6349
03:24:29,540 --> 03:24:33,070
So, today, we have many luxurious guests

6350
03:24:33,370 --> 03:24:34,970
So, let's get into it

6351
03:24:34,910 --> 03:24:36,380
He's proceeding very well

6352
03:24:35,540 --> 03:24:36,210
Firstly,

6353
03:24:36,880 --> 03:24:43,120
Star

6354
03:24:36,880 --> 03:24:43,120
peaking rankings!

6355
03:24:37,840 --> 03:24:40,150
Star peaking rankings!

6356
03:24:40,780 --> 03:24:41,850
Oh we do that

6357
03:24:42,280 --> 03:24:43,120
We have that

6358
03:24:43,780 --> 03:24:45,790
*Matsumoto doesn't speak at all*

6359
03:24:44,880 --> 03:24:45,850
Yes, Matsumoto-san doesn't

6360
03:24:45,950 --> 03:24:46,550
Jinnai,

6361
03:24:46,790 --> 03:24:47,620
So quiet

6362
03:24:47,190 --> 03:24:49,260
I'm not speaking at all

6363
03:24:53,090 --> 03:24:54,630
Not a word

6364
03:24:54,190 --> 03:24:55,190
He doesn't say anything

6365
03:24:58,060 --> 03:24:59,370
Maybe from here he will

6366
03:24:59,600 --> 03:25:16,820
Star peaking rankings!

6367
03:25:00,030 --> 03:25:16,820
I changed a lot...

6368
03:25:00,030 --> 03:25:16,820
I, who won't even kill flies...

6369
03:25:00,030 --> 03:25:16,820
Umemiya

6370
03:25:00,130 --> 03:25:01,270
So, let's move on

6371
03:25:01,370 --> 03:25:02,440
You changed a lot

6372
03:25:03,000 --> 03:25:04,440
I, who won't even kill a fly...

6373
03:25:05,140 --> 03:25:05,670
2nd is

6374
03:25:06,040 --> 03:25:16,820
Demon
Kakka

6375
03:25:06,040 --> 03:25:16,820
Devil dash at the school festival!

6376
03:25:06,040 --> 03:25:16,820
Frantic!

6377
03:25:06,570 --> 03:25:07,670
Demon Kakka

6378
03:25:07,770 --> 03:25:10,410
Frantic! Devil Dash at the school festival!

6379
03:25:11,740 --> 03:25:12,410
1st place is

6380
03:25:12,480 --> 03:25:16,820
A prescription from his mother!

6381
03:25:12,480 --> 03:25:16,820

03:25:13,010 --> 03:25:14,550

1st place Tomonori Jinnai Puzzle! Prescription from his mother!

6388
03:25:20,520 --> 03:25:26,230
so he told Twitter

6389
03:25:20,520 --> 03:25:26,230
Recently, he's been unable to sleep,

6390
03:25:20,690 --> 03:25:22,460
Lately, you've been busy, and you said on

6391
03:25:23,020 --> 03:25:24,690
Twitter that you can't sleep well

6392
03:25:24,260 --> 03:25:25,220
Yes, that's right

6393
03:25:24,990 --> 03:25:25,830
and when you did,

6394
03:25:26,230 --> 03:25:28,290
your mother became very concerned

6395
03:25:26,230 --> 03:25:30,230
His mother, who was concerned,

6396
03:25:26,230 --> 03:25:30,230
sent him some medicine,

6397
03:25:28,730 --> 03:25:29,800
and sent you some medicine

6398
03:25:29,430 --> 03:25:30,100
Yes, correct

6399
03:25:30,160 --> 03:25:31,500
but that medicine was

6400
03:25:30,230 --> 03:25:38,710
but that medicine is

6401
03:25:31,860 --> 03:25:35,340
one meant to increase your appetite

6402
03:25:32,900 --> 03:25:38,710
meant to increase appetite

6403
03:25:35,100 --> 03:25:36,000
Yes that's correct

6404
03:25:36,670 --> 03:25:39,270
Because lately I've been unable to sleep-

6405
03:25:38,710 --> 03:25:38,940
1st place Tomonori Jinnai Puzzle! Prescrption from his mother!

6406
03:25:38,710 --> 03:25:38,940
but that medicine is

6407
03:25:38,710 --> 03:25:38,940
meant to increase appetite

6408
03:25:39,210 --> 03:25:39,940
Unfortunately your time is up!!

6409
03:25:39,940 --> 03:25:42,580
Unfortunately your time is up!!

6410
03:25:40,810 --> 03:25:42,210
No no please let me talk

6411
03:25:42,640 --> 03:25:44,080
Hamada-san, please let me speak

6412
03:25:44,080 --> 03:25:46,080
We just started!

6413
03:25:46,180 --> 03:25:48,350
All he (Matsumoto) does is laugh

6414
03:25:48,380 --> 03:25:49,480
Please let me speak!

6415
03:25:49,550 --> 03:25:51,680
That old man only laughs

6416
03:25:50,750 --> 03:25:51,950
It makes me mad

6417
03:25:51,850 --> 03:26:06,830
A puzzle! A prescription for his mother!

6418
03:25:51,850 --> 03:26:06,830
First place

6419
03:25:51,850 --> 03:26:06,830
Tomonori Jinnai

6420
03:25:53,020 --> 03:25:53,950
Jinnai, why,

6421
03:25:54,420 --> 03:25:55,760
even though you have a wife,

6422
03:25:56,320 --> 03:25:59,660
your mother had to- did- needed to watch over you

6423
03:26:00,830 --> 03:26:01,660
Oh, Matsumoto-san

6424
03:26:01,930 --> 03:26:02,760
No, Matsumoto-san

6425
03:26:03,100 --> 03:26:03,630
I got divorced

6426
03:26:03,630 --> 03:26:04,760
I got divorced

6427
03:26:04,760 --> 03:26:06,230
Whaaaat?

6428
03:26:05,570 --> 03:26:06,730
You already knew that!

6429
03:26:07,300 --> 03:26:09,800
This is bad!!

6430
03:26:08,300 --> 03:26:09,000
This is hard

6431
03:26:11,070 --> 03:26:12,870
This is hard

6432
03:26:12,670 --> 03:26:13,610
This is very bad

6433
03:26:17,340 --> 03:26:19,080
How many times are you gonna say that!?

6434
03:26:20,310 --> 03:26:25,750
Sorry

6435
03:26:20,810 --> 03:26:25,750
My bad

6436
03:26:22,780 --> 03:26:25,750
I knew that

6437
03:26:25,890 --> 03:26:27,650
By the way, Animal-san is-

6438
03:26:27,420 --> 03:26:28,960
Yes?

6439
03:26:29,090 --> 03:26:30,920
"I knew that"?

6440
03:26:29,590 --> 03:26:31,790
My secret to good health is

6441
03:26:32,130 --> 03:26:34,230
a collaboration between strength and will.

6442
03:26:34,460 --> 03:26:35,530
Until 200 years...

6443
03:26:35,730 --> 03:26:37,530
I can live to be 200 years old

6444
03:26:37,160 --> 03:26:38,060
Are you serious?

6445
03:26:38,430 --> 03:26:38,900
First up,

6446
03:26:44,400 --> 03:26:45,000
recently,

6447
03:26:45,440 --> 03:26:47,210
I invented this

6448
03:26:46,540 --> 03:26:47,140
What is it?

6449
03:26:47,370 --> 03:26:48,040
Here goes

6450
03:26:51,110 --> 03:26:51,810
I don't believe it

6451
03:26:51,540 --> 03:26:52,310
Are you serious?

6452
03:26:55,750 --> 03:26:56,380
Yes

6453
03:26:58,990 --> 03:27:00,120
Let's move on!

6454
03:27:06,360 --> 03:27:08,430
This is like a very broken Matsumoto

6455
03:27:08,730 --> 03:27:09,660
His wig is-

6456
03:27:10,430 --> 03:27:11,030
His wig!

6457
03:27:11,400 --> 03:27:12,030
His face is getting red

6458
03:27:12,030 --> 03:27:13,730
His face is getting red

6459
03:27:13,630 --> 03:27:15,230
The next segment is...

6460
03:27:16,870 --> 03:27:17,870

6467
03:27:25,950 --> 03:27:26,150

6468
03:27:25,950 --> 03:27:26,150
Question!!

6469
03:27:26,150 --> 03:27:26,210
Mikihisa Azuma's

6470
03:27:26,150 --> 03:27:26,210
Question!!

6471
03:27:26,210 --> 03:27:29,250
Question!!

6472
03:27:26,210 --> 03:27:31,450
Mikihisa Azuma's

6473
03:27:26,580 --> 03:27:29,050
Who is Mikihisa's question for?

6474
03:27:29,250 --> 03:27:29,620
Kikuchi Ami

6475
03:27:29,620 --> 03:27:31,450
Kikuchi Ami

6476
03:27:29,780 --> 03:27:34,720
Let me ask

6477
03:27:30,050 --> 03:27:31,050
For Kikuchi Ami!

6478
03:27:31,080 --> 03:27:31,750
Oh? Me?

6479
03:27:31,580 --> 03:27:39,030
How can I get on better terms with Hamada-san?

6480
03:27:31,580 --> 03:27:39,030
Kikuchi Ami

6481
03:27:31,580 --> 03:27:39,030
Mikihisa Azuma

6482
03:27:32,050 --> 03:27:34,550
How can I get on better terms with Hamada-san?

6483
03:27:35,350 --> 03:27:39,160
Yes, that's right. I've been part of the celebrity world for a while,

6484
03:27:39,260 --> 03:27:42,560
and I've been working with Hamada-san for over 10 years,

6485
03:27:39,890 --> 03:28:20,570
How do I get on better terms with Hamada-san?

6486
03:27:39,890 --> 03:28:20,570
Kikuchi Ami

6487
03:27:39,890 --> 03:28:20,570
Mikihisa Azuma

6488
03:27:39,890 --> 03:28:20,570
Question!

6489
03:27:41,990 --> 03:27:42,630
That's right

6490
03:27:42,760 --> 03:27:46,530
but no matter what, I still get nervous around him

6491
03:27:45,570 --> 03:27:47,030
Yes that's right,

6492
03:27:47,100 --> 03:27:50,040
but Ami-chan is on pretty good terms with him,

6493
03:27:50,000 --> 03:27:51,170
Yes that's correct

6494
03:27:50,300 --> 03:27:52,370
even though she's so young

6495
03:27:51,200 --> 03:27:52,210
Oh, yes

6496
03:27:52,870 --> 03:27:53,970
Not technique, but

6497
03:27:54,240 --> 03:27:55,980
I wanted to get her advice

6498
03:27:56,110 --> 03:27:57,980
Not a technique...

6499
03:27:58,310 --> 03:27:59,710
When speaking to Hamada-san, I get very nervous

6500
03:27:59,710 --> 03:28:02,220
When speaking to Hamada-san, I get very nervous

6501
03:28:02,220 --> 03:28:04,220
But I befriended him naturally

6502
03:28:06,950 --> 03:28:09,560
Like on the last show, there were many female celebrities,

6503
03:28:09,790 --> 03:28:12,230
but Hamada-san came up to me

6504
03:28:12,390 --> 03:28:13,130
and said, "it's okay to come up front!"

6505
03:28:13,130 --> 03:28:16,200
and said, "it's okay to come up front!"

6506
03:28:14,560 --> 03:28:15,330
Really?

6507
03:28:16,200 --> 03:28:17,330
Seriously! He said that

6508
03:28:17,400 --> 03:28:18,830
to me!

6509
03:28:18,330 --> 03:28:20,570
Don't mess around!

6510
03:28:19,930 --> 03:28:21,030
It's true!

6511
03:28:27,340 --> 03:28:29,410
I don't know

6512
03:28:28,240 --> 03:28:29,410
the right way to watch

6513
03:28:30,910 --> 03:28:33,110
So, let's move on to the next segment!

6514
03:28:33,350 --> 03:28:34,210

It looks similar to Endo's style

6532
03:28:57,200 --> 03:28:59,370
and usually I add glasses

6533
03:28:58,870 --> 03:28:59,770
Interesting!

6534
03:28:59,910 --> 03:29:01,140
Yes, but I wear this often!

6535
03:29:01,370 --> 03:29:02,580

6536
03:29:01,870 --> 03:29:02,980

6567
03:29:40,650 --> 03:29:41,850
He dresses like this?

6568
03:29:44,050 --> 03:29:45,220
Is this true?

6569
03:29:45,850 --> 03:29:48,150
His shoes are very worn out

6570
03:29:48,190 --> 03:29:48,850

They're very normal

6575
03:29:53,290 --> 03:29:54,190
Even this-

6576
03:29:54,230 --> 03:29:55,630
His face is still weird

6577
03:29:56,500 --> 03:29:57,330
It's nothing

6578
03:29:57,160 --> 03:29:58,860

03:32:14,100 --> 03:32:16,870
It's probably that.

6680
03:32:47,170 --> 03:32:51,400
Note: On the right is Nishikawa Kiyoshi, a very senior and respected comedian.

6681
03:32:49,600 --> 03:32:51,740

There's a veteran of comedy here.

6683
03:32:57,880 --> 03:32:58,940
You're kidding me.

6684
03:33:03,820 --> 03:33:04,680
Are we good?

6685
03:33:04,550 --> 03:33:07,090
Whoever has information to share may begin.

6686
03:33:07,290 --> 03:33:08,190
Yes.

6690
03:33:10,690 --> 03:33:16,360
Tsukitei Hosei's Secret Info

6691
03:33:11,420 --> 03:33:12,930
this is about a show called

6692
03:33:12,930 --> 03:33:16,360
"Drive-A-Go! Go!",

6693
03:33:14,490 --> 03:33:16,360
a show that he considers to be very important to him.

6694
03:33:19,470 --> 03:33:21,870
It's always that, isn't it?

6695
03:33:26,170 --> 03:33:29,680
That day, he with the other talents and staff were heading towards the shooting location.

6696
03:33:26,640 --> 03:33:52,030
On-location Shoot for His Main TV Show

Tsukitei Hosei's Secret Info

6698
03:33:29,910 --> 03:33:31,880
A female talent was appearing on the show that day

6699
03:33:31,880 --> 03:33:35,680
A female talent was appearing on the show that day

6700
03:33:33,080 --> 03:33:35,680
and it was her first time working with Hosei.

6701
03:33:35,780 --> 03:33:38,080
So on the way, the director wanted to break the ice

6702
03:33:38,080 --> 03:33:38,980
and asked her, "What's your impression of Hosei?"

6703
03:33:38,980 --> 03:33:41,290
and asked her, "What's your impression of Hosei?"

6704
03:33:41,290 --> 03:33:42,860
I'm told Hosei was listening with anticipation.

6705
03:33:42,860 --> 03:33:43,960
I'm told Hosei was listening with anticipation.

6706
03:33:43,960 --> 03:33:45,120
The girl said, "He's an idiot."

6707
03:33:45,120 --> 03:33:46,660
The girl said, "He's an idiot."

6708
03:33:46,660 --> 03:33:47,160
"He's the idiot of idiots.

6709
03:33:47,160 --> 03:33:52,030
"He's the idiot of idiots.

6710
03:33:48,530 --> 03:33:52,030
All he is, is an idiot, is what I think."

6711
03:33:55,870 --> 03:33:57,270
That did happen.

6712
03:34:01,040 --> 03:34:36,180
On-location Shoot for His Main TV Show

6713
03:34:01,040 --> 03:34:36,180
Tsukitei Hosei's Secret Info

6714
03:34:02,110 --> 03:34:04,310
Hosei laughed at the time

6715
03:34:04,310 --> 03:34:05,010
but inside, he was pissed,

6716
03:34:05,010 --> 03:34:05,480
but inside, he was pissed,

6717
03:34:05,480 --> 03:34:06,280
but inside, he was pissed,

6718
03:34:06,280 --> 03:34:09,550
so he planned

6719
03:34:07,210 --> 03:34:09,550
to get revenge during the shoot.

6720
03:34:09,520 --> 03:34:11,550
I'm told that when Hosei got back to the cast and crew bus;

6721
03:34:11,550 --> 03:34:13,550
she was there eating lunch.

6722
03:34:14,020 --> 03:34:15,590
"This is my only chance," he thought,

6723
03:34:15,590 --> 03:34:17,620
and he quietly sat near her

6724
03:34:18,220 --> 03:34:21,260
and in such a way that she wouldn't notice,

6725
03:34:19,530 --> 03:34:21,260
he began to fart.

6726
03:34:22,260 --> 03:34:27,300
He expelled all the

6727
03:34:23,600 --> 03:34:24,260
gas in his body without making any noise.

6728
03:34:24,260 --> 03:34:25,330
gas in his body without making any noise.

6729
03:34:25,330 --> 03:34:27,300
gas in his body without making any noise.

6730
03:34:27,300 --> 03:34:28,570
Hosei thought to himself,

6731
03:34:28,570 --> 03:34:29,900
Hosei thought to himself,

6732
03:34:29,900 --> 03:34:33,310
"This girl right now

6733
03:34:31,200 --> 03:34:32,070
is eating her lunch together with my fart."

6734
03:34:32,070 --> 03:34:33,310
is eating her lunch together with my fart."

6735
03:34:33,310 --> 03:34:33,640
Then Hoshuu... Hosei...

6736
03:34:33,640 --> 03:34:34,110
Then Hoshuu... Hosei...

6737
03:34:34,110 --> 03:34:36,180
Then Hoshuu... Hosei...

6738
03:34:37,180 --> 03:34:38,610
Come on...

6739
03:34:40,410 --> 03:34:41,850
Mixed up with "revenge (fukushuu)."

6740
03:34:41,850 --> 03:34:43,150
Got it mixed up with "revenge (fukushuu)."

6741
03:34:42,110 --> 03:34:43,080
Come on, Katsu.

6742
03:34:42,980 --> 03:34:44,150
Come on, Katsumata.

6743
03:34:44,150 --> 03:34:45,350
That's not like you.

6744
03:34:48,520 --> 03:34:51,460
He mixed up "revenge (fukushuu)" and "Hosei," I suppose.

6745
03:34:51,460 --> 03:34:52,630
Anyone else?

6746
03:34:52,630 --> 03:34:53,390
Could I?

6747
03:34:53,690 --> 03:34:54,630
Um, on Hamada,

6748
03:34:54,630 --> 03:34:55,660
Um, on Hamada,

6749
03:34:56,730 --> 03:34:57,800
these few years, his absent-mindedness

6750
03:34:57,800 --> 03:35:01,600
these few years, his absent-mindedness

6751
03:34:59,600 --> 03:35:01,600
has gotten worse and worse.

6752
03:35:01,530 --> 03:35:03,270
This happened when he went on a location shoot to Hokkaido.

6753
03:35:01,670 --> 03:35:32,730
Hamada's Secret Info

6754
03:35:01,670 --> 03:35:32,730
On location in Hokkaido

6755
03:35:04,270 --> 03:35:08,770
The original purpose of the shoot

6756
03:35:06,510 --> 03:35:08,770
was to feature desserts.

6757
03:35:07,810 --> 03:35:10,110
But on a previous trip that Hamada had made there privately,

6758
03:35:10,110 --> 03:35:12,240
he found a ramen place that he liked

6759
03:35:11,210 --> 03:35:12,240
so he said he wanted to go there...

6760
03:35:12,340 --> 03:35:14,410
and suddenly changed the content of the shoot.

6761
03:35:14,410 --> 03:35:15,850
He remembered two pieces of information.

6762
03:35:15,850 --> 03:35:16,780
"It's a ramen place in Otaru, and

6763
03:35:16,780 --> 03:35:20,250
"It's a ramen place in Otaru, and

6764
03:35:17,820 --> 03:35:20,250
the name is 'Orange.'  Go find it," he tells the staff.

6765
03:35:20,250 --> 03:35:23,220
With this much information, using the internet these days,

6766
03:35:23,220 --> 03:35:24,490
you should be able to find the place, right?

6767
03:35:24,490 --> 03:35:26,460
So they search and search but they can't find it.

6768
03:35:26,460 --> 03:35:29,500
And after asking the locals many different things, what they found in the end was

6769
03:35:29,500 --> 03:35:30,860
a ramen place in East Otaru

6770
03:35:30,860 --> 03:35:32,730
a ramen place in East Otaru

6771
03:35:31,400 --> 03:35:32,730
called "Mikan."*

6772
03:35:31,400 --> 03:35:34,070
*Note: "Mikan" is a type of mandarin orange that is common in Japan.

6773
03:35:33,870 --> 03:35:35,300
That is...

6774
03:35:36,070 --> 03:35:38,040
That is just...

6775
03:35:36,700 --> 03:35:38,400
Hamada, please.

6776
03:35:38,040 --> 03:35:39,670
Hamada, please.

6777
03:35:38,900 --> 03:35:40,870
Hamada, on this issue, if you could please...

6778
03:35:40,410 --> 03:35:42,340
Hamada, if you could please...

6779
03:35:44,180 --> 03:35:45,340
That's awful.

6780
03:35:45,880 --> 03:35:48,910
I heard another awful story about his aging.

6781
03:35:48,910 --> 03:35:50,880
Hamada made a call to one of his juniors.

6782
03:35:50,880 --> 03:35:52,120
To Iwahashi of Plus Minus,

6783
03:35:52,120 --> 03:35:53,220
To Iwahashi of Plus Minus,

6784
03:35:53,220 --> 03:35:55,020
he made a call and got his answering machine.

6785
03:35:53,220 --> 03:36:02,860
Informant

6786
03:35:53,220 --> 03:36:02,860
Plus Minus' Iwahashi

6787
03:35:53,390 --> 03:36:23,480
Hamada's Secret Info

6788
03:35:53,390 --> 03:36:23,480
The Answering Machine

6789
03:35:55,020 --> 03:35:56,560
Hamada left a message, but

6790
03:35:56,590 --> 03:35:57,620
in the middle of it, he thinks he's talking

6791
03:35:57,620 --> 03:36:02,860
in the middle of it, he thinks he's talking

6792
03:35:59,020 --> 03:36:02,860
to the person instead.

6793
03:36:00,130 --> 03:36:02,860
I had Iwahashi play the message for me.

6794
03:36:03,500 --> 03:36:05,600
"You have 1 new message."

6795
03:36:05,600 --> 03:36:06,770
"Beep."

6796
03:36:06,770 --> 03:36:08,830
"Hello, it's Hamada."

6797
03:36:08,830 --> 03:36:10,700
"How are you for next Thursday?"

6798
03:36:10,700 --> 03:36:13,010
"How are you for next Thursday?"

6799
03:36:13,240 --> 03:36:16,210
"Wondering if you want to get a meal or something."

6800
03:36:16,210 --> 03:36:18,480
"Next Thursday... How are you?"

6801
03:36:18,480 --> 03:36:20,480
"Next Thursday... How are you?"

6802
03:36:20,480 --> 03:36:23,480
"Hey, are you listening!?"

6803
03:36:22,050 --> 03:36:23,480
"Hey,  are you listening!?"

6804
03:36:24,480 --> 03:36:26,850
What the hell are you talking about?

6805
03:36:26,850 --> 03:36:29,220
What the hell are you talking about?

6806
03:36:28,020 --> 03:36:29,320
How could that happen?

6807
03:36:28,990 --> 03:36:30,760
He forgot what was going on.

6808
03:36:30,820 --> 03:36:33,460
Jin, what the hell is that?

6809
03:36:32,660 --> 03:36:34,760
It got all mixed up in his head.

6810
03:36:34,160 --> 03:36:35,930
He got it mixed up.

6811
03:36:38,900 --> 03:36:40,770
That's awful.

6812
03:36:39,600 --> 03:36:41,400
Yeah, that's awful.

6813
03:36:40,600 --> 03:36:42,300
Oh, YOU, go ahead.

6814
03:36:42,330 --> 03:36:43,640
On Hamada's aging...

6815
03:36:43,640 --> 03:36:45,870
On Hamada's aging...

6816
03:36:45,870 --> 03:36:49,680
it seems that, from the stairs in his house,

6817
03:36:46,240 --> 03:36:56,820
Hamada's Secret Info

6818
03:36:46,240 --> 03:36:56,820
The Stairs in His House

6819
03:36:49,680 --> 03:36:50,840
twice a week is the frequency at which he falls down from them.

6820
03:36:50,840 --> 03:36:52,440
twice a week is the frequency at which he falls down from them.

6821
03:36:52,440 --> 03:36:56,820
twice a week is the frequency at which he falls down from them.

6822
03:36:54,150 --> 03:36:55,780
He falls down...

6823
03:36:55,850 --> 03:36:57,580
Twice a week?

6824
03:36:58,020 --> 03:36:59,690
In his house, right?

6825
03:36:59,520 --> 03:37:01,250
He falls down from them?

6826
03:37:01,020 --> 03:37:03,220
He should be the most used to them.

6827
03:37:02,620 --> 03:37:05,120
Even with your eyes closed, you should be able to climb them.

6828
03:37:04,160 --> 03:37:05,420
Twice a week?

6829
03:37:07,290 --> 03:37:09,860
This happened just a few days ago.  He finished shooting,

6830
03:37:07,830 --> 03:37:20,170
After Shooting...

6831
03:37:07,830 --> 03:37:20,170
Hamada's Secret Info

6832
03:37:09,860 --> 03:37:11,000
and Hamada kept going like this,

6833
03:37:11,000 --> 03:37:12,560
and Hamada kept going like this,

6834
03:37:12,560 --> 03:37:14,400
so I was wondering what he was doing.

6835
03:37:14,400 --> 03:37:20,170
Turns out he was looking for his

6836
03:37:15,530 --> 03:37:20,170
lapel mic that he had aleady taken off a while ago.

6837
03:37:20,770 --> 03:37:23,010
That guy, seriously.

6838
03:37:22,880 --> 03:37:24,940
That's crazy.

6839
03:37:28,880 --> 03:37:30,320
Really.

6840
03:37:31,020 --> 03:37:32,790
Oh, on the left.

6841
03:37:32,790 --> 03:37:35,190
This is a story about Endo.

6842
03:37:35,190 --> 03:37:37,290
When he was young and still getting started, performing at the Ginza Lot 7 Theatre,

6843
03:37:35,290 --> 03:37:58,340
Crowd Warming at the Ginza Lot 7 Theatre

6844
03:37:35,290 --> 03:37:58,340
Endo's Secret Info

6845
03:37:37,290 --> 03:37:39,290
he was a warm-up comedian there.

6846
03:37:39,790 --> 03:37:41,260
And the director had told him,

6847
03:37:41,260 --> 03:37:44,060
from a while ago, when you call the performer on stage,

6848
03:37:44,060 --> 03:37:45,300
say a catchphrase or something for them

6849
03:37:45,300 --> 03:37:49,170
say a catchphrase or something for them

6850
03:37:47,070 --> 03:37:49,170
right before you introduce them.

6851
03:37:49,170 --> 03:37:50,500
After thinking on it for a while,

6852
03:37:50,500 --> 03:37:52,140
*Note: Katsura Bunchin is a comedian who is much more senior than Endo and was much more accomplished than Endo at that time.

6853
03:37:50,500 --> 03:37:52,140
for Katsura Bunchin's* introduction, he said,

6854
03:37:52,140 --> 03:37:57,610
"He's recently been improving by leaps and bounds.

6855
03:37:54,070 --> 03:37:57,610
Here's Katsura Bunchin."

6856
03:37:58,710 --> 03:38:00,810
What?

6857
03:38:00,210 --> 03:38:02,480
No way.

6858
03:38:02,480 --> 03:38:04,680
What an idiot.

6859
03:38:03,320 --> 03:38:09,420
A veteran comedian who has been in the business for over 40 years

6860
03:38:03,320 --> 03:38:09,420
Katsura Bunchin

6861
03:38:03,380 --> 03:38:05,120
Seriously?

6862
03:38:04,620 --> 03:38:08,550
Endo was called into his dressing room and he said to Endo, "Who do you think you are?"

6863
03:38:05,680 --> 03:38:09,420
Who do you think you are?

6864
03:38:09,490 --> 03:38:11,220
That's to be expected.

6865
03:38:09,520 --> 03:38:11,220
Ballsy.

6866
03:38:10,420 --> 03:38:11,990
Of course he'd be scolded.

6867
03:38:11,390 --> 03:38:13,060
My apologies.

6868
03:38:13,790 --> 03:38:14,790
Go ahead, anyone.

6869
03:38:15,890 --> 03:38:17,100
This is about Kiyoshi.

6870
03:38:17,460 --> 03:38:18,660
Kiyoshi?

6871
03:38:17,960 --> 03:38:21,030
Um, in the Tokai region...

6872
03:38:19,330 --> 03:38:20,970
About me?

6873
03:38:22,230 --> 03:38:23,370
Yes.  In the Tokai region...

6874
03:38:22,770 --> 03:38:23,000
Hello.

6875
03:38:23,000 --> 03:38:24,340
Hello.

6876
03:38:23,370 --> 03:38:24,340
Yes.  In the Tokai region...

6877
03:38:24,270 --> 03:38:25,940
he was doing a location shoot...

6878
03:38:26,710 --> 03:38:28,510
Excuse us.

6879
03:38:28,210 --> 03:38:29,780
Sorry about that.

6880
03:38:31,310 --> 03:38:33,110
He's been acting weird over there.

6881
03:38:34,250 --> 03:38:36,680
Everyone was too scared to do him in the first round.

6882
03:38:38,450 --> 03:38:40,320
Sorry about

6883
03:38:38,780 --> 03:38:40,320
greeting you there...

6884
03:38:42,890 --> 03:38:46,590
Let's calm down for a second here.

6885
03:38:46,830 --> 03:38:49,160
He was doing a location shoot in the Tokai region,

6886
03:38:46,930 --> 03:39:09,010
At a Shoot in the Tokai Region...

6887

Nishikawa Kiyoshi's Secret Info

6888
03:38:49,160 --> 03:38:51,030
and I was on the same program,

6889
03:38:51,030 --> 03:38:53,200
and we always take a cast and crew bus

6890
03:38:53,200 --> 03:38:54,470
to go from Nagoya Station to the location.

6891
03:38:55,830 --> 03:39:01,140
Every time we get on the bus,

6892
03:38:57,870 --> 03:38:58,370
he immediately says, "Let's have a preparatory meeting."

6893
03:38:58,370 --> 03:39:01,140
he immediately says, "Let's have a preparatory meeting."

6894
03:39:01,140 --> 03:39:03,840
"Let's have a meeting," he'll say. "Let's have it when we get on the highway," he'll say.

6895
03:39:03,810 --> 03:39:09,010
Every time when we get on the highway

6896
03:39:04,840 --> 03:39:05,310
*snore* - he's sleeping.

6897
03:39:05,310 --> 03:39:09,010
*snore* - he's sleeping.

6898
03:39:11,480 --> 03:39:13,450
Then are you guys fine without doing the meeting?

6899
03:39:13,490 --> 03:39:15,250
We just have the meeting when we get to the location.

6900
03:39:16,960 --> 03:39:18,690
So he does mean to do it. He has the motivation.

6901
03:39:20,030 --> 03:39:21,630
The mornings are early, so, you know.

6902
03:39:21,390 --> 03:39:24,600
I also have something on Kiyoshi.

6903
03:39:24,600 --> 03:39:25,860
Recently, we did a live duo performance.

6904
03:39:25,860 --> 03:39:27,670
Recently, we did a live duo performance.

6905
03:39:27,930 --> 03:39:55,890
Backstage at a Duo Performance...

6906

Nishikawa Kiyoshi's Secret Info

6907
03:39:28,030 --> 03:39:31,240
We had invited

6908
03:39:29,000 --> 03:39:31,240
Kiyoshi to appear as a guest,

6909
03:39:31,240 --> 03:39:32,240
and he had agreed to come on.

6910
03:39:32,240 --> 03:39:34,570
For that performance, we had written three new stand-up routines.

6911
03:39:34,570 --> 03:39:37,380
For that performance, we had written three new stand-up routines.

6912
03:39:37,380 --> 03:39:39,550
But we got them done just the day before or so, so on the day of,

6913
03:39:39,550 --> 03:39:41,350
But we got them done just the day before or so, so on the day of,

6914
03:39:41,350 --> 03:39:43,980
two hours before we go on stage, Nobu and I

6915
03:39:43,980 --> 03:39:46,290
planned to just rehearse in that time.

6916
03:39:45,180 --> 03:39:46,950
Just hole ourselves in our dressing room.

6917
03:39:46,390 --> 03:39:49,620
So right when we had holed ourselves in our dressing room and started to rehearse

6918
03:39:49,620 --> 03:39:52,760
in front of the mirror, there was a knock on the door.

6919
03:39:52,790 --> 03:39:54,390
"It's Nishikawa," we heard, and he came in.

6920
03:39:54,390 --> 03:39:56,430
"It's Nishikawa," we heard, and he came in.

6921
03:39:55,890 --> 03:40:22,620

Nishikawa Kiyoshi's Secret Info

6923
03:39:57,030 --> 03:40:02,070
"Are you guys in the middle of a manzai rehearsal?

6924
03:39:59,000 --> 03:40:02,070
This is the most important moment."

6925
03:40:01,000 --> 03:40:02,600
As he says that,

6926
03:40:02,600 --> 03:40:05,440
He came in, sat down,

6927
03:40:03,540 --> 03:40:05,440
and just kept talking

6928
03:40:05,640 --> 03:40:06,910
I thought, "Oh? You're gonna have a seat?"

6929
03:40:06,910 --> 03:40:08,140
This is the most important moment

6930
03:40:08,140 --> 03:40:10,940
And the person who knows this best

6931
03:40:10,940 --> 03:40:13,280
is sitting here with us, is what I thought

6932
03:40:13,280 --> 03:40:15,150
"It's important to rehearse your routine"

6933
03:40:15,180 --> 03:40:15,950
"Yasushi-kun and I, when we had new comedic material,

6934
03:40:15,950 --> 03:40:16,820
"Yasushi-kun and I, when we had new comedic material,

6935
03:40:16,820 --> 03:40:20,920
"Yasushi-kun and I, when we had new comedic material,

6936
03:40:17,920 --> 03:40:20,920
we had to rehearse it at least 20 times!"

6937
03:40:20,920 --> 03:40:22,620
I wanted him to let me do exactly that...

6938
03:40:27,360 --> 03:40:28,730
You were going to do exactly that...

6939
03:40:28,730 --> 03:40:30,730
Yeah, you would've done exactly that

6940
03:40:33,270 --> 03:40:33,930
And...

6941
03:40:33,400 --> 03:40:49,750
Backstage at a Duo Performance...

Nishikawa Kiyoshi's Secret Info

6943
03:40:34,400 --> 03:40:36,200
Sorry about that

6944
03:40:35,070 --> 03:40:37,500
Not at all, so then

6945
03:40:37,500 --> 03:40:40,410
I thought, "What do I do?!" There was only 20 minutes

6946
03:40:40,410 --> 03:40:42,940
until the live performance and that's when I knew we were in trouble

6947
03:40:42,940 --> 03:40:44,110
Seriously speaking here

6948
03:40:44,040 --> 03:40:45,110
He goes "ALRIGHT!!" and then stood up

6949
03:40:45,110 --> 03:40:45,980
He goes "ALRIGHT!!" and then stood up

6950
03:40:46,080 --> 03:40:47,380
He says to me and Nobu,

6951
03:40:47,280 --> 03:40:49,750
"Let's go get some ramen!!"

6952
03:40:53,750 --> 03:40:55,620
That is ridiculous

6953
03:40:55,850 --> 03:40:57,160
That's ridiculous

6954
03:40:57,160 --> 03:40:58,560
At the location of the duo performance

6955
03:40:58,560 --> 03:41:00,960
20 minutes before it starts, no one would go to get ramen

6956
03:41:01,160 --> 03:41:02,530
So I said to the master (Kiyoshi)

6957
03:41:02,290 --> 03:41:23,580
Backstage at a Duo Performance...

Nishikawa Kiyoshi's Secret Info

6959
03:41:02,530 --> 03:41:06,060
"We'll pass on the ramen..." And then Master replied,

6960
03:41:06,060 --> 03:41:07,070
"That so? If it's just me, I'll go eat soba,"

6961
03:41:07,070 --> 03:41:12,700
"That so? If it's just me, I'll go eat soba,"

6962
03:41:08,870 --> 03:41:12,700
and he just left us with that weird statement

6963
03:41:12,140 --> 03:41:14,040
And it was about 5 minutes before the performance

6964
03:41:14,040 --> 03:41:16,610
We went to the back of the lobby and said, "I look forward to working with you"

6965
03:41:16,610 --> 03:41:21,010
"Looking forward to it!!" he says

6966
03:41:17,640 --> 03:41:21,010
while eating a tempura rice bowl

6967
03:41:21,280 --> 03:41:22,580
He didn't eat soba??

6968
03:41:22,980 --> 03:41:24,420
Ramen, then soba!!

6969
03:41:24,420 --> 03:41:26,420
This is ridiculous

6970
03:41:27,320 --> 03:41:29,290
Did you change your mind?

6971
03:41:29,660 --> 03:41:31,960
You keep changing it, ramen, soba...

6972
03:41:30,790 --> 03:41:31,920
Is that what it's about?

6973
03:41:33,490 --> 03:41:37,260
If it's about food

6974
03:41:34,490 --> 03:41:37,260
I think it'll be a hit

6975
03:41:36,600 --> 03:41:38,460
A series about food?

6976
03:41:37,460 --> 03:41:38,460
Well...

6978
03:41:37,630 --> 03:41:53,250
Okonomiyaki Topping

6979
03:41:38,460 --> 03:41:40,900
Kiyoshi says, "Let's go get okonomiyaki*"

6980
03:41:38,460 --> 03:41:43,600
*Notes: Okonomiyaki is a savory Japanese pancake

6981
03:41:40,900 --> 03:41:44,840
The two of us went together and he says, "This time, I want to try something unusual."

6982
03:41:45,200 --> 03:41:46,000
"Can we get kimchi as a topping?"

6983
03:41:46,000 --> 03:41:48,270
"Can we get kimchi as a topping?"

6984
03:41:47,910 --> 03:41:50,340
So the restaurant staff put kimchi on top

6985
03:41:50,380 --> 03:41:53,250
Master just uses his spatula

6986
03:41:51,440 --> 03:41:53,250
and flings it right off

6987
03:41:59,720 --> 03:42:01,550
No way... He flings the kimchi??

6988
03:42:01,550 --> 03:42:04,090
"I can't eat it like this"

6989
03:42:04,120 --> 03:42:05,460
Even though he asked for it?

6990
03:42:08,060 --> 03:42:10,530
Give us a break

6991
03:42:11,030 --> 03:42:11,630
We've all heard of stage taboos, right?

6992
03:42:11,630 --> 03:42:13,630
We've all heard of stage taboos, right?

6993
03:42:13,630 --> 03:42:15,000
Master Kiyoshi was

6996
03:42:15,000 --> 03:42:18,700
the chief judge of the Osaka Manzai Contest

6997
03:42:18,970 --> 03:42:23,640
Note: Denis is a comedy duo

6998
03:42:18,970 --> 03:42:23,780
While Denis was in the middle of their routine,

6999
03:42:20,940 --> 03:42:21,970
Kiyoshi suddenly stood up and said, "SOOO FUNNY!!"

7000
03:42:21,970 --> 03:42:23,780
Kiyoshi suddenly stood up and said, "SOOO FUNNY!!"

7001
03:42:27,580 --> 03:42:30,150
And then Denis didn't become popular at all

7002
03:42:31,050 --> 03:42:32,420
In the middle of preparations!

7003
03:42:32,380 --> 03:42:34,820
I've also been

7004
03:42:32,380 --> 03:42:34,820
told that (while onstage)

7005
03:42:34,690 --> 03:42:35,490
In the middle of it!

Stage Taboo

7008
03:42:35,690 --> 03:42:37,960
There is a place called the Okinawa Theater

7009
03:42:37,960 --> 03:42:40,630
It was first my turn and then Master Kiyoshi's turn

7010
03:42:40,630 --> 03:42:42,630
We were doing our manzai and my line was

7011
03:42:42,130 --> 03:42:44,660
I know this one

7012
03:42:42,630 --> 03:42:46,770
"For a manzai comedian, someone unprecedented, like Master Yokoyama Yasushi, is awesome."

7013
03:42:46,770 --> 03:42:49,600
I say to Paradise, "Say what your great ambition is!"

7014
03:42:49,600 --> 03:42:52,470
Paradise exclaims, "My dream is to become the greatest manzai comedian

7015
03:42:52,470 --> 03:42:55,270
and get rich!" And right after that,

7016
03:42:55,270 --> 03:42:56,910
Master says from the side of the stage, "WELL SAID!"

7017
03:42:56,910 --> 03:42:59,080
Master says from the side of the stage, "WELL SAID!"

7018
03:43:00,680 --> 03:43:02,210
From the side of the stage, "WELL SAID!"

7019
03:43:02,880 --> 03:43:05,150
That was just the set-up of the joke...

7020
03:43:09,720 --> 03:43:11,620
I remember it well

7021
03:43:11,220 --> 03:43:12,720
Nakagawa Reiji, go ahead

Stage Taboo

7024
03:43:12,720 --> 03:43:15,860
A long time ago, on a comedy show, Kiyoshi was the host

7025
03:43:15,860 --> 03:43:18,660
"Here's Nakagawa-Ke! If you'd please!"

7026
03:43:15,860 --> 03:43:21,870
Note: Nakagawa-Ke is a brother manzai duo, which means Nakagawa Family

7027
03:43:18,660 --> 03:43:20,900
And after that, he was getting off the stage, but

7028
03:43:20,900 --> 03:43:22,830
at the same time, we're getting on the stage

7029
03:43:22,830 --> 03:43:23,940
Right as we pass each other, he says "GO GET 'EM!!"

7030
03:43:23,940 --> 03:43:25,470
Right as we pass each other, he says "GO GET 'EM!!"

7031
03:43:27,910 --> 03:43:30,040
He sure shouts a lot

7032
03:43:31,210 --> 03:43:33,180
It was live and he got to make a joke before we had a chance

7033
03:43:33,180 --> 03:43:33,910
Were you surprised?

7034
03:43:33,950 --> 03:43:36,010
I was surprised

7035
03:43:36,820 --> 03:43:38,180
"GO GET 'EM!! GO!!" he says

7036
03:43:40,720 --> 03:43:42,420
Wow, that's amazing

7037
03:43:42,790 --> 03:43:44,820
Oh, Nishikawa-kun, do you have something to say?

7038
03:43:45,160 --> 03:43:45,720
Um...

7039
03:43:45,720 --> 03:43:48,590
May I speak about Sakata Toshio?

7040
03:43:45,720 --> 03:43:53,030
Note: Sakata Toshio is a long-time comedian, currently 74 years old. He is commonly referred to as Master Sakata or Aho-no-Sakata (That-Idiot-Sakata)

7041
03:43:48,590 --> 03:43:53,800
Sakata Toshio's Secret Info?

7042
03:43:49,330 --> 03:43:51,330
Should we have him say it?

7043
03:43:50,130 --> 03:43:51,330
Yes, I think that's fine

7044
03:43:51,330 --> 03:43:53,330
You guys

7045
03:43:53,330 --> 03:43:55,330
You all know so much

7046
03:43:55,430 --> 03:43:57,770
You guys listen up too, you hear?

7047
03:44:00,310 --> 03:44:01,640
We're all listening

7048
03:44:01,610 --> 03:44:03,040
Is this a funeral?

7049
03:44:03,010 --> 03:44:05,010
A funeral...

7050
03:44:11,150 --> 03:44:13,220
Why would you say funeral, of all things?

7051
03:44:17,960 --> 03:44:18,820
I can do this...

7052
03:44:18,820 --> 03:44:22,030
It was like, "Let's prank call Sakata Toshio's house"

7053
03:44:20,390 --> 03:45:18,720
Prank Call

Sakata Toshi's Secret Info

7055
03:44:22,030 --> 03:44:22,960
When I call his place...

7056
03:44:23,060 --> 03:44:27,700
Sakata and his wife always sleep together, so

7057
03:44:27,700 --> 03:44:31,400
Sakata wakes up and his wife is wondering what it is

7058
03:44:31,400 --> 03:44:34,810
"Excuse me, this is Asahi Broadcasting"

7059
03:44:34,810 --> 03:44:37,810
"Tomorrow, Sakata Toshio will be making an appearance so...

7060
03:44:37,810 --> 03:44:40,980
This is for a mic check so I apologize, but..."

7061
03:44:40,450 --> 03:44:43,820
It was about 11:30 or 12:30. "I'm sorry, but

7062
03:44:43,820 --> 03:44:46,620
2 pot lids?"

7063
03:44:43,820 --> 03:44:46,620
do you have

7064
03:44:46,490 --> 03:44:49,220
"I'm sorry, but with the 2 lids, could you...

7065
03:44:49,220 --> 03:44:50,690
I apologize for asking for this in the middle of the night, but..."

7066
03:44:50,690 --> 03:44:53,090
"It's for a mic check so

7067
03:44:50,690 --> 03:44:53,090
could you bang the lids together?"

7068
03:44:53,330 --> 03:44:55,560
Sakata then... Haha...

7069
03:44:55,560 --> 03:45:01,670
He puts down the phone and starts banging the pot lids together in front of the phone, when...

7070
03:45:01,670 --> 03:45:02,400
His wife says, as she's in bed

7071
03:45:02,400 --> 03:45:03,640
His wife says, as she's in bed

7072
03:45:03,800 --> 03:45:07,040
"Dear... What's happened?"

7073
03:45:03,800 --> 03:45:07,040
"Dear... What's happened?"

7074
03:45:07,070 --> 03:45:12,180
"Dear... Dear... You've gone crazy..."

7075
03:45:07,070 --> 03:45:12,180
"Dear... Dear... You've gone crazy..."

7076
03:45:08,640 --> 03:45:12,180
"Dear... Dear... You've gone crazy..."

7077
03:45:08,640 --> 03:45:12,180
"Dear... Dear... You've gone crazy..."

7078
03:45:09,810 --> 03:45:12,180
"Dear... Dear... You've gone crazy..."

7079
03:45:09,810 --> 03:45:12,180
"Dear... Dear... You've gone crazy..."

7081
03:45:11,710 --> 03:45:12,310
Yes?

7082
03:45:12,380 --> 03:45:14,010
I hate to do this in the middle of your story, but

7083
03:45:14,010 --> 03:45:16,880
this ain't funny at all

7084
03:45:17,080 --> 03:45:18,350
Hey now!!

7085
03:45:22,850 --> 03:45:24,290
Bad...

7086
03:45:24,290 --> 03:45:26,260
He's such a bad guy!

7087
03:45:28,530 --> 03:45:30,060
Such a bad guy

7088
03:45:31,500 --> 03:45:36,470
Oh, sorry 'bout that...

7089
03:45:32,400 --> 03:45:36,470
Oh, sorry 'bout that...

7090
03:45:38,340 --> 03:45:40,240
It's 9PM

7091
03:45:38,870 --> 03:45:43,140
Detective Duties: 13 Hours

7092
03:45:40,240 --> 03:45:42,670
Going back to where the new detectives are

7093
03:45:42,670 --> 03:45:45,280
A strange request comes in unexpectedly

7094
03:45:47,350 --> 03:45:48,850

having a dispute over the inheritance

7098
03:45:54,320 --> 03:45:56,190
having a dispute over the inheritance

7099
03:45:56,190 --> 03:45:59,360
Right now, the relatives are gathered

7100
03:45:59,360 --> 03:46:02,530
They're all gathered so

7101
03:46:00,730 --> 03:46:02,530
They want you guys to mediate

7102
03:46:02,930 --> 03:46:10,570
Going in Circles Over Inheritance, Family Gathering

7103
03:46:02,930 --> 03:46:10,570
They Head Out as Detectives to Resolve the Issue!!

7104
03:46:04,530 --> 03:46:05,400
Inugami family...

7105
03:46:05,000 --> 03:46:05,830
Relatives?

7106
03:46:05,830 --> 03:46:08,070
Having a dispute... Over the inheritance?

7107
03:46:08,100 --> 03:46:10,400
A dispute over the inheritance, it seems

7108
03:46:11,570 --> 03:46:18,980
Inugami Family Room

7109
03:46:11,570 --> 03:46:21,180

7110
03:46:14,110 --> 03:46:15,910
Pardon us

7111
03:46:16,170 --> 03:46:18,980
We're from the Detective Agency; would it be okay for us to sit here?

7112
03:46:18,980 --> 03:46:23,880
Thank you very much for going out of your way for us.

7113
03:46:20,980 --> 03:46:23,880
Please, have a seat.

7114
03:46:28,020 --> 03:46:30,020
Excuse us, thank you for having us

7115
03:46:34,260 --> 03:46:38,300
Sir,

7116
03:46:35,530 --> 03:46:38,300
would you please hurry and read the will for us?

7117
03:46:38,500 --> 03:46:41,170
Inugami Takeko

7118
03:46:38,500 --> 03:46:41,170
Second Daughter

7119
03:46:38,730 --> 03:46:41,030
Madam Takeko, please wait a moment

7120
03:46:41,170 --> 03:46:48,870
While Sahei-san was alive, he instructed,

7121
03:46:42,830 --> 03:46:44,170
"The will is to be read when all members of the Inugami family are gathered."

7122
03:46:44,170 --> 03:46:48,870
"The will is to be read when all members of the Inugami family are gathered."

7123
03:46:44,170 --> 03:46:48,870
Lawyer Furudate

7124
03:46:48,240 --> 03:46:49,310
What did you say?

7125
03:46:49,340 --> 03:46:50,840
Takeko-san... I apologize, everyone

7126
03:46:50,840 --> 03:46:52,210
Takeko-san... I apologize, everyone

7127
03:46:52,380 --> 03:46:55,250
Eldest Daughter

7128
03:46:52,380 --> 03:46:55,250
Inugami Matsuko

7129
03:46:52,540 --> 03:46:55,250
My son should be here shortly

7130
03:47:02,690 --> 03:47:09,560
Eldest Daughter Matsuko's Son's Arrival

7131
03:47:07,230 --> 03:47:10,500
Now, hurry and come sit here

7132
03:47:11,000 --> 03:47:12,760
What the hell is this?

7133
03:47:18,770 --> 03:47:20,570
Now sir, please begin

7134
03:47:20,570 --> 03:47:23,240
Now sir, please begin

7135
03:47:22,370 --> 03:47:23,240
Before we begin

7136
03:47:23,240 --> 03:47:24,140
Madam Matsuko, I have a favor to ask...

7137
03:47:24,140 --> 03:47:26,210
Madam Matsuko, I have a favor to ask...

7138
03:47:25,680 --> 03:47:27,010
What could it be?

7139
03:47:27,010 --> 03:47:28,410
The person there, is that truly your son,

7140
03:47:28,410 --> 03:47:30,720
The person there, is that truly your son,

7141
03:47:30,720 --> 03:47:34,690
Itao or not..?

7142
03:47:33,250 --> 03:47:34,850
What did you say?

7143
03:47:34,920 --> 03:47:37,960
I don't mean to doubt you, but...

7144
03:47:37,990 --> 03:47:40,290
If you could just let us see your face

7145
03:47:40,790 --> 03:47:42,890
Then sir

7146
03:47:43,230 --> 03:47:44,800
are you saying that this Itao is an imposter?

7147
03:47:44,800 --> 03:47:50,440
are you saying that this Itao is an imposter?

7148
03:47:46,970 --> 03:47:49,330
No, that is not what I'm saying at all, but...

7149
03:47:49,330 --> 03:47:51,370
How troublesome

7150
03:47:51,540 --> 03:47:52,540
Just once, you must remove your hood

7151
03:47:52,540 --> 03:47:57,510
Just once, you must remove your hood

7152
03:47:54,040 --> 03:47:57,510
and let us see your face

7153
03:47:57,710 --> 03:47:59,610
If you must insist...

7154
03:48:00,180 --> 03:48:01,650
Itao, take off your hood!!

7155
03:48:01,280 --> 03:48:03,820
Fufu...

7156
03:48:01,650 --> 03:48:03,820
Itao, take off your hood!!

7157
03:48:07,390 --> 03:48:08,550
It's Sukekiyo

7158
03:48:07,390 --> 03:48:11,820
Note: Sukekiyo is the name of the character that Itao is based on

7159
03:48:18,560 --> 03:48:22,030
(from Yoshimoto Creative Agency)

7160
03:48:18,560 --> 03:48:22,030
Itao Itsuji

7161
03:48:21,430 --> 03:48:22,430
That is unnecessary

7162
03:48:25,370 --> 03:48:26,600
So unnecessary

7163
03:48:27,010 --> 03:48:28,510
He's definitely messing around

7164
03:48:36,080 --> 03:48:37,180
Well then,

7165
03:48:37,180 --> 03:48:39,880
this Itao over there, you can't tell if he's the real person or not

7166
03:48:39,880 --> 03:48:41,750
Isn't that right, Umeko-san?

7167
03:48:41,750 --> 03:48:42,990
Indeed

7168
03:48:42,990 --> 03:48:45,260
Itao is such a troublesome person

7169
03:48:45,260 --> 03:48:48,090
Itao... Itao is...

7170
03:48:47,430 --> 03:48:48,390
My my...

7171
03:48:48,390 --> 03:48:50,530
How dare you!!

7172
03:48:50,530 --> 03:48:52,900
You detectives over there, what is with your expression?

7173
03:48:52,900 --> 03:48:53,670
You detectives over there, what is with your expression?

7174
03:48:53,670 --> 03:48:55,570
You detectives over there, what is with your expression?

7175
03:48:55,570 --> 03:49:04,380
"This is not Itao," is that it?

7176
03:48:59,640 --> 03:49:04,380
We don't know if he's truly Itao or not!!

7177
03:49:02,510 --> 03:49:04,040
How dare you

7178
03:49:04,440 --> 03:49:05,880
Itao!

7179
03:49:05,880 --> 03:49:07,050
Don't just sit there silently, say something!!

7180
03:49:07,050 --> 03:49:08,780
Don't just sit there silently, say something!!

7181
03:49:12,220 --> 03:49:17,020
It's Itao!!

7182
03:49:19,060 --> 03:49:20,460
In Osaka dialect...

7183
03:49:21,260 --> 03:49:22,530
"It's"...

7184
03:49:31,200 --> 03:49:33,710
All of you members

7185
03:49:34,540 --> 03:49:36,640
It's me, Itao

7186
03:49:40,180 --> 03:49:42,810
Tanaka

7187
03:49:43,620 --> 03:49:44,380
Yes?

7188
03:49:45,320 --> 03:49:50,160
You know it's me, right?

7189
03:49:53,090 --> 03:49:56,160
Why me?

7190
03:50:02,100 --> 03:50:03,800
Endo

7191
03:50:06,400 --> 03:50:08,940
Do you feel the same way that Tanaka does?

7192
03:50:08,940 --> 03:50:13,650
Do you feel the same way that Tanaka does?

7193
03:50:11,210 --> 03:50:13,480
What kind of way of talking is that?

7194
03:50:13,910 --> 03:50:16,480
What a roundabout way to talk

7195
03:50:15,280 --> 03:50:17,650
What the hell?

7196
03:50:18,180 --> 03:50:22,290
Hama-n

7197
03:50:27,260 --> 03:50:28,890
He's never said that

7198
03:50:28,590 --> 03:50:31,030
He hasn't said "Hama-n" before?

7199
03:50:29,630 --> 03:50:31,000
Never

7200
03:50:35,770 --> 03:50:39,100
Hama-n, you believe me, right?

7201
03:50:39,100 --> 03:50:43,040
Hama-n, you believe me, right?

7202
03:50:45,710 --> 03:50:49,150
Hama-n, you feel the same way that Tanaka feels?

7203
03:50:49,150 --> 03:50:52,250
Hama-n, you feel the same way that Tanaka feels?

7204
03:50:51,050 --> 03:50:53,320
I don't know what that means

7205
03:50:52,250 --> 03:50:56,120
What does "the same way" even mean?

7206
03:50:57,390 --> 03:51:00,260
Tanaka, how do you feel?

7207
03:50:59,020 --> 03:51:00,990
We're forced to agree

7208
03:51:03,490 --> 03:51:05,030
We don't know what Tanaka feels

7209
03:51:05,100 --> 03:51:05,860
Exactly

7210
03:51:06,100 --> 03:51:08,430
Why is he basing everything off of how Tanaka feels?

7211
03:51:09,500 --> 03:51:14,410
O-Matsu

7212
03:51:11,300 --> 03:51:14,410
Am I a girl!?

7213
03:51:17,080 --> 03:51:20,510
That's a girl's name!!

7214
03:51:25,420 --> 03:51:28,920
O-Matsu

7215
03:51:29,590 --> 03:51:33,990
O-Matsu, do you feel the same way Tanaka feels?

7216
03:51:33,990 --> 03:51:37,500
O-Matsu, do you feel the same way Tanaka feels?

7217
03:51:38,260 --> 03:51:40,300
That's what we don't understand!!

7218
03:51:43,470 --> 03:51:46,400
"Tanaka's feeling"

7219
03:51:43,470 --> 03:51:46,400
is what we don't know

7220
03:51:45,100 --> 03:51:47,010
in that case we can only have the same opinion-

7221
03:51:47,010 --> 03:51:48,840
Agree or disagree-

7222
03:51:51,710 --> 03:51:54,280
We could make it clear if we agree or disagree

7223
03:52:03,090 --> 03:52:07,560
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU!?

7224
03:52:09,490 --> 03:52:11,500
I'm Hosei

7225
03:52:12,060 --> 03:52:14,630
You're not popular enough

7226
03:52:17,940 --> 03:52:21,410
It seems you're not popular enough

7227
03:52:22,840 --> 03:52:24,510
I'm done with you guys

7228
03:52:24,780 --> 03:52:29,610
You agree with the statement,

7229
03:52:27,550 --> 03:52:29,610
"you are not the real Itao"?

7230
03:52:29,610 --> 03:52:33,380
You don't believe that

7231
03:52:31,350 --> 03:52:33,380
he is the real Itao!!

7232
03:52:33,750 --> 03:52:35,290
Itao, take off that mask!!

7233
03:52:35,290 --> 03:52:37,090
Itao, take off that mask!!

7234
03:52:37,590 --> 03:52:42,090
Itao Finally Reveals himself

7235
03:52:57,640 --> 03:53:01,180
Isn't this too surreal?

7236
03:53:02,510 --> 03:53:04,980
Isn't this too surreal?

7237
03:53:04,220 --> 03:53:05,450
Itao

7238
03:53:05,450 --> 03:53:07,350
let's go

7239
03:53:08,490 --> 03:53:10,390
They're leaving?

7240
03:53:11,460 --> 03:53:12,120
Just because they didn't recognize he was the real Itao

7241
03:53:12,120 --> 03:53:15,260
Just because they didn't recognize he was the real Itao

7242
03:53:19,800 --> 03:53:21,400
Alright let's go

7243
03:53:23,600 --> 03:53:27,670
That was really too surreal

7244
03:53:24,770 --> 03:53:27,670
Yes, that was well done

7245
03:53:29,210 --> 03:53:31,240
10:00 PM

7246
03:53:29,210 --> 03:53:33,640
14 hours of duty

7247
03:53:31,240 --> 03:53:35,550
When the 5 men who were pushed around by Itao return to their room,

7248
03:53:35,550 --> 03:53:37,550
a new development...

7249
03:53:38,220 --> 03:53:38,650
Hey!! Guys!!

7250
03:53:38,650 --> 03:53:39,750
Hey!! Guys!!

7251
03:53:40,850 --> 03:53:44,590
The Hama-Lisa is gone!!

7252
03:53:42,420 --> 03:53:44,420
Oh wow!!

7253
03:53:45,020 --> 03:53:48,430
Phantom Thief X III

7254
03:53:48,430 --> 03:53:49,390
Phantom Thief X is this statue, so it's this third generation

7255
03:53:49,390 --> 03:53:52,130
Phantom Thief X is this statue, so it's this third generation

7256
03:53:52,630 --> 03:53:59,470
Thief is Phantom Thief X the Third

7257
03:53:53,360 --> 03:53:55,000
So whatever looks like this

7258
03:53:56,930 --> 03:53:58,540
His grandson...

7259
03:53:58,540 --> 03:53:59,470
If that's-

7260
03:53:59,470 --> 03:54:02,040
It could only be Hamada-san

7261
03:54:00,710 --> 03:54:02,110
No it's not me

7262
03:54:02,110 --> 03:54:03,940
Isn't this Hamada-san?

7263
03:54:04,010 --> 03:54:06,740
They look alike

7264
03:54:09,410 --> 03:54:11,120
Emergency Alert!! Emergency Alert!!

7265
03:54:09,410 --> 03:54:24,330
Internal Announcement

7266
03:54:11,120 --> 03:54:12,650
Emergency Alert!! Emergency Alert!!

7267
03:54:13,080 --> 03:54:14,350
The Masterpiece Hama Lisa was stolen by Phantom Thief X III

7268
03:54:14,350 --> 03:54:24,330
The Masterpiece Hama Lisa was stolen by Phantom Thief X III

7269
03:54:17,160 --> 03:54:18,860
All officers please report to the auditorium

7270
03:54:18,860 --> 03:54:24,330
All officers please report to the auditorium

7271
03:54:21,390 --> 03:54:24,830
To the auditorium!

7272
03:54:24,830 --> 03:54:26,830
Okay

7273
03:54:24,830 --> 03:54:31,770
Case of the Stolen Masterpiece Hama Lisa

7274
03:54:24,830 --> 03:54:31,770
Thief is Phantom Thief X III Everybody to Auditorium!!

We got really busy

7276
03:54:28,930 --> 03:54:30,070
We're busy

7277

So everyone, can you come sit over here?

All officers are present

7280
03:54:38,410 --> 03:54:39,810
A very serious atmosphere

7281
03:54:43,050 --> 03:54:45,320
Hamada, you're on the very edge

7282
03:54:46,050 --> 03:54:47,590
He didn't use honorifics though

7283
03:54:49,050 --> 03:54:51,890
Why am I over here?

7284
03:54:52,060 --> 03:54:57,100
Usually Hosei's spot

7285
03:54:55,890 --> 03:54:56,930
Something is off

7286
03:54:56,930 --> 03:54:58,330
The seating is different

7287
03:54:57,960 --> 03:55:05,600
Chief Detective Explains Situation

7288
03:55:00,330 --> 03:55:02,330
As you all know,

7289
03:55:02,970 --> 03:55:05,600
the masterpiece worth 10 million yen,

7290
03:55:05,600 --> 03:55:08,670
the Hama Lisa, was stolen!!

7291
03:55:08,970 --> 03:55:10,440
In order to catch the thief as soon as possible,

7292
03:55:10,440 --> 03:55:12,540
In order to catch the thief as soon as possible,

7293
03:55:12,540 --> 03:55:13,980
we asked for the help of the police department

7294
03:55:13,980 --> 03:55:16,280
we asked for the help of the police department

7295
03:55:17,250 --> 03:55:19,080
With that, please go ahead

7296
03:55:25,090 --> 03:55:26,860
GOD

7297
03:55:25,790 --> 03:55:26,860
DAMN!!

7298
03:55:27,230 --> 03:55:32,630
Masahiro Chono jumps in!!

7299
03:55:27,230 --> 03:55:32,630

7300
03:55:32,300 --> 03:55:34,970
Metropolitan Police Department's...

7301
03:55:35,030 --> 03:55:36,500
CHONO!!

7302
03:55:40,170 --> 03:55:42,070
The thief is Phantom Thief X THE THIRD

7303
03:55:42,070 --> 03:55:45,180
The thief is Phantom Thief X THE THIRD

7304
03:55:45,180 --> 03:55:47,410
The thief is Phantom Thief X THE THIRD

7305
03:55:48,210 --> 03:55:48,910
Hey,

7306
03:55:48,910 --> 03:55:50,620
Bring it here!

7307
03:55:55,150 --> 03:55:56,990
The first...

7308
03:55:56,990 --> 03:55:59,120
Phantom Thief...

7309
03:56:00,260 --> 03:56:02,430
The first Kaito (Phantom Thief) X Statue

7310
03:56:01,130 --> 03:56:02,790
X

7311
03:56:06,330 --> 03:56:09,870
The perpetrator

7312
03:56:09,870 --> 03:56:11,500
looks similar to this

7313
03:56:11,240 --> 03:56:16,310
Looks similar to Phantom Thief X

7314
03:56:11,240 --> 03:56:16,310
Theft Perpetrator

7315
03:56:11,500 --> 03:56:13,500
You understand?

7316
03:56:13,770 --> 03:56:15,370
Hey

7317
03:56:16,010 --> 03:56:18,310
It's different from usual

7318
03:56:16,940 --> 03:56:19,510
The perpetrator should be among us

7319
03:56:19,510 --> 03:56:20,650
The perpetrator should be among us

7320
03:56:22,480 --> 03:56:24,780
He has a distinct feature... His LIPS!!

7321
03:56:24,780 --> 03:56:26,420
He has a distinct feature... His LIPS!!

7322
03:56:27,490 --> 03:56:29,450
They're cod roe

7323
03:56:29,890 --> 03:56:33,560
Nobody is gonna turn themselves in?

7324
03:56:33,990 --> 03:56:40,570
Phantom Thief X Lookalike Search!!

7325
03:56:33,990 --> 03:56:40,570
Point is Cod Roe Lips

7326
03:56:38,800 --> 03:56:40,230
Turn yourself in honestly

7327
03:56:40,230 --> 03:56:42,270
Yama-chan's face is so annoying

7328
03:56:41,330 --> 03:56:42,870
Got it!?

7329
03:56:44,600 --> 03:56:48,170
First you, stand up

7330
03:56:50,940 --> 03:56:52,880
It's different...

7331
03:56:52,880 --> 03:56:54,680
Okay you can sit down

7332
03:56:54,280 --> 03:56:56,280
Okay, stand up

7333
03:57:00,180 --> 03:57:04,190
You can sit down

7334
03:57:04,360 --> 03:57:07,760
It's you

7335
03:57:14,600 --> 03:57:17,130
You don't match either...

7336
03:57:20,370 --> 03:57:22,070
Good for you

7337
03:57:22,110 --> 03:57:26,580
Series First! Hosei is off the hook!!

7338
03:57:25,740 --> 03:57:27,980
You, stand up

7339
03:57:28,650 --> 03:57:30,110
Yes

7340
03:57:31,520 --> 03:57:33,380
It's like lapping

7341
03:57:36,320 --> 03:57:38,790
It's not you either

7342
03:57:40,460 --> 03:57:44,300
Do you have any hints for me?

7343
03:57:44,360 --> 03:57:47,300
A mole...

7344
03:57:45,660 --> 03:57:47,700
He has a mole on his chin...

7345
03:57:48,130 --> 03:57:56,840
Cod Roe lips + Mole on chin

7346
03:57:48,130 --> 03:57:56,840
Theft Perpetrator

7347
03:57:51,000 --> 03:57:53,240
Alright

7348
03:57:55,040 --> 03:57:56,410
Okay!

7349
03:57:56,410 --> 03:57:58,410
Get up!

7350
03:58:01,150 --> 03:58:02,610
Look straight!!

7351
03:58:06,150 --> 03:58:08,350
He's changing his face

7352
03:58:07,320 --> 03:58:09,320
Can you remove your hat?

7353
03:58:09,890 --> 03:58:11,290
Raise your chin; LOOK STRAIGHT!!

7354
03:58:11,290 --> 03:58:12,260
Raise your chin; LOOK STRAIGHT!!

7355
03:58:12,290 --> 03:58:14,060
Hey!

7356
03:58:13,420 --> 03:58:15,390
LOOK STRAIGHT!

7357
03:58:18,760 --> 03:58:21,030
Quite the development

7358
03:58:21,030 --> 03:58:22,400
Amazing!!

7359
03:58:25,640 --> 03:58:27,140
This year's "No Laughing..." is a bit different

7360
03:58:27,140 --> 03:58:30,340
This year's "No Laughing..." is a bit different

7361
03:58:30,340 --> 03:58:33,210
Can you get up (on the stage)?

7362
03:58:32,010 --> 03:58:33,210
What?

7363
03:58:33,210 --> 03:58:35,580
Could you stand next to the statue?

7364
03:58:36,880 --> 03:58:39,250
I'd hate to go up there...

7365
03:58:37,080 --> 03:58:38,350
Hm?

7366
03:58:38,350 --> 03:58:39,980
Yes...

7367
03:58:38,980 --> 03:58:41,190
Alright, please go up

7368
03:58:40,350 --> 03:58:46,660
To the stage to be compared to Phantom Thief X!!

7369
03:58:47,930 --> 03:58:48,530
HEY!! GET UP HERE!!

7370
03:58:48,530 --> 03:58:50,260
HEY!! GET UP HERE!!

7371
03:58:55,770 --> 03:58:58,100
This usually happens to Hosei-san

7372
03:59:03,210 --> 03:59:05,240
It's different

7373
03:59:05,540 --> 03:59:09,450
No matter how or where you see it... You did it

7374
03:59:09,450 --> 03:59:11,780
No matter how or where you see it... You did it

7375
03:59:12,250 --> 03:59:13,320
Well I mean

7376
03:59:13,320 --> 03:59:14,820
You could say I look like him...

7377
03:59:14,820 --> 03:59:17,860
You could say I look like him...

7378
03:59:15,820 --> 03:59:17,860
That might be the case...

7379
03:59:19,260 --> 03:59:24,300
This year it's your turn

7380
03:59:23,030 --> 03:59:24,800
He said it directly

7381
03:59:24,800 --> 03:59:26,800
I would hate to be told that

7382
03:59:24,900 --> 03:59:30,330
The thief receives a punishment slap!!

7383
03:59:28,130 --> 03:59:30,530
You know,

7384
03:59:30,530 --> 03:59:32,900
there are a lot of complaints against you!!

7385
03:59:32,900 --> 03:59:34,210
On your damage report...

7386
03:59:34,810 --> 03:59:37,140
Does anyone have any complaints against him?

7387
03:59:37,840 --> 03:59:41,010
He used violence against me

7388
03:59:45,150 --> 03:59:47,180
Pff..

7389
03:59:45,620 --> 03:59:47,180
Pf-

7390
03:59:46,020 --> 03:59:47,180
Pff-

7391
03:59:57,860 --> 04:00:02,030
You rat out your friends too much

7392
03:59:58,660 --> 03:59:59,360
No, no...

7393
03:59:59,500 --> 04:00:00,460
It's the same

7394
04:00:02,070 --> 04:00:02,930
No matter what you do, there's no escaping

7395
04:00:02,930 --> 04:00:04,700
No matter what you do, there's no escaping

7396
04:00:05,740 --> 04:00:06,340
Come here

7397
04:00:06,440 --> 04:00:06,900
Okay, okay

7398
04:00:07,440 --> 04:00:08,370
This is...

7399
04:00:08,210 --> 04:00:10,570
This feeling...

7400
04:00:09,070 --> 04:00:09,840
Seriously?

7401
04:00:10,880 --> 04:00:12,280
No, no, wait...

7402
04:00:13,510 --> 04:00:14,280
Speak!

7403
04:00:18,380 --> 04:00:19,880
Really, you...

7404
04:00:20,280 --> 04:00:21,120
You! Cut it out already! Seriously...

7405
04:00:22,690 --> 04:00:24,160
No, really...

7406
04:00:24,790 --> 04:00:25,020
Really

7407
04:00:25,020 --> 04:00:25,360
Really

7408
04:00:25,360 --> 04:00:25,660
Really

7409
04:00:25,660 --> 04:00:25,990
Really

7410
04:00:25,990 --> 04:00:26,660
Really

7411
04:00:26,720 --> 04:00:27,220
Hey!!

7412
04:00:27,220 --> 04:00:27,590
No, no

7413
04:00:27,530 --> 04:00:27,530
That's bad

7414
04:00:27,530 --> 04:00:29,890
That's bad!!

7415
04:00:28,660 --> 04:00:29,330
Take off the coat!

7416
04:00:31,760 --> 04:00:32,160
Listen here

7417
04:00:32,260 --> 04:00:32,600
Yes

7418
04:00:32,860 --> 04:00:36,100
You! Come here!!

7419
04:00:34,100 --> 04:00:35,830
No, it's scary

7420
04:00:36,100 --> 04:00:37,670
It's not scary at all

7421
04:00:37,070 --> 04:00:38,400
No, no

7422
04:00:37,670 --> 04:00:39,300
You were always laughing, right!?

7423
04:00:40,100 --> 04:00:42,010
Right, you bastard?

7424
04:00:41,310 --> 04:00:45,310
In order to avoid the slap, Hamada closes the distance

7425
04:00:43,010 --> 04:00:43,770
What are you doing?

7426
04:00:43,770 --> 04:00:44,680
This is...

7427
04:00:46,940 --> 04:00:47,810
It is, isn't it?

7428
04:00:47,550 --> 04:00:48,110
This is scary!

7429
04:00:48,110 --> 04:00:49,180
We know

7430
04:00:48,650 --> 04:00:49,810
Enough, enough

7431
04:00:49,810 --> 04:00:50,580
It's scary, huh?

7432
04:00:49,810 --> 04:00:53,480
It's impossible, Hamada-san!!

7433
04:00:53,920 --> 04:00:55,550
Really, I can't...

7434
04:00:55,820 --> 04:00:57,020
Enough with this!

7435
04:00:56,690 --> 04:00:58,120
I really can't...

7436
04:00:59,360 --> 04:01:01,390
It's you this year!!

7437
04:01:01,660 --> 04:01:02,760
Prepare yourself

7438
04:01:01,660 --> 04:01:02,860
He's already said it

7439
04:01:03,890 --> 04:01:04,860
Yeah, he's already said it

7440
04:01:11,500 --> 04:01:12,300
We know

7441
04:01:12,040 --> 04:01:13,900
I know the feeling

7442
04:01:14,000 --> 04:01:15,670
It's really the same

7443
04:01:15,810 --> 04:01:17,070
I really don't like this

7444
04:01:17,070 --> 04:01:17,710
I really don't like this

7445
04:01:17,710 --> 04:01:20,640
There's no helping it

7446
04:01:19,080 --> 04:01:20,640
Yeah, no helping it

7447
04:01:20,850 --> 04:01:21,580
There's no...

7448
04:01:21,980 --> 04:01:23,250
There's no escaping

7449
04:01:25,950 --> 04:01:26,380
Look here!

7450
04:01:26,420 --> 04:01:27,690
No, no... wait..!

7451
04:01:27,380 --> 04:01:28,420
Why, you...

7452
04:01:27,950 --> 04:01:30,250
No wait wait!

7453
04:01:32,890 --> 04:01:34,190
No, no, no...

7454
04:01:34,490 --> 04:01:35,830
Scary!

7455
04:01:36,260 --> 04:01:37,390
I'm really scared

7456
04:01:37,090 --> 04:01:38,760
Hosei-san looked really happy

7457
04:01:38,830 --> 04:01:40,300
Yeah no helping it

7458
04:01:39,860 --> 04:01:41,530
No helping it

7459
04:01:44,570 --> 04:01:46,440
Double... double happy.

7460
04:01:46,200 --> 04:01:50,010
You really don't know when to give up

7461
04:01:48,640 --> 04:01:50,110
He looks like he's having double the fun

7462
04:01:51,040 --> 04:01:51,640
Hamada!

7463
04:01:51,810 --> 04:01:52,880
I'm doing it! Come here!

7464
04:01:52,980 --> 04:01:54,110
Good that you're not getting slapped

7465
04:01:54,180 --> 04:01:55,550
I said come here!

7466
04:01:55,810 --> 04:01:56,910
It's better not to dodge in a strange way

7467
04:01:56,910 --> 04:01:58,780
It's dangerous, stay still!!

7468
04:01:58,980 --> 04:02:00,420
Close your eyes!!

7469
04:02:00,420 --> 04:02:01,950
That's impossible! I can't close my eyes!!

7470
04:02:01,850 --> 04:02:03,790
Stay still

7471
04:02:01,950 --> 04:02:02,590
That's impossible! I can't close my eyes!!

7472
04:02:02,590 --> 04:02:06,920
That's impossible! I can't close my eyes!!

7473
04:02:11,560 --> 04:02:13,560
Hamada-san, do your best

7474
04:02:12,000 --> 04:02:13,600
Do your best

7475
04:02:13,430 --> 04:02:15,070
It's dangerous

7476
04:02:18,970 --> 04:02:19,700
Come here!

7477
04:02:19,700 --> 04:02:20,600
Wait, really...

7478
04:02:20,600 --> 04:02:21,470
Enough is enough, you fucking bastard!!

7479
04:02:21,470 --> 04:02:23,070
Enough is enough, you fucking bastard!!

7480
04:02:21,610 --> 04:02:23,270
No

7481
04:02:23,270 --> 04:02:25,380
Fucker!

7482
04:02:32,080 --> 04:02:33,320
Already filmed

7483
04:02:33,680 --> 04:02:34,490
Quite funny

7484
04:02:34,490 --> 04:02:35,250
as expected

7485
04:02:35,020 --> 04:02:35,790
This is funny

7486
04:02:36,190 --> 04:02:38,190
I've never seen Hamada-san like this

7487
04:02:37,790 --> 04:02:40,360
I'm sorry

7488
04:02:38,720 --> 04:02:39,920
Really funny

7489
04:02:39,720 --> 04:02:40,860
This is...

7490
04:02:40,420 --> 04:02:41,490
Shit, this is funny

7491
04:02:41,290 --> 04:02:42,990
Prepare yourself for it

7492
04:02:43,290 --> 04:02:46,930
Hey Hosei!!

7493
04:02:44,460 --> 04:02:44,960
No helping it

7494
04:02:45,400 --> 04:02:46,030
Good for you

7495
04:02:45,400 --> 04:02:47,060
It's occasionally bad for you, that sound.

7496
04:02:46,930 --> 04:02:49,430
I'm slapping with all my might!!

7497
04:02:48,030 --> 04:02:49,430
Right!!

7498
04:02:49,930 --> 04:02:52,100
You, remember this...

7499
04:02:52,300 --> 04:02:57,580
Finally time for the slap of punishment

7500
04:02:53,670 --> 04:02:55,240
You were really serious...

7501
04:02:55,570 --> 04:02:56,270
Don't run away

7502
04:02:58,380 --> 04:03:00,240
I'll send you flying!!

7503
04:03:02,810 --> 04:03:04,180
Countdown!!

7504
04:03:09,520 --> 04:03:10,690
That was a great expression on his face

7505
04:03:12,460 --> 04:03:14,360
Wait!!

7506
04:03:14,360 --> 04:03:16,030
That person is not the culprit who stole the Hama Lisa!!

7507
04:03:16,030 --> 04:03:16,990
That person is not the culprit who stole the Hama Lisa!!

7508
04:03:16,990 --> 04:03:18,630
That person is not the culprit who stole the Hama Lisa!!

7509
04:03:22,230 --> 04:03:23,270
Inspector Chono

7510
04:03:22,470 --> 04:03:28,140
Young Detective arrives

7511
04:03:23,600 --> 04:03:25,640
You are making a big mistake.

7512
04:03:26,300 --> 04:03:28,110
Please release that person.

7513
04:03:28,710 --> 04:03:30,140
Huh?

7514
04:03:30,670 --> 04:03:33,340
You're not the thief?

7515
04:03:33,340 --> 04:03:33,910
From the start, I've been saying "it wasn't me"

7516
04:03:33,910 --> 04:03:36,280
From the start, I've been saying "it wasn't me"

7517
04:03:35,450 --> 04:03:36,410
Wasn't it you who stole the painting?

7518
04:03:36,480 --> 04:03:39,150
I did not steal it!!

7519
04:03:38,750 --> 04:03:40,150
No way...then return to your seat

7520
04:03:40,350 --> 04:03:46,160
Hamada just barely escapes the slap!!

7521
04:03:41,750 --> 04:03:43,020
Yama-chan's expression...

7522
04:03:42,190 --> 04:03:43,690
it was such a thunderclap

7523
04:03:44,690 --> 04:03:45,520
Inspector Chono!

7524
04:03:46,160 --> 04:03:49,360
Phantom Thief X the first's best specialty skill:

7525
04:03:49,360 --> 04:03:52,030
Phantom Thief X the first's best specialty skill:

7526
04:03:52,030 --> 04:03:53,200
Disguises!!

7527
04:03:53,500 --> 04:03:54,400
Phantom Thief X the first...

7528
04:03:54,400 --> 04:03:55,400
His real face, no one has ever seen it before

7529
04:03:55,400 --> 04:03:58,100
His real face, no one has ever seen it before

7530
04:03:58,500 --> 04:04:00,540
In other words, the face of this statue is also

7531
04:04:00,970 --> 04:04:02,540
Phantom Thief X the first's

7532
04:04:01,640 --> 04:04:09,880
A pro at disguises, no one has seen his real face

7533
04:04:01,740 --> 04:04:09,880
The First Phantom Thief X the statue

7534
04:04:02,740 --> 04:04:03,870
disguise!

7535
04:04:04,740 --> 04:04:05,480
What do you mean?

7536
04:04:06,080 --> 04:04:09,180
Well, where could his real face be hidden?

7537
04:04:06,610 --> 04:04:07,580
Hehe, that expression...

7538
04:04:10,780 --> 04:04:13,050
Please bring that in!!

7539
04:04:17,690 --> 04:04:18,490
Inspector Chono

7540
04:04:19,220 --> 04:04:20,290
Please

7541
04:04:20,290 --> 04:04:21,790
Use this hammer on the statue and smash it!!

7542
04:04:21,790 --> 04:04:25,500
Use this hammer on the statue and smash it!!

7543
04:04:23,360 --> 04:04:24,260
Smash it?

7544
04:04:25,900 --> 04:04:30,900
When the statue gets smashed, the mystery will become clear!!

7545
04:04:25,930 --> 04:04:26,630
It's a statue, y'know

7546
04:04:32,970 --> 04:04:33,440
Smash it?

7547
04:04:45,720 --> 04:04:47,150
That was the worst for Yamasaki

7548
04:04:52,260 --> 04:04:53,420
It's smashed open

7549
04:04:55,430 --> 04:04:57,560
This is harsh

7550
04:04:57,930 --> 04:04:58,660
It was uncovered

7551
04:04:59,200 --> 04:05:00,330
Uncovered!

7552
04:05:01,600 --> 04:05:03,700
The statue sure has a great expression too

7553
04:05:03,400 --> 04:05:06,270
We've returned to the same person as always

7554
04:05:06,270 --> 04:05:09,240
This is the real face of Phantom Thief X the First

7555
04:05:10,340 --> 04:05:12,980
His descendant, it should be clear now who it is!!

7556
04:05:12,980 --> 04:05:15,650
The culprit who stole the famous painting, the Hama Lisa, is...

7557
04:05:16,180 --> 04:05:17,250
Tsukitei Hosei! It's you!!

7558
04:05:17,250 --> 04:05:18,250
Tsukitei Hosei! It's you!!

7559
04:05:18,850 --> 04:05:19,680
So it's you!?

7560
04:05:20,050 --> 04:05:21,690
Wrong!!

7561
04:05:24,890 --> 04:05:25,460
Thanks

7562
04:05:26,860 --> 04:05:28,660
Wait...what's with this?

7563
04:05:30,030 --> 04:05:36,970
Case of the stolen famous painting "Hama Lisa"

7564
04:05:30,030 --> 04:05:36,970
The real culprit was Tsukitei Hosei !!

7565
04:05:32,230 --> 04:05:33,760
You sure did some complex things

7566
04:05:34,470 --> 04:05:36,000
No, I don't know anything

7567
04:05:36,000 --> 04:05:36,800
No, I don't know anything

7568
04:05:37,670 --> 04:05:41,000
This year too... it's you!!

7569
04:05:41,000 --> 04:05:44,810
This year too... it's you!!

7570
04:05:53,650 --> 04:05:55,320
Seriously...

7571
04:05:54,620 --> 04:05:56,690
No way...

7572
04:05:57,020 --> 04:05:57,650
Isn't it fine with Hamada-san!?

7573
04:05:57,650 --> 04:06:00,060
Isn't it fine with Hamada-san!?

7574
04:06:03,860 --> 04:06:04,930
What's your name?

7575
04:06:04,930 --> 04:06:07,300
I'm Tsukitei Hosei

7576
04:06:07,300 --> 04:06:09,000
You are the Third. The First, what Hosei was he?

7577
04:06:09,000 --> 04:06:10,770
You are the Third. The First, what Hosei was he?

7578
04:06:10,770 --> 04:06:12,070
You are the Third. The First, what Hosei was he?

7579
04:06:12,070 --> 04:06:14,910
You are the Third. The First, what Hosei was he?

7580
04:06:15,540 --> 04:06:16,440
The First?

7581
04:06:16,840 --> 04:06:17,640
Yeah, the First.

7582
04:06:18,680 --> 04:06:25,720
Gets brought on stage for questioning!!

7583
04:06:19,380 --> 04:06:20,710
What was his name?

7584
04:06:21,950 --> 04:06:23,150
Phantom Thief X the First?

7585
04:06:23,610 --> 04:06:25,050
What are you saying, you fucker?

7586
04:06:26,250 --> 04:06:28,520
This guy's name is...

7587
04:06:27,420 --> 04:06:28,620
Is that his angry face?

7588
04:06:28,820 --> 04:06:31,190
Yamasaki Hosei, right?

7589
04:06:30,390 --> 04:06:31,090
No,

7590
04:06:30,490 --> 04:06:31,660
Now this is starting again

7591
04:06:31,690 --> 04:06:33,420
It's written "X the First" here however

7592
04:06:35,230 --> 04:06:38,900
Bring your face to the side of the statue. From the back.

7593
04:06:39,900 --> 04:06:41,170
Do it properly

7594
04:06:57,610 --> 04:06:58,180
It's courage

7595
04:06:59,280 --> 04:06:59,950
Come here

7596
04:07:01,080 --> 04:07:08,530
Slap of punishment for the criminal

7597
04:07:03,620 --> 04:07:04,390
Please wait

7598
04:07:04,960 --> 04:07:06,190
I was hoping...

7599
04:07:06,290 --> 04:07:07,160
What?

7600
04:07:06,760 --> 04:07:08,060
I was hoping...

7601
04:07:07,520 --> 04:07:08,930
Don't push

7602
04:07:09,030 --> 04:07:10,890
Please...

7603
04:07:09,930 --> 04:07:10,360
For what?

7604
04:07:11,330 --> 04:07:12,900
Please wait a little before you're going to slap, right?

7605
04:07:14,630 --> 04:07:16,270
It's you!

7606
04:07:17,270 --> 04:07:18,140
Hurts!

7607
04:07:20,340 --> 04:07:21,710
It's started!

7608
04:07:22,510 --> 04:07:24,070
It's started!

7609
04:07:22,610 --> 04:07:24,940
It's started...

7610
04:07:24,310 --> 04:07:25,240
It's started, huh?

7611
04:07:28,850 --> 04:07:30,280
Alright, now get ready

7612
04:07:32,180 --> 04:07:34,690
I know you'll do various things

7613
04:07:34,690 --> 04:07:35,790
Ouch! My armpit!!

7614
04:07:37,050 --> 04:07:38,490
What's with that, huh!?

7615
04:07:38,860 --> 04:07:40,260
What's with that, huh!?

7616
04:07:39,990 --> 04:07:46,030
Coincidentally headbutted Chono's nose

7617
04:07:40,260 --> 04:07:41,160
I'm sorry!

7618
04:07:41,930 --> 04:07:42,660
You!

7619
04:07:42,790 --> 04:07:45,330
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

7620
04:07:45,360 --> 04:07:47,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

7621
04:07:51,940 --> 04:07:54,140
This is...

7622
04:07:53,740 --> 04:07:56,040
My heart was pounding

7623
04:07:56,040 --> 04:07:57,070
Really sorry...

7624
04:07:56,840 --> 04:07:59,540
At the time, he was

7625
04:07:57,610 --> 04:07:58,680
What are you doing?

7626
04:07:58,680 --> 04:07:59,540
Ah, I'm sorry!

7627
04:07:59,410 --> 04:08:02,780
I'll pay you back double!!

7628
04:08:01,180 --> 04:08:03,280
This is

7629
04:08:01,910 --> 04:08:02,780
I didn't do it on purpose!!

7630
04:08:06,850 --> 04:08:08,050
You're going to slap me, right?

7631
04:08:08,050 --> 04:08:10,220
Of course!!

7632
04:08:11,120 --> 04:08:11,590
Enough

7633
04:08:11,960 --> 04:08:13,790
"Of course"

7634
04:08:11,990 --> 04:08:13,360
"Of course"

7635
04:08:12,990 --> 04:08:14,790
I'm gonna do a countdown!!

7636
04:08:15,030 --> 04:08:15,490
Alright?

7637
04:08:26,470 --> 04:08:29,140
GUWAAA!! WAIT!!

7638
04:08:33,310 --> 04:08:34,280
He's scared

7639
04:08:34,280 --> 04:08:35,250
Please wait

7640
04:08:35,010 --> 04:08:36,710
Really scary

7641
04:08:35,850 --> 04:08:37,150
Argh, scary!

7642
04:08:37,210 --> 04:08:38,820
Yeah, we know

7643
04:08:38,320 --> 04:08:38,920
We know

7644
04:08:44,120 --> 04:08:45,290
Do it

7645
04:08:45,290 --> 04:08:46,620
5 seconds too...

7646
04:08:47,090 --> 04:08:49,490
Then, how many seconds do you wanna go with?

7647
04:08:47,620 --> 04:08:49,490
3 seconds

7648
04:08:50,660 --> 04:08:51,190
Then...

7649
04:08:51,500 --> 04:08:52,230
This is really long

7650
04:08:51,860 --> 04:08:52,960
Yeah, it's long

7651
04:08:52,660 --> 04:08:53,430
That it's long...

7652
04:08:52,700 --> 04:08:54,300
Hey, stand straight!

7653
04:08:54,360 --> 04:08:56,100
Well, he said that he's paying it back double

7654
04:08:55,470 --> 04:08:56,130
I'm doing it!

7655
04:09:08,410 --> 04:09:09,180
Paying it back double...

7656
04:09:08,580 --> 04:09:16,450
Slap of punishment explodes!!

7657
04:09:11,250 --> 04:09:12,880
Really looks like it hurt!

7658
04:09:13,220 --> 04:09:14,120
This has got to be painful

7659
04:09:14,790 --> 04:09:17,220
Super painful

7660
04:09:17,590 --> 04:09:19,660
God

7661
04:09:17,720 --> 04:09:18,920
What's with that?

7662
04:09:18,160 --> 04:09:19,660
damn!!

7663
04:09:19,860 --> 04:09:21,460
What's this?

7664
04:09:21,860 --> 04:09:22,290
Yeah

7665
04:09:29,230 --> 04:09:31,130
Urgh

7666
04:09:36,440 --> 04:09:37,570
Ah, it was funny

7667
04:09:38,040 --> 04:09:40,310
What a relief...

7668
04:09:41,010 --> 04:09:41,650
Yama-chan was so happy; how pitiful

7669
04:09:41,650 --> 04:09:43,280
Yama-chan was so happy; how pitiful

7670
04:09:43,280 --> 04:09:45,950
Yama-chan was so happy; how pitiful

7671
04:09:52,890 --> 04:09:55,890
In the midst of the lingering excitement,

7672
04:09:53,490 --> 04:09:57,730
Detective work 16th hour

7673
04:09:56,160 --> 04:09:57,760
there has been trouble...

7674
04:10:00,230 --> 04:10:03,230
Guys, it's terrible!

7675
04:10:01,830 --> 04:10:03,230
You always say that

7676
04:10:03,230 --> 04:10:10,310
A businessman has come here beat up a senior detective who revealed his affair

7677
04:10:08,270 --> 04:10:10,310
I don't get it!

7678
04:10:10,310 --> 04:10:15,650
So you mean ordinary people and the detectives are fighting?

7679
04:10:14,810 --> 04:10:15,650
Exactly!

7680
04:10:15,650 --> 04:10:19,650
The senior detective said deal- he can't deal with this so

7681
04:10:19,650 --> 04:10:20,980
Let's go together

7682
04:10:20,980 --> 04:10:23,750
Well it's a senior detective we've never met, so...

7683
04:10:24,320 --> 04:10:32,030
A Client has come to beat up a detective

7684
04:10:24,320 --> 04:10:32,030
The 5 of them head out to solve the problem!!

7685
04:10:24,390 --> 04:10:25,690
Alright!

7686
04:10:26,090 --> 04:10:27,290
You don't need your jacket?

7687
04:10:27,290 --> 04:10:29,330
Oh you don't- you don't need your jackets

7688
04:10:29,330 --> 04:10:29,890
Okay

7689
04:10:33,430 --> 04:10:36,670
It's a separate branch so it's close by but still kind of far

7690
04:10:44,780 --> 04:10:48,650
So the senior detective- what did you say?

7691
04:10:48,350 --> 04:10:49,150
I don't get it at all

7692
04:10:48,650 --> 04:10:53,450
A businessman who had his affair figured out has come to beat him up?

7693
04:10:53,450 --> 04:10:55,950
So he's causing trouble?

7694
04:10:55,020 --> 04:10:55,990
He definitely is

7695
04:10:56,450 --> 04:11:03,690
The five men travel by bus

7696
04:10:56,450 --> 04:11:03,690
toward a nearby detective firm branch

7697
04:10:57,390 --> 04:11:02,060
The bus with the 5 of them in it will head to a nearby detective firm

7698
04:11:04,460 --> 04:11:09,930
What's waiting for them is...

7699
04:11:13,270 --> 04:11:14,770
Ah, you can hear them

7700
04:11:14,770 --> 04:11:16,440
You can hear them from outside

7701
04:11:15,970 --> 04:11:17,240
They're causing trouble

7702
04:11:17,670 --> 04:11:18,140
This way

7703
04:11:22,080 --> 04:11:22,950
It's fine!

7704
04:11:23,650 --> 04:11:25,680
That's supposed to be private!

7705
04:11:28,120 --> 04:11:31,150
It's your fault for having an affair!!

7706
04:11:31,150 --> 04:11:34,260
What do you mean affair!? That's a private matter!

7707
04:11:34,260 --> 04:11:40,100
Fuck you, how are you a detective?!

7708
04:11:36,330 --> 04:11:39,800
You had an affair; you're in the wrong!

7709
04:11:39,800 --> 04:11:41,400
Wait a minute!

7710
04:11:41,400 --> 04:11:44,130
Don't just stand there and stare at us!!

7711
04:11:44,130 --> 04:11:45,670
Can we just get along?

7712
04:11:45,870 --> 04:11:48,810
Just shut up and sit down!!

7713
04:11:51,810 --> 04:11:54,040
Hurry up and sit!!

7714
04:11:54,040 --> 04:11:55,950
Don't we have to fix the problem?

7715
04:11:54,810 --> 04:11:55,710
Yeah, right?

7716
04:11:55,950 --> 04:11:59,620
We don't have to fix the problem?

7717
04:11:56,950 --> 04:11:57,550
Just observe

7718
04:11:57,780 --> 04:11:58,750
What are you gonna do!?

7719
04:12:00,150 --> 04:12:01,150
Can you just watch?

7720
04:12:01,150 --> 04:12:03,690
OKAY Listen up guys

7721
04:12:03,750 --> 04:12:07,560
Let's fight to see who is stronger!!

7722
04:12:07,560 --> 04:12:09,830
Let's try it then, I accept your challenge!!

7723
04:12:09,830 --> 04:12:12,630
Negotiating has failed

7724
04:12:09,860 --> 04:12:11,360
Alright let's go!

7725
04:12:11,360 --> 04:12:13,360
Let's go!

7726
04:12:13,730 --> 04:12:20,940

With their pride on the line, the Fighting Festival has begun

7730
04:12:21,140 --> 04:12:23,510
Shut up

7731
04:12:22,570 --> 04:12:23,470
What the hell

7732
04:12:23,440 --> 04:12:26,740

7733
04:12:23,440 --> 04:12:26,740
Team Ueshima Staff

Just deal with it, face to face

7735
04:12:28,580 --> 04:12:30,850
It's called...

7736
04:12:30,850 --> 04:12:35,120
Tickling Showdown!!

7737
04:12:32,780 --> 04:12:35,120

We don't understand what you're saying!!

7739
04:12:37,550 --> 04:12:39,760
IT'S A TICKLING SHOWDOWN!!

7740

04:12:46,100 --> 04:12:55,440
Tickling Showdown

7750
04:12:47,230 --> 04:12:51,430
For 30 seconds, the player will tickle his opponent, and whoever gets his opponent to make a sound will win

7751
04:12:51,470 --> 04:12:52,600
Got it?

7752
04:12:52,240 --> 04:12:53,340
This will be too easy!

7753
04:12:53,470 --> 04:12:55,140
Oh, yeah? Let's see what you got.

7754
04:12:55,740 --> 04:12:58,680
So it's first batter then second batter

7755
04:12:57,240 --> 04:13:00,010
Get set... START!

7756
04:13:06,980 --> 04:13:09,090
What the hell is going on?

7757
04:13:12,060 --> 04:13:13,390
What the hell?

7758
04:13:13,390 --> 04:13:16,230
It's between two old men...

7759
04:13:15,430 --> 04:13:16,330
What the heck?

7760
04:13:16,230 --> 04:13:18,260
His opponent hasn't a made a sound though

7761
04:13:19,160 --> 04:13:20,700
What is this?

7762
04:13:21,330 --> 04:13:23,030
Ah, that's the spot

7763
04:13:21,530 --> 04:13:22,770
What is he doing?

7764
04:13:29,640 --> 04:13:31,340
What the hell is this!?

7765
04:13:34,950 --> 04:13:36,880
He didn't make any noise at all!

7766
04:13:37,380 --> 04:13:38,880
No he did, he did!

7767
04:13:39,820 --> 04:13:43,290
What you did to me, I'm gonna do the exact same thing to you!!

7768
04:13:43,820 --> 04:13:48,020
Changing Positions

7769
04:13:44,020 --> 04:13:45,560
Bring it on, whatever you got!

7770
04:13:45,190 --> 04:13:46,960
Go on, Kuro-chan!

7771
04:13:46,860 --> 04:13:48,190
Come come come come!

7772
04:13:48,190 --> 04:13:48,930
Get ready...

7773
04:13:53,130 --> 04:13:54,300
Already?

7774
04:14:05,840 --> 04:14:07,010
What the hell!

7775
04:14:07,010 --> 04:14:09,080
What is this scene!?

7776
04:14:16,590 --> 04:14:17,990
What the hell is this!?

7777
04:14:17,590 --> 04:14:19,790
He was making a lot of noise...

7778
04:14:19,560 --> 04:14:20,660
He definitely was!

7779
04:14:25,630 --> 04:14:29,100
I did it!!

7780
04:14:29,700 --> 04:14:32,370
What are this pig and this plump man even doing?

7781
04:14:32,670 --> 04:14:33,840
Your turn!

7791
04:14:44,750 --> 04:14:48,950

Come on

7793
04:14:51,690 --> 04:14:52,820
Come on, come on

7794
04:14:52,460 --> 04:14:54,560
His touch is so soft

7795
04:15:01,560 --> 04:15:03,670
I can't watch!

7796
04:15:03,670 --> 04:15:05,240
I said I can't watch this!

7797
04:15:07,200 --> 04:15:08,370
There's nothing good about this

7798
04:15:10,140 --> 04:15:10,870
You're doing great!

7799
04:15:10,740 --> 04:15:14,310
Don't look at his face, Iwao!

7800
04:15:16,250 --> 04:15:17,750
Good job!

7801
04:15:19,450 --> 04:15:20,780
What the hell

7802
04:15:23,420 --> 04:15:26,190
He was going "Hee hee"!!

7803
04:15:26,690 --> 04:15:31,590
Changing Positions

7804
04:15:27,520 --> 04:15:29,230
Go, Tanaka!

7805
04:15:29,230 --> 04:15:30,860
Can you beat him, Tanaka?

7806
04:15:30,190 --> 04:15:31,660
Yes I will

7807
04:15:32,860 --> 04:15:34,860
Set, START!

7808
04:15:40,340 --> 04:15:41,570
What a soft round...

7809
04:15:44,110 --> 04:15:46,240
Good face, Iwao!

7810
04:15:46,680 --> 04:15:48,610
How disgusting!!

7811
04:15:52,080 --> 04:15:54,080
That's not tickling!

7812
04:15:54,720 --> 04:15:57,490
So gross!!

7813
04:15:57,650 --> 04:15:59,520
What the hell is this!?

7814
04:15:59,520 --> 04:16:01,160
He already laughed!

7815
04:16:01,930 --> 04:16:04,330
Hey, hey!

7816
04:16:04,860 --> 04:16:06,160
What the hell is this!?

7817
04:16:12,970 --> 04:16:15,140
What the hell?

7818
04:16:14,140 --> 04:16:16,440
That wasn't a tickling showdown!

7819
04:16:21,310 --> 04:16:23,650
He didn't say anything, this guy!!

7820
04:16:23,650 --> 04:16:28,250
It's a victorious smile!!

7821
04:16:26,850 --> 04:16:28,150
Do you know the difference between strength and will?

7822
04:16:28,920 --> 04:16:31,020
Bring in THAT THING!!

7823
04:16:30,050 --> 04:16:30,990
What is it!?

7824
04:16:30,990 --> 04:16:32,360
What is it, damn it!?

7825
04:16:33,320 --> 04:16:34,390
What is this!?

7826
04:16:34,390 --> 04:16:35,460
Show them all!

7827
04:16:35,660 --> 04:16:36,660
Show them!

7828
04:16:36,660 --> 04:16:39,960

04:16:36,660 --> 04:16:39,960
This is a Blindfolded Kendo Showdown!

7831
04:16:40,200 --> 04:16:41,900
Whoa!

7832
04:16:43,100 --> 04:16:49,770
Sense your opponent by sound, then hit!!

7833
04:16:43,100 --> 04:16:49,770
Space with no escape

7834
04:16:49,940 --> 04:16:51,410
Go on, Yoshinobu!

7835
04:16:50,140 --> 04:16:59,980
Blindfolded Kendo Showdown

7836
04:16:50,810 --> 04:16:59,980
Nakamura Yoshinobu

04:16:50,810 --> 04:16:59,980
Tonikaku Akarui Yasumura

7838
04:16:52,040 --> 04:16:59,450
With that, Team Degawa's kendo expert, Yoshinobu and Team Ueshima's Yasumura will compete

7839
04:17:00,150 --> 04:17:04,020
So put on your eyemasks, spin around 3 times, then start!

7840
04:17:00,350 --> 04:17:08,260
2 minute sudden-death match: put on eyemask, spin around 3 times, then start

7841
04:17:00,350 --> 04:17:08,260
Blindfolded Kendo Showdown

7842
04:17:04,550 --> 04:17:06,020
Oh I see

7843
04:17:06,020 --> 04:17:08,020
Okay, now spin around 3 times! Ready...

7844
04:17:08,020 --> 04:17:09,660
set,

7845
04:17:09,660 --> 04:17:11,660
one,

7846
04:17:11,660 --> 04:17:13,630
two,

7847
04:17:13,630 --> 04:17:15,630
three, START!

7848
04:17:17,500 --> 04:17:19,070
Go get him!!

7849
04:17:19,100 --> 04:17:19,870
START!!

7850
04:17:23,740 --> 04:17:27,210
Your stance is a bit off!!

7851
04:17:46,030 --> 04:17:46,930
Ahh no no no no

7852
04:17:53,500 --> 04:17:54,540
Watch out!

7853
04:18:03,180 --> 04:18:05,180
Why does he do that!?

7854
04:18:04,110 --> 04:18:06,720
They can only use sound to sense their surroundings.

7855
04:18:05,720 --> 04:18:06,750
Right

7856
04:18:07,480 --> 04:18:10,650
The next strike will determine their fate!!

7857
04:18:15,260 --> 04:18:18,930
He really gets beat up a lot

7858
04:18:22,430 --> 04:18:23,400
You won!

7859
04:18:32,310 --> 04:18:34,080
Nice counter!

7860
04:18:34,640 --> 04:18:37,010
Let's decide this with a daring feat!

7861
04:18:37,080 --> 04:18:38,550
Get THAT THING ready!!

7862
04:18:41,250 --> 04:18:43,350
What's this sound?

7863
04:18:42,320 --> 04:18:43,390
What is it?

7864
04:18:43,390 --> 04:18:49,360
Very flashy car enters

7865
04:18:44,890 --> 04:18:46,260
Whoa, what is this?

7866
04:18:48,390 --> 04:18:49,590
Alright, so

7867
04:18:50,530 --> 04:18:52,100
This car,

7868
04:18:52,100 --> 04:18:56,300
the back is made to be REALLY REALLY bouncy

7869
04:18:57,470 --> 04:19:03,070
Kenkoba will try to eat all of his very very hot ramen while sitting in the bouncy trunk of this car

7870
04:18:58,170 --> 04:19:02,540
Sit in very bouncy trunk

7871
04:18:58,170 --> 04:19:02,540
Try to finish all of very very hot ramen

7872
04:19:03,570 --> 04:19:07,710
Hydraulics Hopping Ramen Challenge

7873
04:19:08,480 --> 04:19:11,080
You guys definitely can't do this, so...

7874
04:19:11,280 --> 04:19:15,120
JUST WATCH!!

7875
04:19:13,080 --> 04:19:14,850
Who's gonna do it?

7876
04:19:15,120 --> 04:19:17,490
YOU'RE gonna do it?

7877
04:19:15,890 --> 04:19:17,620
Can you even do it?

7878
04:19:17,890 --> 04:19:21,660
I'll show you a report like it's from a normal gourmet channel!

7879
04:19:21,690 --> 04:19:27,030
You won't get a gourmut-

7880
04:19:22,930 --> 04:19:26,930
You won't get an offer from a gour-gourmet channel

7881
04:19:27,560 --> 04:19:29,730
He really got his tongue twisted

7882
04:19:29,070 --> 04:19:31,070
Can you do it?

7883
04:19:37,910 --> 04:19:39,510
Eat more!

7884
04:19:41,040 --> 04:19:43,580
Give us a report!!

7885
04:19:43,780 --> 04:19:44,780
Give us a report!

7886
04:19:44,780 --> 04:19:46,050
Shut up!

7887
04:19:46,550 --> 04:19:47,550
Drink the soup.

7888
04:19:47,550 --> 04:19:48,620
Drink it!

7889
04:20:02,200 --> 04:20:04,230
You didn't eat it!

7890
04:20:04,230 --> 04:20:05,200
He ate a lot of it!! What, you can't see it?

7891
04:20:05,200 --> 04:20:06,970
He ate a lot of it!! What, you can't see it?

7892
04:20:08,710 --> 04:20:11,840
You didn't eat it at all!

7893
04:20:12,180 --> 04:20:14,880
You didn't give us a food report at all!!

7894
04:20:15,180 --> 04:20:19,550
A French maid costume set

7895
04:20:15,950 --> 04:20:19,550
Prepared next is a French maid costume.

7896
04:20:19,050 --> 04:20:26,160
After soaking it in hot water, put it on within 1 minute!!

7897
04:20:19,550 --> 04:20:26,520
The challenge is, for some reason, to soak all of these in hot water and wear them.

7898
04:20:26,160 --> 04:20:27,420
Let's do this!

7899
04:20:26,890 --> 04:20:27,890
The challenger is

7900
04:20:28,390 --> 04:20:31,190
Haranishi of the Ueshima Corps.

7901
04:20:28,390 --> 04:20:31,930
Haranishi Takayuki

7902
04:20:28,390 --> 04:20:31,930
Ueshima Corps

7903
04:20:31,930 --> 04:20:34,700
This guy's strong against hot temperatures.

7904
04:20:35,260 --> 04:20:36,970
All right, let's go!

7905
04:20:38,770 --> 04:20:43,910
Putting the costume in the hot water

7906
04:20:40,500 --> 04:20:42,610
This one, too. I'm gonna do this one, too.

7907
04:20:44,610 --> 04:20:46,010
You can't do it. This is really hot.

7908
04:20:45,740 --> 04:20:46,380
Just wait and see. This is gonna be great!!

7909
04:20:46,380 --> 04:20:49,850
Just wait and see. This is gonna be great!!

7910
04:20:49,880 --> 04:20:50,350
Ready,

7911
04:20:50,880 --> 04:20:51,550
START!

7912
04:20:52,950 --> 04:20:55,280
No way. There's no way you can do it.

7913
04:20:54,350 --> 04:20:56,190
No way. No way.

7914
04:20:55,720 --> 04:20:58,490
Hot! Hot!

7915
04:21:02,690 --> 04:21:04,690
What the hell are you doing?

7916
04:21:07,760 --> 04:21:09,000
Hot!

7917
04:21:08,400 --> 04:21:10,200
Too slow!

7918
04:21:10,200 --> 04:21:12,900
He got it on.

7919
04:21:12,200 --> 04:21:14,000
Don't shake it this way.

7920
04:21:15,440 --> 04:21:16,970
Come on, come on.

7921
04:21:17,010 --> 04:21:18,040
You only get one chance for that.

7922
04:21:19,110 --> 04:21:20,110
Hot!

7923
04:21:20,840 --> 04:21:22,750
You still got a lot more left!

7924
04:21:22,850 --> 04:21:25,820
Haranishi is invulnerable to high temperatures!!

7925
04:21:29,820 --> 04:21:31,050
You can do all of it, come on.

7926
04:21:31,050 --> 04:21:32,160
Go, go.

7927
04:21:34,390 --> 04:21:35,390
What are you doing?

7928
04:21:35,390 --> 04:21:37,560
Only one chance. You took it off, gotta go to the next one.

7929
04:21:36,290 --> 04:21:37,590
You can do it, come on.

7930
04:21:37,590 --> 04:21:39,000
The bottom!

7931
04:21:38,090 --> 04:21:42,300
Trying to at least get a top and bottom on....

7932
04:21:39,000 --> 04:21:42,000
Just put the bottom on!

7933
04:21:40,800 --> 04:21:42,870
Just put the bottom on and you're done.

7934
04:21:42,300 --> 04:21:43,300
Three more seconds left.

7935
04:21:43,300 --> 04:21:44,230
Top and bottom!

7936
04:21:47,500 --> 04:21:47,870
Aahh!!

7937
04:21:47,540 --> 04:21:47,940
Aahh!!

7938
04:21:47,570 --> 04:21:47,970
Aahh!!

7939
04:21:47,600 --> 04:21:48,000
Aahh!!

7940
04:21:47,640 --> 04:21:48,000
Aahh!!

7941
04:21:47,670 --> 04:21:48,000
Aahh!!

7942
04:21:47,700 --> 04:21:48,040
Aahh!!

7943
04:21:47,740 --> 04:21:48,070
Aahh!!

7944
04:21:47,770 --> 04:21:48,100
Aahh!!

7945
04:21:47,800 --> 04:21:48,140
Aahh!!

7946
04:21:47,840 --> 04:21:48,170
Aahh!!

7947
04:21:47,870 --> 04:21:48,200
Aahh!!

7948
04:21:47,900 --> 04:21:48,240
Aahh!!

7949
04:21:47,940 --> 04:21:49,270
Aahh!!

7950
04:21:53,110 --> 04:21:54,880
You didn't put them on!

7951
04:21:54,710 --> 04:21:56,280
Sloppy!

7952
04:21:56,410 --> 04:21:57,980
You gotta put all of them on!

7953
04:21:58,110 --> 04:22:01,350
That was cheap.

7954
04:22:01,480 --> 04:22:02,350
Looks like we beat you at your own game!!

7955
04:22:02,350 --> 04:22:04,890
Looks like we beat you at your own game!!

7956
04:22:03,490 --> 04:22:04,820
Get out of here!

7957
04:22:04,890 --> 04:22:07,120
Play time is over now.

7958
04:22:06,290 --> 04:22:07,120
That's right.

7959
04:22:07,120 --> 04:22:09,760
Let's end this with the usual.

7960
04:22:08,990 --> 04:22:10,930
All right.

7961
04:22:09,990 --> 04:22:11,090
Get it ready!!

7962
04:22:12,300 --> 04:22:14,260
There it is...

7963
04:22:12,900 --> 04:22:15,260
What are you guys, scared?

7964
04:22:16,000 --> 04:22:17,370
For the last one we battle it out with arm wrestling.

7965
04:22:17,030 --> 04:22:18,500
He's gonna say that again.

7966
04:22:17,370 --> 04:22:18,500
For the last one we battle it out with arm wrestling.

7967
04:22:18,500 --> 04:22:20,440
He's gonna say the rules again.

7968
04:22:20,440 --> 04:22:23,640
Fill your asshole to the brim with air,

7969
04:22:23,640 --> 04:22:25,370
battle it out with arm wrestling

7970
04:22:26,380 --> 04:22:29,350
and whoever farts loses.

7971
04:22:29,350 --> 04:22:31,350
Alright already!!

7972
04:22:30,550 --> 04:22:31,480
Stop that.

7973
04:22:31,350 --> 04:22:34,180
We understand the rules of the usual.

7974
04:22:34,950 --> 04:22:36,490
Every year...

7975
04:22:36,090 --> 04:22:37,320
Every year, seriously.

7976
04:22:37,290 --> 04:22:40,790
And the match never gets a result, every time.

7977
04:22:39,090 --> 04:22:40,890
Gotta explain it, or they won't understand what's going on.

7978
04:22:40,460 --> 04:22:41,390
Yeah, they won't.

7979
04:22:44,130 --> 04:22:47,400
There are some first-timers here, so if you could repeat it again for them.

7980
04:22:45,700 --> 04:22:47,400
What are you talking about, here?

7981
04:22:47,400 --> 04:22:49,900
We're gonna arm wrestle!!  But first,

7982
04:22:49,900 --> 04:22:53,840
we fill your asshole to the brim with air and then arm wrestle

7983
04:22:53,840 --> 04:22:59,280
and whoever farts loses.

7984
04:23:01,280 --> 04:23:03,280
Enough already. Seriously, enough of that.

7985
04:23:07,680 --> 04:23:11,290
We, of course, have our invincible captain, Ueshima.

7986
04:23:12,260 --> 04:23:14,890
No one among you can beat Ueshima!

7987
04:23:13,020 --> 04:23:16,390
The legend of fart arm wrestling, Ueshima Ryuuhei

7988
04:23:16,690 --> 04:23:18,900
Degawa, sir, please!

7989
04:23:17,160 --> 04:23:21,260
Degawa Corps Captain

7990
04:23:17,160 --> 04:23:21,260
Degawa Tetsurou

7991
04:23:18,900 --> 04:23:21,700
Let's do this!

7992
04:23:21,630 --> 04:23:28,570
Degawa Tetsurou

7993
04:23:21,630 --> 04:23:28,570
No Farting Arm Wrestling: Battle of The Captains

7994
04:23:21,630 --> 04:23:28,570
Ueshima Ryuuhei

7995
04:23:24,700 --> 04:23:27,440
Every time, you wouldn't come up. What? Were you scared?

7996
04:23:27,440 --> 04:23:28,570
Give me a break.

7997
04:23:28,570 --> 04:23:29,570
I'm totally innulverable to farts.

7998
04:23:29,570 --> 04:23:31,410
I'm totally innulverable to farts.

7999
04:23:31,410 --> 04:23:35,010
That's invulnerable to farts.

8000
04:23:34,710 --> 04:23:38,010
Let's do this, then.

8001
04:23:36,410 --> 04:23:37,950
Invulnerable to farts, okay.

8002
04:23:37,950 --> 04:23:39,080
What are you talking about? "Invulnerable to farts."

8003
04:23:39,180 --> 04:23:41,680
And in any case, Ueshima!

8004
04:23:41,680 --> 04:23:42,490
What is it?

8005
04:23:42,150 --> 04:23:43,850
Because you have blisters on your asshole,

8006
04:23:43,850 --> 04:23:44,990
Because you have blisters on your asshole,

8007
04:23:44,990 --> 04:23:48,560
the air never gets in!!

8008
04:23:46,320 --> 04:23:46,360
Don't say that!! You idiot.

8009
04:23:46,360 --> 04:23:46,390
Don't say that!! You idiot.

8010
04:23:46,390 --> 04:23:46,420
Don't say that!! You idiot.

8011
04:23:46,420 --> 04:23:46,460
Don't say that!! You idiot.

8012
04:23:46,460 --> 04:23:46,490
Don't say that!! You idiot.

8013
04:23:46,490 --> 04:23:46,520
Don't say that!! You idiot.

8014
04:23:46,520 --> 04:23:46,560
Don't say that!! You idiot.

8015
04:23:46,560 --> 04:23:46,590
Don't say that!! You idiot.

8016
04:23:46,590 --> 04:23:48,560
Don't say that!! You idiot.

8017
04:23:47,690 --> 04:23:48,560
It's gross.

8018
04:23:48,560 --> 04:23:51,030
Don't say that I have blisters on my ass!!

8019
04:23:51,030 --> 04:23:54,030
You win only because the air doesn't go in!!

8020
04:23:51,890 --> 04:23:53,400
Don't say that, you idiot. Don't say it.

8021
04:23:54,030 --> 04:23:55,830
Alright!!

8022
04:23:54,400 --> 04:23:55,500
Thank you, let's go.

8023
04:23:58,870 --> 04:24:02,000
Hosshan,

8024
04:23:59,770 --> 04:24:02,000
lotion on the heavy side, please

8025
04:24:00,500 --> 04:24:02,410
Going with that.

8026
04:24:02,000 --> 04:24:07,080
Air is injected into both simultaneously

8027
04:24:03,110 --> 04:24:04,710
This is the first time for Degawa...

8028
04:24:03,410 --> 04:24:04,910
Let's go.

8029
04:24:05,210 --> 04:24:06,910
Is it gonna go in or what?

8030
04:24:07,080 --> 04:24:07,740
Oh no no, that's not the anus.

8031
04:24:07,740 --> 04:24:10,250
Oh no no, that's not the anus.

8032
04:24:09,080 --> 04:24:10,250
Right, yes, yes, thank you.

8033
04:24:10,310 --> 04:24:10,680
Ow

8034
04:24:10,350 --> 04:24:10,780
Ow

8035
04:24:10,380 --> 04:24:10,780
Ow

8036
04:24:10,410 --> 04:24:10,780
Ow

8037
04:24:10,450 --> 04:24:10,810
Ow

8038
04:24:10,480 --> 04:24:10,850
Ow

8039
04:24:10,510 --> 04:24:10,880
Ow

8040
04:24:10,550 --> 04:24:10,880
Ow

8041
04:24:10,580 --> 04:24:10,910
Ow

8042
04:24:10,610 --> 04:24:10,950
Ow

8043
04:24:10,650 --> 04:24:10,980
Ow

8044
04:24:10,680 --> 04:24:11,010
Ow

8045
04:24:10,710 --> 04:24:11,050
Ow

8046
04:24:10,750 --> 04:24:11,150
Ow

8047
04:24:11,150 --> 04:24:14,320
Put the anus on.

8048
04:24:12,050 --> 04:24:14,320
Oh no no, not the anus.

8049
04:24:14,320 --> 04:24:15,650
Put the lotion on...

8050
04:24:16,820 --> 04:24:18,590
No, seriously.

8051
04:24:18,690 --> 04:24:19,920
What the hell?

8052
04:24:19,660 --> 04:24:21,490
I'm scared.

8053
04:24:22,490 --> 04:24:23,990
I'm getting hit like crazy.

8054
04:24:24,630 --> 04:24:25,600
He tried to say "lotion" and he said "anus (koumon)"...

8055
04:24:25,600 --> 04:24:28,330
He tried to say "lotion" and he said "anus (koumon)"...

8056
04:24:28,330 --> 04:24:29,400
What the hell?

8057
04:24:29,000 --> 04:24:31,670
That guy is just...

8058
04:24:31,670 --> 04:24:33,840
I'm scared because it's thick.

8059
04:24:33,840 --> 04:24:34,300
Hurry the hell up.

8060
04:24:34,300 --> 04:24:35,710
Hold on, geez.

8061
04:24:35,710 --> 04:24:37,010
Go "Hahhh."

8062
04:24:36,510 --> 04:24:37,010
No, no.

8063
04:24:37,410 --> 04:24:38,510
No, Hosshan...

8064
04:24:38,510 --> 04:24:40,140
The air's coming out!!

8065
04:24:40,140 --> 04:24:43,510
The air's coming out!!

8066
04:24:44,050 --> 04:24:45,780
Why is it going out?

8067
04:24:46,050 --> 04:24:48,020
It just keeps going out!!

8068
04:24:48,020 --> 04:24:48,650
It won't stop. What is this?

8069
04:24:48,650 --> 04:24:51,990
It won't stop. What is this?

8070
04:24:53,990 --> 04:24:57,490
What the hell is this?

8071
04:24:55,490 --> 04:24:57,390
What the hell are you doing?

8072
04:24:57,830 --> 04:24:59,960
It won't stop. Why is this?

8073
04:24:58,460 --> 04:24:59,960
Why does it come out?

8074
04:25:04,530 --> 04:25:05,470
It keeps going out, even though I'm holding it.

8075
04:25:05,470 --> 04:25:07,270
It keeps going out, even though I'm holding it.

8076
04:25:05,900 --> 04:25:08,640
Our captain is waiting for you!

8077
04:25:07,800 --> 04:25:09,770
You idiot, it's in.

8078
04:25:08,970 --> 04:25:10,540
Here it goes!

8079
04:25:10,040 --> 04:25:13,940
Air is injected into both simultaneously

8080
04:25:11,710 --> 04:25:13,940
It's going. Okay, let's go.

8081
04:25:15,950 --> 04:25:18,250
Is it alright?

8082
04:25:17,050 --> 04:25:18,180
Alright.

8083
04:25:21,550 --> 04:25:23,250
It already came out.

8084
04:25:21,550 --> 04:25:25,690
Ueshima runs backstage

8085
04:25:23,290 --> 04:25:25,150
What the hell?

8086
04:25:28,760 --> 04:25:30,260
What the hell?

8087
04:25:30,260 --> 04:25:34,200
Stop leaking, Ueshimaa!!

8088
04:25:36,200 --> 04:25:38,500
Stop making Ueshima wait!

8089
04:25:38,670 --> 04:25:40,670
I had it just now!!

8090
04:25:38,800 --> 04:25:40,670
Just getting it to this point is fun.

8091
04:25:40,670 --> 04:25:42,670
The moment he took it out, you could hear the air coming out.

8092
04:25:43,110 --> 04:25:45,110
I had it, man.

8093
04:25:44,610 --> 04:25:49,050
Ueshima returns

8094
04:25:45,310 --> 04:25:46,440
How are you doing, captain?

8095
04:25:49,180 --> 04:25:50,180
It's coming out.

8096
04:25:49,910 --> 04:25:52,420
Ryuu, you should also get in that position and be ready

8097
04:25:52,420 --> 04:25:54,480
from the start.

8098
04:25:55,620 --> 04:25:56,690
I'm putting it in.

8099
04:25:55,620 --> 04:25:59,920
Air is injected while in stand-by mode

8100
04:25:56,690 --> 04:25:57,790
It's going in.

8101
04:25:57,290 --> 04:25:58,690
It's coming out.

8102
04:25:57,790 --> 04:25:59,990
Get set, get set.

8103
04:25:59,220 --> 04:26:00,720
It's coming out.

8104
04:25:59,990 --> 04:26:00,890
All right!

8105
04:26:01,660 --> 04:26:02,890
Okay, good!

8106
04:26:02,260 --> 04:26:03,060
Ready...

8107
04:26:03,060 --> 04:26:04,060
Go!

8108
04:26:08,100 --> 04:26:11,270
Can't even tell who that sound came from.

8109
04:26:19,180 --> 04:26:24,750
Both run backstage

8110
04:26:22,240 --> 04:26:24,250
What the hell is he doing?

8111
04:26:27,320 --> 04:26:30,490
What is over there?

8112
04:26:31,490 --> 04:26:36,660
1:30AM: Returning to the office, but there are still many more trials to go through.

8113
04:26:31,950 --> 04:26:36,660
Detective Duty: 17 hours 30 minutes

8114
04:26:45,970 --> 04:26:47,770
That scared me.

8115
04:26:47,770 --> 04:26:49,110
Whoa, okay.

8116
04:26:47,770 --> 04:26:49,770
What... what is this?

8117
04:26:55,710 --> 04:26:56,380
Who is that?

8118
04:26:56,980 --> 04:26:59,050
They were saying something. A shamisen?

8119
04:26:59,050 --> 04:27:00,780
Isn't it simply an old lady?

8120
04:27:06,260 --> 04:27:11,560
Mistress Utsumi Keiko (93 years old)

8121
04:27:06,420 --> 04:27:11,560
I'm ninety-three.

8122
04:27:12,060 --> 04:27:14,900
Note: 1 "go" is about 180 milliliters

8123
04:27:12,060 --> 04:27:14,900
One go* of wine, two bowls of rice.

8124
04:27:14,900 --> 04:27:20,270
One go* of wine, two bowls of rice.

8125
04:27:17,870 --> 04:27:20,270
(La-di-da-di-da.)

8126
04:27:20,440 --> 04:27:23,270
In the middle of the night,
I go to the bathrrom 5 times.

8127
04:27:23,270 --> 04:27:25,880
In the middle of the night,
I go to the bathroom 5 times.

8128
04:27:25,880 --> 04:27:29,480
In the middle of the night,
I go to the bathroom 5 times.

8129
04:27:29,780 --> 04:27:32,680
7 more years until a hundred, no way.

8130
04:27:32,680 --> 04:27:35,080
7 more years until a hundred, no way.

8131
04:27:35,250 --> 04:27:37,890
To everyone, I ask for

8132
04:27:37,890 --> 04:27:40,490
To everyone, I ask for

8133
04:27:40,790 --> 04:27:42,790
your support.

8134
04:27:42,790 --> 04:27:45,390
your support.

8135
04:27:46,730 --> 04:27:47,930
Ugghhh.

8136
04:27:48,400 --> 04:27:51,100
You rookie detective bastards,

8137
04:27:51,330 --> 04:27:53,270
I've taken a friend of you bastards, Hiroshi.

8138
04:27:53,270 --> 04:27:55,640
I've taken a friend of you bastards, Hiroshi.

8139
04:27:55,640 --> 04:27:58,910
Let them hear you.

8140
04:28:00,480 --> 04:28:01,980
Sorry, you guys.

8141
04:28:01,980 --> 04:28:04,310
I'm sorry the situation has come to this.

8142
04:28:04,550 --> 04:28:07,350
Muahahaha!

8143
04:28:07,380 --> 04:28:08,250
But

8144
04:28:08,250 --> 04:28:11,720
I'll give you bastards a chance.

8145
04:28:11,720 --> 04:28:18,060
Hiroshi is captured

8146
04:28:14,160 --> 04:28:18,060
somewhere within the building that you are all in.

8147
04:28:18,060 --> 04:28:18,830
First, Hamada and Tanaka,

8148
04:28:18,830 --> 04:28:22,230
First, Hamada and Tanaka,

8149
04:28:20,860 --> 04:28:22,230
you bastards go first!!

8150
04:28:24,970 --> 04:28:27,940
From this point on, you're allowed to laugh

8151
04:28:27,470 --> 04:28:31,340
I don't want Tanaka!

8152
04:28:27,940 --> 04:28:29,670
but if you get scared, you're OUT.

8153
04:28:29,670 --> 04:28:31,570
but if you get scared, you're OUT.

8154
04:28:31,370 --> 04:28:34,310
This guy falls over in fear.

8155
04:28:31,570 --> 04:28:38,050
Lastly, it's cold outside,

8156
04:28:34,010 --> 04:28:35,780
so wear your jackets when you go.

8157
04:28:35,780 --> 04:28:38,050
so wear your jackets when you go.

8158
04:28:38,050 --> 04:28:41,450
Wear your jackets when you go, alright?

8159
04:28:46,760 --> 04:28:47,720
No way, I hate this!!

8160
04:28:47,720 --> 04:28:49,830
No way, I hate this!!

8161
04:28:50,260 --> 04:28:51,660
What I'm scared of is you always do this,

8162
04:28:51,690 --> 04:28:53,000
That's right, that's right.

8163
04:28:51,690 --> 04:28:53,300
and your elbow will just come up here and hit me really hard.

8164
04:28:53,300 --> 04:28:55,560
And your elbow will just come up here and hit me really hard.

8165
04:28:54,160 --> 04:28:57,000
I won't do that. It won't happen.

8166
04:28:55,660 --> 04:28:56,330
Your nose will bleed thick!!

8167
04:28:56,330 --> 04:28:58,570
Your nose will bleed thick!!

8168
04:28:58,570 --> 04:29:01,800
Really dark blood!!

8169
04:29:02,070 --> 04:29:08,810
Special Midnight Rules

8170
04:29:03,610 --> 04:29:06,080
Special Midnight Rules

8171
04:29:03,640 --> 04:29:08,810
Absolutely No Getting Scared

8172
04:29:03,640 --> 04:29:08,810
Detectives

8173
04:29:06,080 --> 04:29:06,210
Absolutely No Getting Scared

8174
04:29:06,080 --> 04:29:06,210
Detectives

8175
04:29:08,810 --> 04:29:14,820
Rescue the kidnapped Fujiwara!!

8176
04:29:09,650 --> 04:29:14,820
First, the two are to go rescue Fujiwara.  But the concerns about Tanaka remain.

8177
04:29:14,720 --> 04:29:16,490
They had to pick that photo?

8178
04:29:15,350 --> 04:29:17,950
Every year, I know what's going to happen.

8179
04:29:16,950 --> 04:29:17,350
(With the elbow,) bang!!

8180
04:29:16,990 --> 04:29:17,350
(With the elbow,) bang!!

8181
04:29:17,020 --> 04:29:21,160
(With the elbow,) bang!!

8182
04:29:20,320 --> 04:29:21,020
The elbow?

8183
04:29:21,060 --> 04:29:22,190
Yeah, the elbow...

8184
04:29:22,690 --> 04:29:23,690
"Ahhh," he'll go,

8185
04:29:23,790 --> 04:29:24,160
and then, bang!!

8186
04:29:23,860 --> 04:29:24,190
and then, bang!!

8187
04:29:23,890 --> 04:29:26,400
and then, bang!!

8188
04:29:27,330 --> 04:29:29,170
I'm seriously afraid of that.

8189
04:29:29,430 --> 04:29:31,700
If I'm about to go like this, could you just hold me like this, then?

8190
04:29:31,700 --> 04:29:32,330
No, no...

8191
04:29:32,570 --> 04:29:33,970
That would be dangerous.

8192
04:29:33,970 --> 04:29:34,970
I'll be careful, though.

8193
04:29:34,600 --> 04:29:37,470
You mean, wrap you up?

8194
04:29:35,670 --> 04:29:37,470
Oh, then what about

8195
04:29:37,470 --> 04:29:40,210
you hold on tightly to Hamada and walk?

8196
04:29:40,510 --> 04:29:43,080
Instead, yeah, since you're big.

8197
04:29:43,180 --> 04:29:44,380
Right, right.

8198
04:29:43,280 --> 04:29:45,880
Like this? Like this, right?

8199
04:29:45,080 --> 04:29:47,150
So if you get scared, you can go like this.

8200
04:29:46,580 --> 04:29:48,050
Don't let go here.

8201
04:29:48,250 --> 04:29:49,520
We're seriously gonna walk like this?

8202
04:29:49,520 --> 04:29:52,250
We're seriously gonna walk like this?

8203
04:29:50,450 --> 04:29:52,350
I think it's good.

8204
04:29:52,320 --> 04:29:55,060
Good luck.

8205
04:29:53,860 --> 04:29:55,060
Sorry. I'm sorry about this, Hamada.

8206
04:29:55,060 --> 04:29:56,230
If only you could be more dependable, that's all this is about.

8207
04:29:56,230 --> 04:29:59,230
If only you could be more dependable, that's all this is about.

8208
04:29:56,860 --> 04:29:59,530
Hamada has a weak back, though.

8209
04:29:59,500 --> 04:30:01,400
Damn, so many things...

8210
04:30:01,330 --> 04:30:02,530
Arrgghhh!!

8211
04:30:03,530 --> 04:30:06,070
Arrgghhh!!

8212
04:30:07,740 --> 04:30:08,300
You're right

8213
04:30:08,470 --> 04:30:08,940
See?

8214
04:30:09,540 --> 04:30:11,310
What should I do..?

8215
04:30:11,310 --> 04:30:13,410
I can't walk...

8216
04:30:12,010 --> 04:30:13,310
You really can't...

8217
04:30:13,410 --> 04:30:14,880
You're probably taking too much time even now...

8218
04:30:14,880 --> 04:30:17,210
You're probably taking too much time even now...

8219
04:30:16,410 --> 04:30:17,580
It is dark already...

8220
04:30:17,180 --> 04:30:19,650
Seriously though man, I'm counting on you

8221
04:30:18,650 --> 04:30:19,220
The elbow, man, the elbow.

8222
04:30:19,220 --> 04:30:20,820
The elbow, man, the elbow...

8223
04:30:21,180 --> 04:30:27,420
Aaaaaaaaah

8224
04:30:23,090 --> 04:30:27,420
Baaang

8225
04:30:23,290 --> 04:30:27,420
like that...

8226
04:30:26,960 --> 04:30:28,360
Only Hamada laughed...

8227
04:30:28,820 --> 04:30:30,060
Okay, I'm sorry...

8228
04:30:30,060 --> 04:30:30,630
We're off... We're going.

8229
04:30:30,630 --> 04:30:32,560
We're off... We're going.

8230
04:30:32,900 --> 04:30:37,730
2nd Floor: in front of the waiting room

8231
04:30:34,160 --> 04:30:35,730
It's the scariest with you

8232
04:30:35,730 --> 04:30:37,730
It's the scariest with you

8233
04:30:38,000 --> 04:30:42,470
Until the hidden prank

8234
04:30:38,300 --> 04:30:40,570
Where are we going, are we meant to go down these stairs?

8235
04:30:39,840 --> 04:30:40,400
Yeah, I presume so...

8236
04:30:41,070 --> 04:30:41,900
There's no other way...

8237
04:30:45,870 --> 04:30:50,550
Nebaaru-kun is outside the window

8238
04:30:46,540 --> 04:31:09,870
[Note: Nebaaru-kun is a mascot character based on natto(fermented soybeans). "Nebaaru" means sticky. He ends sentences with "nebaa".]

8239
04:30:50,550 --> 04:30:52,880
I'm Nebaaru-kun

8240
04:30:52,680 --> 04:30:53,780
Hold on!

8241
04:30:55,180 --> 04:30:56,220
He's already on
the floor!!!

8242
04:30:55,250 --> 04:30:58,390
Sticky sheets

8243
04:30:57,990 --> 04:30:58,620
The floor...

8244
04:30:58,820 --> 04:30:59,390
W-W-Wow!

8245
04:31:01,520 --> 04:31:03,630
Nebaa, nebaa

8246
04:31:03,960 --> 04:31:10,100
Dolls of Nebaaru-kun fall from the ceiling

8247
04:31:06,100 --> 04:31:10,100
1 for 800yen

8248
04:31:07,900 --> 04:31:10,100
Buy it, nebaa

8249
04:31:09,600 --> 04:31:10,900
That shocked me

8250
04:31:11,170 --> 04:31:11,570
Wait

8251
04:31:11,570 --> 04:31:13,170
Can you please

8252
04:31:11,570 --> 04:31:13,170
do something about this sticky sheet?

8253
04:31:12,170 --> 04:31:12,770
My hand...

8254
04:31:13,900 --> 04:31:14,340
Timi-...

8255
04:31:17,070 --> 04:31:18,040
That's shouting from hell!!

8256
04:31:18,040 --> 04:31:20,080
That's shouting from hell!

8257
04:31:18,070 --> 04:31:19,380
They're screaming right outside the door...

8258
04:31:20,710 --> 04:31:24,180
Tanaka, this (sticky sheet)

8259
04:31:21,310 --> 04:31:24,180
what do I do about it!?

8260
04:31:22,610 --> 04:31:23,580
It's completely stuck on you!

8261
04:31:24,180 --> 04:31:25,580
Take it off for me!!

8262
04:31:25,910 --> 04:31:32,090
1st Floor Corridor

8263
04:31:27,020 --> 04:31:27,480
Okay...

8264
04:31:27,850 --> 04:31:28,780
Man, that scared me...

8265
04:31:28,920 --> 04:31:33,460
Until the hidden prank

8266
04:31:31,050 --> 04:31:31,750
This way...

8267
04:31:32,990 --> 04:31:34,590
Seriously Tanaka...

8268
04:31:39,630 --> 04:31:43,600
Hayashiya Pe-Pako husband&wife couple appear!

8269
04:31:40,760 --> 04:31:41,860
Damn, that scared me.

8270
04:31:40,860 --> 04:31:41,860
He fell over again...

8271
04:31:43,770 --> 04:31:47,540
Great work on this huge shoot

8272
04:31:45,000 --> 04:31:46,140
Oh no, not at all... Thank you so much...

8273
04:31:47,500 --> 04:31:50,440
I've never been on such an amazing program...

8274
04:31:50,440 --> 04:31:53,610
Just for them, they're going to tell a joke

8275
04:31:50,540 --> 04:31:51,010
Okay...

8276
04:31:51,070 --> 04:31:53,540
Will you listen to our jokes would that be okay?

8277
04:31:53,610 --> 04:31:56,480
Even when the weather is really bad

8278
04:31:56,480 --> 04:31:58,910
Where's the place to dry laundry?

8279
04:32:00,080 --> 04:32:01,650
It's Arakawa-ku in fact...

8280
04:32:00,080 --> 04:32:05,450
[note: pun based on fact Ara means 'oh dear' and 'kawaku' means 'to get dry'

8281
04:32:01,750 --> 04:32:04,750
Ara-kawaku

8282
04:32:06,760 --> 04:32:11,190
Pa-ko's Picture

8283
04:32:07,560 --> 04:32:10,960
Seriously though, great work!

8284
04:32:08,290 --> 04:32:08,690
Oh, thanks...

8285
04:32:08,860 --> 04:32:10,030
Do your best!

8286
04:32:09,730 --> 04:32:10,490
Thank you so much...

8287
04:32:10,760 --> 04:32:11,360
Sorry about this...

8288
04:32:11,360 --> 04:32:11,990
Yes, sorry...

8289
04:32:11,460 --> 04:32:12,860
Thank you!

8290
04:32:12,360 --> 04:32:14,300
Great job, guys!

8291
04:32:13,130 --> 04:32:14,430
Damn, that shocked me!

8292
04:32:13,930 --> 04:32:15,200
Yeah, it did...

8293
04:32:15,200 --> 04:32:17,370
Haha! Oh no...

8294
04:32:16,230 --> 04:32:17,370
Haha! Oh no...

8295
04:32:20,340 --> 04:32:22,300
Damn, I don't want to do this...

8296
04:32:20,500 --> 04:32:20,900
Damn...

8297
04:32:24,010 --> 04:32:25,870
It was just me farting for fuck's sakes...

8298
04:32:27,040 --> 04:32:27,540
Huh, what was that?

8299
04:32:27,540 --> 04:32:30,880
Huh, what was that?

8300
04:32:31,450 --> 04:32:34,750
If you get shocked at something like that...

8301
04:32:34,750 --> 04:32:35,250
Could you please not fart

8302
04:32:35,250 --> 04:32:37,850
Could you please not fart

8303
04:32:35,720 --> 04:32:37,850
here?

8304
04:32:38,690 --> 04:32:47,900
They quietly wait for news from the 2

8305
04:32:39,090 --> 04:32:43,290
Meanwhile, the other 3 wait for further instructions...

8306
04:32:48,230 --> 04:32:56,640
1st Floor: in front of the Disguises Room

8307
04:32:48,460 --> 04:32:49,260
It says something there...

8308
04:32:49,600 --> 04:32:50,230
It says something there...

8309
04:32:51,170 --> 04:32:56,640
From a treasure box in the room,

8310
04:32:51,170 --> 04:32:56,640
Hiroshi's location!!

8311
04:32:51,170 --> 04:32:56,640
find and get a map clue of

8312
04:32:51,500 --> 04:32:53,940
From a treasure box in the room

8313
04:32:54,500 --> 04:32:56,840
find and get a map clue of Hiroshi's location...

8314
04:32:57,310 --> 04:32:57,910
Oh wait...

8315
04:32:58,470 --> 04:32:58,940
What?

8316
04:32:58,470 --> 04:33:02,110
Cautious of the shock from door knob

8317
04:32:58,840 --> 04:33:00,440
Please, you open it...

8318
04:33:00,310 --> 04:33:01,080
Wait, why?

8319
04:33:01,080 --> 04:33:02,110
Why do I have to do it?

8320
04:33:02,110 --> 04:33:05,380
Oy you, don't mess with me!!

8321
04:33:03,380 --> 04:33:05,380
It'll be fine!!

8322
04:33:06,050 --> 04:33:09,080
Hurry up and open it!!

8323
04:33:14,520 --> 04:33:19,160
As expected, the door knob gives off a shock

8324
04:33:20,760 --> 04:33:22,660
You seriously are just...

8325
04:33:23,000 --> 04:33:26,740
1st Floor Disguises Room

8326
04:33:26,300 --> 04:33:26,970
What now...

8327
04:33:28,040 --> 04:33:29,340
There it is

8328
04:33:28,300 --> 04:33:29,410
Open it...

8329
04:33:29,410 --> 04:33:31,710
Open it...

8330
04:33:30,110 --> 04:33:34,240
You must open this treasure box!!

8331
04:33:31,970 --> 04:33:34,240
Hamada-san, you open it!

8332
04:33:37,850 --> 04:33:38,550
Must push...

8333
04:33:38,980 --> 04:33:42,320
Must push!

8334
04:33:39,180 --> 04:33:40,050
It says "Must push"!

8335
04:33:41,450 --> 04:33:41,980
Must push?

8336
04:33:42,520 --> 04:33:43,320
Please push it...

8337
04:33:49,360 --> 04:33:51,430
I see...

8338
04:33:51,930 --> 04:33:57,070
Connected to the waiting room where carbon dioxide gas gets blasted

8339
04:33:54,500 --> 04:33:56,170
This is really bad
for our health

8340
04:33:56,000 --> 04:33:56,670
From over there...

8341
04:33:56,170 --> 04:33:58,170
So annoying...

8342
04:33:57,470 --> 04:34:00,200
Seriously, what the hell...

8343
04:34:01,370 --> 04:34:04,040
Nothing happened!

8344
04:34:04,040 --> 04:34:09,980
Current location

8345
04:34:04,040 --> 04:34:09,980
Map clue

8346
04:34:04,040 --> 04:34:09,980
Search continues! Aiming for annex's 2nd floor

8347
04:34:04,710 --> 04:34:06,940
The two resume their search for Fujiwara.

8348
04:34:07,310 --> 04:34:09,180
They head for the second floor of the annex

8349
04:34:10,310 --> 04:34:14,380
1st Floor Corridor

8350
04:34:10,380 --> 04:34:11,780
Those stairs, huh?

8351
04:34:12,080 --> 04:34:12,580
I get it...

8352
04:34:12,650 --> 04:34:13,680
Oh damn...

8353
04:34:14,650 --> 04:34:19,890
Until secret prank

8354
04:34:16,590 --> 04:34:16,950
That's right, right?

8355
04:34:16,990 --> 04:34:17,550
Yes, I think so...

8356
04:34:18,320 --> 04:34:18,850
and this goes...

8357
04:34:24,330 --> 04:34:25,160
Oh damn!

8358
04:34:26,030 --> 04:34:26,660
I'm sorry!

8359
04:34:26,830 --> 04:34:27,400
What the hell!?

8360
04:34:27,400 --> 04:34:29,430
Danson

8361
04:34:28,700 --> 04:34:31,700
Oh what the hell!?

8362
04:34:29,430 --> 04:34:37,440
3 deer and Bambino Ishiyama enters

8363
04:34:30,300 --> 04:34:31,100
Danson!

8364
04:34:31,800 --> 04:34:32,500
Danson!

8365
04:34:37,340 --> 04:34:37,870
What...

8366
04:34:37,870 --> 04:34:38,570
Danson!

8367
04:34:38,610 --> 04:34:39,440
You want us to dance?

8368
04:34:39,440 --> 04:34:43,650
Inviting them to dance?

8369
04:34:46,520 --> 04:34:47,720
Ni-bura!

8370
04:34:46,520 --> 04:34:56,120
[note: this is a comedy routine by duo 'Bambino'. The chants mostly  don't really have any particular meanings. Although 'Danson' means 'dance' in French]

8371
04:34:47,720 --> 04:34:48,850
Wait, they're coming here...

8372
04:34:48,750 --> 04:34:50,990
Ni-bura

8373
04:34:49,120 --> 04:34:49,890
You're really
doing it...

8374
04:34:50,120 --> 04:34:50,990
Ni-bura

8375
04:34:51,390 --> 04:34:58,390
Success in catching the 3 deer

8376
04:34:58,390 --> 04:35:00,400
Damn you're
good friends

8377
04:35:00,400 --> 04:35:01,160
You did it.

8378
04:35:03,400 --> 04:35:06,440
What the hell!?

8379
04:35:06,440 --> 04:35:08,170
That scared me...

8380
04:35:09,000 --> 04:35:13,380
Why was I forced to do

8381
04:35:10,340 --> 04:35:13,380
a junior's routine  like that?

8382
04:35:13,680 --> 04:35:16,510
2nd Floor: Photo-taking Room

8383
04:35:13,980 --> 04:35:15,340
Wow, damn it...

8384
04:35:16,510 --> 04:35:21,520
Follow the instructions of the machine

8385
04:35:16,510 --> 04:35:21,520
and take a buddy-buddy photo!!

8386
04:35:16,910 --> 04:35:17,610
Wait...

8387
04:35:17,280 --> 04:35:19,520
Follow the instructions of the machine...

8388
04:35:19,780 --> 04:35:21,650
and take a buddy-buddy photo...

8389
04:35:21,650 --> 04:35:24,120
What's it like in there?

8390
04:35:26,190 --> 04:35:27,020
HOLY SHIT!

8391
04:35:27,860 --> 04:35:32,860
King of Cont 2015 Lotti's comedy

8392
04:35:27,860 --> 04:35:32,860
[note: King of Cont is an annual comedy skit competition]

8393
04:35:31,560 --> 04:35:32,590
Damn, that scared me

8394
04:35:33,230 --> 04:35:36,530
This guy's so irritating!!

8395
04:35:33,800 --> 04:35:35,030
Did you see?

8396
04:35:35,460 --> 04:35:36,230
Ye-sh...

8397
04:35:36,530 --> 04:35:39,940
Are you decent now?

8398
04:35:37,700 --> 04:35:39,940
Ye-sh...

8399
04:35:48,340 --> 04:35:49,440
What the hell are you doing?

8400
04:35:49,010 --> 04:35:51,310
You're not decent at all!

8401
04:35:51,310 --> 04:35:53,480
Is it okay now? Are you decent?

8402
04:35:53,480 --> 04:35:55,050
Is it okay now? Are you decent?

8403
04:35:55,050 --> 04:35:57,120
"Ye-sh" he said that right?

8404
04:35:55,580 --> 04:35:57,120
Ye-sh

8405
04:35:57,120 --> 04:35:58,590
I'm opening it...

8406
04:35:58,120 --> 04:35:58,790
Okay...

8407
04:36:03,160 --> 04:36:04,960
Stop taking the piss!!

8408
04:36:03,390 --> 04:36:05,290
What the hell, man..?

8409
04:36:05,430 --> 04:36:06,260
What the-...

8410
04:36:05,590 --> 04:36:06,360
Wear properly, you said "Yeesh"!!

8411
04:36:06,360 --> 04:36:08,500
Wear properly, you said "Yeesh"!!

8412
04:36:08,760 --> 04:36:12,300
What the hell..?

8413
04:36:12,800 --> 04:36:16,840
The 2 take a buddy-buddy photo

8414
04:36:13,200 --> 04:36:14,700
The previous customer leaves

8415
04:36:14,970 --> 04:36:16,610
The two can take a photo now...

8416
04:36:17,110 --> 04:36:17,740
3...

8417
04:36:18,610 --> 04:36:19,140
2...

8418
04:36:20,080 --> 04:36:20,540
1...

8419
04:36:24,410 --> 04:36:25,310
The picture will come out of the side of this machine

8420
04:36:24,410 --> 04:36:28,120
Announce

8421
04:36:25,310 --> 04:36:28,120
The picture will come out of the side of this machine

8422
04:36:26,180 --> 04:36:26,850
Oh great...

8423
04:36:26,950 --> 04:36:28,120
Please wait outside

8424
04:36:27,880 --> 04:36:28,450
I was so scared...

8425
04:36:28,350 --> 04:36:31,350
I thought something was going to happen...

8426
04:36:29,920 --> 04:36:30,650
Yeah...

8427
04:36:32,090 --> 04:36:35,260
The picture taking ends...

8428
04:36:32,420 --> 04:36:32,820
Here it is...

8429
04:36:33,290 --> 04:36:33,920
It's already come out...

8430
04:36:35,920 --> 04:36:47,900
Hamada got switched with Sato Gajiro

8431
04:36:35,920 --> 04:36:47,900
[note; Sato Gajiro is a veteran actor]

8432
04:36:41,930 --> 04:36:42,900
They love using
him...

8433
04:36:44,600 --> 04:36:47,170
They really think
highly of him, huh?

8434
04:36:46,300 --> 04:36:47,600
This isn't me...

8435
04:36:48,070 --> 04:36:55,810
Masked squad takes the 2 away

8436
04:36:49,000 --> 04:36:51,610
Because the 2 did not take a good picture,

8437
04:36:51,840 --> 04:36:53,580
they were taken away to another location

8438
04:36:53,610 --> 04:36:55,140
That was a dirty trick

8439
04:36:54,510 --> 04:36:55,380
It was strange

8440
04:36:56,450 --> 04:37:00,120
Prefab small room

8441
04:36:58,050 --> 04:36:58,880
What?

8442
04:36:58,350 --> 04:36:59,580
What's with this?

8443
04:36:59,980 --> 04:37:00,520
What?

8444
04:37:02,120 --> 04:37:02,750
What? What?

8445
04:37:03,250 --> 04:37:05,590
Wait a little!!

8446
04:37:06,120 --> 04:37:07,360
Eh? Seriously?

8447
04:37:09,320 --> 04:37:12,690
I wonder if the others have started out?

8448
04:37:12,960 --> 04:37:16,130
Tied

8449
04:37:12,960 --> 04:37:16,130
Up

8450
04:37:13,560 --> 04:37:15,860
Oh what the hell, man..?

8451
04:37:16,470 --> 04:37:19,170
Newbie waiting room

8452
04:37:19,300 --> 04:37:21,670
So tired...

8453
04:37:29,880 --> 04:37:31,980
I have taken Hamada and Tanaka as well

8454
04:37:31,980 --> 04:37:34,920
I have taken Hamada and Tanaka as well

8455
04:37:34,920 --> 04:37:37,790
You're the only ones left!

8456
04:37:37,790 --> 04:37:39,450
Now go!!

8457
04:37:39,990 --> 04:37:42,190
Don't you guys forget to wear your jackets though too, okay?

8458
04:37:42,190 --> 04:37:44,860
Don't you guys forget to wear your jackets though too, okay?

8459
04:37:44,860 --> 04:37:47,200
Wear your jackets and go, okay?

8460
04:37:44,860 --> 04:37:47,200
You guys

8461
04:37:47,200 --> 04:37:50,200
Whatever happens, don't forget it!!

8462
04:37:53,540 --> 04:37:54,740
Here it is...

8463
04:37:55,240 --> 04:37:57,410
So those 2 also got caught, huh?

8464
04:37:57,710 --> 04:38:04,350
Before rescuing Fujiwara, they will go to save the captured two

8465
04:37:58,440 --> 04:38:00,980
Before rescuing Fujiwara, the 3 will

8466
04:38:01,310 --> 04:38:03,350
go and save Hamada and Tanaka

8467
04:38:06,210 --> 04:38:08,420
Damn, I'm so scared...

8468
04:38:08,320 --> 04:38:12,320
2nd Floor: in front of the waiting room

8469
04:38:10,420 --> 04:38:11,050
Please don't scream...

8470
04:38:11,050 --> 04:38:14,290
Please don't scream...

8471
04:38:13,220 --> 04:38:14,290
Let's do our very best

8472
04:38:15,890 --> 04:38:21,260
Carbon dioxide gas suddenly comes out

8473
04:38:18,190 --> 04:38:19,800
Damn it...

8474
04:38:19,860 --> 04:38:21,300
Right from the start...

8475
04:38:21,330 --> 04:38:23,300
I don't want to do this...

8476
04:38:23,100 --> 04:38:25,770
There's some debris here...

8477
04:38:24,670 --> 04:38:27,970
Sticky sheets

8478
04:38:25,770 --> 04:38:27,970
This is where Hamada-san

8479
04:38:26,470 --> 04:38:27,970
was screaming like "Ugyaaa"

8480
04:38:28,070 --> 04:38:31,440
The 2 in the prefab...

8481
04:38:28,970 --> 04:38:31,240
Meanwhile, the captured two...

8482
04:38:31,640 --> 04:38:38,810
Until pitch black

8483
04:38:32,210 --> 04:38:33,310
Help us!!

8484
04:38:36,650 --> 04:38:37,480
This is...

8485
04:38:38,280 --> 04:38:39,180
They can't hear us...

8486
04:38:39,210 --> 04:38:40,050
You're right

8487
04:38:40,450 --> 04:38:45,450
The prefab room suddenly becomes pitch black

8488
04:38:42,880 --> 04:38:44,350
That's scary...

8489
04:38:43,120 --> 04:38:44,350
What is this?

8490
04:38:44,120 --> 04:38:44,690
Give me a break...

8491
04:38:44,690 --> 04:38:45,450
Please stop this...

8492
04:38:45,590 --> 04:38:46,820
Wait, what what...

8493
04:38:45,950 --> 04:38:53,160
Filming with a special camera. Visibility for the 2 is zero

8494
04:38:46,050 --> 04:38:48,560
Please brighten the room up...

8495
04:38:48,560 --> 04:38:49,730
This would be
scary

8496
04:38:49,760 --> 04:38:50,590
Way more...

8497
04:38:52,690 --> 04:38:53,200
What the?

8498
04:38:53,500 --> 04:39:25,260
Filming on night vision camera

8499
04:38:54,060 --> 04:38:58,670
With visibility at zero, Barbie enters

8500
04:38:55,630 --> 04:38:57,900
What the hell, seriously..?

8501
04:38:58,100 --> 04:38:59,570
I had no idea...

8502
04:38:58,670 --> 04:39:00,340
I literally have no idea...

8503
04:38:59,570 --> 04:39:01,570
But Barbie can't
see either, right?

8504
04:39:01,840 --> 04:39:02,140
I'm scared...

8505
04:39:02,140 --> 04:39:02,300
I'm scared...

8506
04:39:02,300 --> 04:39:03,740
I'm scared...

8507
04:39:03,210 --> 04:39:04,010
What the hell is going on..?

8508
04:39:04,340 --> 04:39:08,510
Barbie uses night vision scope to see

8509
04:39:05,410 --> 04:39:06,210
Seriously...

8510
04:39:05,840 --> 04:39:07,010
Oh of course...

8511
04:39:07,440 --> 04:39:08,540
This is so so so scary...

8512
04:39:10,280 --> 04:39:11,150
Wait, what what??

8513
04:39:11,050 --> 04:39:13,320
My dick got touched

8514
04:39:12,350 --> 04:39:13,050
You're kidding me

8515
04:39:14,480 --> 04:39:15,680
Something touched my dick...

8516
04:39:15,720 --> 04:39:16,380
You're kidding me...

8517
04:39:16,180 --> 04:39:16,550
Serious...

8518
04:39:17,820 --> 04:39:18,550
What happened?

8519
04:39:19,290 --> 04:39:19,920
Mydick got touched too

8520
04:39:19,920 --> 04:39:22,820
My dick got touched too

8521
04:39:21,920 --> 04:39:22,720
What is this?..

8522
04:39:23,530 --> 04:39:25,260
What is going on here?

8523
04:39:25,590 --> 04:39:30,600
1st Floor Corridor

8524
04:39:25,860 --> 04:39:27,200
This is seriously annoying...

8525
04:39:27,600 --> 04:39:30,600
Wait here!!

8526
04:39:28,360 --> 04:39:30,100
It says wait here...

8527
04:39:30,800 --> 04:39:32,570
And it's telling us to stand in line...

8528
04:39:31,930 --> 04:39:33,670
Huh?

8529
04:39:32,600 --> 04:39:33,670
Huh?

8530
04:39:33,800 --> 04:39:36,370
You people!!

8531
04:39:33,800 --> 04:39:36,370
You people!!

8532
04:39:35,300 --> 04:39:36,370
Ufufu

8533
04:39:35,300 --> 04:39:36,370
Ufufu

8534
04:39:36,370 --> 04:39:40,180
The Kano sisters are waiting in the yard with machine guns

8535
04:39:36,840 --> 04:39:37,840
Wait right there!

8536
04:39:36,840 --> 04:39:37,840
Wait right there!

8537
04:39:39,980 --> 04:39:41,810
What a ridiculous
outfit

8538
04:39:45,450 --> 04:39:50,050
The Kano sisters shoot wildly with their machine guns

8539
04:39:51,750 --> 04:39:52,690
I'm Sexy Rambo Kyouko!!

8540
04:39:52,690 --> 04:39:56,090
I'm Sexy Rambo Kyouko!!

8541
04:39:53,660 --> 04:39:54,560
I'm the same, Mika!!

8542
04:39:54,560 --> 04:39:56,090
I'm the same, Mika!!

8543
04:40:00,900 --> 04:40:02,860
I don't get it

8544
04:40:03,900 --> 04:40:05,000
Mika...

8545
04:40:06,100 --> 04:40:08,070
That is one crazy outfit

8546
04:40:08,070 --> 04:41:09,630
Night vision recording

8547
04:40:08,670 --> 04:40:12,170
Barbie playing pranks in the prefabricated room in complete darkness

8548
04:40:13,480 --> 04:40:14,740
Please no...

8549
04:40:13,510 --> 04:40:16,340
Tickling armpit with brush

8550
04:40:14,740 --> 04:40:16,580
What the hell is this..?

8551
04:40:16,610 --> 04:40:18,010
Help!!

8552
04:40:16,950 --> 04:40:18,680
I don't think I could handle this

8553
04:40:18,010 --> 04:40:19,610
Help!!

8554
04:40:18,050 --> 04:40:19,410
Come on...

8555
04:40:18,250 --> 04:40:19,450
What what what?

8556
04:40:19,450 --> 04:40:20,750
Oh God, I'd hate this

8557
04:40:21,520 --> 04:40:23,820
Augh!! Hey hey, wait!

8558
04:40:23,820 --> 04:40:27,660
Something's hitting my face!!

8559
04:40:24,990 --> 04:40:26,320
Hitting your face?!

8560
04:40:26,320 --> 04:40:28,420
What is it, what is it??

8561
04:40:31,360 --> 04:40:33,260
Gross!! What is it? Stop stop stop!!

8562
04:40:34,760 --> 04:40:36,300
Stop please, stop!!

8563
04:40:36,300 --> 04:40:38,300
What is this?!

8564
04:40:37,770 --> 04:40:40,140
Something's hitting your face, right?

8565
04:40:38,300 --> 04:40:40,300
Yes, something is

8566
04:40:40,340 --> 04:40:42,040
So gross... Who is it?

8567
04:40:42,040 --> 04:40:43,470
So gross... Who is it?

8568
04:40:44,010 --> 04:40:47,210
I can't get my vision adjusted at all

8569
04:40:44,270 --> 04:40:50,750
Time until
secret prank

8570
04:40:44,270 --> 04:40:50,750
seconds

8571
04:40:44,740 --> 04:40:47,080
Yes, it just won't adjust!

8572
04:40:47,440 --> 04:40:49,080
That's enough, right?

8573
04:40:48,780 --> 04:40:49,580
I'm telling you, I can't see anything at all

8574
04:40:49,580 --> 04:40:51,580
I'm telling you, I can't see anything at all

8575
04:40:52,410 --> 04:40:54,120
That's enough, isn't it?

8576
04:40:54,320 --> 04:40:56,250
What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on?!

8577
04:40:54,680 --> 04:40:59,790
In complete darkness, Hamada's wall revolves

8578
04:40:55,080 --> 04:40:56,550
Wait, what? What's happening??

8579
04:40:56,250 --> 04:40:57,520
What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on?!

8580
04:40:56,920 --> 04:40:58,120
What's wrong? What's wrong? Hamada-san??

8581
04:40:57,520 --> 04:40:58,620
What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on?!

8582
04:40:58,120 --> 04:40:59,220
What's wrong? What's wrong? Hamada-san??

8583
04:40:58,620 --> 04:41:00,190
What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on?!

8584
04:40:59,220 --> 04:41:01,220
What's wrong? What's wrong? Hamada-san??

8585
04:41:00,660 --> 04:41:04,160
Hamada gets switched with Sato Gajiro

8586
04:41:00,660 --> 04:41:04,160
Note: Sato Gajiro is a Japanese actor who has made several appearances on previous batsu games

8587
04:41:04,330 --> 04:41:08,900
Time until
light turns on

8588
04:41:04,330 --> 04:41:08,900
seconds

8589
04:41:05,030 --> 04:41:06,460
Come on, gimme a break

8590
04:41:05,730 --> 04:41:06,530
Really though... Please give me a break

8591
04:41:06,530 --> 04:41:08,500
Really though... Please give me a break

8592
04:41:08,500 --> 04:41:09,500
This is enough, isn't it?

8593
04:41:11,070 --> 04:41:13,300
Uwahh!!

8594
04:41:14,700 --> 04:41:17,640
Haaamada-san...

8595
04:41:17,640 --> 04:41:20,310
I was so shocked

8596
04:41:20,780 --> 04:41:23,580
Gajiro-saaan...

8597
04:41:23,780 --> 04:41:29,720
Front of prefabricated room

8598
04:41:23,850 --> 04:41:25,680
Hamada-saaan!!

8599
04:41:26,280 --> 04:41:29,720
That shrieking is Tanaka, isn't it?

8600
04:41:27,320 --> 04:41:29,520
Tanaka's shrieking... You think so?

8601
04:41:30,120 --> 04:41:36,360
Hamada's entrance

8602
04:41:30,120 --> 04:41:36,360
In just a moment,

8603
04:41:31,190 --> 04:41:34,260
In just a moment... Hamada's entrance...

8604
04:41:33,390 --> 04:41:34,760
I wonder what this means

8605
04:41:34,760 --> 04:41:36,360
Hamada's entrance?

8606
04:41:36,730 --> 04:41:39,900
"Hamada's entrance"? What does that mean?

8607
04:41:38,890 --> 04:41:40,160
Hamada-san, this way please

8608
04:41:39,900 --> 04:41:43,500
Hamada's Manager, Nagai

8609
04:41:40,160 --> 04:41:41,400
Hamada-san, this way please

8610
04:41:40,360 --> 04:41:41,030
It's Nagai-kun

8611
04:41:41,030 --> 04:41:41,760
Oh

8612
04:41:41,760 --> 04:41:43,330
It's the manager, Nagai-kun

8613
04:41:41,960 --> 04:41:43,500
Yeah, the manager...

8614
04:41:43,500 --> 04:41:45,600
This way, if you would please

8615
04:41:45,530 --> 04:41:55,740
Hamada entering the scene

8616
04:41:45,530 --> 04:41:55,740
M-Ichigo

8617
04:41:45,530 --> 04:41:55,740
M-Ichigo

8618
04:41:47,740 --> 04:41:53,140
Note: M-Ichigo is a monster that originally appears in Ultraman. He's also appeared in EDF batsu and was described as a Hamada lookalike.

8619
04:41:49,870 --> 04:41:51,410
Hello!

8620
04:41:50,210 --> 04:41:52,840
You're so cheery

8621
04:41:51,270 --> 04:41:52,840
Greetings

8622
04:41:54,710 --> 04:41:57,450
It's playing the
sound of my laughter?!

8623
04:41:55,740 --> 04:41:58,350
He's so very cheery

8624
04:41:59,920 --> 04:42:01,380
That's just amazing

8625
04:42:01,720 --> 04:42:03,690
He's so cheery

8626
04:42:02,920 --> 04:42:05,090
This this, I think this is it

8627
04:42:03,820 --> 04:42:07,320
Hamada and Tanaka are in here!!

8628
04:42:04,320 --> 04:42:06,420
Hamada and Tanaka are in here!!

8629
04:42:05,150 --> 04:42:07,460
That was amazing just now

8630
04:42:08,090 --> 04:42:08,360
Oh, there, they're there, th... Huh?

8631
04:42:08,360 --> 04:42:08,760
Oh, there, they're there, th... Huh?

8632
04:42:08,760 --> 04:42:09,220
Oh, there, they're there, th... Huh?

8633
04:42:09,220 --> 04:42:10,960
Oh, there, they're there, th... Huh?

8634
04:42:09,660 --> 04:42:10,160
Help... Please help me!

8635
04:42:10,160 --> 04:42:11,260
Help... Please help me!

8636
04:42:12,090 --> 04:42:13,430
Where's Hamada-san?

8637
04:42:13,860 --> 04:42:14,860
Ha...  Hamada?

8638
04:42:14,860 --> 04:42:17,770
Ha... Hamada?

8639
04:42:15,700 --> 04:42:17,900
Hamada-san, you've gotten a bit smaller

8640
04:42:18,470 --> 04:42:21,600
There's too many Hamadas...

8641
04:42:20,040 --> 04:42:22,340
No no no, that's not right

8642
04:42:23,470 --> 04:42:24,470
Wait...

8643
04:42:27,580 --> 04:42:32,610
Hamada returns with a map with a clue

8644
04:42:28,740 --> 04:42:30,980
We'll release you, we'll release you

8645
04:42:30,150 --> 04:42:30,950
Thanks

8646
04:42:34,580 --> 04:42:36,950
Ow ow ow ow ow...

8647
04:42:34,980 --> 04:42:36,950
Wow, today has just been amazing

8648
04:42:36,950 --> 04:42:39,420
Just now, Nagai went out for Hamada's entrance together with you

8649
04:42:39,420 --> 04:42:41,190
Just now, Nagai went out for Hamada's entrance together with you

8650
04:42:41,720 --> 04:42:42,120
You were in such  a good mood!

8651
04:42:42,120 --> 04:42:45,030
You were in such a good mood!

8652
04:42:43,560 --> 04:42:45,530
Hamada-san... Yes, I heard him

8653
04:42:45,130 --> 04:42:47,430
You guys, that's ridiculous, don't you think?

8654
04:42:47,430 --> 04:42:49,400
It's clear that it wasn't me!!

8655
04:42:49,560 --> 04:42:50,570
Your eyes shine at night occasionally

8656
04:42:50,570 --> 04:42:55,270
Your eyes shine at night occasionally

8657
04:42:52,770 --> 04:42:54,340
You idiot...

8658
04:42:53,440 --> 04:42:55,500
I'm not really sure what that was...

8659
04:42:55,670 --> 04:42:57,210
But really, I'm so glad

8660
04:42:56,740 --> 04:42:58,140
I'm so glad

8661
04:42:57,510 --> 04:42:58,710
So glad!

8662
04:42:57,540 --> 04:42:58,610
With that map, do you know where we have to go last?

8663
04:42:58,610 --> 04:42:59,980
With that map, do you know where we have to go last?

8664
04:42:59,980 --> 04:43:05,480
Grounds

8665
04:42:59,980 --> 04:43:05,480
Map with Clue #2

8666
04:42:59,980 --> 04:43:05,480
Prefabricated Room

8667
04:42:59,980 --> 04:43:05,480
You Are Here

8668
04:43:00,240 --> 04:43:05,480
With all 5 gathered, Fujiwara's rescue is on the way!!

8669
04:43:00,980 --> 04:43:02,010
The 5 of them head to the grounds as indicated on the last map

8670
04:43:02,010 --> 04:43:05,010
The 5 of them head to the grounds as indicated on the last map

8671
04:43:05,980 --> 04:43:09,620
Isn't this insane? How far does it go?

8672
04:43:07,580 --> 04:43:16,860
Escape the thicket of the forest, to the grounds where Fujiwara awaits

8673
04:43:08,120 --> 04:43:11,120
We've come to a big forest; are we going to be okay?

8674
04:43:12,450 --> 04:43:14,220
This is dangerous if we're not careful

8675
04:43:13,790 --> 04:43:15,490
That's so true

8676
04:43:14,260 --> 04:43:16,020
Watch your feet

8677
04:43:15,460 --> 04:43:16,620
So true

8678
04:43:17,160 --> 04:43:18,790
Let's go slowly

8679
04:43:17,160 --> 04:43:20,500
Grounds

8680
04:43:22,030 --> 04:43:23,400
My head hurts...

8681
04:43:23,630 --> 04:43:24,970
Your head hurts?

8682
04:43:25,000 --> 04:43:31,140
Continuing on the path to Fujiwara's location of confinement

8683
04:43:26,970 --> 04:43:28,240
What the hell..? So scary...

8684
04:43:28,240 --> 04:43:29,740
What the hell..? So scary...

8685
04:43:30,210 --> 04:43:31,140
These crosses...

8686
04:43:31,140 --> 04:43:32,910
These crosses...

8687
04:43:31,540 --> 04:43:36,140
On the grounds is a grave

8688
04:43:34,640 --> 04:43:35,840
So long!

8689
04:43:36,880 --> 04:43:39,610
Why do we...

8690
04:43:38,310 --> 04:43:39,610
It's Hiroshi

8691
04:43:39,610 --> 04:43:43,250
We have to save Fujiwara-san

8692
04:43:41,120 --> 04:43:42,480
Are you serious, Hamada?

8693
04:43:43,990 --> 04:43:44,490
There he is!

8694
04:43:44,490 --> 04:43:45,890
There he is!!

8695
04:43:44,790 --> 04:43:45,620
Where?

8696
04:43:45,090 --> 04:43:46,020
Huh, where?

8697
04:43:46,050 --> 04:43:48,220
Oh, you're right

8698
04:43:46,890 --> 04:43:48,320
You're right

8699
04:43:48,220 --> 04:43:49,890
He's been captured

8700
04:43:48,660 --> 04:43:49,890
There he is

8701
04:43:49,890 --> 04:43:52,360
Will you rescue me?!

8702
04:43:51,230 --> 04:43:53,160
Yes, let's rescue him!

8703
04:43:52,360 --> 04:43:54,000
You sure do get captured a lot. You have no sense of danger do you?

8704
04:43:54,000 --> 04:43:57,270
You sure do get captured a lot. You have no sense of danger do you?

8705
04:43:55,460 --> 04:43:57,070
Can't you just do this yourself?

8706
04:43:56,060 --> 04:43:57,830
Tanaka?

8707
04:43:56,660 --> 04:43:58,830
Yes yes, I understand

8708
04:43:58,330 --> 04:43:58,770
I was about to become a sacrifice for the titan!!

8709
04:43:58,770 --> 04:44:01,600
I was about to become a sacrifice for the titan!!

8710
04:44:00,200 --> 04:44:01,140
Titan?

8711
04:44:00,640 --> 04:44:01,800
A sacrifice?

8712
04:44:00,640 --> 04:44:01,800
What the hell is that?

8713
04:44:02,640 --> 04:44:03,070
It's clearly justvelcro

8714
04:44:03,070 --> 04:44:05,540
It's clearly just velcro

8715
04:44:03,470 --> 04:44:04,210
Finally...

8716
04:44:04,540 --> 04:44:06,140
Hey, what's this?

8717
04:44:05,740 --> 04:44:07,210
What the hell is wrong?

8718
04:44:06,780 --> 04:44:08,340
What's wrong with your leg?

8719
04:44:06,810 --> 04:44:09,810
My leg won't move

8720
04:44:08,480 --> 04:44:09,810
Could you put me in this?

8721
04:44:09,710 --> 04:44:12,110
No way, we can't do that

8722
04:44:09,810 --> 04:44:15,020
Fujiwara's leg is injured; escape by a hand-pushed cart

8723
04:44:11,010 --> 04:44:14,550
This has nothing to do with it

8724
04:44:11,080 --> 04:44:12,950
Here, hold this yourself

8725
04:44:14,550 --> 04:44:15,850
Sorry about this

8726
04:44:15,920 --> 04:44:18,850
You're going to be a live sacrifice for the titan?

8727
04:44:17,590 --> 04:44:18,790
Everyone hurry, we have to go

8728
04:44:18,390 --> 04:44:19,320
Let's go then?

8729
04:44:19,190 --> 04:44:21,660
As if I'd let you leave! Go!!

8730
04:44:21,660 --> 04:44:23,930
As if I'd let you leave! Go!!

8731
04:44:23,930 --> 04:44:25,630
I'm going to become the titan's live sacrifice!!

8732
04:44:25,590 --> 04:44:27,600
You're fine, you're fine

8733
04:44:25,760 --> 04:44:31,330
Time until
secret prank

8734
04:44:25,760 --> 04:44:31,330
seconds

It's muddy

8753
04:44:53,420 --> 04:44:54,990
You're so damn heavy!!

What the hell?

8840
04:47:15,800 --> 04:47:19,270
You want to live together with her?

8841
04:47:17,900 --> 04:47:19,800

8847
04:47:26,740 --> 04:47:28,410
That was something

8848
04:47:28,410 --> 04:47:29,810
What the hell is he saying?

8849
04:47:29,410 --> 04:47:31,210
Living together... That's crazy

8850
04:47:29,580 --> 04:47:32,380
He says that nonsense for the last line...

8851
04:47:35,620 --> 04:47:37,750
He said "living together is my desire"...

8852
04:47:37,920 --> 04:47:38,690
Everyone, if you pass that gate, it'll be the end!!

It's finally over

8871
04:47:55,600 --> 04:47:56,800
I'm second

8872
04:47:57,540 --> 04:48:00,640
You sure got hit

8873
04:47:58,910 --> 04:48:00,580
That's quite the difference

8874
04:48:01,140 --> 04:48:05,980
Note: This song debuted in 2001 and topped the Japanese Oricon charts as their second biggest hit. Guitarist Ito has appeared in many batsu games as well.

8875
04:48:05,650 --> 04:48:07,350
This is the first time that it's a female

8876
04:48:07,650 --> 04:48:09,350
Ah, it's Ito. Normally...

8877
04:48:08,850 --> 04:48:10,690
Finally, he makes a
normal appearance

8878

Guitarist: Ito Ichiro

8879
04:48:10,490 --> 04:48:11,550
Right?

8880
04:48:10,690 --> 04:48:12,790
He looks normal here

8881
04:48:10,690 --> 04:48:12,790
This is his normal primary occupation

8882
04:48:12,490 --> 04:48:14,960
Vocals: Mochida Kaori

8883
04:48:14,960 --> 04:48:20,700
As always, just simply

8884
04:48:17,890 --> 04:48:20,530
This is a song from a very long time ago!

8885
04:48:18,030 --> 04:48:20,700
As always, just simply

8886
04:48:19,560 --> 04:48:21,000
So true

8887
04:48:20,700 --> 04:48:26,430
For a cause without flair

8888
04:48:20,730 --> 04:48:22,660
Ah right, Nakai appeared here

8889
04:48:22,860 --> 04:48:26,430
For a cause without flair

8890
04:48:24,270 --> 04:48:26,430
For a cause without flair

8891
04:48:26,430 --> 04:48:32,210
Spent money to call Nakai

8892
04:48:29,400 --> 04:48:32,210
Spent money to call Nakai

8893
04:48:32,210 --> 04:48:37,910
Budget getting drained, it's so agonizing

8894
04:48:34,380 --> 04:48:37,910
Budget getting drained, it's so agonizing

8895
04:48:35,780 --> 04:48:37,910
Budget getting drained, it's so agonizing

8896
04:48:37,910 --> 04:48:43,520
The live singing was so awkward

8897
04:48:40,250 --> 04:48:43,520
The live singing was so awkward

8898
04:48:43,520 --> 04:48:49,260
Kissing so many times

8899
04:48:49,260 --> 04:48:54,900
Horikita, reading your heart

8900
04:48:52,130 --> 04:48:54,900
Horikita, reading your heart

8901
04:48:54,900 --> 04:49:03,340
This feeling is so miserable

8902
04:48:57,330 --> 04:49:03,340
This feeling is so miserable

8903
04:49:03,340 --> 04:49:09,140
Being "repulsive" is not something I recall

8904
04:49:06,610 --> 04:49:09,140
Being "repulsive" is not something I recall

8905
04:49:09,140 --> 04:49:14,820
Your forehead is the target for the monkey's punch

8906
04:49:10,750 --> 04:49:14,820
Your forehead is the target for the monkey's punch

8907
04:49:12,050 --> 04:49:14,820
Your forehead is the target for the monkey's punch

8908
04:49:13,780 --> 04:49:14,820
Your forehead is the target for the monkey's punch

8909
04:49:14,820 --> 04:49:20,490
If you're not going to protect my butt

8910
04:49:16,420 --> 04:49:20,490
If you're not going to protect my butt

8911
04:49:17,990 --> 04:49:20,490
If you're not going to protect my butt

8912
04:49:20,490 --> 04:49:26,130
I won't be able to take any more Thai kicks

8913
04:49:21,160 --> 04:49:22,020
So pointless

8914
04:49:22,120 --> 04:49:26,130
I won't be able to take any more Thai kicks

8915
04:49:24,230 --> 04:49:26,130
I won't be able to take any more Thai kicks

8916
04:49:26,130 --> 04:49:31,970
Even if you desperately try to change, all the faces are the same

8917
04:49:27,900 --> 04:49:31,970
Even if you desperately try to change, all the faces are the same

8918
04:49:29,500 --> 04:49:31,970
Even if you desperately try to change, all the faces are the same

8919
04:49:31,970 --> 04:49:37,710
Although a hurt Junior is there too

8920
04:49:33,530 --> 04:49:37,710
Although a hurt Junior is there too

8921
04:49:35,100 --> 04:49:37,710
Although a hurt Junior is there too

8922
04:49:37,710 --> 04:49:43,440
"I want to try it at least once" is what Yagira said

8923
04:49:39,370 --> 04:49:43,440
"I want to try it at least once" is what Yagira said

8924
04:49:40,780 --> 04:49:43,440
"I want to try it at least once" is what Yagira said

8925
04:49:43,440 --> 04:49:52,390
Connected by punishments unknown

8926
04:49:45,050 --> 04:49:46,410
So scary

8927
04:49:45,410 --> 04:49:52,390
Connected by punishments unknown

8928
04:49:47,180 --> 04:49:52,390
Connected by punishments unknown

8929
04:50:06,730 --> 04:50:12,010
With all their strength

8930
04:50:09,470 --> 04:50:12,010
standing on their toes

8931
04:50:12,370 --> 04:50:18,250
Disguised

8932
04:50:14,540 --> 04:50:18,250
as hosts

8933
04:50:18,250 --> 04:50:23,890
Plain Clothes

8934
04:50:21,080 --> 04:50:23,890
with no fashion sense

8935
04:50:23,890 --> 04:50:29,590
Umemiya

8936
04:50:26,020 --> 04:50:29,590
staggered around

8937
04:50:29,590 --> 04:50:35,330
A terrible

8938
04:50:31,830 --> 04:50:35,330
Furuhata impression

8939
04:50:35,330 --> 04:50:40,940
Attack the 5 of them

8940
04:50:40,940 --> 04:50:46,540
From Laughter

8941
04:50:43,700 --> 04:50:46,540
it becomes insistent

8942
04:50:46,540 --> 04:50:55,020
Being forced to see this bad drama

8943
04:50:55,080 --> 04:51:00,860
It all started

8944
04:50:58,250 --> 04:51:00,860
from a costume change

8945
04:51:00,860 --> 04:51:06,530
There was also

8946
04:51:03,890 --> 04:51:06,530
some painful asses but

8947
04:51:06,530 --> 04:51:12,200
Believe in the young ones

8948
04:51:09,800 --> 04:51:12,200
and you'll be exposed, Kiyoshi

8949
04:51:12,200 --> 04:51:21,380
In order to not be destroyed

8950
04:51:15,900 --> 04:51:21,380
They'll want to watch their backs

8951
04:51:36,660 --> 04:51:42,260
They pushed their bodies

8952
04:51:39,860 --> 04:51:42,260
as far as this

8953
04:51:42,260 --> 04:51:48,100
Even if they run away from the oxygen

8954
04:51:45,300 --> 04:51:48,100
It's a lot of fun

8955
04:51:48,100 --> 04:51:53,770
Even though Hamada was caught

8956
04:51:51,370 --> 04:51:53,770
someone was overjoyed

8957
04:51:53,770 --> 04:51:59,410
You can't escape

8958
04:51:57,350 --> 04:51:59,410
from the promised slap

8959
04:51:59,410 --> 04:52:05,150
All of this

8960
04:52:02,680 --> 04:52:05,150
started 10 years ago

8961
04:52:05,150 --> 04:52:10,930
There are days

8962
04:52:08,320 --> 04:52:10,930
filled with pain too but

8963
04:52:10,930 --> 04:52:16,630
Let's all grab

8964
04:52:14,230 --> 04:52:16,630
the things we think are painful

8965
04:52:16,630 --> 04:52:25,970
And move towards another fun tomorrow!

8966
04:52:27,940 --> 04:52:30,550
"Let's take a picture"

8967
04:52:28,780 --> 04:52:30,510
"Take a picture"

8968
04:52:30,510 --> 04:52:37,220
filled with laughter once more....

8969
04:52:30,510 --> 04:52:37,220
Let's make this year

8970
04:52:39,820 --> 04:52:40,790
Thank you very much.

8971
04:52:41,220 --> 04:52:42,790
We've already crossed into the new year.

8972
04:52:42,420 --> 04:52:43,060
Oh!

8973
04:52:43,090 --> 04:52:46,960
Happy new year!

8974
04:52:43,860 --> 04:52:45,160
Happy new year!

8975
04:52:45,760 --> 04:52:47,030
Happy new year!

8976
04:52:49,000 --> 04:52:52,370
What did you guys think?  Did you think they might actually go with Hamada?

8977
04:52:52,000 --> 04:52:54,070
I really did.

8978
04:52:52,230 --> 04:52:53,400
I did.

8979
04:52:53,000 --> 04:52:54,070
Me too;

8980
04:52:54,240 --> 04:52:58,310
I kept thinking, "No way, no way," but it felt like they really were going to do it.

8981
04:52:57,040 --> 04:52:58,270
I thought they would do it.

8982
04:52:58,410 --> 04:53:00,810
Watching that and seeing your joy—what the hell?

8983
04:53:01,080 --> 04:53:02,140
We'll keep that footage, I think.

8984
04:53:02,310 --> 04:53:03,280
That was crazy.

8985
04:53:03,440 --> 04:53:04,880
Even in this new year, that won't be forgotten.

8986
04:53:03,980 --> 04:53:05,380
That was crazy.

8987
04:53:05,110 --> 04:53:07,750
Even in this Year of the Monkey, that will have an effect.

8988
04:53:06,380 --> 04:53:07,420
He was going like this the whole time.

8989
04:53:07,280 --> 04:53:09,080
I wasn't feeling joy at all.

8990
04:53:09,320 --> 04:53:11,820
"Why would you do that to Hamada!?" I was thinking.

8991
04:53:09,420 --> 04:53:10,290
That was crazy.

8992
04:53:11,620 --> 04:53:13,760
No way.  How in the...?

8993
04:53:13,990 --> 04:53:15,760
You were slapping the ground at the end.

8994
04:53:16,190 --> 04:53:19,960
"Stop it!  Stop it!  Get your hands off of Hamada!" is what I meant.

8995
04:53:16,420 --> 04:53:17,960
You were going like this.

8996
04:53:20,200 --> 04:53:24,100
On the infrared camera, you look like Sakai Masaaki.

8997
04:53:24,930 --> 04:53:25,800
What in the world?

8998
04:53:26,270 --> 04:53:27,700
Why didn't you say it at that part?

8999
04:53:27,370 --> 04:53:29,070
I thought it might be getting in the way if I said it there.

9000
04:53:30,540 --> 04:53:31,670
It's getting in the way saying it now, too, though.

9001
04:53:31,710 --> 04:53:32,670
No, no.

9002
04:53:33,940 --> 04:53:38,980
And so, to everyone, please continue to watch Gaki No Tsukai in the year 2016.

9003
04:53:46,490 --> 04:53:52,290
This is a work of fiction

9004
04:53:46,490 --> 04:53:52,290
and all organization names that appear in it are fictional.
