1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,620
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende:

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,470
Bamiyan Marathon - 100,000 Yen Prize

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,110
Tokyo 23 Ward Challenge!

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,520
A series Hamada-san really hates

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,410
He seems to be in a bad mood already

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,410
That's not true, why would I hate this

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,680
Well last time, it ended because of Hamada-san

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,340
In the end it's always his fault

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,740
I ended it just in time didn't I?

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,420
I knew you guys couldn't eat any more

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,330
So I ended there on purpose

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,750
No no

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,840
If you guys clear all the stores, you can win the prize,

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,900
So this time to help us- What was your name again?

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,460
It's Fujiwara! You're kidding right?

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,080
What was your duo's name again?

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,080
LISCENCE! We're starting with that?

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,580
I'm amazed you're letting me take part

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,860
Established in 1984,

20
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,380
With 333 stores across the country,

21
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,180
Bamiyan, the Chinese Family Restaurant

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:12,420
The rule; From a menu of 59, they choose 2 dishes at random to finish at each store

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,680
Starting with Himonya,  they aim to clear 51 stores accross Tokyo's 23 wards

24
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,910
So with 2 dishes per store, after 30 stores,

25
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,020
You'll have eaten every dish here

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,710
Yeah that's true

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,060
But since this is about clearing all the stores,

28
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,550
The rest is for part 2 next week

29
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,580
That makes no sense!!

30
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,660
So in the first part, we try everything?

31
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,360
Then there's a part 2

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,540
That makes no sense. If we eat everything it should end.

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,580
All you do is complain

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,580
Let's be more optimistic

35
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,940
If they can clear 51 stores, there's a prize of 100,000yen

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:03,160
However, if anyone gives up the challenge ends. The one who gives up has to pay for everything the group ate.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,720
First off, the choose the menu for Store #1 Himonya

38
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,520
Red Mabo Tofu with homemade Chili Oil & Sichuan Pepper

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,820
The second dish,

40
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,560
And the second dish,

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,060
Oh yeah, I like this, it's a good one I think

42
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,250
"Bamiyan Ramen" - The signature

43
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,750
Eat this one please, since it's their specialty

44
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,280
They use cards to decide who takes a break

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,500
Who will be the first person to rest?

46
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,760
Oh, Tanaka-san!

47
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,380
You take a lot of breaks don't you?

48
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,380
You take a looot of breaks

49
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,730
Thank you very much!

50
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,800
Tanaka gets to choose something from the side menu

51
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,840
I'll have....oolong tea.

52
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,560
There it is.

53
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,560
A very Tanaka thing to say.

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,640
There it is, Tanaka's Oolong tea

55
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,060
The first store, Himonya

56
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,700
They head straight to their table

57
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,040
I have an improvement I want to suggest,

58
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,030
Why do we gotta wear overalls?

59
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,770
You're making us a lot right? It makes me really want a shit sometimes,

60
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,730
But overalls, and pooping,

61
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,700
It's like oil and water right?

62
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,700
Yeah that's not good. They should give you jerseys

63
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,120
At least the top and bottom are separate

64
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,570
That other thing is good too,

65
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,210
The thing babies wear

66
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,210
A romper?

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,220
Would you really want to wear a romper at this age?

68
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,690
I'll wear a diaper with it

69
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,480
And the bib as well

70
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,040
I think our objective has changed

71
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,760
Here's the bamiyan ramen.

72
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,100
This is our Mabo Tofu with homemade chili oil

73
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,380
Sprinkle this on as you'd like

74
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,060
How many people is this for?

75
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,350
This is for 5 people

76
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,160
This is gonna be so easy

77
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:21,040
The soup, noodles, char siu, and even the toppings are all carefully selected for this most popular dish, Bamiyan Ramen

78
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:30,040
And notable for it's aroma, red Mabo Tofu with homemade Chili Oil & Sichuan Pepper

79
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,040
It's gonna be more dishes like this

80
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,760
Bon appetit!

81
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,110
How does it taste Matsumoto-san?

82
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,110
It's simply delicious

83
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,560
-Tasty!

84
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,420
Easy to slurp down

85
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,640
This Mabo Tofu is the real thing

86
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,160
I can dig into this

87
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,620
Very fast indeed

88
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,900
Piece of cake

89
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,740
Yeah for the first one, we're usually fine

90
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,540
This is seriously tasty!

91
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,540
I think we can do this

92
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,940
Is it easy? You guys ate that up

93
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,360
We licked it up

94
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,490
We licked it up

95
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,020
Could you decide the menu please?

96
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,560
Are you done Hamada-san?

97
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,880
Listen to him

98
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,420
I thought after eating this,

99
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,140
It's liggable

100
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,840
Licka-miyan

101
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,200
It's not Ba-miyan

102
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,360
It ain't Bamiyan

103
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,700
It's Licka-miyan

104
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,300
"Crunchy and juicy - specialty Oroshi Ponzu Fried Chicken"

105
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,520
Please discuss amongst yourselves

106
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,000
And the second one?

107
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
Oh!

108
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,380
4 of them? (Shoronpo)  (also called Xiaolongbao)

109
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,760
Which means, we might have 2 people rest

110
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,040
What do you mean? 2 of us can take a break?

111
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,580
(Crosstalk - Agreeing)

112
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,720
And so, it was decided 2 people will rest

113
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,600
The two people resting, ready steady boom

114
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,760
Endo-san and Hamada-san

115
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,770
You're disappointed?

116
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,600
I did want to eat

117
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:28,400
Hamada and Endo's choices are fried chicken with potatoes and oolong tea.

118
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,380
After paying, they head to the second store at Shimokitazawa South

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,880
I wonder what Bamiyan means

120
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,780
It's definitely a Chinese word

121
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,820
Could we a get a hint

122
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,570
We're all doing a quiz you see

123
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,480
We're having a blast you see

124
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,580
Is there a meaning? Really?

125
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,610
There is, there is a meaning

126
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,480
It's probably Chinese right?

127
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,020
It's not

128
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,720
The store is named after something that exists

129
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,940
Ah, I got it

130
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,440
I got it, since I got it I'll stop now

131
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,250
You get it so much you don't even need to hear the answer right?

132
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,700
Shall I tease it out?

133
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,420
"Alrighty"

134
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,420
TN: Not sure I got this part right

135
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,640
Don't say "alrighty" asshole

136
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,960
You're trying so hard to be an Idol. What the hell is "Alrighty"

137
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,660
So disguting

138
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,500
It's the name of a peach right?

139
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,640
There's some peach they call Bamiyan in China right?

140
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,700
Completely incorrect

141
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,730
You should get a batsu game.

142
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,730
Wait, why should I get a batsu game?!

143
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,080
Mandatory

144
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,480
It's the name of an old city on the Silk Road

145
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,480
TN: Also the name of a great Afghan restaurant in the GTA

146
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,480
TN: Bamiyan, capital of Bamiyan province in Afghanistan

147
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:02,800
They wanted to "Bring Chinese food to new worlds", and so named it Bamiyan

148
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,560
Their car approaches Shimokitazawa

149
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,690
The railroad crossing is gone

150
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,690
The Suzunari is gone!

151
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,530
It's there

152
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,650
Thank goodness, I have a lot of memories there

153
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,380
Surely you don't have memories at Suzunari

154
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,010
Ah, it's Nitta-san's house
(DownTown's former manager)

155
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,710
TN: Okamoto is the CEO of Yoshimoto Creative Agency

156
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,710
Yeah him andOkamoto used to live there

157
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,550
President Okamoto used to live there.

158
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,580
Oh wow, I didn't know that

159
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,400
President Okamoto
Right?

160
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,760
President Okamoto used to live there

161
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,330
We got it. There right?

162
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,320
We set off fireworks in his house

163
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,320
On Gaki?

164
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,810
On Gaki

165
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,920
Oh yeah we did!

166
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,260
We got away with that kind of stuff back then huh?

167
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,260
I don't know if we got away with that

168
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,970
We set fireworks off inside his house

169
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:16,060
After a 20 minute drive, they arrive at Shimokitazawa South

170
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,420
At this store they will dig into;

171
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,700
Shoronpo, which overflows with meat juices from the pork inside,

172
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,960
And the crunchy & juicy speciality Oroshi Ponzu fried chicken,

173
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,600
This is Tanaka-san's first dish right?

174
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,600
Mmmm...it's delicious!

175
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,460
Very satisfying

176
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,840
The second store is cleared in a flash!

177
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,460
It's not Bamiyan

178
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,460
It's not Bamiyan

179
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,110
It's Licka-miyan

180
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,080
So for the 3rd store,

181
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,540
"Tanmen with Plenty of Vegetables"

182
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,890
Oh, very nice

183
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,520
A rice dish would be nice

184
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,580
And then,

185
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,760
Tofu Bon Bon Chicken Salad

186
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,180
I think this is a good balance

187
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,180
Yes, yes the balance is good

188
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,780
Hosei gets to rest, and decided on Anindofu (Apricot Kernel Tofu dessert)

189
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,860
The head for the 3rd store, in Setagaya's Kamisoshigaya district

190
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,850
Endo, sing us a song for Bamiyan

191
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,850
A song for Bamiyan?

192
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,720
There isn't one that exists right?

193
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,250
I think there's one inside you Endo

194
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,700
I think from time to time you can surprise us

195
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,070
I hope I don't disappoint,

196
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,070
Here I go...

197
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,640
Bamiyan starts with B

198
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,630
Totally delicious-

199
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,970
Isn't this too long?

200
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,000
You're doing it like that?

201
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,510
You're making up a new song?

202
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,980
This guy wants to sing it the whole time we're in the store

203
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,820
Do something they'd use in a commercial

204
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,150
Ah I see like a jingle, Ah I see that's what you mean

205
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,450
So like a CM?

206
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,450
Here it is.

207
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,300
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.......miyan!

208
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,900
I hate that

209
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,830
I just hate it for some reason

210
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,980
Bamiyan Food Marathon - The aim to clear store #3, Kamisoshigaya

211
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:02,800
Endo, around this area...

212
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,800
Oh yeah, Hosei-san visted me often around Umegaoka

213
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,150
I was soon after I came to Tokyo, right?

214
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,360
Your girlfriend lived with you too right?

215
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,050
Yes yes, when I came to Tokyo, the very first time

216
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,840
The girl you brought to Gaki?

217
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,240
Oh not her

218
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,510
Earlier than her

219
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,570
At least bring her instead then

220
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,570
You should've told me she was your girlfriend

221
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,740
I thought she was some girl you picked up

222
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,770
It was so awkward

223
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,080
"I'll show her DownTown"

224
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,080
Yeah, "I'll show her DownTown"

225
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,500
And Endo and I hadn't really met before that

226
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,410
That's true, it was basically our first time meeting

227
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,880
And you brought a girl you just picked up

228
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,550
To our "Free Talk" segment

229
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,100
What would you think?

230
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,360
Just "Ohhhh I see"

231
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,200
Cause I don't know if she's gonna become your wife or something

232
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,500
I can't really say anything

233
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,510
I can just go "Ahhh Ok"

234
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah I'll never forget I did that

235
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,720
Yeah that's something you never forget

236
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,720
I'll remember that forever

237
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,680
I can't undo that

238
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,700
And that woman didn't even laugh that much

239
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,490
And Tanaka being Tanaka, the first time he met Matsumoto-san

240
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,840
In the Taxi outside Tokyo Station

241
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,260
He got in and sat next to the driver, and didn't speak a single word

242
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,830
I thought he was an exchange student at first

243
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:30,940
The taxi driver's exchange student

244
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,160
"Maybe he's learning the streets"

245
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,880
I think I introduced him - "This is my junior Tanaka"

246
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,490
And Tanaka didn't react at all

247
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,490
He didn't react at all

248
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,450
I remember being very nervous, incredibly nervous I remember

249
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,540
Did we get food too?

250
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,570
A Chinese place, around Shibuya if I recall

251
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,570
I don't remember at all

252
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,720
When you say Chinese, it's gotta be Bamiyan, right Endo?

253
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,710
Ba-ba-ba-baaaaaa.....miyan!

254
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,240
The 3rds store, Setagaya's Kamisoshigaya location

255
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,740
At this store; The Tanmen with Plenty of Vegetables,

256
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,160
And notable for its dressing,

257
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,400
the Tofu Bon Bon Chicken Salad

258
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,280
Fujiwara and Tanaka are in charge of distributing the dish

259
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,820
Tanaka's good at this. He muight be really good at this.

260
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,600
It's 300g right?

261
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,460
Wow that's kind of amazing!

262
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,340
Tanaka is amazing!

263
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,920
Ah, well that's still pretty good

264
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,420
Here's the last one.

265
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,560
Tanaka's amazing

266
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,520
The one that's a little too heavy is Hamada's

267
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,550
It felt good though didn't it?

268
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,260
Let's eat.

269
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,540
This is good.

270
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,240
The salad is great too

271
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,440
I'm going along at a good pace

272
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,170
The distribution was good

273
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,940
No problems at all

274
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,580
So you would say it's easy?

275
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,660
Still finding it easy

276
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,520
The menu for the 4th store?

277
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,780
(Note: Also known as "twice-cooked pork.")

278
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,780
Hoikoro.

279
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,240
Another non-rice dish?

280
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,860
That's true

281
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,680
"Miso Ramen with Plenty of Vegetables"

282
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,080
We need a rice dish soon

283
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,600
Hosei gets to rest again.

284
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,660
He decided on Honey Fried Bread with Vanilla Ice Cream

285
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,800
#4, the Suginami Miyamae store

286
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,580
This is the Miso Ramen with Plenty of Vegetables

287
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,980
And the Hoikoro

288
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,420
Tanaka is once again in charge of the distribution

289
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
300, around 300g

290
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,320
Oh I didn't see inside

291
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,600
Tanaka is unwavering

292
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,880
Amazing!

293
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,820
Are you for real?!

294
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,460
This one is a bit on the heavy side

295
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,930
It was about 10g over

296
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,610
This is good hoikorou.\

297
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,900
This is our 3rd noodle dish

298
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,080
Noodles? Oh yeah it is

299
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,720
We've eaten 1 bowl of ramen by now

300
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,320
Ah yes, you might well have

301
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,200
Finished! Time for the next menu please

302
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,520
Another noodle dish

303
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,520
Gomoku

304
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,020
It's just noodles

305
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,300
This will be the 4th ramen dish of the day

306
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,580
And the other dish was Meat Shumai

307
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,800
And the one who rests?

308
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,320
The third in a row!

309
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,140
You guys fixed this again

310
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,060
I'm hungry too you know

311
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,720
With an unexpected 3rd rest, Hosei decides on Shine Muscat

312
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,220
With the 4th store, 8/59 of the dishes are cleared

313
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,950
How are your stomachs doing? Next is the 5th store

314
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,300
I think it's just right

315
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,480
It feels just right, like I finished eating dinner

316
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,730
How about you Hamada-san?

317
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,920
I'd say the same, I'm ready to pay the bill

318
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,480
Ready to pay the bill?

319
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,370
There's still,

320
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:13,210
46 stores left ... desu

321
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:13,040
TN: Inomoto was slow with the "desu"; omitting it would be rude when addressing a senior

322
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,190
That's no way to talk to us

323
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,440
I'm saying there's still a lot left

324
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,240
Bamiyan Marathon - #5 is Kamishakuji

325
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,060
At this store they'll enjoy;

326
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,480
Gomoku noodles, with lots of toppings and vegetables

327
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,640
And notable for it's juiciness, Meat Shumai

328
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,510
This is tasty.

329
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,510
Way good.

330
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,680
These noodles are firmer than the ones we've had today

331
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,200
They finish quickly, and choose the menu for the 6th store

332
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,460
They want a rice dish now, however...

333
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,900
Grilled Albacore Tuna with Hoisin (?) sauce

334
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,900
What is that?

335
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,940
That's true, a rice dish would be nice

336
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,400
Ajitama Ramen!

337
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
More noodles!

338
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,660
Give us Chahan at least once

339
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:31,380
I won't eat Chahan in the second half

340
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,380
This Albacore Tuna is pretty good I hear

341
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,120
And Fujiwara will be the one to rest

342
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,900
So just Matsumoto-san left

343
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,320
No breaks

344
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,320
I've been eating noodles this whole time

345
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,880
Fujiwara decided on a Taiwanese dessert, Lemon Ogyichi

346
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,940
They head for the 6th store

347
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,680
I'm kind of starting to get pissed off

348
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,640
Too many noodles?

349
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,260
Noodles....noodles...noodles...it's just...

350
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,220
Some of us don't like noodles

351
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,040
You know I never picked noodles out of the box

352
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,540
Actually you drew the Bamiyan Ramen

353
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,260
He did do that

354
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:29,020
We can just edit that!

355
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,020
"I'm amazing, we can eat ramen now!"

356
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:34,840
We always decide on editing after our talk

357
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,640
Bamiyan Marthon - The 6th store is the Nerima-kasugacho location

358
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,300
My body feels a little heavy

359
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,740
It feels like I'm forcing this

360
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,940
At this store, the 5th ramen dish of the day
Ajitama Ramen, and,

361
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,420
Grilled Albacore Tuna with Hoisin sauce

362
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,880
The taste has changed a bit?

363
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,030
So little!

364
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,030
That's so little

365
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,940
What are you doing?

366
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,550
It just so happens the distribution turned out like this

367
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,000
But you were spot on before

368
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,570
It's difficult to do it with Ajitama

369
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,440
Let's give Tanaka some noodles

370
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,440
Alright, I'll take some noodles

371
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,430
You have too few noodles, everyone give him a bit

372
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,860
Here you go

373
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,250
Wait a minute, hold on...

374
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,750
This is enough for 2 people!

375
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,640
No no that's a fair amount

376
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,640
The Ajitama is pretty good

377
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,850
Everyone seems to be slurping it up

378
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,640
Except Tanaka-san

379
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,960
Alright, leave this to me

380
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,960
Yes, please

381
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,980
Can we decide who rests first?

382
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,710
If I get to rest, well that'll use up my luck

383
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,650
Let these bastards eat noodles

384
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,000
It's Fujiwara.

385
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Again?

386
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,420
Well this can happen, like with Hosei-san

387
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,420
Fujiwara gets it in a row

388
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,900
We should just take turns resting

389
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,840
Next week...

390
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,440
Bamiyan Marathon Finale

391
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,440
Matsumoto still didn't get to rest

392
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,700
And the challenge;

393
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,360
4 dishes at once!

394
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,980
How will their luck turn out?
