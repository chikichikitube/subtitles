1
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:38,920
"The points so far."

2
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,410
You just don't know Kitamura-san...

3
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,080
-You're angry.
-I'm not angry.

4
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,040
-It's in here.
-It's coming out.

5
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,210
You lowered your guard!

6
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,110
And the winner is...

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The final 34-minute attack.

8
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,030
Here we go!

9
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,730
The meat looks delicious.

10
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,230
It was really good.

11
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,270
Okay, can I take a moment, then?

12
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,970
What's with these sunglasses?

13
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,990
I'm Toshi-chan!

14
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,290
I'm Toshi-chan!

15
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,790
I'm Toshi-chan!

16
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,960
I'm Toshi-chan!

17
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,400
Enomoto!

18
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,500
Enomoto!

19
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,240
Jungle jungle jungle!

20
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,800
Jungle jungle jungle!

21
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,470
Toshi-chan jungle!

22
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,010
Toshi-chan jungle jungle jungle!

23
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,910
Toshi-chan jungle!

24
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,510
Toshi-chan jungle jungle jungle!

25
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,180
Toshi-chan in jungle!

26
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,890
Jungle Toshi-chan!

27
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,250
Toshi-chan in jungle!

28
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,760
Jungle Toshi-chan!

29
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,230
Toshi-chan.

30
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,300
Toshi-chan.

31
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,270
Toshi-chan...

32
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,830
Toshi-chan...

33
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,900
Toshi-chan...

34
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,410
Hey!

35
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,350
What was with that time lag?

36
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,820
It just happens sometimes.

37
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,150
—Come on!
—That was funny.

38
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,650
It's impossible.

39
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,050
—Pretty much, huh?
—He's cheating!

40
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,990
That was my two-sword style.

41
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,620
I might've held it with just one.

42
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,930
Let's take a look.

43
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,160
Toshi-chan...

44
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,430
Toshi-chan...

45
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,200
Toshi-chan...

46
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,830
Toshi-chan...

47
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Toshi-chan...

48
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,270
Come on, Miyazako!

49
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,440
You're not out yet, but you get an orange!

50
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,980
You're slowly piling them up.

51
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,150
Your points...

52
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,880
And time's almost...

53
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,490
The end's getting near.

54
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,120
Yeah.

55
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,090
Zakoshi's doing everyone in.

56
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,860
Can you sit here?

57
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,930
I guess I have to go then.

58
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,130
If only we could get rid of Zakoshi.

60
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,300
I just have to sit here?
It hasn't started yet, right?

61
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,540
—It hasn't.
—Here we go.

62
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,580
It has a switch right there.

63
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,040
Hello!

64
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,350
Hello!

65
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,350
I'm Katou-tii!

66
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,920
I'm Katou-tii!

67
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,020
You see, Katou-tii was just...

68
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,520
You see, Katou-tii was just...

69
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,960
...called a demon!

70
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,130
Intense!

71
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,670
Don't worry about the little things!

72
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,410
This is pure chaos.

73
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,910
What should I say?

74
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,350
—I'm Katou-tii.
—Katou-tii, right?

75
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,190
"The results are...!!", "The results are...!!"

76
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,120
"The results are...!!", "The results are...!!"

77
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,800
"The results are...!!"

78
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,330
"The results are...!!"

79
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,070
"The results are...!!"

80
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,300
"The results are...!!"

81
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,810
"The results are...!!"

82
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,480
Someone's here.

83
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,950
"The results are...!!"

84
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,990
That was close.

85
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,630
Who are you?

86
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,440
—Tokyo!
—Tokyo! (Editor's Note: Announcer at the IOC who announced that Tokyo will host 2020 Olympics)

87
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,740
So he was that kind of person...

88
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,680
—Tokyo!
—Tokyo!

89
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,920
—Tokyo!
—Tokyo!

90
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,830
I almost died.

91
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,730
I almost died.

92
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:43,970
Wait...

93
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,430
Everyone's gone.

94
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,340
It's kind of chilly here, huh?

95
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,880
What is that?

96
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,910
You know I wanted to become a boxer, right?

97
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,980
Yeah.

98
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,220
Because I'm pretty confident in my reflexes.

99
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Yeah, yeah.

100
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,950
Try throwing those from a close distance.

101
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,550
—I can throw these at you?
—Yeah, I'll avoid them all.

102
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,820
—Really?
—Sure, it's no problem.

103
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,370
See?

104
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,980
See?

105
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,080
Not a single one hit me.

106
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,350
They didn't, right?

107
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,140
Do you use the mail?

108
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,110
—Yeah, sometimes.
—The mail?

109
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,940
What would you do if you couldn't get rid of this?

110
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,180
When you're having a snack.

111
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,550
Couldn't get rid of it?

112
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,550
You can't get rid of it as in,

113
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,550
you have nowhere to put it in.

114
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,820
What do you do?

115
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,120
Guess I could tuck it between my legs.

116
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,130
That's amazing!

117
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,060
What's with that belt?

118
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,400
I don't really eat stuff like that at this age.

119
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,530
I guess so.

120
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,270
I'm eating one more.
Here I go.

121
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,840
So what do you do when you can't get rid of this?

122
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,680
I can't think of that scenario, though.

123
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,010
You bastard.

124
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,250
That looks like it's gonna fall for sure.

125
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,390
—It won't.
—Really?

126
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,590
Of course.

127
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,930
You can put it in?

128
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,430
Boy, boy.

129
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Boy.

130
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
Boy.

131
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,010
Zakoshi is a pain in the ass.

132
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,180
I want to eat Shinbashi's oden again.

133
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,580
This is a mess.

134
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,670
Something's here.

135
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,810
This is too much...

136
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,330
That's cruel.

137
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,470
The tiger-step wasn't particularly interesting.

138
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,440
Here we go.

139
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,980
Zombie time!

140
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,430
Five seconds before I fall in love for real!

141
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,860
Here we go!

142
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,470
"I love dogs"

143
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,340
Alright, let's do this!

144
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,940
—That's the other way around.
—It's the other way around.

145
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,710
That looks pretty tight.

146
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,610
Ready?

147
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,410
We can do anything as long as we're happy!

148
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,790
Here we go! One, two, three...

149
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,720
Cha...!

150
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,090
You said you couldn't do that, though.

151
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,730
—Master.
—Master?

152
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,800
There's a master too?

153
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,740
—Who's that?
—What's that?

154
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,540
A sea turtle?

155
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,820
Koyabu!

156
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,220
If you don't laugh with this, you won't laugh with anything!

157
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,660
He's not laughing at all, master.

158
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,290
You shut your mouth!

159
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,860
Koyabu!

160
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,530
The reason you can't make Zakoshi laugh

161
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,300
is because you don't know laughter yourself!

162
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,070
And you want to take down Yoshimoto?

163
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,550
—Listen and take a look.
—Okay.

164
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,480
—You too, Zakoshi-san.
—Okay.

165
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,480
You know Comedy Number One?

166
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,620
Yeah, I do, I do.

167
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
Master Sakata.

168
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,350
I wanted to be like you.

169
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,530
Twelve dogs!

170
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,700
That's twelve dogs, sho~!

171
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,320
How do you use this?

172
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,190
How do you use this, Zakoshi-kun?

173
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,560
You turn it on right here.

174
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,630
Here, huh?

175
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,010
Hey!

176
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,680
Hey, that's not the mode I had in mind.

177
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,810
Hey, that's not the mode I had in mind!

178
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,250
Not the mode I had in mind!

179
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,950
Damn it sho!

180
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,320
Damn it sho!

181
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,560
Damn it sho!

182
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,510
And that guy just keeps rubbing his cock, huh?

183
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,450
That's right, Tamuken!

184
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,420
These guys are too difficult.

185
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,360
So that's it, huh?

186
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,150
I've got to admit it's a little funny.

187
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,710
Thirty four dogs!

188
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,110
What's with all those dogs?

189
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,680
What are you counting for all along?

190
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,550
While you're swinging your dick.

191
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,920
I'm sure you smiled earlier.

192
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,620
I didn't.

193
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,030
Ouch!

194
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,260
It's red already.

195
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,530
It really hurts.

196
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,800
Looks like it's about to come off.

197
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,000
No one's laughing at all.

198
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,670
Maybe someone could've, though.

199
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,640
What's the best gum you've had so far?

200
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,180
Like Quick Quench or something like that?

201
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,010
Isn't Quick Quench that sports thing...?

202
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,450
Yeah, with the lemon.

203
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,180
This is the best gum in the entire world.

204
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,390
So just give it a try.

205
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,890
Two... you can have two of them.
You can take two each.

206
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,430
That's one too much for me.

207
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,360
No one's noticed yet.

208
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,230
—Can I eat this?
—Yeah.

209
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,000
Ah, this is my helper.

210
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,740
He's Koume Dayu from my office.

211
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,110
I think he has some great jokes,

212
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,080
so I'd like you to have a look.

213
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,750
Please go on.
Do the Two Lions Dayu one!

214
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:28,720
Whenever...!

215
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,130
I tried to eat an octopus...!

216
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,530
I got...!

217
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,510
Sprayed with...!

218
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,310
Ink!

219
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,550
Stop it! Stop it!

220
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,520
Stop it! Stop it!

221
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,060
Funny, right?

222
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,370
You do this on stage?

223
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,640
He's super slippery.

224
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,840
I don't know what I should be laughing at.

225
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,370
Okay, just one more time.

226
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,850
Chikuwa goes...!

227
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,160
Chikuwa goes...!

228
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,730
Stop it! Stop it!

229
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,340
Stop it! Stop it!

230
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,210
Funny, right?

231
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,580
So he says "Chikuwa goes brr".

232
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,050
Why does he want the chikuwa to stop?

233
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,250
He wants the chikuwa to stop going brr?

234
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,950
Is it bad at it?

235
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,390
I love chikuwa that goes brr.

236
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,190
Then why do you want it to stop?

237
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,400
Just because, you see.

238
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,860
Just because?

239
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,170
Just because.

240
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,130
Just because.

241
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,240
I guess...

242
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,610
...there's some weird stuff on twitter, too.

243
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,640
So you've been seeing me?

244
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,710
Every day...

245
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,010
Seeing me cursing every day?

246
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,850
You do that one every day?

247
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,120
Cursing every day?

248
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,820
—Do it once, just once.
—Ever- Every- Every day...

249
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,820
Cursing every day?

250
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,590
Just do it with "chan cha"

251
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,970
It's the first time I've seen this live.

252
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:05,350
You thought it looked like a circle,

253
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,720
but it turned out to be a triangle!

254
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,860
Damn it!

255
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,200
I want to see the "do re mi fa" one.

256
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,570
You have that one?

257
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,900
Do re mi fa...
That's right, yeah.

258
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,070
Okay, I got it.

259
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,540
Ah, that's right.

260
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,150
—Why?
—Huh?

261
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,400
Did you say to do the "chan cha" thing? Huh?

262
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,450
Why's it not coming up?

263
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,920
Wait a second. Didn't you say "chan cha"?

264
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,290
Your forgot it?

265
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,090
I do remember the joke, though.

266
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
He's always this slow?

267
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,690
You can start with the "chan cha" part, though.

268
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,530
Let's do that, from the "chan cha" part.

269
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,980
Do... Re... Mi...

270
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,810
Fa... So... La...

271
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,550
Ti... Do...

272
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,190
If you think about that...!

273
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,330
Fa... Fa... Fa... Fa...

274
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:33,640
Fa... Fa... Fa... Fa...

275
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,970
That's how it was!

276
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,770
Ah, damn it!

277
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,580
—What happened?
—What's going on?

278
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,410
Don't lie to us.

279
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,610
I was expecting a full on "Do Re Mi Fa" thing

280
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,150
but it turned out to just be "Fa fa fa fa".

281
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,780
I guess it's time he does the MRI one, then.

282
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,820
He should just do the MRI.

283
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,420
—The MRI?
—Go do the MRI.

284
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,560
What?

285
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,960
He can do that?

286
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,800
—The MRI?
—I guess he can't do it just like that.

287
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,080
I got an MRI.

288
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,750
And after running some tests,

289
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,020
there was only a single thread in my brain.

290
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,050
Ah, damn it!

291
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,760
If he can do that, he can do anything.

292
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,260
That's wrong. You were saying something earlier.

293
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,530
You said you had no brain at all earlier.

294
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,660
I didn't have a brain...?

295
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,630
Do the one with teachers from bad schools.

296
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,840
That one...

297
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,740
This has gone too far.

298
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:57,150
I went to a school...

299
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,290
...with poor records...

300
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,560
...the teachers were chimpanzees.

301
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,760
Damn it!

302
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,130
That has to be a lie!

303
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,070
There's no way they were chimpanzees!

304
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,840
Where's that school?!

305
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,940
Where in Tokyo?!

306
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,410
—Not in Tokyo.
—Where is it?!

307
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,840
Answer me!

308
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,780
—Why... Why?

309
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,980
Tell me!

310
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,580
—Where is it?!
—Where?

311
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,280
—Where's that school?
—It's not real, it's not real.

312
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,050
It's not real.

313
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,790
It's not real?
So it was a lie after all?

314
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,390
It's not real.

315
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,230
—I lied.
—Why did you lie?!

316
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,330
That was the joke...

317
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,500
Hey!

318
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,900
—That's the joke.
—You're an insane bastard!

319
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,100
Come here and touch the tits.
Touch the tits!

320
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,870
—Hurry and touch them!
—What's this?

321
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,370
—Touch them already!
—What's going on?

322
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,710
You can touch them more.

323
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,180
—You can touch them more.
—Wh-What's going on?

324
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,010
The tits.

325
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,210
What do you think? How do they feel?

326
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,020
Koume-san.
Why don't you suck them?

327
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
—Suck them!
—Suck, suck, suck...

328
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,390
Suck them now that you're here.

329
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,620
—Suck?
—Yeah.

330
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,760
I have to suck this? Suck right here?

331
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,860
—Suck the nipples.
—Why do I have to suck this?

332
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,730
They have nipples, so suck them.

333
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,270
—They have nipples.
—What's going on?

334
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,140
—Who was it?
—No way...

335
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,810
—Koyabu?
—He went all the way...

336
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,980
And just when I thought we weren't making any progress.
There he goes.

337
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,050
Because we made him suck them.

338
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,390
It's time for hell now.

339
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,120
He could've just sucked them normally.

340
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,630
"But he kept going all "huh? huh?" and I just laughed.

341
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,800
—Koyabu!
—I guess it can't be helped.

342
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,370
This is an orange!

343
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,600
Damn it.
I never thought I'd laugh.

344
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,810
—I have to suck this?
—Yeah.

345
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,980
How do I suck it? Like this?

346
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,080
—They have nipples.
—Why do I have to suck them?

347
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,950
They have nipples.

348
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,350
—They have nipples.
—What's going on?

349
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,050
That face, though...

350
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,160
It's the first time I've seen someone like this.

351
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,690
There's no more time.

352
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,860
There's really no time.

353
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,660
—Thank you Koume.
—Sure, thank you.

354
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,160
Thank you.

355
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,730
See you tomorrow.

356
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,570
From now on and for the next 15 minutes,

357
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,570
we're gonna have to go free-time.

358
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,070
Here we go.

359
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,470
Hey, what was with that fart?

360
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,180
Zakoshi-san, what was that fart just now?

361
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,310
It was just a fart.

362
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,680
No, it was all... "buuuu".

363
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,210
—It's just a fart.
—You're insane.

364
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,620
Why do you care about it?!

365
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,980
That fart was insane.

366
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,350
It wasn't.

367
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,550
Touch the tits!

368
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,290
-Why do I have to go through your hell...?

369
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,000
-Just do it already. Touch them. Hurry.
-Why do I have to go through your hell...?

370
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,290
-Just do it already. Touch them. Hurry.

371
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,390
Make sure you give them a good touch.

372
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,290
How is it?!

373
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,040
Now touch them from the front. Come on.

374
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,750
I've had enough.

375
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,150
With an ass like his, of course it's going to sound like that.

376
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,590
It flutters around.

377
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,020
It sounds like that.

378
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,260
Touch them.

379
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,130
Why do I have to? Is something going on?

380
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,130
Hurry.

381
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,330
That hurts, that hurts, that hurts!

382
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,530
Ow!

383
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,090
They're not even looking at each other.

384
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,630
It's pretty funny, though.

385
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,530
Double payback.

386
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:11,040
Two hundred million payback.

387
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,270
Just what is that sound?

388
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,410
Two hundred million payback.
It came all the way from the Chuo line in Tokyo.

389
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,780
-Katou was pretty great to the halfway point...
Two hundred million payback.
It came all the way from the Chuo line in Tokyo.

390
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,080
-I'm Hanzawa Naoki.
Payback.

391
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,050
-but the last half has been...
-I'm Hanzawa Naoki.
Payback.

392
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:25,050
...mostly Zakoshi's fault.

393
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,990
Wait, what did you do?

394
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,360
Yeah, what did you do?

395
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,790
What do you mean "what" you bastard?!

396
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,390
You're always like this.

397
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,760
What do you mean "always" you bastard?!

398
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,530
Are you being serious?

399
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,930
Wh-Wh-What are you talking about?

400
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,600
—Say it, Katou!
—Are you being serious?

401
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,170
Wh-What do I have to do if I am?

402
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,300
In that case, try to hit me!

403
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,410
What are you doing?

404
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,640
In that case just take your blade.

405
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,080
If you can do it with this, it'll all be your responsibility.

406
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,040
Okay, come here!

407
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,650
Hey! More!

408
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,420
Hey!

409
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,050
Hey! Hey! Hey!

410
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,060
Hey! Hey! Hey!

411
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,700
Touch the tits.

412
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,300
What are you doing?

413
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,670
—Touch the tits.
—What are you doing?

414
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,070
What's up with that?

415
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,710
What was it, Koyabu-san?
You look like you want to touch some tits.

416
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,070
I've been waiting for a long time,

417
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,840
but what the hell happened to Kitamura-san?

418
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,280
Kitamura-san! I think it's about time we have a call.

419
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:25,780
For real! I forgot about him altogether!
Kitamura-san! I think it's about time we have a call.

420
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,280
For real! I forgot about him altogether!

421
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,420
Just what does he have in mind?

422
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,350
Okay, Kitamura-san.
Just what does he have in mind?

423
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,750
Kitamura-san is definitely going to call us.

424
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,690
How can you tell just by looking at the phone?

425
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,260
How do you know he's gonna call?

426
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,190
I got a Line.

427
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,290
What does it say?

428
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,960
That he's going to give us a call.

429
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,430
-Ah, I guess it's alright if he said so on Line.

430
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,170
-He's going to give us a call?
-Ah, I guess it's alright if he said so on Line.

431
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:45,830
-He's going to give us a call?

432
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,970
This is annoying.

433
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,670
It's all a mess.

434
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,440
You guys know the Konami Code?

435
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,910
Yeah, up, up, down, down...

436
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,110
Yeah, if Sen Masao did that he'd go... (EN: JP Singer)

437
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,350
Up Up! Down Down!

438
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,160
Left right! Left right!

439
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,430
He'd sing that?

440
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,630
Did he say "Down Down"?

441
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,600
Okay, in the NES' golf,

442
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,270
there's a difference between Wood 1 and pitching wedge.

443
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,540
First, Wood 1.

444
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,880
Pitching wedge.

445
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,620
That's the putter.

446
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,300
—OB
—Ah yeah, I know that.

447
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,570
You know it, huh?

448
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,770
Okay, and this is the one from Gargoyle's Quest when you die.

449
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,090
It was like that?

450
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,790
Sure. When Firebrand shows up.

451
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,990
—That's the one that looks like a bat.
—Yeah, exactly.

452
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,030
Can I do Hyokkorihan next? (EN: JP Comedian)

453
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,800
—Hyokkorihan?
—Exaggerated, yeah.

454
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,800
That's good.

455
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,740
So he's going to put on the glasses.

456
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,810
Can he do an exaggerated Hyokkorihan, though?

457
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,180
Here's Hyokkorihan!

458
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,250
Okay, I'm Hyokkorihan.

459
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,430
Here, here, here!
I'm Hyokkorihan!

460
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,360
Hyokkoricock!

461
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,900
Here, here, here!
Hyokkoricock!

462
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:10,140
—We have to do this.
—Almost five minutes to go.

463
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,350
Come on, it's been six hours already...

464
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,050
My feet are starting to skink.

465
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,020
Won't you smell them, Kato-kun?

466
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,150
—They stink?
—Aren't you just saying that?

467
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,160
—They stink?
—They're that bad?

468
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,960
—They're putrid?
—Give them a whiff.

469
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,000
That stinks!

470
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,070
What do they smell like? Do they stink that much?

471
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,910
Feet smell...

472
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,840
They smell so bad?

473
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,480
That stinks!

474
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,020
—That stinks.
—Do it again.

475
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,150
Are you for real?!

476
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,350
I already smelled them.

477
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,460
Are you rotting or something?

478
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,840
I want seconds!

479
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,880
This is hell, this is hell, this is hell.

480
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,480
—I'm feeling sick.

481
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,580
Can you smell them, Zakoshi?

482
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,750
Give them a whiff, Zakoshi.

483
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,530
Na-ka-ta! Nakata!
Na-ka-ta! Nakata!

484
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,890
I'm a perfect human!

485
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,560
This is too much.
I'm a perfect human!

486
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,570
I'm a perfect human!

487
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:50,780
That stinks!

488
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,180
That was hilarious.

489
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,850
—What are you doing?!
—That was too bad!

490
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,020
That was impressive!

491
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,860
This is too much.

492
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,760
—What was that just now?
—Let's see!

493
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,160
You saw it, right? Koyabu, Miyazako!

494
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,270
You're out! We went double this time.

495
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,610
That smelled terrible.

496
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:21,140
For some reason my left one's fine, but the right one stinks too much.

497
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,080
Left is usually stinkier, though...

498
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,350
But if they did that to me...

499
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:27,550
How did you come up with the "perfect human" crap?

500
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:37,490
Na-ka-ta! Nakata!
Na-ka-ta! Nakata!

501
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,930
I'm a perfect human!

502
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,460
This is too much.
I'm a perfect human!

503
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,530
I'm a perfect human!

504
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,400
Yeah, that's way too much.

505
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,670
Yeah, that's way too much.

506
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,370
More than I expected.

507
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,410
He turned a tight spot into an opportunity.

508
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,410
He's truly a role model.
Just having Zakoshi here was a mistake.

509
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,710
Well, we only have 1 minute, 51 seconds.

510
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,550
I never thought both of you would be out so close to the end.

511
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,150
—He's too strong.
—He is!

512
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,990
I lost.

513
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,590
I couldn't do anything I wanted.

514
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,230
Na-ka-ta! Nakata!

515
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:16,430
There's no way we wouldn't laugh at that.

516
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,700
I was always walking a tight rope.

517
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,940
I felt pretty close to laughing at Zakoshi all this time.

518
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,750
I wonder what someone like him has inside his head.

519
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,520
He's regularly a great guy, too.

520
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,250
His methods to make us laugh

521
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,590
were just too much for us, for real.

522
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,730
I was just completely outplayed.

523
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,700
Here we go!

524
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,410
Well, that sure was amazing.

525
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,310
Okay!

526
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,180
Katou...?

527
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,290
Hey, did you just look at me, you asshole?!

528
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,260
—I didn't!
—You fucking did!

529
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,890
I fucking didn't!

530
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,290
Who do you think I am?!

531
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,530
Who the fuck are you?!

532
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,030
You want me to call my boss?

533
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,160
Go ahead, shithead!

534
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,230
Pissing your pants?!

535
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,100
—What the fuck is it?!
—I'm calling him!

536
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:30,770
—Who the fuck?
—My boss!

537
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,770
Boss right back at ya!

538
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,280
Right back at you!

539
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,080
Two-layered return!

540
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,750
Two-pieces of squid?!

541
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,820
Two-pieces of squid?!

542
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:52,330
Right now I'm acting an exaggerated Chidori!
Two-pieces of squid?!

543
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,070
—Hey.
—What?!

544
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,670
—Touch the tits!
—What's your problem?!

545
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,730
Hurry, touch the tits!

546
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,340
These are some good tits!

547
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,100
That's my woman! Touch her tits!

548
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,440
How are they?

549
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,440
Touch them more!

550
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,650
Did you like that? Did you like that?

551
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,520
Two-pieces of squid?!

552
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,230
It's over?

553
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:27,960
It's over.

554
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,500
It's over?

555
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,900
Okay, that's all!

556
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,070
And the winner this time is...

557
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,880
—you!
—I did it!

558
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
Really?!

559
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,480
—It was a perfect victory.
—That was too much.

560
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,080
Thank you very much!

561
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,790
That's Hollywood Zakoshisyou's victory!

562
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,320
I did it!
I'm so happy!

563
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:56,990
Thank you very much!

564
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,100
That was way too funny.

565
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,440
—You destroyed us all.
—All of them.

566
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,940
Even earlier,

567
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,470
I was really struggling, man.

568
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,510
Back there with the dog, right?

569
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,940
That was close, huh?

570
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,010
You really did your best, right?

571
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,540
It just hurt too much and I did it without thinking.

572
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,480
I thought he'd laugh if I kept pulling.

573
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,260
I think I was really on the verge of laughing.

574
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,390
But even if you had laughed,

575
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,290
that would've just been an orange card.

576
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,760
—It was too much.
—Thank you very much!

577
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:37,360
Thank you very much!

578
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,930
He got the 10 million!

579
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,170
Well, to be honest I do feel defeated.

580
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,210
I might've jumped the gun too quickly in the first half.

581
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,980
My tits!

582
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,610
It exploded!

583
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,580
You're angry!

584
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,550
And then there was the time the phone didn't ring.

585
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,290
Kitamura-san isn't calling me at all.

586
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,820
Kitamura-san is coming....

587
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,530
My gags are usually pretty pointless,

588
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,000
so I feel like there are times where I just make them angry.

589
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,540
I'm only seeing equations written here.

590
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,180
That's right.

591
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,580
There's no answer.

592
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,980
So mean.

593
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,050
Who's mean?

594
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,050
I am.

595
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,390
Alright then!

596
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:39,030
Here they are! 10 million!

597
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,960
I guess I could win two back to back after all.

598
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,000
It was really close at times, though. For real.

599
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,830
Sorry for using other people's passports.

600
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,900
I ended up laughing once pretty early on.

601
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,810
But Katou sure was strong!

602
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,240
—What about you Katou?
—No way am I eating that!

603
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,440
Why's he so pissed off?

604
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,080
But he kind of lost steam at the end.

605
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,480
Maybe I pulled off more gags.

606
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,030
—Good job.
—Good job to you too!

607
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,630
This time was insane.

608
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,330
I just laughed to exhaustion I guess.

609
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,340
—Especially Zakoshi.
—Yeah.

610
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,770
I don't know if I should say he met my expectations,

611
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,670
or he actually succeeded them.

612
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,510
It was amazing.

613
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,250
He also managed to turn his struggles into chances,

614
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,520
and to be honest, this may sound a little bad,

615
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,450
but I actually think Katou was insanely funny.

616
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,490
You don't know Kitamura-san, right?

617
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,830
Katou was far superior in the first half.

618
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,960
I actually wondered if that was really Katou.

619
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,860
But the latter half,

620
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:53,100
Zakoshi went around amassing points little by little.

621
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,640
He didn't waste a single moment to the very end.

622
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,040
Two-pieces squid!

623
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,580
He was incredible.
