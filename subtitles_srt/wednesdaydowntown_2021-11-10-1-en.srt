00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,550
This is Suiyoubi no Downtown.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,790
Bakarhythm

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,790

00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,590
(All) Hello!

9
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,660
Our first presenter

10
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,660
will come out now.

11
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,000
Presenter
Jinnai Tomonori

12
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,900
It's Jinnai Tomonori-san!

13
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,170
So everyone,

14
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,370
People who use Kansai-ben
despite not being from Kansai

15
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,410
Have you seen any?

16
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,280
Ah yes. Aren't there a lot of workers at Yoshimoto like that?

17
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,250
(Haruna) They use Kansai-ben

18
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,250
Ahh..

19
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,320
My manager who used to represent me

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,320
would always use Kansai-ben

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,520
I thought he might be from there but

22
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,890
he was from Chiba.

23
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,960
(Haruna) It is unpleasant

24
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,960
That's kind of gross

25
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,260
Bakarhythm, how about you?

26
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,260
When I was young,

27
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,300
a director at the time

28
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,770
despite not being a native

29
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,770
often spoke in Kansai-ben

30
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,870
so when I'd tell him my jokes, he'd say

31
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,570
(In Kansai-ben) That's funny!

32
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,170
<That's annoying

33
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,170
Ah, someone like that

34
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,710
I felt like my joke was being tainted

35
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,380
What are you talking about?

36
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,380
And with that,

37
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,380
I bring to you now:

38
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,150
Kansai Werewolf

39
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,220
Kansai Werewolf.

40
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,220
What does that mean?

41
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,890
Does everyone know

42
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,890
the Werewolf game?

43
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:22,560
A game where players are divided citizens and werewolves, and have to guess who the werewolves are

44
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:22,560
Werewolf game

45
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,560
Yep

46
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,560
You have citizens and wolves.

47
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Everyone talks and tries

48
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,560
to figure out who the wolves are.

49
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,660
Kansai-ben version of that:

50
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,660
This time we have the

51
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,430
Find the fake Kansai natives

52
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,670
I see

53
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,640
After this...

54
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,240
Out of a group of people not known

55
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,240
for being from Kansai...

56
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:38,680
Who are the fake Kansai natives!?

57
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,440
we find out who's just pretending

58
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,110
(In Kansai-ben) I'm old Osaka

59
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,610
Then, at the convenience store...

60
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,180
No Plastic Bag Shopping Challenge

61
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,920
I can't believe how effective this is

62
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,720
And...

63
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:53,330
Is the portable shrine boil
disappearing because of Coronavirus?

64
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,040
Kansai Werewolf

65
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,350
Everyone, welcome to Kansai Werewolf.

66
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,180
Gamemaster
Jinnai Tomonori

67
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,850
Out of the 8 people here, 5 are from Kansai,

68
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,820
but not generally known for being so.
Hidden Kansai Natives.

69
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,760
The remaining 3 have no
connection at all to Kansai

70
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,130
but are pretending they're from there. fake Kansai natives.

71
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,370
Akira 100%

72
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,370
Hayashiya Pei

73
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,370
Inamura Ami

74
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,370
Jimon Terakado

75
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,370
Kawasaki Mayo

76
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,370
Watanabe Yōchi

77
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,370
Ôsawa Akane

78
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,370
Ōhashi Miho

79
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,770
The Kansai Werewolf players...

80
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,740
are these 8 people:

81
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,610
Of those 5 are really

82
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,610
from Kansai but

83
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,680
fake Kansai natives.

84
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,680
the remaining 3 are

85
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,550
The 3 fake Kansai natives

86
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,550
know who the other fakes are.

87
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,890
So, it's the first day

88
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,090
and it's elimination meeting time.

89
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:05,500
Detect the fake Kansai Natives using Kansai-ben intonation

90
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:05,500
Elimination meeting

91
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,130
Please try to find who the

92
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,130
fake Kansai natives are.

93
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,300
Let's begin.

94
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,500
Day 1
Elimination meeting

95
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,570
(In Kansai-ben)

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,240
I'm Terakado Jimon.

97
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,540
That's a bit too much isn't it?

98
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,680
What are you saying?

99
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,780
I'm definitely a Kansai native and

100
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,950
Jimon-san you don't seem like one at all.

101
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,380
Definitely not!

102
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,390
Just so you know, my accent is old Osaka

103
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,560
"washi"... ha ha ha

104
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,790
It's even old in Osaka. So young people there--

105
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,830
How many years ago was it?

106
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,130
It's been about 30 or 40 years.
The words have changed so much.

107
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,930
His Kansai-ben's awful.

108
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,930
Is he really from there?

109
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,970
Jinnai also doesn't know who the fake Kansai natives are

110
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:49,070
When I debuted in Tokyo, you had to speak Tokyo-ben

111
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,380
Well, I agree with that.

112
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,850
45 years ago when I came to Tokyo,

113
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,480
speaking Kansai-ben was unacceptable.

114
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,920
For your image.

115
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,650
That's right.

116
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,360
After people like Sanma-san appeared,
Kansai-ben quickly became acceptable.

117
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,090
That's right.

118
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,060
So we were trained...

119
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,760
"Ah, Kansai-ben? No, no, no"

120
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,960
Jimon-san you don't really need an image like that do you?

121
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,030
Huh?

122
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,330
Why are you criticizing me?

123
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,330
It feels like I'm being criticized. Why?

124
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,470
Isn't his intonation strange?

125
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,340
Weren't you using Tokyo words too?

126
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,040
Well, of course. I've been in Tokyo for 45 years.

127
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,050
Mayo-san doesn't strike me as a
native but his Kansai-ben is good

128
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,280
Jimon-san, you're very suspicious.

129
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,380
Huh?

130
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,850
Very suspicious.

131
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,160
People from Kansai don't speak slowly like that!

132
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,260
It's more energetic.

133
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,460
There aren't many people there like you.

134
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:47,970
After graduating middle school, I spent about 30 years as a battlefield cameraman.

135
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,000
So I've lived all over the world.

136
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,000
I knew about that but...

137
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,470
My Japanese has become

138
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,180
My Japanese has become strange, hasn't it?

139
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,750
I see. That's right.

140
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,720
I don't know about Watanabe-san.

141
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,620
Akira-san

142
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Akira's suspicious

143
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,020
Akira-san doesn't do Kansai-style comedy, right?

144
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,560
You're usually naked, right?

145
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,790
Comedians from Kansai don't do stuff like that

146
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,830
I'm from Shiga. My father...

147
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,500
Huh? Say that again.

148
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,500
Shiga

149
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,960
Why don't you use Kansai-ben if you're from Shiga?

150
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,370
I moved to Saitama in the first year of middle school

151
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,140
Since then it's been like 35 years, hasn't it?

152
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,810
I've been here ever since then.

153
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,550
When I trained to be an actor, I also had my intonation corrected

154
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,350
Is that so?

155
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,250
I love Chaplin

156
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,190
If he's fake, he's good

157
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,290
1 minute remaining

158
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,290
OK everyone, 1 minute left

159
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:52,160
My elementary school teacher was Fujiyama Kanbi

160
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,900
So I'm deeply Osakan

161
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,970
The accent is totally different to Jimon-san's

162
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,170
Osaka baseball ground is nearby.

163
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,610
I've been going there since before
Nomura started at the Nankai Hawks.

164
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,780
Ah!

165
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,780
Wow!

166
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,950
So Osakan.

167
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,080
Appearance-wise you're the most
suspicious but I trust you the most.

168
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,550
Do you normally use Kansai-ben when performing?

169
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,660
When I'm in Osaka, to an extent

170
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,160
Why don't you use it when you're in Tokyo?

171
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,760
Flowery Tokyo-ben seems... n-natural

172
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,870
Suspicious!

173
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,400
What's that?

174
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,600
That's really suspicious

175
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,040
Day 1 complete

176
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,580
OK everyone

177
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,040
It's elimination time

178
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,250
Could all players please

179
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,250
select one player who they think

180
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,420
is a fake Kansai native.

181
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,460
These two are both suspicious

182
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,930
I can't decide

183
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,230
Jimon-san is the only suspicious one

184
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,230
It has to be Jimon-san

185
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,000
Voting is complete

186
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:04,040
Let's see who voted for who

187
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,740


188
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,740
Jimon-san thinks the fake Kansai native is...

189
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,440
Watanabe Yōichi

190
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,440
Without a doubt!

191
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,850
He hasn't spoken any proper Kansai-ben at all

192
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,080
Well... you haven't been speaking it either.

193
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,780
Huh?

194
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,420
Watanabe-san didn't speak in Kansai-ben.

195
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,420
That he didn't use it →

196
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,720
makes me suspicious.

197
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,460
I see. I see.

198
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,400
And Watanabe Yōichi-san

199
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,400
thinks the fake Kansai native is...

200
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,700
Terakado Jimon

201
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,700
The first word

202
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,070
out of your mouth was in Tokyo-ben.

203
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,940
Well.. I dunno. It might be a bluff.

204
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,080
There are all sorts of things
that are easy to say in a show like this.

205
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,250
But you shouldn't judge
someone for something so simple.

206
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,580
He's annoyed, isn't he?

207
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,920
Very suspicious.

208
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,090
All the remaining players

209
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,560
voted for these two.

210
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,030
Hayashiya Pei...

211
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,000
voted for Watanabe Yōichi.

212
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,100
However...

213
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,340
The remaining 5 all voted for Jimon.

214
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,410
Which means...

215
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:20,510
Jimon-san has been eliminated.

216
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:20,510
With 6 votes against him,

217
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,020
No way!

218
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,020
You're not going to air this, are you?

219
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,020
What the hell is going on here?

220
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,520
Day 1's elimination is Terakado Jimon.

221
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:36,290
Note: The other players can't hear this

222
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,560
I don't know either.

223
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Well, shall we find out?

224
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,330
Here's the big reveal.

225
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,330


226
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,100
JImon-san, are you a fake Kansai native?

227
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,000
Or, are you actually from Kansai?

228
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,340
I'm from Kansai.

229
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,340
Huh?

230
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,840
From Hyogo.

231
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:46,840
Huh?

232
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
I'm from there too, you know.

233
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,640
Kawanishi.

234
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,340
Kawanishi?

235
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,050
And I went to elementary school in Minō.

236
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,810
You'd go to Osaka?

237
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,810
Yes, to Osaka.

238
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,180
So, how come your Kansai-ben is so crappy?

239
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,520
Until when?

240
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,020
My 5th year of elementary school.

241
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,820
My whole childhood was in Osaka.

242
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,330
Then after I became an adult,

243
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,800
I returned a lot to Osaka for work too.

244
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,960
The truth is I've spent a long time there.

245
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,030
But you don't speak in Osaka-ben at all?

246
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,000
After I debuted with Dachō Club, I stopped needing it

247
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,370
Ryūhei-san is from Kansai, right?

248
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,170
Dachō Club
Ueshima Ryūhei

249
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,370
Yes, totally.

250
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,170
He also sounds fake when he uses it.

251
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,640
I knew about Ryū-chan but...

252
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,640
Yeah.

253
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,980
I didn't know about Jimon.

254
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,480
Can you say 'what the hell!' in Kansai-ben for us?

255
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,850
What the hell!

256
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,150
That's really awful.

257
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,090
And so, the remaining members are

258
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,090
are these 7.

259
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,060
And in Kansai Werewolf,

260
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,360
Just like in
the original,

261
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:46,530
A team wins by eliminating all of the opposing team's players.

262
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,030
OK everyone, it's day 2.

263
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,940
If this were the normal game, after elimination

264
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,740
a citizen would be eaten by a werewolf but

265
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,780
an upstanding Kansai citizen would never eat or get eaten by someone, so

266
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,610
for this game we have no such rule.

267
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,780
So, let's start the elimination meeting.

268
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,860
Day 2 begins

269
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,290
Can I say something?

270
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,560
Inamura-san hasn't said anything since we began

271
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,630
It wasn't on purpose.

272
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:24,070
I originally came here in the 5th year of elementary school

273
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,400
That's young.

274
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,580
So it hardly comes out at all.

275
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,180
What kind of situations do you use it in?

276
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,980
TL note: obaa-chan = grandmother

277
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,980
With my western... obaa

278
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,850
It's like something from
"Once upon a time in Japan"

279
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,290
So how would you speak to your western obaa?

280
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,720
I need someone to play her...

281
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,130
Pei-san

282
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,790
Could you be my obaa?

283
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,600
H-how would you like me to do it?

284
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
"How would you like me to do it?" is..

285
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,670
Like you're on the phone with her.

286
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,500
Obaa, how are you?

287
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,540
I'm good! How are you?

288
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,670
Ah... I'm [in KSB] fine!

289
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,340
"Fine"?

290
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,140
Suspicious.

291
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,310
There's something strange about Akira-san too

292
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,280
[in KSB] Really?

293
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,880
No, no. I'm good at Kansai-ben.

294
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,750
You're good but there's something off about it

295
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,020
Well it could be because he's from Shiga

296
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:23,290
Shiga and east of Biwa lake. It's really rural

297
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,430
But I also don't have that
impression of Ōhashi either...

298
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,600
1 minute remaining

299
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,670
Are you from Osaka?

300
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,500
Hyogo.

301
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Do you normally speak in Kansai-ben?

302
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,510
When I'm working with Yoshimoto, lots of the staff are from Kansai,

303
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,110
so even the meetings will be in Kansai-ben.

304
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,710
That's when a little slips out.

305
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,280
Even though I trying to suppress it.

306
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,980
Ah... natural!

307
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,780
You're very Tokyo.

308
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,820
Watanabe-san, you're barely Kansai.

309
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,220
I feel like I'm losing the words...

310
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,460
Hahaha

311
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,460
Well.. it's bad already now...

312
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,730
I've been here in Tokyo since I came here at 13,

313
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,640
I've been married to a foreigner for 30 years.

314
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,940
But I still haven't forgotten it!

315
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,740
Well he's the same as me.

316
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,580
Even if the accent doesn't
come out, he's from Osaka

317
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,480
When they talk slowly you can't tell

318
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,210
You can't

319
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:20,120
Day 2 complete

320
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,890
It's elmination meeting time.

321
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,890
Who could it be?

322
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:26,260
Could all players please vote

323
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:26,260
for who they think...

324
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,430
is the fake Kansai native.

325
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,830
Voting is complete

326
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,070
Ōhashi-san thinks the fake Kansai native is...

327
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,840
Inamura Ami

328
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,070
Yes.

329
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,840
She may be from the west, but I feel like it's more Kyushu or Okinawa

330
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:48,050
Calling her obaa-chan "obaa",

331
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,520
I've never really heard that in Kansai

332
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,880
We don't say it

333
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,590
Next, Watanabe Ryōichi votes for...

334
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,460
Ōhashi Miho

335
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,990
Definitely.

336
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:08,170
Your native language is Tokyo-ben. Using your announcer skills, you speak Kansai-ben.

337
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,470
Your roots are in Tokyo.

338
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,610
Can he say all that off-the-cuff?

339
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,810
I know

340
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,380
All the remaining

341
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,380
players

342
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,250
a single person

343
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,250
voted for

344
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,250
That is...

345
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,220
Watanabe Yōichi

346
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,290
Therefore...

347
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,990
Watanabe Ryōichi-san

348
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,990
has been eliminated.

349
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,260
Watanabe-san, are you a fake Kansai native?

350
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,630
I'm a fake Kansai native.

351
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,170
By the way, where are you from?

352
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,240
Shizuoka

353
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,340
Shizuoka?

354
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,310
With that...

355
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,310
out of the remaining players,
2 are fake Kansai natives.

356
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,550
Day 3 begins

357
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,620
(Kawashima)
I have a question for everyone.

358
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,150
What did you think when you first came to Tokyo?

359
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:08,760
As you'd expect, the cars and buildings are so cool..

360
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,230
A bit different from Osaka. More refined.

361
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,230
Akira-san, how about you?

362
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:20,170
The udon soup was really dark I thought

363
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,870
It's different, right?

364
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,410
Something good's coming

365
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,340
It's a bit too cliched

366
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,140
That's suspicious

367
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,020
Akane-chan, how long has it been?

368
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,220
After graduating middle school.

369
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,920
People from Osaka, even if they don't have to, live hard and fast, don't they?

370
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,060
Haha, I know. Always..

371
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,590
People from Tokyo choose a goal and work towards it

372
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,260
Now this is Osaka-ben! She has to be from Osaka.

373
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,370
I came to Tokyo and the first thing I noticed was how many convenience stores there were,

374
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:56,610
So I'd think "ah, this is paradise!" in my day-to-day life.

375
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,140
The intonation is a bit...

376
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,880
it's totally weird, right?

377
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,650
You know, Inamura Ami-chan's Kansai-ben...

378
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,720
It's suspicious!

379
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,820
It's become Jimon-ized

380
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,820
It's bad, right?

381
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,690
Day 3 complete

382
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,660
At the end of the 3rd day, the person who received the most votes was...

383
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:19,200
Caught out by her intonation,

384
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:19,200
it's Inamura Ami.

385
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,700
So...

386
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,700
Inamura Ami has

387
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,700
been elimnated.

388
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,410
I'm a fake Kansai native!

389
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,840
Ami-chan, where are you from?

390
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,780
Tokyo

391
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,310
Totally!

392
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,050
At the end of the 3rd day,

393
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,350
there remains one more fake Kansai native.

394
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:50,730
Who is the remaining fake Kansai native?

395
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,890
If they can discover who it is,
the Kansai citizens will win but...

396
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,390
who on Earth could it be?

397
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,550
Day 4 begins

398
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,620
So. you know. I'll be straight..

399
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,090
I'm honestly thinking Akira-san is a little strange...

400
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,020
I thought so too at the start

401
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,590
Yes

402
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,890
But, his intonation on one thing changed my mind

403
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,430
He pronounced Biwa lake "Biwa lake"

404
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,930
(changing his intonation)

405
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,730
I'm thinking he's really from Kansai...

406
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,000
Am I being tricked?

407
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,140
No, no, no

408
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,540
So? That's what I'm thinking

409
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,070
But Mayo-san..

410
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,380
in this episode you've seemed like someone from Kansai at times

411
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,380
but you're an actor, aren't you?

412
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,480
So if you've had accent training for a role,

413
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,920
you'll be able to speak it perfectly.

414
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,150
Wait a second! I..

415
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,060
I'm a Kansai native! In every respect.

416
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,330
That's been bothering me from the start

417
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,060
If he's a fake I can't tell at all. Really.

418
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:03,200
You've been using standard Japanese with some Kansai-ben sprinkled in,

419
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,070
like someone who puts on a Kansai-ben accent when saying the word "Kansai".

420
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,210
(partly in KSB) Really?

421
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,880
It's not like that at all.

422
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,110
That "Really?" is a bit strange too.

423
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,850
We'd say it all in Kansai-ben.

424
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,520
You thought about the "really?" too much,

425
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,190
so your next sentence came out completely Kanto-ben, right?

426
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,250
Not at all.

427
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,960
He's good but the small details are wrong

428
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,060
I really really am from Shiga though!

429
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,930
Day 4 complete

430
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,430
"Shiga"

431
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,430
I don't know...

432
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,430
Do people from Shiga

433
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,430
pronounce it "Shiga"?

434
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,440
Mayo votes for Hayashiya Pei...

435
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,440
On day 4, Kawasaki

436
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,280
and Akira 100% for

437
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,280
Ōsawa Akane.

438
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,610
Then...

439
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,910
The last 3 all voted

440
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,910
for the same person.

441
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:54,490
Akira 100%

442
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,620
So, on day 4

443
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,620
the person to be eliminated...

444
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,720
is Akira 100%-san!

445
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:07,100
If Akira 100% is a fake Kansai native, the Kansai citizen team will win

446
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,500
Is he?

447
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,940
I'm a fake Kansai native.

448
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,240
(Ōhashi) We did it!

449
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,340
That means the Kansai citizens win.

450
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:22,780
Kansai citizen victory

451
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,220
The fake Kansai natives in this game were...

452
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,220
Akira 100%-san

453
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,490
Watanabe Ryōichi-san, and

454
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,990
Inamura Ami-san.

455
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,030
Huh? Jimon-san

456
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,630
So the first person everyone chose,

457
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:43,000
Terakado Jimon, is a fully-fledged Kansai native

458
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,000
Exactly!

459
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,900
He was the worst of all

460
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,570
So, to conclude, Jimon-san,

461
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,870
what did you think of Kansai Werewolf?

462
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,810
I'm exhausted

463
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,010
And with that, the first

464
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,010
game of Kansai Werewolf

465
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,520
results in a citizens' victory

466
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,450


467
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,790
So as we expected, people from Kansai can tell when someone is faking

468
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,460
But, for me, Akira...

469
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,460
Can you?

470
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,460
Ah, which part?

471
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,460
he fooled me quite a bit

472
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,460
Definitely...

473
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,200
the way he said "Biwa lake"

474
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,960
(changing intonation)
When he said "Biwa lake" instead of "Biwa lake"

475
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:19,100
From Shiga
Miyagawa Daisuke

476
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,300
(with Kansai-ben intonation)

477
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,300
Daisuke says it "Biwa", doesn't he?

478
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,140
So I thought it might be a Shiga thing

479
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,140
Yeah, he does

480
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:28,710
From Hyogo
Terakado JImon

481
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,810
Downtown-san, did you know that

482
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,810
Jimon-san is from Kansai?

483
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,810
I did

484
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,810
No I didn't

485
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,480
Dachō Club has 2 people from Kansai in it

486
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,480
That's right

487
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,710
From Hyogo
Ueshima Ryūhei

488
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,710
From Okinawa
Higo Katsuhiro

489
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,280
Jimon-san,

490
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,280
at this point,

491
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,680
can we revoke his right to call himself one?

492
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
Definitely

493
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,650
Our next presenters will come out now

494
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,670
Presenters
Kazuya Shimasa/Yashiki Hirosama
(New York)

495
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,560
It's New York!

496
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,570
Thank you

497
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,570


498
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,570
New York, right?

499
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,340
So...

500
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,440
From last July, plastic bags have had a fee

501
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,340
Ah, yes

502
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,410
If you bring your own,
you can use that but...

503
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,350
when you don't, how much do you carry without a bag?

504
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,780
As long as I can carry it in one hand

505
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,290
Because I want to take my key out when I get home

506
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,960
One hand full is enough

507
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
(Shimasa) I see

508
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
I know

509
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,960
Today we bring you a
theory related to that fee

510
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,960
Here it is

511
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:23,330
The most one can carry home from the convenience store without a bag is 10,000 yen's worth of products

512
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,300
Oh..

513
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,300
Yep

514
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,140
(Haruna) It's quite a lot. 10,000 yen

515
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,140
Can you hold that much?

516
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,140
It really is

517
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,210
I've worked at one before so I know.

518
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,480
Things like chargers and cosmetics...

519
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,550
They sell things which
are small but expensive.

520
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,490
Ah... I see, I see

521
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,490
If you buy things like that then maybe...

522
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,050
TBS Announcer
Yamamoto Rina

523
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,290
No plastic bag shopping battle!

524
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,960
No plastic bag shopping battle!

525
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:56,430
Alco & Peace
Hiroku Yūki / Sakai Kenta

526
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:56,430
Matenro:
Anthony / Ōtoni

527
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:56,430
Onigoe Tomahawk
Sakai Ryōta / Kin-chan

528
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,560
Carrying things today will be people who we think would have an advantage:

529
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,430
Big-bodied entertainers

530
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,570
These 3 large entertainer
teams will battle it out

531
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:01,110
Without putting the products they buy at the convenience store into a bag,

532
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,210
each must

533
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:06,910
Transport the goods 10m in their hands

534
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,580
GOAL

535
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:12,450
The team who spends the most wins

536
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,950
In a task like this teamwork is important

537
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,150
We get along well but...

538
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,690
these guys probably don't.

539
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,890
Yes we do

540
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,130
We get along great

541
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,130
We're
childhood friends

542
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,760
We never talk at all backstage

543
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,560
Are you still trying to?

544
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,770
No one who wants to do that

545
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,770
Showa-era entertainers, right?

546
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,540
Our first challengers are:

547
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,840
Anthony

548
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,840
Matenrou

549
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,840
Ōtoni

550
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,740
Let's go!

551
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,280
Ah, what to choose?

552
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,280
This is hard

553
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,750
I just want to eat a bento. I'm hungry

554
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,980
(Ōtoni) Bentos are bulky

555
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,650
Wait

556
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,720
It's totally fine

557
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,820
I guess

558
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,850
But we can only buy one

559
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,590
Rule: Only one of each product may be purchased

560
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,330
One of each type?

561
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,590
(Staff) one bento only

562
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:05,070
Rule: For every product purchased but left behind, there is a 1000 yen fine

563
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,500
Also, regardless of whether it is put in the basket...

564
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,430
for each item not carried back

565
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:04,770
a penalty of 1,000 yen will be imposed.

566
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,970
Therefore...

567
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:11,180
Buying while predicting how much they can carry

568
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,910
... is important here.

569
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,380
This is a battle of money, right?

570
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,350
Even if we buy loads of small cheap stuff, it's no good

571
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,720
We should buy everything expensive

572
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
Let's do it

573
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,290
Expensive is expensive, whatever it is

574
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,860
Woah woah woah

575
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,920
This is great

576
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:29,760
Electric shaver

577
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,930
Isn't this expensive?

578
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,760
Put anything over 1,000 yen in

579
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,230
I found something amazing

580
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,800
What is it?

581
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,400
Y-shirt

582
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,470
(Anthony) We're getting that for sure

583
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,230
This will be no problem at all

584
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,800
By the way, even though they're expensive,

585
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,510


586
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,140
Prepaid cards are forbidden.

587
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,950
The same goes for things like reusable bags:

588
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:50,750
Products that were made to carry things are also forbidden

589
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,680
Look at these earphones!

590
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,680
Wow wow wow

591
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,690
Earphones

592
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,220
It's great here

593
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,520
There's a thermometer here too

594
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:03,530
Body thermometer

595
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,390
A USB cable...

596
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,390
And there's a cable here

597
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:03,530
USB cable

598
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,760
Put all the USB stuff in

599
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,530
USB drive

600
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,830
(Anthony) Put it all in

601
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,830
Ah, wow a mobile battery pack

602
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:10,700
Mobile battery

603
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,100
(Ōtoni)

604
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,100
This tie is expensive too

605
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,700
Necktie

606
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,830
Will this be OK?

607
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,100
Razors

608
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,700
Razor blade pack

609
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,700
Yes, it's OK. Don't even think about it

610
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,040
They're putting in loads of things over 1,000 yen in

611
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,440
After spending 10 minutes

612
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,440
choosing products in the everyday life section...

613
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,280
Oh, let's finish with a fruit sandwich!

614
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:28,250
Fruit sandwich

615
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,580
You just want to eat it!

616
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,350
Mixed fruit sandwich

617
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,250
One of these

618
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,190
Can we finish now?

619
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,790
OK, we can

620
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,520
This has to be the limit

621
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,520
This is the maximum limit

622
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,220
Let's go pay

623
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,160
Shopping complete

624
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,930
Hold on, now it's spread it all out like this...

625
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,930
it's looking harder to carry.

626
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,500
Do you need a plastic bag?

627
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,170
Honestly, yes

628
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,340
In charge of carrying  for Manterou will be Anthony

629
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,980
This is unbelievably easy

630
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,750
Isn't it? We could've bought more

631
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,880
You're carrying it all in one hand, Anthony

632
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,390
We miscalculated

633
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:10,490
After they misjudge Anthony's capacity, he is left with an empty right hand.

634
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,000
This is the worst

635
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,100
(Yamamoto) Here they come

636
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,670
So much spare capacity

637
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,870
This is so bad

638
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,040
I underestimated myself

639
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,870
This is really the worst

640
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,870
So easy

641
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,110
We're done

642
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,970
Just your left hand

643
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,380
He's only using one hand

644
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,410
The goal's here!

645
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,180
Put it on here to finish

646
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,110
We're done!

647
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,120
Wow that's amazing...

648
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,420
To carry all that in just one hand!

649
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,590
We miscalculated

650
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,620
You could've carried twice as much

651
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,460
(Anthony) I could've

652
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,320
We seriously screwed up

653
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:45,200
Necktie
Y-shirt
Electric shaver
Shoes
Battery
Gift bag
Foundation
USB drive
Lingerie

654
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:45,200
Supplements
Extension cord
Bath towel
Razor blades
Cotton pads
Mobile battery
Thermometer
USB cable
Earphones

655
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:45,200
Umbrella
Fruit sandwich
Bento
Blu-ray discs
Lightbulb
Nail clippers
Brush
Earplug
Flashlight

656
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:45,200
Manterou was able
to carry a total of...

657
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:45,200
items

658
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:45,200
yen

659
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,460
Our next challengers are:

660
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,200
Kin-chan

661
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,200
Onigoe Tomahawk

662
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,200
Sakai Ryōta

663
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,170
Good morning

664
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,770
Everyday goods?

665
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,340
Stuff like batteries

666
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,470
Yes, yes, yes

667
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,140
Something light and kind of expensive

668
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,940
Look!

669
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,150
Body thermometer

670
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,880
It's almost exactly the same

671
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,420
They've arrived at that corner, haven't they?

672
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,420
Guess so...

673
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,990
Now I'm thinking, if it's all
too small I won't be able to carry it

674
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,090
Yeah

675
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,090
So what if we put it on something bigger?

676
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:18,460
Something like a large slab

677
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,200
How's this?

678
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
2000 yen

679
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,970
Nappies

680
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,970
As a platform

681
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,100
Yes, sure

682
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,270
We can put loads on this foundation

683
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,110
I see

684
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,440
That would've worked

685
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,110
And then...

686
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:42,690
Loaf of bread

687
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,910
Another foundation?

688
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,910
Let's do it

689
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,720
After adding bread
to their foundations...

690
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,860
This foundation's expensive

691
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:53,160
Foundation

692
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,460
(Kin-chan) Put it in

693
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,460
(Sakai) Shall we get the lipstick too?

694
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:53,160
Lipstick

695
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,160
(Sakai) Put that in too

696
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,160
The fragrance is good too

697
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,160
Fragrance spray

698
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,270
Can we get both these steaks?

699
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,470
They're different things, yes

700
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,670
Chicken steak

701
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,670
Hamburg steak

702
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,870
Kyu-chan cucumbers!

703
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,870
Pickled vegetables

704
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,610
They add their last product...

705
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,980
Here you go

706
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,480
Shopping complete

707
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,320
Let's start with the foundations

708
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,650
I'm worried about the bread

709
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,090
With the foundations constructed...

710
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:22,760
They start placing products on them

711
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,090
Then...

712
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,400
OK OK OK…

713
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:36,610
They attach small items to Kin-chan's curly hair

714
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,780
However...

715
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,640
No, I can't hold more

716
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,950
I can't put this on?

717
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,950
That's what I'm saying

718
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,450
We'll get penalties for these...

719
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:47,120
Penalty x 9

720
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,780
(Kin-chan) It's all the stuff you
added at the end

721
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,780
Ryo-chan, open the door!

722
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,390
Alright, let's go Kin-chan

723
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
(Ōtoni) Can he do it?

724
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
OK OK

725
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,560
Incredible

726
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,130
(Sakai) Ok, let's go Kin-chan

727
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,130
He's doing it!

728
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,890
Wow

729
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,430
(Anthony) Here he comes

730
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,430
(Yamamoto) Hang in there!

731
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,900
Can you see where you're going?

732
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,300
Just about

733
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,870
This way

734
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:03,870
Where?

735
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,300
Right, right, right

736
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,300
Looking good

737
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,300
OK!

738
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,080
Seriously

739
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,080
That was great.

740
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,380
(Yamamoto) Well done!

741
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:22,850
Earplugs
T-shirt
Lingerie
Cotton pads
Mobile battery
Earphones
Soluble fiber
Hairbands
Candy
Hairpins
Shaving foam
Lip cream

742
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:22,850
Mints
USB drive
USB cable
Sweet chestnuts
Mechanical pencil
Fragrance spray
Foundation
Support brace
Razor blades
Bath towel
Lipstick
Cigarettes

743
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:22,850
Nappies
Bread
Cup yakisoba
Blu-ray discs
Cheese
Body wash
Tongue brush
Medical spray
Mouth gel
Brush
Supplements
Kitchen bleach

744
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:22,850
Y-shirt
Air freshener
Denture cleaner
Lighter
Towel
Thermometer
Batteries
Shoes
Sake
Snacks
Ice cream
Electric shaver

745
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,350
Drastically exceeding Manterou's total,

746
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:22,850
items

747
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:22,850
they were able to carry...

748
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:22,850
yen

749
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,520
Body lotion

Biscuits

Hamburg steak

750
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,520
Cup ramen

Chicken steak

Energy drink

751
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,520
Pickles

Can of beer

Chocolate

752
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:27,420
But, what effect will the penalty of 9,000 yen have on their score?

753
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:32,960
Alco & Peace

754
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:32,960
Hirako Yūki

755
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:32,960
Sakai Kenta

756
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,730
The final challengers are:

757
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,670
Let's go

758
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,470
I'd rather die than lose this

759
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,710
Then, Hirako discovers something...

760
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,270
How about that?

761
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,810
What if we use it as a base?

762
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:52,950
Box of cakes

763
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,850
With this as a base and a frame too...

764
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,950
We can make a big square thing like Jenga

765
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,190
Similar to Onigoe, they choose the...

766
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,390
Pedestal strategy

767
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,620
And then...

768
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:08,770
Cane

769
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,630
How about something like this?

770
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,600
With this and
an umbrella we can build a frame

771
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,060
Sounds good

772
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,600
That'll work

773
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,770
It'll be sturdy

774
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,070
It will

775
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,070
Right?

776
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,570
Combining the cane and umbrella

777
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,340
They invent an improved base

778
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,870
Clever

779
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,870
Clever

780
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,180
So clever

781
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,150
Let's start with the biggest first

782
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,150
Jenga-style

783
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,410
Like this? Is that OK?

784
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,420
OK

785
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,420
Yeah

786
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:30,050
I think it will

787
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:30,050
Wow, this will totally work

788
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,960
Ah, this is a good shape

789
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,960
Interesting

790
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:41,300
Ice cream

791
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,430
Nice

792
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,330
We can play with this

793
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,990
What?

794
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,300
Interesting

795
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,300
Yep, we can play with it

796
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,770
Then, after that,

797
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,940
Yokan
(jellied bean paste)

798
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,140
Having chosen mainly

799
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,140
square products...

800
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:49,810
they finish shopping.

801
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,810
Donuts

802
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,110
Yes, just a bit more

803
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,950
I think he's scared

804
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,620
(Ōtoni) Wow, amazing

805
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,550
It's really stable

806
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,550
(Ōtoni) Really great

807
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,550
It's the best

808
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,790
It's so stable

809
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,790
He's not going to drop a thing

810
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,060
No problem at all

811
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,590
Beautiful

812
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,060
(Yamamoto) You can put it down like that

813
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,730
It's like a piece of art

814
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,730
(Yamamoto) Magnificent!

815
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,730
Wow!

816
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,130
(Yamamoto) Well done!

817
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,130
<That is so good

818
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:23,870
The number of products may not be the best, but in terms of art...

819
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,410
They're stacked beautifully

820
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,880
We're different to the crude people at Yoshimoto

821
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,880
Stop it with that

822
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,110
I want you to see it

823
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:37,420
With three very different ways of carrying things, what will the final result be?

824
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:37,550
Alco & Peace

825
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:37,550
Matenrou

826
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:37,550
Onigoe
Tomahawk

827
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,420
(Yamomoto) All together, go!

828
00:29:37,550 --> 00:30:02,650
Alco & Peace

829
00:29:37,550 --> 00:30:02,650
Matenrou

830
00:29:37,550 --> 00:30:02,650
Onigoe Tomahawk

831
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,430
How much?

832
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,430
How much?

833
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:47,430
(Yamamoto) Matenrou got 50,774 yen,

834
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,770
Onigoe got 54,244 yen,

835
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:54,770
and Alco & Peace 55,351 yen.

836
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,440
(Anthony) Unexpectedly close

837
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,340
Seriously?!

838
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
So close!

839
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,650
If it weren't for the penalty...

840
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,650
It's because of that

841
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,450
Now we're going to have another round

842
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,020
Huh?

843
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,020
Second round?

844
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:11,860
We're adding an "open one item" rule now

845
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,360
For round two...

846
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:20,230
Added rule: one product can be opened

847
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:26,140
The type of product they choose to open and hold other products with is key to winning

848
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,140
First in this round is Mantenrou

849
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,610
who came last in round 1.

850
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,050
Using one hand with this open...

851
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,180
Ah, actually

852
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,350
This is too easy

853
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:42,550
What will they open?

854
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
It's this

855
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
This

856
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:48,390
Opened item:
Umbrella

857
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
An umbrella

858
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,390
We'll open the umbrella
and put things in

859
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,100
This is good, right?

860
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,100
Here it is

861
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,600
We can put so much in this!

862
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,800
Seriously

863
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,440
So..

864
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,440
This will work

865
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:02,640
Things that are as light and expensive as possible

866
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,180
Umeboshi for 400 yen

867
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,180
Ah this is best

868
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,040
Umeboshi

869
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Umeboshi for 400 yen is best

870
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,510
The best?

871
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,910
Is he an idiot or something?

872
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:16,190
Having chosen...

873
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,250
Lightweight and high value goods

874
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,620
they start putting them in them umbrella

875
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,330
Go! Put it in!

876
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,930
There must be 30kg here

877
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,730
Alright

878
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,730
Look at this

879
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,730
Over here, look

880
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,730
where I'm looking

881
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,210
Can we load it up again?

882
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,210
(Staff) Sure

883
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,640
Dropping things inside the store is allowed

884
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,580
so after devising a new way of carrying things...

885
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,080
they repack and try again.

886
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,020
Can I fit?

887
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,750
This is the most it can open

888
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,760
(Ōtoni) You can do it!

889
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,560
Ah wow, it's holding it, it's holding it

890
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,760
(Yamamoto) You mustn't drop it
now, Anthony-san!

891
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,460
It's so far

892
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,400
My arms!

893
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
Impressive

894
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,030
Keep going!

895
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,540
Ah, phew!

896
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,540
OK

897
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,440
I can't lift my arms at all

898
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,540
(Yamamoto) Well done!

899
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,540
We did it!

900
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,550
After that, Matenrou's score is

901
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:19,450
Total:

902
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:19,450
items

903
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:19,450
yen

904
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,050
Added to their score from round 1,

905
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:26,620
their total is 132,222 yen and they provisionally move to 1st place.

906
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,030
Next, Onigoe Tomahawk's attempt

907
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,560
Which item did they open?

908
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,730
Go straight forward

909
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,730
I can't see ahead at all

910
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,070
<Wow, here they come

911
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,070
Go right and stay level

912
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,070
(Yamamoto) He can't see ahead at all

913
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,080
Forward, forward...

914
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,080
Go straight ahead

915
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,080
(Yamamoto) Slowly slowly

916
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,350
Yes, they used a t-shirt

917
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:51,980
Opened item: T-shirt

918
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:56,420
By tying the sleeves and blocking the neck hole with a box of rice crackers

919
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,420
Onigoe made a large bag

920
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,420
We could've put more in

921
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,860
There's so much space in here

922
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
Straight, straight

923
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:09,000
Aaah, I can't

924
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
Forward, no, no, forward

925
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,700
You can do it, you can do it

926
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,040
A bit more!

927
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,040
Forward, forward

928
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
(Yamamoto) One more meter

929
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,040
OK OK OK…

930
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,040
This is OK

931
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,050
(Anthony) Yay!

932
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,050
OK

933
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,050
We did it

934
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,350
(Yamamoto) Wow, amazing

935
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,590
With this strategy, this has become an unexpectedly physical challenge

936
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,730
Onigoe's score is...

937
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:40,200
Total:

938
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:40,200
items

939
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:40,200
yen

940
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Their grand total is 122,414 yen

941
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,400
so they fail to surpass Matenrou.

942
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:52,080
Last is Alco & Peace

943
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,080
In round one they took pride in carrying things gracefully...

944
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,180
So, what kind of item did they open?

945
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,020
It's fine.

946
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,020
There's more than enough width.

947
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,020
< There he is

948
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,020
<Wow, here he comes

949
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,720
Duct tape?

950
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,590
Ah..

951
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,590
Wow!

952
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,360
Yes, they opened

953
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,360
duct tape

954
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,930
Opened item: duct tape

955
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,370
They combined products

956
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,700
into easy-to-carry shapes

957
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,710
and even wrapped some around his body

958
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,110
to reduce the burden on his arms.

959
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,340
(Yamamoto) Wow

960
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,340
<He's coming out

961
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,680
Ah, we dropped one

962
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,880
(Kin-chan) We dropped one

963
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,880
Leave it, leave it behind

964
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,850
Skin lotion

965
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,320
It's super stable

966
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,050
(Various) He's got room to spare!

967
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,050
(Yamamoto) Amazing

968
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:41,390
Ahhhh...

969
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:41,390
Alright!

970
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,390
(Yamamoto) Well done!

971
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,390
<Great

972
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,660
Total:

973
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,660
items

974
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,660
yen

975
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,100
I can't believe you used such a dirty tactic

976
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,070
We were humans carrying things

977
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:56,170
You're not a human anymore!

978
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:56,170
This is a convenience man!

979
00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:03,450
Alco & Peace

980
00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:03,450
Matenrou

981
00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:03,450
Onigoe Tomahawk

982
00:34:56,410 --> 00:35:00,340
The final result is as follows:

983
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,680
The winners are Alco & Peace!

984
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,020
Everyone, what did you think?

985
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,990
Well, compared to how excited the participants got...

986
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,020
We in the studio did not get as excited

987
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,530
I don't know but

988
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,160
The viewing figures for children will be really good

989
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,030
Haruna-san, what did you think?

990
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,030
Well, you know,

991
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:25,270
Maybe one round was enough

992
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,540
Hey!

993
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,610
I got a bit excited

994
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,610
Shigemori-san, you?

995
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:32,880
At the end when they used the duct tape

996
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:32,880
Oh, really?

997
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
it was like "oh, you can do that!"

998
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,050
It was like a Eureka moment

999
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,050
That's good

1000
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,980
Well, the rating figures for kids will indeed be good

1001
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,190
32, right?

1002
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,190
32?

1003
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,720
Next...

1004
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:49,630
Everyone's Theories

1005
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:49,630
Investigating various popular topics and theories sent in by viewers

1006
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,900
Tonight's presenter is...

1007
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:57,830
Presenter
Tamura Kenji

1008
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,970
Yes, it's Tamura Kenji-san!

1009
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,970
What happened?

1010
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,970
What's the commotion?

1011
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:03,240
It seems we're waiting for Tamuken

1012
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,240
Ummm, ah..

1013
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,650
I've forgotten my notebook

1014
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,310
He always has it

1015
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,310
Yeah

1016
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,280
So I thought...

1017
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,620
let's see if I can manage without it

1018
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,920
What are you saying?

1019
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,760
Ah, but, it probably would've been better to go get it...

1020
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,090
They'll give it to you from here

1021
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,090
Please don't be angry at me later

1022
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,090
They won't be

1023
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,430
Sorry, I'm really sorry

1024
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,430
What's going on?

1025
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,030
OK, everyone,

1026
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,570
(mispronouncing gozonji as goronji) \nDo you know mikoshi dako?

1027
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,910
"Goronji"?

1028
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,380
Please, get it together

1029
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,450
Mikoshi dako?
(Lit: "Portable shrine octopus")

1030
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,450
Do you know what mikoshi dako is?

1031
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,780
If you carry a portable
shrine like this,

1032
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,450
That's right

1033
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,450
a bump forms on your shoulder.

1034
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,450
Is there anyone here who's seen one?

1035
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,450
Ah, I haven't

1036
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,460
I've seen people with it on TV

1037
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,790
It's a pretty big bump, right?

1038
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,790
The shape changes.

1039
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,800
Recently, there haven't been many festivals, right?

1040
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,730
Ah, yes, because of coronavirus

1041
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,730
Ahh..

1042
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:05,130
So what I bring you today is this:

1043
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,910
Are people with mikoshi dako losing them because of coronavirus?

1044
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,080
I don't know about this

1045
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,080
In the last 2 years?

1046
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,080
Yes

1047
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,750
They haven't carried them on their shoulders for two whole years

1048
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,920
You know, they've always done it

1049
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,920
so when they can't..

1050
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,390
they go rogue.

1051
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,420
They have secret festivals

1052
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,420
Don't you think?

1053
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,420
Right

1054
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,430
Huh?

1055
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,030
and law-evading mikoshi

1056
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,430
Law-evading mikoshi…

1057
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,430
They'll do it...

1058
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,730
In the shadows...

1059
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,730
Right

1060
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,630
Is all this hopeless stuff written in your notebook?

1061
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,240
You brought it here especially for us?

1062
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,100
All of it

1063
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,270
It's all written there?

1064
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,110
So what Tamuken was saying just now weren't his own words, right?

1065
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,440
Law-evading...

1066
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,440
Of course not

1067
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,450
Law-evading mikoshi?

1068
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,120
"Law-evading mikoshi"
is written right here

1069
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,120
Wow it is

1070
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,120
It's stupid, isn't it?

1071
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,120
Well then sorry

1072
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,120
"Law-evading mikoshi" is here

1073
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,120
They made you say it

1074
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,120
But actually I...

1075
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:04,630
Approved it and decided to say it

1076
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,890
I'm responsible too

1077
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,400
Well yeah, you could've left it out

1078
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,100
However,

1079
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,100
the law-evading mikoshi...

1080
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,830
I liked it and I wanted to say it

1081
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,670
You liked it

1082
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:33,690
Are people with mikoshi dako losing them because of coronavirus?

1083
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:39,030
Due to coronavirus, festivals all over the country were cancelled

1084
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,800
Kanda festival cancelled

1085
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,800
Mikoshi togyo
cancelled for
first time in 74 years

1086
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,800
Yamahoko Junko
cancelled for
first time in 58 years

1087
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,770
For two years the
mikoshi haven't appeared

1088
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:49,110
Have the mikoshi dako of those who held them disappeared too?

1089
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:54,040
The first person we visit is

1090
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,350
(Staff) Nice to meet you

1091
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,350
Nice to meet you

1092
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:02,020
With 10 years' experience
carrying mikoshi, Sekido-san

1093
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:07,860
Prior to coronavirus, he did it every month

1094
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:11,360
Here's his mikoshi dako from 3 years ago...

1095
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:19,500
3 years ago

1096
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,770
WIth one on his shoulder
and one on his neck, his is the

1097
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:19,500
2-boil type

1098
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:23,810
What has happened to it?

1099
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,980
(staff) Wow

1100
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:27,210
Here's my right shoulder

1101
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,610
(Staff) It's huge

1102
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,520
Thank you very much

1103
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,290
Totally still there

1104
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,060
Hasn't it grown?

1105
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,690
(Haruna) It's gotten bigger

1106
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,690
It's growing

1107
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,560
3 years
ago

1108
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,560
Now

1109
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,560
It isn't smaller at all

1110
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,400
(Staff) Ever thought about removing it?

1111
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,030
Not once

1112
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:54,140
My wife hates it

1113
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:58,940
(Staff) So she wants you to have it removed?

1114
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,940
Yes. As you'd expect, she seems embarrassed

1115
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,410
But I'm proud of it

1116
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:04,310
It's been like having a medal

1117
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:09,690
To be honest I'd like the left one to be bigger.
I'm a bit ashamed of it at the moment

1118
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,720
(Staff) How do you mean "ashamed"?

1119
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,020
It's like "this guy only carries it on one side!"

1120
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,490
"He hasn't got one on the left at all!"

1121
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:22,830
So I want to grow the left one to show people I can hold it on both sides

1122
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:26,940
(Staff) Are there any advantages to having it?

1123
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:31,740
Shoulder bags fit it perfectly

1124
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,310
I think it's convenient

1125
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
Next is...

1126
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,680
(Staff) Hello

1127
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,680
Hello

1128
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
Clearly a southpaw, it's...

1129
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:47,960
Yamawaki-san

1130
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:47,960
years'
experience

1131
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,230
(Staff) How many times a year would you do it?

1132
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,360
Well, around 70 times

1133
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,960
(Staff) Would you tour the country?

1134
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,570
Just around Kanto

1135
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:03,110
2 years
ago

1136
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,340
It was this big 2 years ago but now...

1137
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:05,370
Let's see

1138
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,380
(Staff) Ahh

1139
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,380
Here it is

1140
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,380
(Staff) Incredible

1141
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,150
It's smaller now but it'll get bigger when the season starts

1142
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,020
(Staff) How much has it shrunk?

1143
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,960
About 1.5 to 2cm

1144
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,730
2 years
ago

1145
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,730
Now

1146
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,390
It's definitely gotten smaller but...

1147
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,700
it's not disappeared.

1148
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,330
When I was in hospital due to an accident,

1149
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:33,370
the doctor asked me if I wanted the
hematoma on my shoulder removed.

1150
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:36,640
"No", I said, "without this I can't carry the mikoshi"

1151
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,180
(Staff) Without that...?

1152
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,180
It'd hurt

1153
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,880
This stops it hurting

1154
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,920
This fits perfectly now, doesn't it?

1155
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,790
(Staff) It's like a cushion

1156
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,790
Yes, it's like there's a cushion inside it

1157
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,820
(Staff) How has it helped you in your daily life?

1158
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,360
Shoulder bags don't slide off at all

1159
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,960
That's enough

1160
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,130
They fit perfectly in my shoulder here

1161
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,130
Everyone'll say that

1162
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:05,600
Next, in possesion of his own mikoshi...

1163
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,040
Ichihara-san

1164
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,040
years'
experience

1165
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,170
Could you show it to us?

1166
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,170
Sure

1167
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:18,110
2 years
ago

1168
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:18,110
Now

1169
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,380
His hasn't changed size
in the last two years either

1170
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,680
I used to work in sales

1171
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:24,890
It was hard to take time off on weekends with festivals

1172
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,990
So because I wanted to do this,

1173
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:29,430
I changed jobs and did something else

1174
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,560
(Staff) You moved jobs for mikoshi?

1175
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,560
I did

1176
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,800
(Staff) Has having one helped you in any way?

1177
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,100
For example, in my room when there's nothing to lean on

1178
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,610
If I'm sitting down like this, it's a perfect pillow

1179
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:44,510
(Staff) I see

1180
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,980
Also, when holding a ba--

1181
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,880
This man, who wouldn't look out of place with a cane, has one too

1182
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,920
Fujimori-san

1183
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,920
years'
experience

1184
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:54,020
(Staff) It's totally different
From the front...

1185
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,020
Oh, cool!

1186
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,020
Wow!

1187
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,560
Possibly useful on planes, it's the

1188
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,890
Neck pillow type

1189
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,300
Watanabe-san

1190
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,300
years'
experience

1191
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,100
It's like this

1192
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,760
Well, to be honest,

1193
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,070
When people who don't do festivals see it, they definitely wonder what it is

1194
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,110
I think the size probably hasn't changed that much

1195
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:18,670
5 years ago

1196
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,670
It's like a boob

1197
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,110
In terms of cup size, I'd say it's a C-cup

1198
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,110
I'm often told that at least

1199
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:26,480
That being said, it's not like it has a pointed tip

1200
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,750
Ozawa-san

1201
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,750
years'
experience

1202
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,950
There are
mikoshi-carrying
women too

1203
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,950
(Staff)

1204
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,950
Where is it?

1205
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,560
This is the boil

1206
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:37,290
(Staff) It's a bit hollow

1207
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:41,000
3 years ago

1208
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:41,000
It hasn't gotten smaller

1209
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:41,000
Now

1210
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,970
Kondō-san

1211
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,970
years'
experience

1212
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,100
And here is the
"Little Kiyohara"-type

1213
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:47,700
And from the back...

1214
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,270
These are my C-cups

1215
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:55,080
"Middle Kiyohara"-type

1216
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,910
Miura-san

1217
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,910
years'
experience

1218
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,250
(Staff) Wow

1219
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,950
(Staff) You have 2?

1220
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,780
And behind there's...

1221
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,850
(Staff) Behind? How do you mean?

1222
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,090
(Staff) Oh, cool

1223
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,920
Really cool

1224
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,400
Kōchi-san

1225
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,400
years'
experience

1226
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:13,700
Next, someone whose
head seems to be sinking
into their body...

1227
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:17,400
A "Younger Toguro"-pattern mikoshi dako

1228
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,110
(Staff) Wow, cool

1229
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,940
It's just like an octopus

1230
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,550
(Staff) Have they gotten smaller?

1231
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:34,650
It feels to me like they haven't

1232
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:37,050
(Staff) So they're not going to change?

1233
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,050
No they're not

1234
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:41,660
Watanabe-san

1235
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:41,660
years'
experience

1236
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,590
And this is Watanabe-san

1237
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,730
(Staff) Woah

1238
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:58,640
(Staff) What's going on here?

1239
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:05,680
From the back, it's just like the character for mountain (山)

1240
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,950
(Staff) Are there any ways in which you've found having them useful?

1241
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:09,650
Shoulder ba--

1242
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:15,160
Result: We look forward to them holding the mikoshi next year

1243
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,230
What did you think?

1244
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,230
Wow

1245
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:20,560
It was not what I expected

1246
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,430
It was pretty impressive, right?

1247
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,530
I want them put on us too

1248
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,770
(Haruna) On that drawing

1249
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,710
(Bakarhythm) MIkoshi dako

1250
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,710
No, no

1251
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:33,040
You don't hold mikoshi, do you?

1252
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,380
You earn those from
carrying mikoshi

1253
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,380
A lucky charm

1254
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,380
As a lucky charm

1255
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,380
And you're holding up Mt Fuji

1256
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,920
Because the comedy world is resting on your backs?

1257
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,150
You'll get comedy mikoshi dako

1258
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:47,360
Great

1259
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:47,360
It was better than I'd imagined

1260
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,190
Panelist Theory

00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:52,730
Next week..

'When peeing in the mens' toilets,
everyone can see you from outside' theory

1264

We air theories given
by panelists in the opening

1265
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:04,410
And investigate a selection of them

1266
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:07,440
If Downtown were young now,

1267
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,450
they wouldn't be this popular
