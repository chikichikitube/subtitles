00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,020
1st Time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arrahende
"I'm the One Who Understands you Best!"

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,820
"Anyways, You'd Look Great in this Thing" DAIGO Edition!!

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,830
The "DA" was so loud!

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,160
The "DA" of DAikkai.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,730
And the "DA" of DAIGO.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,730
Yeah the DAIGO "DA"  too.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,770
Ok, but after the first one it was smooth.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,170
You mean after "DA" of DAikkai.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,810
It's been a while since we've done this.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,710
It's been a year and a half.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,980
The guest of last time is no longer with us, Pe-e.

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,620
The guest of last time is no longer with us, Pe-e.

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,620
That's not true.  She's alive and well.

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,950
I heard she fell in a river...

15
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:48,360
A special series on Gaki, where the members buy gifts for guests based on their interests!!

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,660
So, without further ado, let's bring out today's guest.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,110
DAIGO

18
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,510
Are these your casual clothes?

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,510
They look similar to your stage clothes.

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,680
They're pretty similar.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,020
So you wear this normally?

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,620
Yeah, but...

23
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,620
You even wear this stuff casually?

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,990
Pretty much.

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,860
Perfect.

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,690
What I've got is perfect.

27
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,090
This is totally ok.

28
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,830
It's ok?

29
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,160
I'm not sure about Hamada-san though.

30
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,800
Hamada-san seems less confident.

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,070
I went a completely different direction.

32
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,000
I went a completely different direction.

33
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,000
We might yet see a new DAIGO.

34
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,540
That's true...

35
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,080
...but only if I feel like it.

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,580
What sort of answer is that...

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,590
Timed, Typeset & Translated by Inepped

38
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:59,830
Before the show started, the Gaki members went shopping to find a top and an accessory for DAIGO.

39
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,170
Shibuya

40
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,520
If you're over 40 you've gotta shop in Shibuya.

41
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,870
I was thinking of getting something a bit oversized.

42
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,140
Staff

43
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,140
These look nothing like DAIGO-san's image...

44
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,140
It's not, but...

45
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,450
I'm going for something different. When you see him on TV it's all...

46
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,820
Black

47
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,120
Black, white and grey.

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Black, white and grey.

49
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,220
Black, white and grey.

50
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,820
This feels like what youngster's would wear casually.

51
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,490
I bet his wife wants him to dress like that too.

52
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,030
I bet his wife wants him to dress like that too.

53
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,030
I kind of want this too.

54
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,770
This is completely different from his usual image.

55
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,410
I really want to come in first.

56
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,410
Harajuku

57
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,110
I think I'll go quite aggressive this time.

58
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,750
This is super interesting, what is it?

59
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,750
It's a leather harness.

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,590
58,724 Yen (approx. £360/$410)

61
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,590
There's masks as well.

62
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,190
This store's pretty interesting.

63
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,560
It's transparent...

64
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,560
Staff

65
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,560
It's pretty interesting.

66
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,730
What do you think?

67
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,200
32,180 Yen (approx. £200/$225)

68
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,200
It's think it's alright.

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
What about these sunglasses?

70
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,870
28,484 Yen (approx. £175/$200)

71
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,570
I can actually see out of them.

72
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,980
This time I've come to BUCCA...

73
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,980
Ebisu

74
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,510
...it's TKO Kinoshita's store.

75
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,280
These photos are pretty gross though.

76
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,520
BUCCA's stuff is kinda baggy...

77
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,630
...it's usually a larger size.

78
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,630
This set...

79
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,930
This set...

80
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,730
IT'S KINOSHITA!

81
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,370
I'm looking for a visual rock style.

82
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,670
Kanda

83
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,670
When thinking of it...

84
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,640
Bondage comes to mind.

85
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Rubber...

86
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,050
See

87
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,350
It makes such a great noise.

88
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,690
It's even waterproof.

89
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,090
This is super cool

90
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,130
is it breathable?

91
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,130
No it's not.

92
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,130
Store Manager

93
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,060
So it's not breathable.

94
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,030
Can you wear this for surfing?

95
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,030
I guess so.

96
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,970
This is...

97
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,770
...this would be impossible to put on by yourself.

98
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,940
It shows off your body line.

99
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,210
It does.

100
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,110
Store Manager

101
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,110
You have such a nice body line.

102
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,820
I think this place should be good.

103
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,820
Yurakucho

104
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,560
This time is gonna be pretty tough...

105
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,200
Shimura ZOO is a Japanese TV program

106
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,200
Since he's on Shimura ZOO...

107
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,930
...maybe this handkerchief would work.

108
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,440
This is...

109
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,940
Right... It's not bad at all.

110
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,670
Price tag

111
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,880
276,000 Yen (approx. £1,165/$1,920)

112
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,260
But it's not bad...

113
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,930
Really?

114
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:31,940
DAIGO will take home his favourite item, the worst will have to pay out of their own pocket.

115
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,720
First off we will be presenting the tops we've picked to DAIGO.

116
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,620
Surprisingly, the tops this season are a bit...

117
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,490
That's true.

118
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,020
I was a bit unsure this time.

119
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,130
In saying that...

120
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,130
...I still found the perfect top.

121
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,400
Since you've said that...

122
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,200
...let's start off with Matsumoto-san.

123
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,170
We start off with the confident Matsumoto.

124
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,440
This is...

125
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,710
...truly

126
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,480
truly perfect.

127
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
I'm excited.

128
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,380
Let me just preface this...

129
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,110
...this is a bit of a more mature style.

130
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,350
He doesn't really have an older style.

131
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,750
That's what I was thinking.

132
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,120
That's true.

133
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,090
I don't think I have a single thing that's older.

134
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,060
I don't think I have a single thing that's older.

135
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,830
I think you'll like this.

136
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,500
Can you pull it out?

137
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,210
It's so short!

138
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:47,190
5,292 Yen (approx. £34/$37)

139
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,880
What's with that?!

140
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,110
Is he a hotel porter?

141
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,420
Of course not!

142
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,780
What's this?

143
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,150
There's no button.

144
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,150
That came off in transit, sorry about that.

145
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,150
Can you try it on?

146
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,990
It's just so short.

147
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,760
I'm sorry about the buttons coming off.

148
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,330
It's so short.

149
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,210
This is something completely new!

150
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,340
The size is just...

151
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,240
This is bad!!

152
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,040
This is so bad!!

153
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,210
It looks great!!

154
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,920
So great!!

155
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,320
Look! Doesn't it look good!

156
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,230
How about buttoning up the front?

157
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,560
This? Ah here.

158
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,060
This? Ah here.

159
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,300
You look like a prince.

160
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,300
This suits you perfectly!

161
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,370
No it doesn't!

162
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,370
It's just so small.

163
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,010
So cool!

164
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,910
So uncool.

165
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,480
Can I just do my own check?

166
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,320
Here comes the Rock check.

167
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,690
Alright, that's enough!

168
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,160
Next to present his top, Hosei.

169
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,860
Have you just bought senbei?

170
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,160
Senbei = Japanese rice cracker

171
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,160
It's not senbei

172
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,070
See.

173
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,870
Really!?

174
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,340
What is that?

175
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,210
What sort of texture is that?!

176
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,210
What is that?

177
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,920
It's rubber.

178
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,660
It feels...

179
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,660
It's nice right?

180
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,630
It's waterproof 'cos it's rubber.

181
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
What do you think of this guys?

182
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,000
It'd be impossible to wear in the summer.

183
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,270
Do you put clams in the pockets?

184
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,240
Do you put clams in the pockets?

185
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,050
How much is it?

186
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:02,250
It is 27,864 Yen. (approx. £172/$195)

187
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Really?!

188
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
A small price to pay for this quality.

189
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,250
So expensive!

190
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,890
Can we see the DAIGO check?

191
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,060
I feel sorry for DAIGO.

192
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,570
Hamada has a slightly surprising top to present.

193
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,970
Your usual image is something like this.

194
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,580
I think this sorta thing is good to wear casually.

195
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,580
The bag is pretty small.

196
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,580
It's a baggier look.

197
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,020
I don't have anything like this.

198
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,460
A baseball shirt.

199
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,700
It's a different look right?

200
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,640
This is just troublesome...

201
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,640
No it's not!

202
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,310
This kinda thing is comfy to wear.

203
00:09:52,470 --> 00:10:00,110
10,584 Yen (approx. £68/$74)

204
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,670
That's a good point.

205
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,710
This is something new to me.

206
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,280
You haven't worn anything like this before, right?

207
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,320
You can wear it open or closed.

208
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
Nah. This isn't it.

209
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,320
It's different, but isn't that a good thing?

210
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,860
It doesn't suit him at all!

211
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,530
This is the worst so far.

212
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,570
I can't say for certain, but...

213
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,070
...judging by his face, it's not great.

214
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,570
This is gonna be a new DAIGO.

215
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,910
That's enough already!

216
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,780
Next up is an attacking top from Endo.

217
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,110
We've seen that...

218
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,280
...you mostly wear tight clothes, right?

219
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,020
I thought maybe something a little baggier.

220
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,060
I don't have anything in this colour.

221
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,060
Wow!

222
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,060
My eyes hurt!

223
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,900
It's baggier like mine.

224
00:10:50,400 --> 00:11:08,010
5,389 Yen (approx. £35/$38)

225
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,560
It's way too big!

226
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,400
You're saying it's too big, but...

227
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,940
...this is from BUCCA, TKO Kinoshita's store.

228
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,810
The meaning behind the name of BUCCA is baggy.

229
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,010
Instead of being tight.

230
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,480
It just looks like a pain to wear.

231
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,690
It looks great on you!

232
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,090
Stop lying!

233
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,560
It really looks great on you!

234
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,960
It really doesn't!

235
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,370
It really suits you!

236
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,170
It's certainly adventurous.

237
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,710
There's a lot of adventure here.

238
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,640
Please do your check.

239
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,810
Is that alright? Ok here we go!

240
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,450
That's enough.

241
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,480
Hoping to show an excellent top, last up is Tanaka.

242
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:52,390
This is...

243
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,520
You beating the others?

244
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,430
Yes, this is truly on another level.

245
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,960
Look at him laughing.

246
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,500
That's not what this segment is about Tanaka.

247
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,540
It's not about the laughs.

248
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,540
I'm being serious here.

249
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,900
Really...

250
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,540
...I'm truly being serious.

251
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,740
This is truly nice.

252
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,980
What is this?!

253
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,350
It's really cool!

254
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,280
What is this?!

255
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,120
Tanaka-san, what are you thinking?

256
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,120
This is really cool.

257
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,820
It's a leather jacket.

258
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,960
It's a rocker's leather jacket.

259
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,030
It's full of holes.

260
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,200
Did you spend all night making this yourself?

261
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,400
It's undersized right?

262
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:46,280
32,184 Yen (approx. £205/$225)

263
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,370
Yes.

264
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,510
I found this in Harajuku...

265
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,510
...it's nice right?

266
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,740
It's a true rocker's style.

267
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,740
See.

268
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,740
See, doesn't it look great!

269
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:56,690
This is the first time I've worn such a light leather jacket.

270
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,690
I'm gonna do the check.

271
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,090
That's enough.

272
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,100
Which top will DAIGO choose as his favourite?

273
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,970
This is...

274
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,800
What are you unsure of?

275
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,800
Is there something?

276
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
I'm not sure...

277
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
It's kinda...

278
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:17,510
I'm in a bit of a panic.

279
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,310
I'm in a bit of a panic.

280
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,980
In first place is?

281
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,620
First is...

282
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:35,160
Endo

283
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:35,160
Hamada

284
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:35,160
Hosei

285
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:35,160
Matsumoto

286
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:35,160
Tanaka

287
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,860
THIS!

288
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,200
YOU GOTTA BE JOKING!!

289
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,940
NO WAY!

290
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,670
This is first because...

291
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,510
...it feels like a new rock.

292
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,340
Now we're in a bit of a panic.

293
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,780
Now we're in a bit of a panic.

294
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,780
In second place is?

295
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,780
In second is...

296
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,450
Endo

297
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,450
Hamada

298
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,450
Hosei

299
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,450
Matsumoto

300
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,090
This one.

301
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,990
Thank you.

302
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,260
There's no way.

303
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,590
DAIGO-kun has no idea.

304
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,890
Truly no clue.

305
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,630
No way this is top two.

306
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,730
Of course it's this.

307
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,800
The reason?

308
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,130
I just don't have anything like this.

309
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,570
I just don't have anything like this.

310
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,240
I also like the idea of fusing baseball and rock.

311
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,670
I also like the idea of fusing baseball and rock.

312
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,170
There's no way.

313
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,170
They just don't go together.

314
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,810
So, which is in third place?

315
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,910
In third place is...

316
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,250
Think this through properly.

317
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,220
Endo

318
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,220
Hosei

319
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,220
Matsumoto

320
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,920
It's this.

321
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,790
YES!! I DID IT!!

322
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,090
It should've been first though!

323
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,430
Nah, it's third.

324
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,900
You're kidding right?

325
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,730
I'm being serious.

326
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,000
Wha wha wha wha ... what's good about this?

327
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,270
Wha wha wha wha ... what's good about this?

328
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:50,470
Wha wha wha wha ... what's good about this?

329
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,600
Wha wha wha wha ... what's good about this?

330
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:50,840
Wha wha wha wha ... what's good about this?

331
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,140
Wha wha wha wha ... what's good about this?

332
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,170
It's even short on the arms.

333
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,170
That's what's good about it.

334
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,810
I actually really like this sort of thing.

335
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,320
Which of these tops will be ranked the worst?

336
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
Ok, here we go, last place.

337
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,320
Endo

338
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,320
Hosei

339
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,350
In last is...?

340
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,190
No way!

341
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,990
I also thought so...

342
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,530
To be honest, it's just too far away from what I'd wear.

343
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:29,470
It looks like something you wear for the 24 hour batsu.

344
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,470
It's not that bad.

345
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,910
Endo has to pay out 5,389 yen (approx. £35/$38)

346
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,310
Next up...

347
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,380
An accessory to suit DAIGO. First up is Hamada.

348
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,750
I don't think you wear shorts very often.

349
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,190
I don't think you wear shorts very often.

350
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,190
I never wear them.

351
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,260
I don't have any shorts.

352
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,690
You don't have any shorts?

353
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,690
Yeah, I don't.

354
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,460
Is it an accessory?

355
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,170
There are all sorts of accessories.

356
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,240
That doesn't suit his image.

357
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,740
5,400 Yen (approx. £34/$38)

358
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,110
Yeah but, he said he doesn't have any shorts and...

359
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,410
...they can also be used as swim shorts.

360
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,120
This season's spring and summer collections...

361
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,520
...and high fashion have this kind of look.

362
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,060
You don't have to force yourself.

363
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,290
I'll go and try them on.

364
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,290
Really?

365
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,290
You want to try them on?

366
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,670
I feel sorry for DAIGO.

367
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,500
He's really trying hard.

368
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,400
It's a different image for him, wearing shorts.

369
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,970
He should be done, come out DAIGO.

370
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:49,090
Why are you still wearing the boots and gloves?

371
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,990
The boots make it look weird.

372
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,060
DAIGO can you do your thing?

373
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,060
Sure, let's give it a go.

374
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,000
Looks great!

375
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,330
There's no way!

376
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,500
First with his top, how will Tanaka do with his accessory?

377
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,440
I'm avoiding last.

378
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,670
He and I have got the best connection...

379
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,240
...out of all of us.

380
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,880
I'm gonna win this one too.

381
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,010
Earlier was just by chance.

382
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,180
It's small.

383
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,550
I think this is a great accessory.

384
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,460
What is this?

385
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,460
A choker.

386
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,160
Ah, a choker.

387
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,860
Lame.

388
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,500
This guy really gives off weird vibes sometimes.

389
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:49,480
10,584 Yen (approx. £66/$73)

390
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,880
How is it?

391
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,210
It's pretty sparkly.

392
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,480
Does it say "SEXY"?

393
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,880
That's so lame.

394
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,250
Why is that lame?

395
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,090
It's super cool.

396
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,930
You don't have anything this size right?

397
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,930
Nothing this big, no.

398
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,700
Sengoku busho = Armoured generals of the Sengoku period (1467–1615)

399
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,700
This is what Sengoku busho wore around their necks.

400
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,140
Endo's accessory is little different, animal style.

401
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,370
If I'm not mistaken you're also on a horse racing program, right?

402
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,370
Ah, horse racing.

403
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,880
Yes I am.

404
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,480
What's that?

405
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,920
They're gloves.

406
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,420
Gross.

407
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,750
The gloves feature a horse's hoof.

408
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:37,760
2,230 Yen (approx. £13/$15)

409
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,330
It's Midori no Makibaō.

410
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,330
Midori no Makibaō is a Japanese manga
about a mule becoming a racehorse

411
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,770
There's also boots...

412
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,770
There's four of 'em?

413
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,840
2,680 Yen (approx. £17/$19)

414
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,770
Are they covers?

415
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,040
Yeah, you can wear them over your shoes.

416
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,370
I do really like horses but...

417
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,770
But...?

418
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,680
You look great!

419
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,880
You can't see his hands!

420
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,520
You're signing right?

421
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,420
We can't see his fingers!

422
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,260
This is certainly something new.

423
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,890
This is unfair!

424
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,930
This is too good!

425
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,330
Next up to present his item to DAIGO, Matsumoto.

426
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,400
This is...

427
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,340
...this is the one.

428
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,470
This is the winner here.

429
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,050
This is...

430
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,050
Right?!

431
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,280
Yeah yeah yeah.

432
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,280
It's rock.

433
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,990
It's rock.

434
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,390
A fan?

435
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,260
It's a rock fan.

436
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,830
This is pretty apt.

437
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,830
Exactly.

438
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,760
27,000 Yen (approx. £167/$187)

439
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,760
This is truly fresh!

440
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,000
This is the sorta thing you should be getting!

441
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
You guys are the strange ones!

442
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,470
Nah, we're not.

443
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,410
Do you wanna...

444
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,980
...do your rock check? It'll look so cool.

445
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,250
Ok, here we go.

446
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,880
Here we go.

447
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,330
Last up to show his accessory, Hosei.

448
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:27,540
I also like rock style stuff, so I've got a good sense for this.

449
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,540
You can't forget about the rock.

450
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,680
This is something, but...

451
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,350
What is that?

452
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,920
It's a skull, but...

453
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,620
Huh?

454
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,220
What is this?

455
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,590
This...

456
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,920
...it's a bag.

457
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,160
A bag?

458
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,920
Ah, I see.

459
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,630
It's so small.

460
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,130
It looks so weird.

461
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,170
It's so weird.

462
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,600
You just carry it like that?

463
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,640
Yeah.

464
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,640
You can probably wear it over your shoulder too.

465
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,740
Try it over the shoulder.

466
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,780
It looks like a Tengu.

467
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,780
Tengu = A creature from Japanese folklore.

468
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,950
Tengu's are often depicted with red faces and long noses.

469
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,950
Where's the Tengu's nose?

470
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,390
How much was it?

471
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,020
It was

472
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,960
21,384 yen (approx. £130/$148)

473
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,790
So expensive!

474
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,960
Everything you get is expensive!

475
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,930
Ok, I'll try it out.

476
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,930
What is that?

477
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,470
It's like a festival dance.

478
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,140
The Tengu looks like he's been cremated.

479
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,780
His nose has burnt off.

480
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,620
Which of these will be DAIGO's favourite?

481
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,580
In first place is...?

482
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:55,560
Endo

483
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:55,560
Hamada

484
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:55,560
Hosei

485
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:55,560
Matsumoto

486
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:55,560
Tanaka

487
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,890
In first place is...

488
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,630
This one!

489
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,630
YES! Of Course it is!

490
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,630
It couldn't be anything else!

491
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,500
There's no way it'd be anything different!

492
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,200
I felt like Matsumoto-san really put some thought into this...

493
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,010
I felt like Matsumoto-san really put some thought into this...

494
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,040
I felt like Matsumoto-san really put some thought into this...

495
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,880
It's the

496
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:15,310
Wind of Rock.

497
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,310
I want him to feel the

498
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,280
Let's move on to second place...

499
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,780
Endo

500
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,780
Hamada

501
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,780
Hosei

502
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,780
Tanaka

503
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,280
In second place is...

504
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,280
This!

505
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,390
Thank you!

506
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,660
Well, that makes sense.

507
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,660
Of course it does.

508
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,930
Since you don't have any shorts, and they work as swim shorts too.

509
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,430
If we were looking for a new DAIGO, then this is first.

510
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,600
Thank you.

511
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,300
It really is...

512
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:43,070
...Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai ya Arrahende!

513
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,440
In third is...?

514
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,210
In third is...

515
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:52,580
Endo

516
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:52,580
Hosei

517
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:52,580
Tanaka

518
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:52,580
This one.

519
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,950
Of course.

520
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,720
You're joking right?!

521
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,650
Of course.

522
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,650
With "SEXY" on it!!

523
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,650
Ehh, really?!

524
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,650
These two again!

525
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:25,280
Which will come in last, Endo's horse gloves or Hosei's skull bag?

526
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,850
I don't think I should lose to that.

527
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,890
So DAIGO...

528
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,720
in last place is...?

529
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:34,860
Endo

530
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:34,860
Hosei

531
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,220
In last is...

532
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,090
C'mon.

533
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,460
Please.

534
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,460
The worst is...

535
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,870
It's this.

536
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,240
Of course it is.

537
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,070
Endo to pay 4,910 yen (approx. £30/$34)

538
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,370
But, DAIGO.

539
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,610
Which was worse... well of course this was worse...

540
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,840
Which was worse... well of course this was worse...

541
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,340
...but what about this one?

542
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,750
This was... the opposite of Rock.

543
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,710
This was... the opposite of Rock.

544
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,790
Maybe something to stick to the fridge.
