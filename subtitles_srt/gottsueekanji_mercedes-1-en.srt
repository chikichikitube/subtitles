00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:12,890
I am reporting from the headquarters of
Mercedes Venz in Stuttgart, Germany

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,600
where a test drive is in process

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,890
We are here

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,240
to observe how they conduct a test drive

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,520
On their latest '97 Venz model

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,420
Rumor has it that the model

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,840
has undergone a 100% change from previous years

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,040
So without further adieu

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,640
Here's the world's first footage

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,850
of the Venz' latest model

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,650
C'mon now

13
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,770
This way, this way

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,620
Yes, yes

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,370
What's the hold up?

16
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,140
Pick it up

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,140
You can do this

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,740
Faster, faster

19
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,550
Come around this way

20
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,750
Around the corner

21
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,150
Alright, alright

22
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,250
Stop right here

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,340
Alright, are we good?

24
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,350
Let's do a test run

25
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,120
Let's beat your time from yesterday, OK?

26
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,420
Ready

27
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,540
Go!

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,570
No good, no good

29
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,940
Come on back

30
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,770
Get back here

31
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,020
Come back

32
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,020
That's a good boy

33
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,100
Don't forget to look both ways

34
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,300
before you start into drive

35
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,540
It's called defensive driving

36
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,770
"What if a child runs into the street?"

37
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,020
"What if a cyclist shows up"

38
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,050
That's being defensive

39
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,370
So don't ever forget to look both ways before you go

40
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,170
Don't ever assume anything

41
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,770
"Oh, I should be fine to go"

42
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,440
or, "Oh, nobody's gonna jump out in front of me"

43
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,770
That's a dumb move

44
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,700
You ready?

45
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,700
Look both ways

46
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,000
Both ways

47
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,250
Yes, both ways

48
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,450
Look to the right again

49
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,420
just to be sure

50
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,100
OK, let's go

51
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,100
Let's do better than yesterday

52
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,450
better than yesterday

53
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,400
Oh no, the rain

54
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,300
Here comes the rain

55
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,250
Raining

56
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,240
Alright, good job

57
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,550
Let's wait it out

58
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,570
Wait it out

59
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,120
OK, no more rain

60
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,340
Rain's over

61
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,050
Shake it off

62
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,370
Shake the water off

63
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,720
You're making better time than yesterday

64
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,020
Keep it up

65
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,170
Looking good

66
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,120
Alright, alright

67
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,450
Good boy

68
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,970
Good job

69
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,570
Let's break for lunch

70
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,250
Go for it

71
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,150
Wait!

72
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,540
Hold on!

73
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,770
It looks as though Japanese automakers
will face stiff competition

74
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,850
Good boy

75
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,650
Good boy

76
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,440
We'll be heading to Japan very soon

77
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,770
That's my boy

78
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,770
This model also comes in red
