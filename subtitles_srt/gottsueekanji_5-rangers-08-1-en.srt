00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,700
The Future Century
Squadron: The Five Rangai!

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:14,220
You know, the manager said...
he wants to break up with me.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,480
Tha selfish jerk!

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,340
I can't stand that ass-hole.
- I understand.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,640
Hey.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,060
Ryoko-chan, do you want me
to give you a shampoo?

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,000
Why shampoo?
- Because I'm good at it!

8
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,440
Maybe I'll ley you do it then.
- Don't, Ryoko.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,800
Shut up! It's none of your business.
Come to Aoyama, 3:00, ok? - Don't.

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,500
Heeelp!
- Take this!

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,800
Stop!

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,560
Blue Rangai!

13
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,140
Green Rangai!

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,180
Ladies, run, now!

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,880
Our powers combined!

16
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,160
The Five Rangai!

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,200
Bring it on!
- 5 Rangai will take you on!

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,720
Wait. You're too short for 5 Rangai!

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,180
Save your breath. Come on!
Let's not go into it now.

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,960
But there're only 2 of you!
What happened?

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,500
Let's not go into details.
- Don't talk about number.

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,300
Wait!

23
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,980
We pull evils of this world!
We pull evils by force of justice!

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
We are.

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,360
After School Electromagnetic Wave Club!
(from another sketch)

26
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,580
Let's have it out, Dokuro-san.
- Let's fight, now!

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,360
Stop it, you morons!

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,860
We pull evils!

29
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,720
Why are you divided into 2 groups?

30
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,760
You have no business here. Get out!
- Go away.

31
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,540
Before you boot them, look closely
at these guys who have been with you.

32
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,320
Don't you feel anything?
Turn around!

33
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,460
I'm ashamed.
- You'd been with these guys.

34
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,940
I'm disgusted with them. -Hey!
We are doing this in real earnest!

35
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,720
Bring it! Are you ready, South Pole?
- You bet, North Pole.

36
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:43,720
Fight us, Dokuro-san, fight!
- Stop!

37
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,020
Don't crouch! You're showing it!

38
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,460
Let me explain, please.
- I said don't crouch!

39
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,020
Hey, get a grip!
- We decided we'll try really hard.

40
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,080
But he said he can't forget his brother
and wants to make a new team.

41
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,620
Why did you betrayed us
and joined him?

42
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:14,200
Because he said he can't make it
by himself alone and he needs me.

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
And I was tempted by his costume.

44
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,580
Yeah, you always liked exposure.
- Dokuro-san, fight us, not them.

45
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,600
No, fight us. - Wait. You guys had
been in this together till last week.

46
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,980
Why don't you unite as a team?

47
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,920
Then you should come back
to 5 Rangai. - No! No!

48
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,860
You should join us. - No! Hell no!

49
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,920
What Poles can we be?

50
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,160
There couldn't be another Pole.
- They're right, North Pole.

51
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,640
We can find a way if we try.

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,940
Listen to me. Unite as 5 Rangai!

53
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,740
I can't. Not with these guys.
- Let me handle this!

54
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,120
Pink Rangai!

55
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,740
What? - Why?
- Don't crouch!

56
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,740
Oh, brother!
- You guys are just naked!

57
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,200
As naked as jaybird!

58
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,960
I thought you are dead.
-  There's a reason for this.

59
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:28,200
Tell him, Blue.
- That's about 1,2 months ago...

60
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:34,780
Every week he came here
to get scolded by Dokuro-san.

61
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,000
So we had meetings every week to
discuss what we should do about him.

62
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:48,640
But they always make excuses, with cold
and part time job. Once there were only 2.

63
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:57,100
We thought if we go on like this, we'll
fall apart. So he... - I staged this.

64
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,220
So this is your idea.
- Is that true? - Yes.

65
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,820
This is a good opportunity for you
to get together as 5 Rangai again.

66
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,060
Why don't you take this opportunity?
- That's not good!

67
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,880
Why, South Pole? What's troubling you?
- Too late for that.

68
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,260
But what other option do we have?
- Just stick to... it.

69
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,400
To what?
- Electromagnetic Wave Club.

70
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,400
What about all the trouble I had?

71
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,560
I can't fight with you guys
if you're like this now.

72
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,240
All of you got to be in for 5 Rangai.
You got to unite!

73
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:45,700
I understand. We'll discuss about
how we should start over.

74
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,140
So, please fight Magnectic Wave Club
just for today. - No!

75
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,480
We pull evils!
- Just bring it!

76
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,400
I don't like to fight and watch out for
it not showing at the same time.

77
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,760
Don't worry about that.
- We just cut all corners.

78
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,700
No way I'm gonna fight
with naked guys.

79
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,000
Look, it's good thing he's back.
- Yes.

80
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,460
You should unite as a team.
Start all over again as 5 Rangai.

81
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:25,760
We'll think about whether we join them
or they join us. - That's your choice.

82
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,140
Sorry, about all this. - Let's fight
next week. Full 5 Rangai vs me.

83
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:38,180
Sorry about the vulgarity.
- Don't crouch! Hold yourself erect!

84
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:45,820
Can I go first?
- You are just in the raw!

85
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,300
Goodbye.
- Bye. We'll do it right next time.

86
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,780
Don't forget to unite!
- We won't.

87
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,440
The Future Century Squadron: The Five Rangai!   To be con't.
