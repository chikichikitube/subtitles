00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,140
I thought there was nothing...

3
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:33,990
that could rival or surpass Documental.

4
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,760
It was an idea that just came to
me when we were having a meeting.

5
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,060
If I can expand the
scope of the project a little,

6
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,700
I think we can make
something worthy of it.

7
00:00:53,690 --> 00:01:00,540
The weakest is the strongest, and
I think you'll agree when you see it.

8
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:06,400
I'd like to see more than
just comedians competing.

9
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,280
Maybe the most interesting
person in the world

10
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,580
is really the second-most interesting,

11
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,870
and the most interesting person
is the one who does nothing.

12
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,760
Is that it? I think I'm getting
to the point where that's true.

13
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,480
The title of the project is "Freeze."

14
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,690
It's made from the idea of doing nothing.

15
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,750
But I'm sure there will be laughter in it.

16
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,970
I think it'll be...

17
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,440
interesting.

18
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,090
It's Nana Suzuki.

19
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,360
She's dressed up nicely, isn't she?

20
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:27,510
I don't think this is the kind of
project she needs to dress up for.

21
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,250
I don't know which outfit
is suitable for me, though.

22
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,890
Hi, I'm Nana Suzuki.

23
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,560
It's nice to meet you.

24
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,700
They didn't tell me anything about today.

25
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,780
I didn't know what I
was getting myself into.

26
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,570
So I'm really worried.

27
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,640
I'm really anxious.

28
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,180
I haven't really been told anything.

29
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,010
I'm really nervous.

30
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,100
I'm super nervous right now.

31
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,220
I’m entering.

32
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,070
What is this?

33
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,700
Bobby, huh?

34
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,740
I think he's a timid person.

35
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,360
He's a big guy,

36
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,190
but I think he's timid.

37
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,820
OK, I found a good seat.

38
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,050
I'm comfortable here.

39
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,540
I don’t think I'll have any problems.

40
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,640
I mean, even if I wanted to
react, I wouldn't be able to.

41
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:39,490
It's easier to be told not to do
anything than to be told to react.

42
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,850
I don't want to sit next to you.

43
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,940
Why not?

44
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,420
Well, you scream.

45
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,580
Non-chan is a bit mysterious to me.

46
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,090
As for not moving, I'm not the type of
person who moves around that much.

47
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:19,480
I generally spend a lot of time
very still when I'm recording a show.

48
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,830
Are they recording from everywhere?

49
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,480
That’s weird.

50
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,590
Are there any safe angles? I'm exposed.

51
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,300
None at all.

52
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,350
I'm sure they'll record it.

53
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,360
It's OK to move, right?

54
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,550
Yes, you can.

55
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,210
Can we move once we've sat down?

56
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,060
I think he’s another timid one.

57
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,120
To be honest, I'm a bit nervous
about the Amazon project.

58
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,860
I'm assuming I'm going to be frozen.

59
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,670
Yeah.

60
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,310
- What are they going to do?
- I'm scared.

61
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,470
It's like a rich man's game.

62
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,380
A bunch of sociopaths.

63
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,130
You're probably right.

64
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,980
But it's not like that.

65
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,480
What? You scared me!

66
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,790
You scared me!

67
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,620
A little change in the type of people.

68
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,800
Hey!

69
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,390
What's with these boring members?

70
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,920
Hello, I'm Kazumi Morohoshi.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,780
I've heard the title.
It's called "Freeze."

72
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,910
It's definitely an adult prank.

73
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,960
I roughly know what it’s going to be.

74
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,820
We're not boring people.

75
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,070
What do they think of this?

76
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,130
I wonder how well they know each other.

77
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,310
Your clothes are kind of dirty.

78
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,680
No, yours are too damaged.

79
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,440
This is expensive.

80
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,080
No, that’s what unfashionable people say.

81
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,340
How much was it?

82
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,210
Oh, Shizu-chan.

83
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,590
Another boring person.

84
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,790
I think she might be a winning candidate.

85
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:21,090
It's an Amazon project,
and it's with Matsumoto-san.

86
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,060
So I'm really scared.

87
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,830
I don't know what to do.

88
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,930
Isn't this a great line-up?

89
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,710
I love this line-up.

90
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,830
I can't help it.

91
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,660
Oh, it's Kuro-Chan.

92
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,380
A more boring person came.

93
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,360
In a way, he's quite extraordinary.

94
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,410
What?

95
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,640
Why did you hit me?

96
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,810
Morohoshi-san?

97
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,720
What's the matter? Why did you hit me?

98
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,830
It's Kuro-chan from Yasuda Circus.

99
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,310
You know "freeze", where you
hold up your hands and stop.

100
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,920
That's what they say when
you're pointing a pistol at someone?

101
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,890
That's right.

102
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,180
Are we going to be shot?

103
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,620
That's interesting.
The choice of shirt is interesting too.

104
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,290
Feather patterns.

105
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,110
Hello, I'm Diamond Yukai.

106
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,130
Well, I don't know what this is.

107
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,340
But I'll do my best anyway.

108
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,980
They're not just comedians.

109
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:46,720
They’re a mix of men and women,
and from different walks of life.

110
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,680
- What will happen?
- I don't know what's going to happen.

111
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,730
- Hi, everyone.
- Oh, he appeared.

112
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,530
- Good morning.
- So, how are you all feeling?

113
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,450
What do you mean how are we feeling?

114
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,960
I have no idea what that means.

115
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,630
We don’t even know what's going to happen.

116
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,120
How well are you today, physically?

117
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,850
- What?
- "Physically"?

118
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,990
Will it be something to do
with our physical condition?

119
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,070
It will be related to your condition.

120
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,030
I want you all to aim to win.

121
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,210
- Win?
- Be ready for anything.

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,300
By the way, your heart rate...

123
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,950
I'm measuring it.

124
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,110
You are wearing trackers.

125
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,040
Who do you think has the highest?

126
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,430
Who is it?

127
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,660
There's one person
who's really high right now.

128
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,630
It's Morohoshi.

129
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,200
What?!

130
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,040
You're so nervous.

131
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,800
What? Is that so?

132
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,940
- That's so lame!
- It's really unexpected.

133
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,690
- Did you make a joke because you're nervous?
- That's suspicious.

134
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:53,990
Kuro-chan's heart rate didn’t go
up at all when Morohoshi hit him.

135
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,510
What?

136
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,120
Why did you hit me?

137
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,130
Morohoshi-san?

138
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,370
What's the matter? Why did you hit me?

139
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,250
Does heart rate have
anything to do with it?

140
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,170
I'm just trying to give you an
idea of what I'm talking about.

141
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,100
But still.

142
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,820
We can't freeze our heart rate.

143
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,380
We'd die.

144
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:21,960
By the way, Kuro-chan's heart rate suddenly
went up when I said it didn't before.

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,570
You can't say such things, Matsumoto-san.

146
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,970
- It's funny.
- It's not cool.

147
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,040
I don't really care. Now, everyone,

148
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,470
today I'd like to ask you all to
compete with very simple rules.

149
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,030
When you hear "freeze", don't move.

150
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,800
That's it.

151
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,320
No matter what happens, don't move at all.

152
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,430
Don't move at all. If
you do that, you'll win.

153
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,710
If you don't move, you win. The person
who doesn't do anything is the best.

154
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,040
No reaction.

155
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:11,040
And keep it that way
until you hear "release."

156
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,570
Just keep your arms folded.

157
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,310
And your face a little tighter.

158
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,170
Actually, it's better to not talk.

159
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,220
Because your mouth would move.

160
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,640
Something's going to happen, isn't it?

161
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,570
Something might happen.

162
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,920
Of course it will.

163
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,680
So we freeze and fold our
arms? And then release.

164
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,030
If it's a release, you can talk.

165
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,220
This is scary.

166
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,730
I'm really scared.

167
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,330
I'm so nervous.

168
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,400
And, ladies and gentlemen,
there will be a prize for the winner.

169
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,320
One million yen!

170
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,700
- Wow!
- I want it!

171
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,330
One million yen for doing nothing.

172
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,850
- Awesome.
- I want it!

173
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,790
What do you think? I
think it's really easy.

174
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,620
Yeah, you just don't react and
you get one million yen. It's so easy.

175
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,500
That's right.

176
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,590
So, first of all, this is the first stage.

177
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,650
Two of you will be eliminated.

178
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,510
Does that sound okay, Shizu-chan?

179
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:20,870
You know, I feel like I can keep
from moving. But I'm really sensitive.

180
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,240
Sensitive, huh?

181
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,830
The right breast is more
sensitive than the left.

182
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,750
What is that, stop it.

183
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,070
Fujimon, who do you think
is your strongest opponent?

184
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,500
Who do I think? I think Yukai-san.

185
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,470
Me too a bit. I think he's
one of the favorites to win.

186
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,110
Well, then, I'd like to get started.

187
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,340
I'm scared.

188
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,730
I'm looking forward to it!

189
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,380
- Is it starting?
- Don't worry, we haven't been told to freeze yet.

190
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,670
Oh, not yet?

191
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,520
I really can't.

192
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,260
Will it come suddenly?

193
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,950
Starting. It’s starting.

194
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,610
It’s fine now. We can
talk and move normally.

195
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,880
- We aren’t frozen yet.
- It's too dangerous.

196
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,270
Let's just get it all out now.

197
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,400
Freeze, freeze!

198
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,870
- What's going on?
- Stop it!

199
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,780
- Stop that.
- Stop it!

200
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,480
Don't say it.

201
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,840
He's the nervous one.

202
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,630
He's trying to
ease his nerves, so he's joking around.

203
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,110
I'm so scared.

204
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,330
- Is it okay?
- Don't you have to cross your arms?

205
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,090
You freeze. Freeze and cross your arms.

206
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,690
That's it. You should just relax, right?

207
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,120
Well, we’d better get started then.

208
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,450
Here we go.

209
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,550
Why do you freeze now?

210
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,840
No, no, no. What did you say?

211
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,270
Isn't this great?

212
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,280
Good, good.

213
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,530
This is hell.

214
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,390
Well, let's do it then, shall we?

215
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,250
They're doing well.

216
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,440
It's tough, isn't it?

217
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,740
How are the heart rates?

218
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,060
They haven't changed that much yet.

219
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,020
Everyone is doing well freezing so far.

220
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,540
They're doing well.

221
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,990
What was that?!

222
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,560
I can still hear it!

223
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,240
- You did pretty good.
- Hang on, my ears...

224
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,330
You're all moving too much.

225
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,670
The thing is still lit.

226
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,240
- No, no, no!
- It's alright.

227
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,860
It’s alright. That’s different.

228
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,070
I’m scared!

229
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,680
Wait a minute!

230
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,570
Nothing happened.

231
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,490
What?!

232
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,900
- Is that the first thing?
- Something that big?

233
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,370
Basically...

234
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,480
you all moved.

235
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,660
No way!

236
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,300
Would you like to see it a little slower?

237
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,760
Look at Diamond Yukai!

238
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,950
There are people like this!

239
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,140
Morohoshi-san too.

240
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,430
Yukai-san and Morohoshi-san are amazing.

241
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,010
I think it's strange
they didn't move at all.

242
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,290
We did move.

243
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,180
I can't do this either.

244
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,000
I tried to hold back,
but it just came out.

245
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,860
I'll give it back to you.

246
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,190
What was that weird
pause before it exploded?

247
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,190
- What are we going to do? This is only the beginning.
- This is bad.

248
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,730
I tried my best to hold
back, but my voice came out.

249
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,980
I know, I was there.

250
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,580
Bang!

251
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,330
There was a huge bang sound.

252
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,910
I didn't expect such
a level from the start.

253
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,270
I was so scared.

254
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,720
I thought, "isn't this dangerous?"

255
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,920
I wondered if it was really safe.

256
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,620
If it explodes, I think I'll die.

257
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,020
I don't know if the people
watching this will get it.

258
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,390
It's really loud.

259
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,510
Of course we'll move, right?

260
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,960
It's so loud.

261
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,520
It's the kind of thing you throw at a
criminal who's holed up in a building.

262
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,600
Are you easily scared?

263
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,340
I'm very timid.

264
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,760
The other day, I was in the dressing
room with Haranishi, and we were alone.

265
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,460
Haranishi suddenly stood up.

266
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,540
I was so surprised.

267
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,600
Like that.

268
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,640
- That smoke was bad.
- My ears hurt.

269
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,110
- It's bad for the eyes.
- Here we go.

270
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,440
Shizu-chan is good. She’s
got a good expression.

271
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,230
Neither a man nor a woman anymore.

272
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,730
It's a good face.

273
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,560
Well, shall we give it a try?

274
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,300
Let's see who we get.

275
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,860
Bobby's smiling the whole time.

276
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,010
I told him to keep a straight face.

277
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,970
His face is annoying.

278
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,950
I've got an idea.

279
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,620
Let's go to Yukai again.

280
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,820
Turn it up to the max.

281
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,210
Awesome, Yukai.

282
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,930
Yukai is amazing.

283
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,310
Stop laughing!

284
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,240
Bobby, you...

285
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,730
Stop laughing!

286
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,870
Wait a second, it's hilarious.

287
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
It hurt!

288
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,630
Why Yukai-san?

289
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,770
- The rhythmic hitting it was doing was hilarious.
- But it hurts!

290
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,600
The most painful part
is when it scrapes you.

291
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:01,430
If you do something like that right
in front of me, of course I'll laugh.

292
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,250
What was that?

293
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:10,210
I don't mind my leg being hit like that.

294
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,680
But the hardest part...

295
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,450
is the scraping!

296
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,540
The shin.

297
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,500
That part almost made me scream.

298
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,330
Does it hurt?

299
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,420
Yes, it hurts.

300
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,260
But every time it hits me,

301
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,190
I can hear them laughing.

302
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,430
Bobby was laughing, wasn't he?

303
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,860
Morohoshi was laughing too, I think.

304
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,220
I thought it was rude of them.

305
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,800
Yeah, rude.

306
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,000
Watching Yukai-san...

307
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,100
I thought it was going to break his leg.

308
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:54,350
It was going round and
round, hitting from the outside.

309
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,930
I couldn't stop laughing.

310
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,470
I want to see the part where
Yukai-san gets hit again.

311
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,860
Okay, it’s starting.

312
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,500
Why is Yukai-san good at...

313
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,060
I don't think I can do this.

314
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,030
Diamond Yukai, so funny.

315
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,190
Diamond Yukai is so funny!

316
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,260
What the hell?

317
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,560
He's almost like a mannequin.

318
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,020
Okay, let's go to someone else.

319
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,700
Bobby.

320
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,300
I like Bobby.

321
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,740
You've got a good face.

322
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,450
Good.

323
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,610
Nice, nice.

324
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,480
Bobby's holding back.

325
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,030
I think that's good.

326
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,970
Enough of the little
bat. Let's try knives.

327
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,380
It hurts, it hurts!

328
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,230
So scary!

329
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,560
What was that?

330
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,750
No, no, no.

331
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,220
Hang on a minute.

332
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,820
Why wouldn't you move?

333
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,810
Of course you'd move!

334
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,980
I didn't think they'd use a drone.

335
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,930
And they attached a knife.

336
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,840
That’s not right.

337
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,130
How could they hit me?

338
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,820
That has to be an accident.

339
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:20,710
I never thought drones
would be used like that.

340
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,580
What about the drone?

341
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,580
It came at me like this.

342
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,130
Diamond Yukai, so funny.

343
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,340
Diamond Yukai is so funny!

344
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,310
It's like it's moving around my chin, too.

345
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,390
It's so unpredictable!

346
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,240
No seat changes?

347
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,820
I can't do this.

348
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:46,080
Please don't put me facing Yukai.

349
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,950
I'd like to change seats.

350
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:53,980
Fujimon thinks Yukai is
so funny. He's hooked.

351
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,230
I hope you get hurt a bit.

352
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,750
People don't find it funny
when comedians get hurt.

353
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,930
That’s not true.

354
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,490
Now, it's time to move on.

355
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,720
Shi-chan's face right now...

356
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,810
She looks like a news anchor, you know?

357
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,040
It's great.

358
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,600
Let's start...

359
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,040
from the middle.

360
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,820
This isn't good.

361
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,360
I would hate it too.

362
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,590
Let's see if Yukai can endure it.

363
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,200
Go to Morohoshi.

364
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,160
Looking good.

365
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,650
Makes me want to shoot him.

366
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
Shall we?

367
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,250
Morohoshi is good. Amazing.

368
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,900
Fujimon is so afraid.

369
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,430
Let’s go back to Morohoshi again.

370
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,710
Don't let him rest.

371
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,210
Oh, stop it! I can't do it anymore!

372
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,660
This is impossible!

373
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,780
It's too much.

374
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,700
Impossible.

375
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,890
I seriously can't do it.

376
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,900
No way. I'm going crazy.

377
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:18,890
You're too scared, Fujimon-san. Just a
little change in angle and you freak out.

378
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,330
Is this possible?

379
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,680
Wait a minute, please.

380
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
What?

381
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,130
Please stop it.

382
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,280
Ladies and gentlemen...

383
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:39,760
The first stage of the
competition has come to an end!

384
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,480
However,

385
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,140
two of you have been eliminated.

386
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,430
The worst was...

387
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,650
Fujimon!

388
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,350
You moved too much.

389
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,320
No, you’re supposed to move!

390
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,110
You need to tolerate it.

391
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,930
It's normal to move!

392
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,710
People who don't move
are crazy, seriously.

393
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,190
This was the most terrifying
moment of my life.

394
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,450
And now, one more person.

395
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:25,310
It was very close, but...

396
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,670
Kuro-chan is out!

397
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,790
Me?!

398
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,940
That’s unexpected.

399
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,880
- Because of the drone.
- Yes, he moved from it.

400
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,190
The knife hit me between my eyebrows.

401
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,730
Also, Yukai is so good.

402
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,460
He's so strong.

403
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,140
I think Yukai and Morohoshi
are very strong opponents.

404
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:06,150
Whenever Yukai-san has
something done to him, it's so funny.

405
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,990
It makes me laugh.

406
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,090
Here it is.

407
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,550
Diamond Yukai is so funny.

408
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,540
So, I'll leave you two,
Fujimon and Kuro-chan.

409
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:20,320
Everyone else, please
move to the second stage.

410
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:24,390
It's weird. The pistol
aimed at me so many times.

411
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:30,280
- It pointed at everyone.
- No, it faced me a lot more often.

412
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,380
So we just sit here?

413
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,610
That's right.

414
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,810
We've been eliminated.

415
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,950
Hey, get rid of this too.

416
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,850
Take this back quickly.

417
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,960
You know, when something bangs
in front of you, won’t you move?

418
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:49,800
Can you really not?

419
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,020
No, it's a big surprise.

420
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,030
No, just take it away quickly!

421
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,710
It was definitely frustrating.

422
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,570
The explosion and the gun
pointing at me were the worst.

423
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,250
I was scared to reach the goal.

424
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:20,000
The main reason I lost is probably
that the goal was taking so long.

425
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,140
I think I tried really hard.

426
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,610
I did my best.

427
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,830
Too much happened, more than I expected.

428
00:38:41,150 --> 00:39:07,170
