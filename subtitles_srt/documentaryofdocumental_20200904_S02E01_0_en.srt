00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,480
Well... to be honest...
The thing is that...

3
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,910
we had to let it go…
and put it away.

4
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,220
The highly controversial work

5
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,220
But I negotiated something

6
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,660
and I think some people
may actually like it.

7
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,060
Especially since we
went so far with this one.

00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,170
And if possible,

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,040
I'd really like everyone
to take a look at it.

doing comedy nonstop
since we won the M-1

91
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,570
but I'm feeling pretty excited
for the first time in a while.

92
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,700
I like Documental
as a comedian

93
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,610
And I laugh
with the straight man role.

94
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,650
I hope the others are funny.

95
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,420
Something I'm expecting from this

96
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,080
is for Soshina to be able to

97
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,450
take a new step forward
during this competition.

98
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,020
Depending on the other
straight man roles,

99
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,930
I might have to
refine my strategy.

100
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,130
Maybe I'll go all out,

101
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,900
or look at the others,
and act like an idiot.

102
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,570
He's pretty orthodox,

103
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,240
and doesn't have
experience with women.

104
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,910
So you have to wonder

105
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,280
how far a cherry-boy (Virgin) like him can go

106
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,450

107
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,520
I wonder what he'll do
after 20-30 minutes.

108
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,560
Alright, a guy...

109
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,800
Yo-san has some good surprises for you.

110
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,870
Whoa!

111
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,040
Good morning, Sensei!

112
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,570
—Akiyama-sensei!
—You're here? Hey!

113
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,540
You too, Soshina?

114
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,850
Akiyama-san!

115
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,620
I'm Akiyama Ryuuji from ROBERT.

116
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,550
You can leave
Documental to me.

117
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,230
I wonder
how many times it's been.

118
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,060
This is already
his fourth time.

119
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,170
So I want to see...

120
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,300
what else he can do,

121
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,510
or come up with.

122
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,310
I also wonder if I might
use up everything

123
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,080
that they haven't seen before
this time around.

124
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,950
I've already used the
Umemiyage act before,

125
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,720
so I've added some improvements
and I want to give it a try.

"The reliable creators"

127
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,870
I want to put up a fight
for the ages this time.

128
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,640
So I was talking to a female announcer,

129
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,770
and she got all embarrassed,

130
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,680
and told me she watched it.

131
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,510
I asked if she watched
the "hand service" part as well.

132
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,720
So her face got beet red,
and she left.

133
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,790
Maybe she liked it.

134
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,890
It wouldn't surprise me
if he won it eventually.

135
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,230
So maybe this time?
Finally?

136
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,530
I'm sure no one

137
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,470
would complain if I finally
won it all.

138
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,940
It's finally time!

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,600
Finally! Documental!

140
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,010
For real, I have to
settle my score here,

141
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,340
or I won't think straight.

142
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,310
Yeah, I know
this is how I'm ending the month.

143
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,080
What's with those sandals?

144
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,460
Who's gonna show up?

145
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,890
Wait, that's too soon!

146
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,730
You're dressed like that?!

147
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,060
So Matsuo's not coming?

148
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,970
I'm Matsuo from
Chocolate Planet.

149
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,300
I came to take
the ten million today.

150
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,910
Huh? Which one—? Whoa!

151
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:17,910
Ah right!

152
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,280
Matsuo-san!

153
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,650
Matsuo-san from Chocolate Planet...

154
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,150
Don't read as Ikko-san!

155
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,990
You should leave Ikko-san
for later! Later!

156
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:33,160
Chocolate are funny
and sometimes spontaneous,

157
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,730
so even if he has no plans
I still think

158
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,530
that maybe something good
might happen.

159
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm the Kamikaze Captain
in Chocolate.

160
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,040
They like more
power play and stuff.

161
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,470
But the destructive one
tends to be me.

162
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,940
Recently,
I've been doing impersonations.

163
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,010
So I've prepared
a few of those for today.

164
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,380
How much?! (Alternatively: How long?!)

165
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,160
I don't think many people there
will be doing impersonations.

166
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,530
So I think this might be innovative.

167
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,500
I usually do Ikko-san
on TV, but

168
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,570
I want to do an Ikko-san

169
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,570
more aimed for comedians.

170
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,710
So... a pleasure to
be here today.

171
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,080
I hope I won't
cause much trouble to you all.

172
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,940
Just don't hurt me physically.

173
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,810
Next year, it'll be 15 years in comedy for me.

174
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,180
But I've never tried any
solo comedy so far,

175
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:40,060
so I think winning this
might make me a better comedian.

176
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,860
That's why I'm here today.

177
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,800
What happened to you there?

178
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,570
I just had...
an incident, you know.

179
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,580
Another guy...

180
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,780
Oh no...

181
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
I hate this.

182
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,580
This is a newcomer.

183
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,990
No way...

184
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,160
Someone good showed up.

185
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,220
No way, man!

186
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,330
Koumoto-san!

187
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,460
Come on!

188
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,470
I'm Koumoto from Jicho Kacho.

189
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,540
I'm so nervous
I feel like

190
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,540
asking someone to
switch places.

191
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,770
Good morning!

192
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,140
Good morning!

193
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,680
Take this.

194
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,810
I've seen this.

195
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,750
It's finally here!

196
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,990
It's hard to believe
but this is his first time!

197
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,320
I guess I wasn't
expecting it,

198
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,530
or maybe the timing was
kind of funny.

199
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,760
Koumoto tends to laugh a lot.

200
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,400
Yeah.

201
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,770
"Well then, I'll give you
something to think about."

202
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,670
Come on!

203
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,880
You laugh at everything...

204
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,950
I do!
So...

205
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,820
I'm the type to laugh
even when I'm in the shower.

206
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,390
It can't be helped that I do
so I'll take advantage of it.

207
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,430
I'll teach you a lesson, okay?

208
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,700
Give me a break!

209
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,870
Koumoto-san! Damn!

210
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,540
He might be older
for sure.

211
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,770
Maybe that'll put
some pressure on him.

212
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,340
I didn't prepare any weapons,

213
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,750
instead I was thinking of
counter-attacks.

214
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,850
I have high expectations,

215
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,080
So I'll try to
do things my way.

216
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,250
Stop it, guys!

217
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,560
Huh?

218
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,520
You're trying too hard!
Huh?

219
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,830
Matsuo, right?

220
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,990
Stop it, you two.

221
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,400
You two?
You're trying.

222
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,470
I'm not trying anything.

223
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,770
The Oguri Shun impersonation.

224
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,340
Who's doing that?
Oguri Shun?

225
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,910
I'm sure we'd know immediately
if he was.

226
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,480
Seems like everyone
brought a lot of stuff today.

227
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,350
I've never seen this
from up close.

228
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,820
I hate this, man.

229
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,480
Huh?

230
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,350
Hello!

231
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,150
I'm dead!

232
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,460
This sucks!

233
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,560
These guys are all great!

234
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,200
Sorry!

235
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,660
I hate this already.

236
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,470
I won M-1 2017.

237
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,770
I'm Kubota from Toro Salmon.

238
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,010
I do everything aside from
shady business and lying.

239
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,740
I want to make a mess.

240
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,650
Good morning.

241
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,750
What? I have to quit?

242
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,120
Quit Yoshimoto?

243
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,960
We haven't seen each other for a while.

244
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,960
So I thought it was fine.

245
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,900
I thought it could be fun
to see him explode.

246
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,100
Late last year...

247
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:13,200
I made some remarks that almost made the country explode, and burned bridges.

248
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,710
And that's how I got here.

249
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,180
I think maybe I shouldn't

250
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,450
be talking about this,

251
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,280
I thought I was going to die

252
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,590
and I was planning on dying
late last year,

253
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,860
but I couldn't take the last step

254
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,060
and I'm still alive

255
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,160
Damn it! I wanted to die!

256
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,640
But it's finally time

257
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,840
Can I send everything to hell?

258
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,570
I don't care if they cancel me.

259
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,140
Are you sure you want to have me here?

260
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,390
You didn't get the money from the Omura boat race?

261
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,990
Now's not the time.
I like that!

262
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,620
Don't do that now.
Don't do business now!

263
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,430
Damn, this is scary.

264
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,700
Pretty bad, for real.

265
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,000
How did you choose to do that?

266
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,670
Look, look!

267
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,640
There he is!

268
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,710
There he is, this is serious!

269
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,170
For real?

270
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,480
Drop the T-shirt!
What are you doing?

271
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,120
I'm Inada from Einstein!

272
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,890
I'm ready to lose face!

273
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,930
A million yen!

274
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,490
I'm glad but also scared.

275
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,700
A million yen sounds good, though.

276
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,270
How much was your hair transplant?

277
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,530
1.04 million

278
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,830
And it moves?

279
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,700
Lately he's been

280
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,410
pretty incredible.

281
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,410
Like deep inside he's...

282
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,040
breaking all kinds of walls.

283
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,720
With a face like mine, it would be embarrassing

284
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,920
to lose against anyone else.

285
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,130
I used to suffer from stage fright,

286
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,000
and I didn't laugh much either.

287
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,530
But if you meet people's true selves,

288
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,840
you realize they're mostly good people

289
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,600
Just like yokai

290
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,810
so I started laughing a lot more.

291
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,180
I started questioning

292
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,180
if he really was so clumsy.

293
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,610
And he definitely is clumsy, but...
you know...

294
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,590
I started getting my hands dirty

295
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,860
and I wanted to become a filthy
but cool

296
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,860
type of comedian.

297
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,760
He's here! Damn it!

298
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,430
This is Documental

299
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,570
He's huge!

300
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,080
Good morning

301
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,650
I guess you could call him a regular by now!

302
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,420
Are you getting used
to that door?

303
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,920
You should be too!

304
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,360
Hello, I'm Kendo Kobayashi.

305
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,730
This is my third time here.

306
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,190
It's here?

307
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,570
I've lost a lot, so I have no real right to be here.

308
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,870
My age!

309
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,340
—So this time...?
—I'm going for sure.

310
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:36,910
I'm going.

311
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,870
I just don't have the right.

312
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,810
I want the money.

313
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,350
Koba has been trying
with this show for a while.

314
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,480
He's kind of a team with Akiyama.

315
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,650
He does pretty filthy things
but he's not super filthy.

316
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,560
I think that's his strength.

317
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,630
But he can't win with that.

318
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,360
And I think Koba
believes so as well.

319
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,230
I just wanted to be relaxed.

320
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,570
I should have probably been more nervous.

321
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,510
I think it's weird, to be honest.

322
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,810
Why was I so relaxed,

323
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,680
with a pink dildo inside me?

324
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,890
We can stop right now.

325
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,020
The bastard with phimosis showed up too

326
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,560
That doesn't matter.

327
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,060
That was a personal thing,

328
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,370
I was with a girl, and she said it.

329
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,130
This isn't about comedy, though.

330
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,610
I ended up doing it with
one of those TV girls that come and go...

331
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,770
That wasn't me but Jinnai, by the way.

332
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,910
It wasn't me.

333
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,520
I'm counting on you.

334
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,990
This is too scary.

335
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,100
He has a travel bag and...

336
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,300
he's ready for anything I guess.

337
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,400
No way he's here!

338
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,070
That's enough.

339
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,580
This is getting fun.

340
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,550
He's a newcomer.

341
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,950
Where are you going?

342
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,750
I just brought some weapons.

343
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,750
I'm Nadal from the Korokoro Chikichiki Peppers.

344
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,620
This gets me the most nervous.
Damn it!

345
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,360
There it is!

346
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,540
I think that Nadal has
a pretty good defense.

347
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,710
I don't really know what
makes Nadal laugh.

348
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,840
I get the impression that he's
kind of a psychopath.

349
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,950
So he can act like one if he wants to.

350
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,620
I kinda feel that

351
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,190
it would be nice to see him face off
with Zakoshi someday.

352
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,960
I'm happy as a comedian, yeah.

353
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,290
Right now, whenever I'm on TV,

354
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,530
I usually get pranked,

355
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,970
or bullied a lot.

356
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,430
But you know?

357
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,400
I guess I can try something different here,

358
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,070
and do my best.

359
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,450
I don't think
I have much pressure on me.

360
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,520
But I want Matsumoto-san
to think that I'm funny.

361
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,460
That's a huge amount of baggage.

362
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,020
But I'm sure that you'll be laughing
in just two minutes.

363
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,330
Please do that! I've come here to learn.

364
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,530
Don't tell me...

365
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,240
He's tall!

366
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,610
No way!

367
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,710
There he is!

368
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,980
Again?!

369
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,480
They're also shocked he's here again.

370
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,950
You got ten million already, right?

371
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,820
No, no, I don't have that anymore!

372
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,990
Hey, I'm Cookie from Yaseibakudan.

373
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,550
I don't wanna, I don't wanna.

374
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,490
Anyways, nice to meet you.

375
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,630
Good morning
This is for you.

376
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,390
There's the red letter.

377
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,500
This is Cookie's fourth time.

378
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,700
Is this some sort of
champion round?

379
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,040
Give me a call when you do one,
no more regular ones.

380
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,100
You did one?

381
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,110
Ten million!

382
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,120
Sometimes I watch Cookie on amazon

383
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,750
But sometimes even I can't watch.

384
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,460
I can't watch him drink sock sweat.

385
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,700
He's pretty... reckless.

386
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,670
That's enough already!

387
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,640
You can't run away and win.

388
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,550
I think either Zakoshi or I

389
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,510
will become Documental's emperor.

390
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,090
That's why I have to win this time,

391
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,660
and get a little nasty

392
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,830
with Mister Documental.

393
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,400
Who's the only one left?

394
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,170
This is enough!

395
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,970
It's no small fry.

396
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,980
There he is!

397
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,840
He's too quick!

398
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,820
That's enough!

399
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,590
Why are you like that already?!

400
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,120
He's acting already!

401
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,290
I'm Jimmy Onishi!

402
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,960
I'm going to win

403
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,070
no matter what today!

404
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,130
Excuse me!

405
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,240
Good job today.

406
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,240
This is for you.

407
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,500
There it is...

408
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,570
There it is.

409
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,280
This guy's not going to win.

410
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,110
But I want to see how far he goes.

411
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,020
This isn't just for laughs.

412
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,790
I have to put pressure on everyone from the get go.

413
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,950
What's up with your eye?

414
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,190
I don't really get his lead ups.

415
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,370
He's prepared a lot of things.

416
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:42,700
He looks like he'd bring dynamite with him,
but not a lighter

417
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,010
I have to give it my all, or else...

418
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,050
It's gonna be bad.

419
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,090
I trained for a full week
with my manager.

420
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,560
I got good laughter at first,

421
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,460
but I ran out of ideas along the way.

422
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,230
That's how I became Jimmy-san.

423
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,000
I'm always serious, but this time

424
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,970
I'm several times more serious.

425
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,630
I have to win this.

426
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,910
Ah, sorry

427
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,260
Why are you dressed like that?

428
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,240
Did you quit comedy
and become an escort?

429
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,440
You said that.

430
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
No, they told me I couldn't.

431
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,770
Who?

432
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,980
The company told me I couldn't.

433
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
Told you to respect yourself?

434
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,640
They told me I couldn't, yeah.

435
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,360
Good morning.

436
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,860
Hey!

437
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,470
We have a good cast

438
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,940
Is this a good cast?

439
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,670
I changed the color of my hair.

440
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,280
It looks really good.

441
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,180
Really? Thanks.

442
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,550
It's dull.

443
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,210
Pretty dull.

444
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,580
He's a first timer.

445
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,790
And well... the regulars, or veterans would be

446
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,660
about half the room.

447
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,520
Koumoto hasn't been here, somehow.

448
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,030
I haven't, yeah.

449
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,090
My first time out of eight.

450
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,660
I remember Nadal doing pretty well...

451
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,900
Stop it, I haven't been here.

452
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,270
You haven't?
I haven't.

453
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,700
I really thought you had been here once...

454
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,470
I haven't! For real!

455
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,280
Ah, and then there's Ina-chan.

456
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,780
This is serious!

457
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,050
You're laughing.

458
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,320
You're laughing just looking at him.

459
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,580
It's like it's your first time.

460
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,050
And you have time, right Kubota?

461
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,960
Yeah, I'm free right now.
Why?

462
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,820
I said...

463
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,490
Something that shook the country
to a woman.

464
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,100
You're an idiot.

465
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,860
And so I'm here.

466
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,970
I don't even know how much time I have left.

467
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,600
A lot happened, huh?

468
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,310
Are you sorry?

469
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,880
I'll repent, come back to life, and participate here again.

470
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,020
Feel free to get nasty here, though. It's fine.

471
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,490
So uh... you all brought it?

472
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,830
We can gather it, and

473
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,930
This is a big competition.

474
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:57,000
It's huge! Just look at how much
money we have right here.

475
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,840
Everything okay? I trust you all!

476
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,610
So this is almost ten million,

477
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,350
but right now, we only have 9 million.

478
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:16,280
That's why every single time, I do this.

479
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,190
Really, every time.

480
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,720
I have to use this envelope
as soon as possible,

481
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,030
we don't know
when it'll be over

482
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,130
Yoshimoto's going to be over?

483
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,700
It's going to disappear?

484
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,960
No, no, it's not.

485
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,970
Thanks to your effort,
it's not going anywhere.

486
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,210
And so this becomes this.

487
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,920
And now, this one
goes here, right? Right here.

488
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,580
And that's how it is.

489
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,390
We also have the rules,

490
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,460
which I think should
be fine, really.

491
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,460
But this time,
they're a little special.

492
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,800
We have a new stage,
a different room

493
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,800
where you can do what you want.

494
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,470
I think it can
be pretty useful.

495
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:09,810
So first we have yellow, then orange.

496
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,410
And finally the red.

497
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:15,040
You can get it directly, if it's too obvious.

498
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,250
It can happen.

499
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,420
Got it?

500
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
Okay.

501
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,690
You can try to stop it.

502
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,190
Huh? What?

503
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,720
You can try to stop it.

504
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,260
That's enough of that!

505
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,200
Seems like all of you have a lot of baggage today!

506
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,800
That's good, I think it shows spirit!

507
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,210
And we have some toys
around here as well.

508
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,680
You can use them
or not, whatever.

509
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,150
To take a look
make sure you do.

510
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,620
—Okay, Jimmy-chan?
—All okay!

511
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,380
We're the same age, so I'm counting on you!

512
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,790
Are you the only one

513
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,720
without anything?

514
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,390
That's what's unnerving!

515
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,700
I'm getting nervous!

516
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,830
What's going on, man?

517
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,440
So we can't just
target Jimmy-san, then.

518
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:22,440
Sorry, but I'm
not laughing at all today.

519
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,950
Are you actually sick or something?

520
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,210
Is it contagious?

521
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,980
It's onset is at dawn!

522
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,890
Show us your eye!

523
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,650
Do it right now.

524
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,790
We want to see!

525
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,960
—You sure?
—It's the best option.

526
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,630
But I'll lose a chance!

527
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,490
Maybe two.

528
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,500
You're already two down.

529
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,940
Before we begin... it's nothing special.

530
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,770
Why did he take it off now?!

531
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,380
—You laughed!
—We haven't started yet.

532
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,050
Why did you take it off?

533
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,410
Everyone told me to do it!

534
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,480
Documental start!!

535
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,760
You laughed though!

536
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,990
When you chat with Matsuhito

537
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:15,900
at this distance,
do you get nervous?

538
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,870
Ma-Matsuhito?

539
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,230
Matsuhito?

540
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,140
Yeah, Matsuhito!

541
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,100
No one calls you Matsuhito, though.

542
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,570
Ma-chan is better!

543
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,410
Has anyone called you Matsuhito?

544
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,810
If you were still a novice
and we met somewhere

545
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,380
would you ask for a handshake?

546
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,880
Yeah, I would've.

547
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,120
Yeah, me too.

548
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,950
But now I'm used to it.

549
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,860
That doesn't matter!

550
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,490
Startled me.

551
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,000
Why did you shout?

552
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,070
Why did you call us four here?

553
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,840
Just tell us what's going on!

554
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:02,080
This is Documentary of Documental.

555
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,110
So I asked you all
to come here.

556
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,580
We have to talk.

557
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,950
You know the newest Documental

558
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,520
has been delayed, right?

559
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,560
Yeah, kind of.

560
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,200
I thought it was
about time it released.

561
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,260
Yeah, yeah.

562
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,300
And that's what
Matsuhito said as well.

563
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,230
Stop it with the Matsuhito thing!

564
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,140
And he does it like...

565
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,910
Keep it up for a couple days

566
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:34,680
Well you see, we had
a bit of trouble.

567
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,980
Trouble?

568
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,150
That's confusing, right?
I think it is, so...

569
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,520
So I want you to
take a look at this.

570
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,600
Hey, hey, hey.

571
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,910
Huh?!

572
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,280
Huh?

573
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,190
Why?

574
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,760
What's going on?

575
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,330
—No way!
—I guess that's that!

576
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,400
That's that, yeah.

577
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,060
Vulgar?

578
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,310
Whoa!

579
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,210
They called him out directly!

580
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,440
This is serious.

581
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,280
It's family-friendly?

582
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,510
Right, right.

583
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,680
We're sabotaging family reunions.

584
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,550
Hey, Kubota...

585
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,240
Wait, is this real?

586
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,650
They called you out.

587
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,120
You're blacklisted for sure!

588
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,380
It's like a
murder report!

589
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,290
What's going on? Why?

590
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,720
It was vulgar!

591
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,130
Too vulgar!

592
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,130
That's not just this time, though!

593
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:37,670
It's a weird translation, right?
It's kind of backwards!

594
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,330
Aren't they saying
that it was good?

595
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
For now, yeah.

596
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,210
Maybe it's a typo?

597
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,710
—So they're angry?
—A little!

598
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:53,250
Originally, next year was already

599
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:58,850
rearing up to be great content
for Amazon.

600
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,260
But it's all Kubota's fault.

601
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,530
What? I'm reported everywhere now?

602
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,430
What should I do?

603
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:10,270
To be honest
we were also pretty shocked.

604
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,740
Well, we had pissing too, yeah.

605
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,500
So those bits were
family-friendly after all?

606
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,610
Until now, yeah.

607
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,610
Maybe it was worse than pissing!

608
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,940
Toro Salmon's Kubota is
going to become a slur now!

609
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:27,050
So why had everything
been fine until now?

610
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,390
We didn't really remember either

611
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:32,850
and we had our doubts...

612
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,360
So today we wanted to

613
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,990
see what went wrong with you guys.

614
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,100
We're settling this?

615
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,330
We're debating like this.

616
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,040
Yoshimoto is debating Amazon

617
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,270
on what to do to get it online.

618
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,980
But they don't
have much hope.

619
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,110
I want it to go live!

620
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,380
It would suck if it didn't.

621
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:06,190
We thought that Amazon
would accept basically anything

622
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,120
Everything goes, right?

623
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,530
But it seems like
we went too far.

624
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:15,100
We went all the
way with this.

625
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,930
So now we know that
there really was a limit!

626
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,440
Why can't they tell us?

627
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,340
So let's see where the line is.

628
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,980
I think it might
have been that thing...

629
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,250
Well, I want to check
and see in real time what went wrong.

630
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,520
So let's have a look.

631
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,480
Documental start!

632
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,360
You laughed!

633
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,820
But before it started.

634
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,730
Let's get our bags.

635
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,330
What's up with your eye?

636
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,600
This?

637
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,070
The eye that's to your left?

638
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,140
No, it's to our right.

639
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,040
It's to our right.

640
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,210
—To your right?
—Yeah.

641
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,350
Your left eye
is to our right.

642
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,320
Touch it.
Touch your own eye.

643
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,620
Huh? What?

644
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,190
Huh? What was that?

645
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,490
Why don't you touch
where it's red?

646
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,660
Here?

647
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,560
(No way!)

648
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,190
Was that you?

649
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,060
You have-You have to be silent!

650
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,870
Be silent?

651
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,840
Is that a
"be silent" sampler?

652
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,610
Don't push me!

653
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,810
Why?

654
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,850
What was that sound?
Who was that?

655
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,010
That was Tamuken-san, right?

656
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,620
Icchan, that's not funny.

657
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:55,300
What's wrong?

658
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,070
Um... just phlegm.

659
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,540
You have some?

660
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,200
Do you have some allergies?

661
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,710
Huh? It's coming back?

662
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,180
No, I think
it has to be that thing.

663
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,560
That's kinda funny.

664
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,990
It's going smoothly.

665
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,390
It's good,
same as always.

666
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,230
See? It's the same.

667
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,110
There's no punchline, though.

668
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,210
Back to the phlegm?

669
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,050
What was that?

670
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,320
Why do you always wear
a tank top to Documental?

671
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,290
Well, it's just
to regulate my temperature.

672
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,590
This, this!

673
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,360
You know this, you guys?

674
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,730
Matches?

675
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,190
You know how to stick them together?

676
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,700
Huh?

677
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
You go like this,
and stick them...

678
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,270
—No idea.
—You don't know?

679
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,170
You stick them like this.

680
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,240
Don't grab that.

681
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,600
It's hot!!

682
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,940
Eh? Why?!

683
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,210
Yeah...

684
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,780
I wanted to see them stick together.

685
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,540
What's going on?

686
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,080
What kind of matches are these?

687
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,650
Read this.

688
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,420
Those matches are huge.

689
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,780
Positive...

690
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,390
Positive matches?

691
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:29,060
I'll do your reading.

692
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,830
A positive and simple heart.

693
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,700
You gonna stay as Ikko?

694
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,700
What do you mean?

695
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,630
A regretful heart.

696
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,240
—A thankful-
—Admiring...

697
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,940
admiring heart.

698
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,610
They don't know shit.

699
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,870
A responsible heart.

700
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,080
He can't read properly, man.

701
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,950
What do you mean?

702
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:57,890
A loser's heart. A helpful heart, thankful words.

703
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,250
He's getting it all?

704
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,860
For real?

705
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,120
Watch out, man!

706
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,830
They won't stick!
They're not sticking!

707
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,190
Look, everyone!

708
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,360
I couldn't do it.

709
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
Why?

710
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,930
We have to put out the fire.

711
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,710
Watch out.

712
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:21,480
Let's put it out. Wait, I'll do it.

713
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,540
Watch out! Put out the fire!

714
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,910
Ready? I'll do it
let's put it out!

715
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,320
Extinguish!

716
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,680
Extinguish!

717
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,350
Extinguish!

718
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,320
Nothing's sticking anywhere.

719
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,300
Hey, stop it.
Can you stop it?

720
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,870
It won't come out from the mouth.

721
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,170
You're soaking wet, besides.

722
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,540
Stop it.

723
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,000
Just for a little while.

724
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,310
It's stopped, it's stopped.

725
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,880
Stop it! Stop it! Just a little!

726
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:54,940
I stopped, I stopped!

727
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,150
Okay!

728
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,550
There's no more fire, it's fine.

729
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:03,380
Stop, stop! Stop it!

730
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,990
It's leaking everywhere.

731
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,590
Stop it~ Man~!

732
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,830
Did you put it out?

733
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,800
It got hot, but yeah.

734
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,670
Looks like I pissed my pants.

735
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,570
You can't piss in that direction.

736
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,940
Please stop when I tell you.

737
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,810
Now I look
like I pissed myself.

738
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,010
Hey man, you think you could

739
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,550
put some tuna inside your foreskin?

740
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,820
No, I don't wanna.

741
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,280
You don't?

742
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,390
Do it man!
He's older than you!

743
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,790
If he tells you to put tuna

744
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,360
on your dick,
you fucking do it.

745
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
Okay, but...

746
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,390
You're a Yoshimoto, right?
You do it if he says so.

747
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,130
Stop it, stop it.

748
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,470
You have to do it right away.

749
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,740
I've hurt people, you know?

750
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,880
I'm sorry.

751
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,010
You need help?

752
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,720
Ah, kind of.

753
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,430
Is this it?

754
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,730
Isn't this it?

755
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,100
This is it, right?

756
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,670
Jimmy-san, the time.

757
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,400
What time is it right now?

758
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,810
What?

759
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,310
I mean, look.

760
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,940
2 hours 45 minutes.

761
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,780
It has to be this.

762
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:46,190
This is serious.

763
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,860
In just a second.

764
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,640
Everyone reacted like that.

765
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,270
2 hours 46 minutes.

766
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,610
This is Sato-san...

767
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,660
This sucks!

768
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,130
That one has
no mosaic at all!

769
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,400
You're really fucking with me, man.

770
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,800
What were you thinking
showing that on air?!

771
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,730
What did you show?

772
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:33,940
What did you show?!

773
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,540
Come on, man

774
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,710
Scold him, Matsumoto-san!

775
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:41,840
This might be
more than a yellow.

776
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,010
I think this might be
close to a rule violation!

777
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:46,910
Let's verify at once.

778
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,580
I'll fully admit that
I laughed, of course.

779
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,290
But punish Kubota

780
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:52,650
I see, I see

781
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,420
Because there's some things
we can't do, right?

782
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,990
Did he show you from his phone?

783
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,130
It's a video...

784
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,000
Are you stupid?

785
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,530
Why do you have that?
You use that?

786
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:08,740
But there's some females later.

787
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,740
What good would some
female porn do?

788
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,270
Actually, I think female
porn would be even worse.

789
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,580
I'm sorry

790
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:18,450
I'm glad Coo-chan laughed
this early on!

791
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,620
It was nervous laughter

792
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,290
This is Sato-san...

793
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,630
We're in a pretty tight spot!

794
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:36,660
At first I thought
orange was good enough,

795
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,930
But Coo-chan, you get a yellow!

796
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,240
Yeah, I get it. Thank you

797
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,540
He was just like a
bystander watching.

798
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,640
But there's that!

799
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,580
Let him see

800
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:54,620
Look at the time, man...

801
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:58,020
You're both the same!

802
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,090
Why're you mad at me?!

803
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,460
This is just like playing concentration!

804
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,720
One pair!

805
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:18,810
Now, I won't say it's
classy or anything

806
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:21,880
We've had stuff like that before

807
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,740
We have, yeah.

808
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:29,020
We can edit something like this
with a mosaic and stuff.

809
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,590
Looking at it
I'd say this part is safe.

810
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,750
Of course, objectively speaking
we're insane

811
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,620
Yeah, definitely.

812
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,060
But in the world of Documental...

813
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,900
A fictional land...

814
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:46,430
In that world, yeah...
I'd say it's safe.

815
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:49,540
Yeah, I don't think Amano-san minds this...

816
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,440
Which means,
that was fine, right?

817
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,110
If we crossed the line
then what bothered Amazon?

818
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,650
We don't see the problem so far.

819
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,320
I'm starting to get sad.

820
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,120
This was on about the same level
as Hirunandesu.

821
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:04,790
Idiot!

822
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:06,990
So this is Nanchan standards?

823
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,160
Nanchan wouldn't be able to handle this!

824
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,930
Hey man, that's rude!

825
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,130
No, no, no

826
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:15,300
No matter how you slice it,
a "boke" doesn't set standards.

827
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,860
Because it doesn't suit him, right?

828
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,100
Someone could misunderstand you

829
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:19,470
Sorry, sorry

830
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,140
Sorry for doing that.
