00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,850
Hello and welcome to Wednesday Downtown everybody!

5
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:13,430
Here is our first guest, come out please!

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:23,500
It's Fujisaki Market!

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,500
Hello! We'll be in your care!

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,240
The crowd is like...

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,040
Yes that's bad.

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,710
Even I'm a bit like 'huh?'

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,980
La-la-la-la gym?

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,120
Don't you remember that?

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,120
Ah they do!

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,890
That was 10 years ago!

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,320
10 years!?

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,320
It's been that long.

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,090
When you look at the crowd's reaction...

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,630
...we're definitely guys from the past.

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,630
Completely.

20
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,800
We brought something related to what makes 'one hit wonders' like us very happy...

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,700
...a theory about "Where are they now?" programs.

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,000
Eh~

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,510
Here it is!

24
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,480
Theory: You can't point it out if someone completely different showed up to a "Where are they now?" program.

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,580
Yes!

26
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,980
That's what it is.

27
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,420
What do you mean by "you can't point it out"?

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,820
Since years have passed since you last saw them, and faces can change as well...

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,890
...we thought that it would be hard to notice.

30
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,930
I see.

31
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,890
Going "you're not that person!"

32
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:22,860
Yes.

33
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,630
So you're saying they wouldn't notice, right? It's not that they are doing it out of consideration

34
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,630
Yes, and...

35
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,770
...even if they notice it, they wouldn't be able to say it out loud.

36
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,440
Oh it's what this program is famous for: Nobody gets anything out of this.

37
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,410
After this, in a "Where are they now?" shoot, a complete stranger shows up!

38
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,210
Can they really not say anything about it?

39
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,150
Hello-ssu

40
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,150
Also...

41
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,420
The theory that people who have signatures even though they're not famous are kinda weird.

42
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,720
We look into half-entertainers' signatures.

43
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,160
And then...

44
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,760
The theory that if you make people living in a peninsula draw a map of Japan, their own peninsula will stand out.

45
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,780
Theory: You can't point it out if someone completely different showed up to a "Where are they now?" program.

46
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,820
What kind of people are
chosen I wonder?

47
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,220
With that, our first targets are...

48
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,230
It depends on the
person too, yes.

49
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,760
This is "Where is that nostalgic person now?"

50
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,230
Right?

51
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,900
Ginshari

52
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,000
And the fake person they will meet is...

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,870
The person that you will meet is Kakefu-kun.

54
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,900
They're wearing an
outside version of
their usual clothes.

55
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,610
Oh I see.

56
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,070
I used to watch it!

57
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,080
That's a good one.

58
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,050
This type of segment's classic, from 30 years ago...

59
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:53,720
...Kakefu-kun, who was really famous for looking like Kakefu from the Hanshin Tigers*

60
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:57,920
*Masayuki Kakefu played for the Hanshin Tigers 1974-1988

61
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,990
This was a good choice.

62
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,990
You won't be able to tell right?

63
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,800
You are familiar?

64
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,920
Of course, I was born in 1980 so...

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,790
...he was a really big star as a kid actor.

66
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,160
It's amazing.

67
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,560
If you think about it though, wouldn't his face be completely different?

68
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,270
But that type of face doesn't really change.

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,270
You think he stayed the same?

70
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:13,540
If you talk about change, it should be completely different since it's a stranger.

71
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,510
So we'll see if they
can say it?

72
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,440
We quickly go to meet with the fake Kakefu-kun.

73
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,510
Right?

74
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,750
That's a good spot.

75
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,950
Does this mean he's doing voice acting or something?

76
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,950
Oh really, "Voice Acting Academy"

77
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,880
Oh if it's a place like this...

78
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,850
Waiting for Ginshari is this gentleman...

79
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,850
It's a completely
different person!

80
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,630
...with a setting that the actor is trying to find work in voice acting.

81
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,510
This is quite questionable!

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,860
With that...

83
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,860
Is it here?

84
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,300
Isn't that him? Right there in the middle? Definitely!

85
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,400
He looks a bit like the current state of Kakefu-san.

86
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,710
At this angle...

87
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,610
It's 100% him!

88
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,310
The one talking now?

89
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,940
Absolutely!

90
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,940
Undoubtedly.

91
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,010
If you pass each other on the street, you wouldn't see it.

92
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,210
You won't go like "Wait-"

93
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,950
Will they question it?

94
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,150
Of course not.

95
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,890
I'm not living thinking about Kakefu-kun all the time.

96
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,490
It's really easy to see though isn't it?

97
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,630
But they're believing it.

98
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,630
They are.

99
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,410
As we said, the face doesn't change that much.

100
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,490
They are taking the 100% changed Kakefu-kun...

101
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:16,640
...as completely real.

102
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,170
It's an entirely
different person.

103
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,640
Wooaah this is it, the smile!

104
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,080
They're into it 100%

105
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,630
Truly nostalgic!

106
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,020
Ultimately, they end up feeling nostalgic from a complete stranger.

107
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,710
This is impossible.

108
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,710
Embarrassing.

109
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,480
Their first meeting.

110
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,480
Embarrassing.

111
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,020
They have no intention of questioning his authenticity.

112
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,920
Really, the theory was
right it seems.

113
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,060
Could you please if I might ask?

114
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,060
Yes, I understand

115
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,760
It's a stranger though.

116
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,320
You didn't have glasses back then right?

117
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,800
Right.

118
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,800
Could you please take them off?

119
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:53,570
You made a good choice
with this person.

120
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,040
Isn't this amazing?

121
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,040
This is it!

122
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,610
You're exactly the same!

123
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,610
This face!

124
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,480
Getting super excited for a fake.

125
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,250
You're shaking hands with an unknown old man.

126
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,950
By the way, the real Kakefu-kun looks like this...

127
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,320
This is a 9 year old video but...

128
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,420
The general aura is similar.

129
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,590
...he seems to still be the owner of a convenience store.

130
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh I see, right.

131
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:20,030
The fake one looks
more like Kakefu-kun.

132
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,270
It's easy to tell them apart like this.

133
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,640
At this rate, we won't be found out so...

134
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,740
...we go with a pretty out-of-the-box fake scenario.

135
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,480
I currently have five kids.

136
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,480
Five kids.

137
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,480
Five? You have five kids?

138
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,480
Yes.

139
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,220
Come kids!

140
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,020
This...

141
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,220
You kids don't look like Kakefu-kun do they?

142
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,220
What's up with
this geezer?

143
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,830
Of course, they're all strangers.

144
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,560
They don't look similar.

145
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,890
Introduce yourselves then.

146
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,230
I'm Masayuki, I'm 12 years old, nice to meet you.

147
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,230
Masayuki?

148
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,870
I'm Mayumi, 11 years old, nice to meet you.

149
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,870
Mayumi?

150
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,970
They're Hanshin
players' names!

151
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,770
I'm Kouichi, 10 years old, nice to meet you.

152
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,610
I'm Akinobu, 8 years old, nice to meet you.

153
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,610
Yes, thank you.

154
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,580
I'm Yutaka, 4 years old, nice to meet you.

155
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,450
Aren't they all named after Hanshin players?

156
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,680
I know Mayumi, but the rest?

157
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,690
Akinobu right?

158
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,920
Okada Akinobu

159
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,920
You really know their first names!

160
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,120
Masayuki?

161
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,590
Kakefu's full name is Kakefu Masayuki right?

162
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,590
Yes.

163
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,730
Amazing!

164
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,040
They can't seem to be
getting away from
this good feeling.

165
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:32,540
With them not questioning the reality of the situation whatsoever we can stop filming.

166
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,370
He isn't wearing
the hat.

167
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,270
They are only pranking
these guys?

168
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,340
With that, here we reveal the plan.

169
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,610
In reality, this isn't a "Where are they now?" program but...

170
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,210
...it's Wednesday Downtown.

171
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,320
They all become like
this when they hear
those words.

172
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,030
Hold up for a minute, are you for real?

173
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,590
What kind of trick was it?

174
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:55,330
That's right!

175
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,190
I can't find the thing.

176
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,190
I don't see it.

177
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,330
They were too smooth.

178
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,990
With that in mind...

179
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,700
...wasn't there anything weird with today's shoot?

180
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,630
Ah, they asked them.

181
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,700
Eh?

182
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,680
The kids are all fake maybe?

183
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:08,110
It's not just the kids, but the entire thing. Then we explain the theory.

184
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,210
They're not seeing it.

185
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,340
The theory is: You can't point it out if someone completely different showed up to a "Where are they now?" program.

186
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,610
Someone else?

187
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,610
Eh-eh?

188
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,420
Wait for a sec...

189
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,320
This person isn't Kakefu-kun at all...

190
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,320
Who the hell are you!

191
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,260
You really were yapping back there too!

192
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,260
Really?

193
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,200
This is so embarrassing.

194
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,630
Making him wear the hat and going "That's it! That's it!"

195
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,470
Eh- What is this?

196
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,500
What kind of prank is this?

197
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,040
The theory will definitely pass!

198
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,040
Yeah!

199
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,470
Somebody who questions it would be weirder!

200
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,210
Going like "You're not Kakefu-kun"!

201
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,340
This is a great success.

202
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,950
Then, how will it be going for a more recent person...

203
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,490
...and lowering the quality?

204
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,820
The target is...

205
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,390
"Where is that nostalgic figure now!?"

206
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,390
There he is!

207
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,330
Punk Boo Boo's Kurose

208
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,930
That last one was
too hard then?

209
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,530
So today we'll...

210
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,930
Yes it was.

211
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,670
...be meeting with a nostalgic figure-

212
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,810
Ah- sorry, excuse me, sorry.

213
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,040
Who "that person" is going to be...

214
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,800
...I currently don't know.

215
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,810
That crow sure
knows how to caw.

216
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,920
Really, yes...

217
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,870
...can we not shoot somewhere with less people passing through?

218
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,550
He's really unlucky.

219
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,690
The fake person Kurose will be meeting is...

220
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,990
Kurose-san will be meeting...

221
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,730
... Hamada Brittney-san.

222
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,830
It's not that old is it?

223
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,350
The gyaru?

224
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,330
Since I'm currently homeless...

225
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:49,820
About 10 years ago, Hamada Britney had a break as the homeless gyaru manga artist.

226
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,340
That kind of thing
is hard to guess.

227
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,110
Ten years ago huh?

228
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:56,530
We prepared a fake person, with the setting that she's working at this pet shop.

229
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,050
But it's kinda hard.

230
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,820
I wonder if the fake
person is a gyaru?

231
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,520
Ah- There she is!

232
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,850
She is?

233
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,190
I can see traces of her.

234
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,060
Traces of her?

235
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,890
A bit, yes.

236
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,380
She hasn't changed too much.

237
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,580
Looking from far away, he seems to be feeling the vibe.

238
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,700
They keep making
themselves believe
even more.

239
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,570
How will it turn out?

240
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,010
I'm sorry, good day.

241
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,160
Hello-ssu!

242
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,280
Wiss Chihassu!

243
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,280
There it is!

244
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,180
This is so forced!

245
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,580
She's so different.

246
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,650
Are you Hamada Brittney?

247
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,420
Yes-ssu!

248
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,420
Yeah- there it is!

249
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,490
It's completely fake!

250
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,190
So nostalgic, this tension!

251
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,630
Hello-ssu!

252
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,430
You're bad.

253
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,860
Your makeup is so different from back in the day!

254
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,560
Did it give me out?

255
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,560
But if you look at it closely...

256
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,770
...you have the vibe.

257
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,070
Of course man!

258
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,610
On top of not looking similar, the acting is also bad.

259
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,880
If you look at it knowing she's not similar at all but...

260
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,320
...for some reason Kurose seems to not notice.

261
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,320
By the way, the real Hamada Brittney currently looks like this.

262
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,390
She manages a company based in the catering industry,

263
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,660
She seems to have
toned it down.

264
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,660
Certainly seems so.

265
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,930
as well as writing a manga series.

266
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,530
You didn't have a home, right?

267
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,530
Yah

268
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:23,840
I told you guys, I was homeless back then.

269
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,840
That's right!

270
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:28,070
Her speech pattern
is crazy.

271
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,170
What are you doing nowadays?

272
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,770
You can't tell by lookin'?

273
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,040
I'm a pet breeder, yo!

274
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,880
Hamada Breeder

275
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,980
You're Hamada Breeder now!

276
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,150
Despite the awful acting, Kurose seems convinced.

277
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:46,090
Even the awful manga slips by him.

278
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:53,500
And thus, the fake and dubious recording finishes without incident.

279
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,870
It's so obviously fake.

280
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,870
This is nuts.

281
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,170
So we explain the project.

282
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,170
That person...isn't Hamada Brittney

283
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,170
NO FRICKIN' WAY!

284
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,610
Nice to meet you.

285
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,110
Ehhh? You're not?

286
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,980
Nope, she's not.

287
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,710
No way...

288
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,550
I didn't even know.

289
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,490
What did Hamada Brittney look like again?

290
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,960
Since it's nothing more than a tricky prank

291
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,290
She became much paler.

292
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,580
We made the last person easier to tell apart.

293
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,830
Our next target is

294
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,970
It's a nostalgic 'Where are they now?' segment!

295
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,800
Fujimon would definitely
be able to tell.

296
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:35,070
A veteran entertainer, familiar with pranks from Lincoln, Fujimoto Toshifumi.

297
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,770
He's quite finicky
with details.

298
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,580
You're right.

299
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,540
And the impostor that Fujimoto is about to meet?

300
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,020
I definitely couldn't
tell the difference.

301
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:46,520
A psychic magician with 40 years in the business, who rose to popularity during the supernatural power fad in Japan:

302
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,880
The spoon bending guy!

303
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,880
Uwaa they picked a great guy!

304
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,150
It's harder with
foreigners.

305
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
Uri Gellar.

306
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,820
This is a bit...
What'll they do?

307
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,190
Uwaa you really did it! The spoon spoon guy!

308
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,990
He remembers the
guy, that's good.

309
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:59,000
And so, our target arrives at his appointment with 'Uri Gellar'.

310
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,930
The guy should obviously
be foreign, right?

311
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,930
It should be obvious.

312
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,700
Hello!

313
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,800
Just like with Korean faces...

314
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,640
Ah, he'll probably get it.

315
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,510
He's totally different!

316
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,980
It's nice to meet you!

317
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,550
This is so obvious!

318
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,550
So that's how it is.

319
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,680
We're just going to pause filming for a minute.

320
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:25,120
He kinda has the
right aura though.

321
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,760
We're in your care today.

322
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,500
What did he find?

323
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,500
What was he looking it?

324
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,930
So what's the reason for you coming to Japan this time?

325
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:41,540
He came to promote his new song, which is now on sale.

326
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,010
There's no excuse
for believing this!

327
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,280
Eh? Right now you're...

328
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,610
Sorry, um, what do you do now?

329
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,080
He just sings.

330
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,820
A mega-suspicious imitation Gellar.

331
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,660
Um, right now,

332
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,230
are you able to show me your psychic powers?

333
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,130
I'm sorry, I can't today.

334
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,130
Not today.

335
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,840
Hmm... I see...

336
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,480
A request for one song is accepted,

337
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,810
but the spoon bending is completely denied.

338
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:26,480
And so, the promised new single, "Shimauta".

339
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:32,560
This is so strange.

340
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,630
His face is
gradually dropping.

341
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,170
C'mon man, hold it in!

342
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,680
He can't take it.

343
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,650
Because the song is so bad, Fujimoto can't help but laugh.

344
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,200
"I really want people to buy my CD."

345
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,200
Yes, of course.

346
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,400
The atmosphere is
so awkward!

347
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,000
But I wonder what the
impostor is thinking?

348
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,900
Well... it was certainly something.

349
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,870
I don't know what either
of them are thinking.

350
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,300
It's a well-matched opposition
between these two.

351
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,300
We now reveal the prank.

352
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,780
He should think it's all pretty suspicious,

353
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:32,300
but did Fujimoto notice that it was an impostor?

354
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,550
How did the meeting go?

355
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,820
Is Uri Gellar okay?

356
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,990
How do you mean?

357
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,540
I mean, this will NEVER sell!

358
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,370
So he doesn't seem to doubt that it was Uri Gellar himself.

359
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:53,200
The truth is...this isn't a 'Where are they now?' program.

360
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,680
It's Wednesday Downtown.

361
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,480
It came around too fast!

362
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,250
They hooked me in too quick!

363
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,320
So what was this about then?

364
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,290
What kind of theory do you think it is?

365
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,960
I have absolutely no idea.

366
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:19,130
Theory: If a completely different person appeared on a 'Where are they now?' show, you couldn't point it out.

367
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,600
But the guy was a foreigner!

368
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,470
So it was kinda uncomfortable then?

369
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,070
Ya obviously!

370
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,910
What was uncomfortable?

371
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,140
The crappy song!

372
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,680
So there you have it, 'Where are they now?' pranks are inevitable.

373
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,120
Don't you think the difficulty was too high?

374
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,120
I don't think so.

375
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,960
Because the ideal thing here

376
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,860
is that Uri Gellar will get loads of girls.

377
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,330
So how was it everyone?

378
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,660
Well...

379
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,640
Because I'm kinda suspicious of you guys

380
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,270
I want to see them do that thing.

381
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,270
I wanna know if you're the real deal.

382
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:07,140
Do some of your 'la la la' thing.

383
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,140
Yeah, please!

384
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,350
Please believe us if we do it.

385
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,580
They're the real thing.

386
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:18,790
Eyesight testing exercise~~~

387
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:29,030
It's the working version.

388
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,770
You didn't laugh though.

389
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,170
The quality of laughter confirms that you're real.

390
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,170
Please stop that!

391
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,180
Continuing on, our next presenter is this person, please come out!

392
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,480
It's Hakata Daikichi!

393
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,480
Thank you for having me on.

394
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,980
He's the real deal.

395
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,980
Yep, I'm the real deal.

396
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,230
It may be sudden, but by your feet

397
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,560
There should be a pen and paper.

398
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,560
Ah, yeah I was wondering about that.

399
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,970
Could you write your own autograph for me?

400
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,800
Please make it out to Yoshio-

401
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,380
Ah, my real name is Yoshioka Hironori.

402
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,810
The joke's over, so let's return to the writing.

403
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,210
Autographs huh

404
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:21,420
My theory is related to autographs, so I want to see yours.

405
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,420
Okay everyone, please show us your autographs.

406
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,630
That's it.

407
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,630
Oh, you really wrote an autograph.

408
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,360
You've written "To Yoshio Ka-" at the top

409
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,360
Ah, because I didn't have enough time.

410
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,700
Please stop playing around with hiragana and write it in kanji.

411
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,140
It's too informal.

412
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,410
I'd like to hear everyone explain their autographs one by one.

413
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:48,250
I'm really sorry, it's different from my original autograph.

414
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,920
I shortened the kanji for Matsumoto Hitoshi.

415
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,350
And this used to be a 'DT', but I can't really see it anymore.

416
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,390
Ah, you write a 'DT' as in Downtown?

417
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,360
So it used to be much clearer?

418
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,360
I used to write it much more clearly, yeah.

419
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,560
Okay, moving on to Asao

420
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:11,740
Since I'm an athlete, a lot of kids ask for my autograph, so I write it in hiragana.

421
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,070
When did you decide to write it that way?

422
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,580
I decided to play beach volleyball in 12th grade

423
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:23,150
So while I was commuting on the bullet train I'd practice my signature.

424
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,920
And so, the theory I have brought with me this time is this:

425
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,840
Theory: "Although they're not famous, they have their own autograph - cringe"

426
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,600
Isn't that okay?

427
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,960
But there are people

428
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,930
who write their names using only kanji.

429
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,000
It doesn't count as an autograph

430
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,000
They write out every stroke.

431
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,270
Yeah, they're not all swishy like autographs.

432
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,410
Shouldn't the "cringey" part be "that hurts"?

433
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,300
Well you see the "cringey" part
I'm leaving the 'cringe' parts up to you.

434
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,110
You're waiting to hear "That's so cringey!" from us.

435
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,110
I see, I understand.

436
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:15,400
Theory: "Although I'm not famous, I have my own autograph - cringe"

437
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,770
I think it's cringey.

438
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:21,680
An autograph: an entertainer's proof of identity.

439
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,680
You get restaurants with
loads of autographs like that.

440
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,480
Firstly, to the entertainers: When did you come up with your autograph?

441
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,150
I've never thought
about it before.

442
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,650
Our investigation starts with a look at comedians

443
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:37,890
and the location of this investigation is Yoshimoto's comedian training school.

444
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,150
Ah, the training school.

445
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,860
I wonder if they
have autographs?

446
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,860
Do these pre-debut entertainers have autographs?

447
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,620
Is there anyone here who has an autograph?

448
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,670
Ahh, so there are a couple.

449
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,660
Oh you already have your own signature?

450
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,810
Only 6 out of the 54 have an autograph already.

451
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:02,980
The majority haven't made theirs yet.

452
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,500
I would find it embarrassing.

453
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,520
Since I haven't had my debut I haven't needed to autograph

454
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,890
Look at the guy
behind him.

455
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,190
so I would find it presumptuous.

456
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:22,400
It seems that most of them develop an autograph when there is such a demand from fans.

457
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:30,040
For these 6 people who have developed a signature, let's hear their backstory.

458
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,040
There's an oddball there.

459
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,510
I thought of it when I struggled with a comedy sketch.

460
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,320
Since you were struggling with a sketch you thought of it?

461
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:36,980
Yeah.

462
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,480
5 years ago

463
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,890
when I entered the underground idol scene I thought

464
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,820
I will continue to protect it.

465
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,330
When I went to the villain's assembly...

466
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,600
There are all kinds of reasons but

467
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,870
some of them were quite cringey.

468
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,370
What about those who aren't comedians?

469
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:04,310
When did sports stars develop their signature?

470
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,980
Pleased to meet you.

471
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,720
The comedian Ikeda Tetsuya who has participated in 150 high school baseball matches.

472
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,890
Let's ask him about his autographs during high school.

473
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:23,090
Did you have your own signature when you were a high school player?

474
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,260
I could see him
writing many.

475
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,260
So do I.

476
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:29,900
I never saw anyone sign anything.

477
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,230
I wonder why.

478
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,000
So he didn't
have any.

479
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,100
When it was the birthday of Watabe

480
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,610
from Unjash

481
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,210
we all signed a card for him

482
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,480
to give him as a present.

483
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,950
We had been playing for years

484
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,050
but among us no one autographed it.

485
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,490
We simply wrote our names with kanji.

486
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,590
Nakamura went to the same high school

487
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,630
so did Yasuda.

488
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:00,360
These two also wrote their signatures on the gift.

489
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,900
Both of them used kanji.

490
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,900
Even if they were
famous at the time.

491
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,770
Even if they were already pro

492
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,380
they didn't have a signature?

493
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,380
Indeed. They did not.

494
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:17,410
It seem that for baseball players they don't develop a signature until they start going pro.

495
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,450
What about people working the company

496
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:25,520
and who have celebrity-like tasks.
How is it for announcers?

497
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,460
Do announcers have their own signature?

498
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:35,370
Since we often need to express gratitude

499
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,400
I think that everyone writes autographs

500
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,140
but there are many who don't have quick and stylish signatures.

501
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:48,880
In block letters they simple write:
TBS Announcer X X

502
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,220
Indeed, if we look at the autographs of the female announcers at TBS

503
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,590
then there are some who have thought of a composition

504
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:01,860
but most of them write their company name and then their full name.

505
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:06,230
But among them one draws all the attention.

506
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,870
The announcer Hayashi Minaho.

507
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:13,000
Her signature like a long time comedian.

508
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:15,210
She's doing it.

509
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,210
She really does have one.

510
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,640
We unfortunately couldn't ask her directly about it.

511
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,670
It makes me curious.

512
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,640
I see.

513
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,140
Mean.

514
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,080
This is way too mean.

515
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,680
We now understand more about the basics of these signatures.

516
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,460
It takes off from here.

517
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,420
Let's get back to the main topic

518
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,890
Are there people who aren't celebrities who have a signature?

519
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:45,040
Multiple times winner of the Japanese award for stylists - the odd duck: Matsumoto Takuma

520
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,610
I would like to inquire

521
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,240
He's a stylist, right?

522
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,880
do you have your own signature?

523
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,650
While he is an amateur he does have experience being on TV.

524
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,250
Does he have his own signature?

525
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,250
I wonder...

526
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,690
Can you show me your signature?

527
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,490
This is it.

528
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,260
Perfect.

529
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,630
He totally had one.

530
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,660
Totally.

531
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,630
Seriously?

532
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,690
I finally understood the title.

533
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,630
When did you make this signature.

534
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:20,770
Back when I was a little boy and practicing writing.

535
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,910
What do you mean?

536
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,510
Dare I say that

537
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:29,610
that already back then I was thinking of becoming a person who people wanted an autograph from.

538
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,080
That's actually a
great backstory.

539
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,050
One could say it's a bit perplexing?

540
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,950
Somehow I would end up on TV

541
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,890
I had this weird confidence.

542
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,890
Really?

543
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,260
The age at which he developed his signature is a bit odd

544
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,700
but his dream of appearing on TV came true.

545
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:56,910
And charismatic shop employees who gather a loyal shopping crowd have their own signature because of it.

546
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:02,650
It seems that among the general public there are some who also have their own signatures.

547
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:12,160
Let's begin a quiz on non-performers who have some relative fame and see whether they have their own signature.

548
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:18,260
"Barely a celebrity: Do they have a signature or not?" quiz.

549
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,000
First off...

550
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,030
Excuse me.

551
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,800
Pleased to meet you.

552
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,220
Former member of the House of Representatives.

553
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,580
She's definitely
has one.

554
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,310
This is all of a sudden but

555
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,260
I want her to.

556
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,410
can I have your autograph?

557
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,140
My signature?

558
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:37,350
She's so energetic.

559
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,480
Sure.

560
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,920
I'm happy to be asked to give an autograph.

561
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,400
I think she has one.

562
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,920
Please write it here.

563
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,120
Since...

564
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,690
I was a member of the parliament until recently

565
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:48,690
I have't written many, to be honest.

566
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,330
I'm getting nervous. It's a bit embarrassing.

567
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:55,600
Until last year she was living the life of a congress woman.

568
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,970
When asked does she have her own signature?

569
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,940
Asou, please give us an answer.

570
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,710
I think she does have one.

571
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,950
She must be getting used to being asked several times.

572
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,580
I wrote it.

573
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,180
Can I ask you to show it?

574
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,490
I've never shown it on TV but here it is.

575
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,590
There's a heart.

576
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,860
Found it.

577
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,390
That's 'larious.

578
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,290
What the heck.

579
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,560
When did you make this?

580
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,170
Since there's a
heart in there.

581
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,670
It's a bit embarassing but

582
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:34,400
when I was in high school I thought of it.

583
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,510
This kind of thing shows
during that period.

584
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,210
When did you have the chance to use it?

585
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,480
In high school I really liked Amuro Namie.

586
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,180
When I saw Amuro Namie's autograph

587
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,850
I tried to copy it with my own name.

588
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,890
Have you written this autograph while you were in the Diet?

589
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:54,760
If I wrote this while being in the Diet

590
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,730
I would be told: "Don't get too cocky."

591
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,460
So I didn't write it during that time.

592
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,800
So I still haven't used this much still.

593
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,070
Next up is...

594
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:12,110
Professor Kishi Hiroyuki.

595
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,810
May I ask you

596
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,110
to give me your autograph?

597
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,950
Autograph.

598
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,690
Lately he's been appearing in variety shows.

599
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,120
He doesn't have
one, right?

600
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:26,360
His main job is as a university professor.

601
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,190
Please don't have one.

602
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,890
However, does he have his own signature?

603
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,060
Yuki, please answer.

604
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:38,100
I don't think he has one based on his reaction.

605
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,400
Please show me.

606
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,040
I simply just wrote my plain name.

607
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,840
It's average but
drooping a bit.

608
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,440
He doesn't have one.

609
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,680
Is it drooping a bit?

610
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,610
My handwriting is just sloppy.

611
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,920
When I stay at a hotel and have to sign

612
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,720
I wrote like this.

613
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,020
So this isn't an autograph, right?

614
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,020
It's not.

615
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,920
Since I am a commoner.

616
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,560
I despise fools who aren't comedians and think they need their own signature.

617
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,830
Swift decapitation.

618
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,270
Next up...

619
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:10,230
Yeah, the previous person.

620
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,230
He was so straightforward.

621
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,370
Excuse us but this is TBS.

622
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,170
Mister Sasuke: Yamada Katsumi

623
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:20,440
Please give us your autograph.

624
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,310
Why are they asking
him at his entrance.

625
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,820
It's the same Yamada Katsumi as on the shows but

626
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,380
I wonder...

627
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,520
I think he has one.

628
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,050
Let's see if he has his own signature.

629
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,620
This one is difficult.

630
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,190
Please respond, Fukawa.

631
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:36,960
It makes sense if he has one. He has one!

632
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,730
Please show us.

633
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,970
It's this simple thing but...

634
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,270
He totally had one.

635
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,900
He totally did have one.

636
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,900
What did you write?

637
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:51,510
Yamada Katsumi. So here is Yamada and here is Katsu.

638
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,510
He really has thought
about everything.

639
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,650
And this one is a bit strange but it's "mi".

640
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:59,370
And here I wrote: Mr. Sasuke.

641
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,650
Don't they write their
autographs too?

642
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:03,620
What about the other Sasuke All Stars members?

643
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,460
Yes, everyone after appearing and getting tons of support

644
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,590
develop their personal signature.

645
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,330
Even the young ones who have...

646
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,060
appeared 2-3 times on Sasuke.

647
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,600
Or within appearing 4 times

648
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,970
they start developing their signatures.

649
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,770
One step ahead, right?

650
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:24,410
You think it's a bit too rash?

651
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,410
Yes, I do think that.

652
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,180
You aren't there yet, you punks.

653
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:31,720
I think that some of them are aren't quite on that level yet.

654
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,980
Let's survey more people who are only half-celebrities.

655
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,190
The next half-celebrity is

656
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:44,190
Quiz master - Furukawa Youhei.

657
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,200
I don't think
he has one.

658
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,430
Can you please show it?

659
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,200
He had one.

660
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,300
And it's quite cute.

661
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,470
How did it become like this?

662
00:29:54,470 --> 00:30:03,810
Since my name is Furukawa so I wrote Furu and Kawa down here and with the line on the Furu I wrote quiz and then I...

663
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,850
Following that...

664
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,150
He sure took a
lot of effort for
that design.

665
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,850
Endou-san

666
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,450
Ah, good morning

667
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:15,230
Head of the Japanese Arm Wrestling Federation: Endou Mitsuo

668
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,200
Can you show it to us?

669
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,600
I wonder what
it looks like?

670
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,030
Here's how it looks like

671
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,170
"Your body's resilience is your heart's pride."

672
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:26,570
His favorite motto was there, but it still retains its original form.

673
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,090
It wasn't that distorted.

674
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:30,090
It isn't thrown
off-balance.

675
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,040
Following that...

676
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,180
OSU

677
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,550
Mister-OSU
Wada Kasumi-san

678
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,920
Mister-OSU, do you have a signature?

679
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,450
OSU

680
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,890
Which does that OSU refer to?

681
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,890
IT'S OSU.

682
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:48,630
Here it is: OSU

683
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,600
The start and end are surrounded by OSU

684
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,380
But it wasn't much of a signature.

685
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,070
Can I inquire about this unique stamp?

686
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,640
This stamp is?

687
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,640
I had it made.

688
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,870
So it's an original stamp?

689
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,870
Yes, yes, OSU.

690
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,140
The stamp writes out OSU.

691
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,140
OSU

692
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,960
Made from sperm whale.

693
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:16,050
*Also known as the Washington Convention.

694
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:16,050
As if a stamp of the CITES treaty.*

695
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,690
An old reference just like Mister-OSU.

696
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:22,860
And now we will return to the quiz.

697
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,560
Pleased to meet you.

698
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,560
Pleased to meet you.

699
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,030
Aah, I wonder
if he does...

700
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,110
Good morning.

701
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,000
In the outer sphere of the celebrity world:

702
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,230
This one is difficult.

703
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,170
the café located near our filming studio.

704
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,370
It would be odd if
he had one but
it could be fun.

705
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,370
The owner of the café.

706
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,910
He always asks me drop by!

707
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,840
This might be sudden but...

708
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,780
could you give me your autograph?

709
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,780
What?

710
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,620
Please.

711
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,580
I bet he doesn't
have one.

712
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:50,820
He has become slightly famous since RG (Razor Ramon) has been impersonating him.

713
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,690
Then I wish
he has one.

714
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,220
However...

715
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,180
Fujita Nicole, please answer.

716
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:02,170
Against the odds he might have one

717
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:05,070
Could you please show it to us?

718
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,740
He did!

719
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,880
No way!

720
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,580
When did you develop your autograph?

721
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,150
When was it...

722
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,620
I basically never had to write autographs.

723
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,320
I was asked by a talent way back in the past

724
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,210
so I started developing one just for fun.

725
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:31,540
What is unusual is that he doesn't use his full real name.

726
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:38,640
Of everyone in the panel, Hamada, please answer.
What is the full name of the owner?

727
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:43,570
I don't know his full name.
It's something like Fukuda something.

728
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,340
I only say Fuku-chan.

729
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,340
Oh, so you call him Fuku-chan.

730
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,480
How should this be read?

731
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,980
It's simply pronounced Fukuda Yukihiro.

732
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,890
I tried to read it.

733
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,090
But I wrote it a bit artistically.

734
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:01,070
Therefore the correct answer is Fukuda Yukihiro.

735
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,960
And for the last one...

736
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,830
Excuse us.

737
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,800
Yes...

738
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,870
Hello.

739
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:17,060
Often appearing in comedy sketches,
the mother of Tanaka from Ungirls: Tanaka Mieko.

740
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:22,510
Could I have your autograph?

741
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:26,250
Autograph?

742
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,250
Yes please. Your autograph.

743
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,820
That's fine.

744
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,820
After all she does
appear on TV a lot.

745
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:35,680
While it's true she has many appearences she's still considered an amateur.

746
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,010
Matsumoto, please answer.

747
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,020
Considering her response so far she probably has one.

748
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,250
Please show us.

749
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,420
Here it is.

750
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,430
She totally had one.

751
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,610
What's written there?

752
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:01,180
I wrote it with kanji and romaji.

753
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:05,560
Tanaka (田中) and Mieko.

754
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,160
I've had it since I was young.

755
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,460
It seems everyone
has one.

756
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,700
Does your son know

757
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,550
that his mother has her own autograph?

758
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,670
I don't think he does.

759
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,800
He would probably go: "Why does mom have her own autograph?"

760
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,620
And he would probably get angry.

761
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:29,210
And that's it. In the world lots of amateurs seem to have their own autograph.

762
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,180
How does it make you feel?

763
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:36,620
Only Kishi refuses to have one it seems.

764
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:43,130
While watching it only Kishi-sensei conveyed my feelings.

765
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,830
Who was the most surprising one, Nicole?

766
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,600
It might be the owner.

767
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,670
I was surprised to know he had one.

768
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,920
It seems that both of Downtown
call him Fuku-chan, right?

769
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,040
Hamada seems to really know him well.

770
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,740
I speak with him informally.

771
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,780
I thought he was over 1000 years old!

772
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,330
Has he passed 1000 years?

773
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,330
It could look like it.

774
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,950
But you are all the same age?

775
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,960
I wonder what has have to happen in someone's life

776
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,710
in order for someone to look like that.

777
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,560
I wonder how someone becomes like that.

778
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:21,100
But something like that makes a thing like coffee taste better.

779
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,200
And let's not forget the stamp
made from a whale's tooth.

780
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,920
That one had the strongest impact.

781
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:35,260
Next up: Let's explore the theories that various people come up with.

782
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,700
And this time the presenter is...

783
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,750
It's Tamura Kenji!

784
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,390
When I say the word "peninsula"

785
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,680
you might all think "which peninsula", right?

786
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,140
The Hokkaido peninsula.

787
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,140
That's not a peninsula!

788
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,020
It's an island.

789
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,720
You picked the wrong person
for asking such a question.

790
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:08,010
It feels like I set it up for such a response.

791
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:13,900
For me it's Chita peninsula and Noto peninsula.

792
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,900
Noto peninsula, right? There's even a song about it.

793
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,620
Therefore, here is the theory that I am bringing to you.

794
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:25,230
Theory: "Locals who live on peninsulas, when asked to draw their place on the Japanese map, would exaggerate their half by a bit."

795
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,700
Wouldn't that naturally turn out to be the case?

796
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,900
So that's how you perceive it?

797
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:40,280
After all when asking Japanese people to draw Japan on the world map.

798
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,280
Japan will obviously be prominent.

799
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,810
With that being said let's return to the present:
Will the locals indeed exaggerate their peninsula?

800
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm not so sure about the fact that you still stumble on your lines today.

801
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,320
This time, I will be bringing... Huh?

802
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,760
There are a lot of good places to visit and good drinks are plentiful.

803
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,990
And they are kind people, aren't they?

804
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,330
I fully understand, so...

805
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,960
What was that exchange about?

806
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:09,320
Theory: "Locals who live on peninsulas when asked to draw their place on the Japanese map, would exaggerate their half by a bit."

807
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:14,680
With that being the case: Firstly, let's go to the most prolific peninsula in Japan.

808
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,280
It's the most easy to understand and outwardly protruding Noto peninsula.

809
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:25,150
But before this, for the purpose of our theory, we asked people who lived in Tokyo to draw a picture of Japan.

810
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:38,640
Shikoku, chuugoku, Kyushu, Okinawa, Hokkaido

811
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,600
He drew the most
minimum outline.

812
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,540
Along the coastlines, don't you remember there were some peninsulas?

813
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,170
I don't know much about that.

814
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,640
Regarding geography I am not so familiar with it

815
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,410
I mean other than the outline of Japan nothing much comes to mind.

816
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:51,950
If I had such a good memory to begin with, I wouldn't be called a pig-head.

817
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,130
And I wouldn't be loitering jobless in the streets.

818
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,140
There were no peninsulas and no work to be found.

819
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,630
If that's the first person to start off with...

820
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,580
As we continue with the investigation...

821
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,480
This is Tokyo.

822
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,740
It's pretty nice.

823
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,490
Shikoku and Kyushu.

824
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,410
He drew Boso peninsula and Kii peninsula

825
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:20,160
but he has completely ignored the western Japan sea side.

826
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:24,160
Others drew without any peninsulas.

827
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:31,090
Most people in Tokyo drew without any peninsulas.

828
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,090
Furthermore...

829
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:37,990
I can draw a map of Japan.

830
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,990
Only Japan, right?

831
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,930
This is Shizuoka.

832
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,500
Is it Shizuoka?

833
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:43,500
Yes.

834
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,000
It's protruding a bit.

835
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,800
What are those 4 things?

836
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,870
Shikoku. (The four islands)

837
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,840
Shikoku isn't split into pieces

838
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,410
Shikoku - are they islands?

839
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,180
Aren't they split apart?

840
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,490
Too cruel
towards Shikoku.

841
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,490
Aren't they like Hiroshima?

842
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:01,480
Of the 20 people in Tokyo who included a peninsula in their drawings...

843
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,000
only made up 3 of them.

844
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,960
Back to our main question:

845
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,960
Asking the people living in Noto peninsula to draw a map

846
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,730
Well it's obviously
going to...

847
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:15,370
Will they really exaggerate their peninsula?

848
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,220
You chose to shoot
that person?

849
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,900
Are you a local?

850
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,000
Yes, I am.

851
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,200
I was born and grew up here.

852
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,370
She will definitely draw
their peninsula in.

853
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,340
We would like you to draw a picture of Japan.

854
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,370
Raised in the peninsula.

855
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,920
Japan? Sure I can do that.

856
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:33,550
Indeed, there was exaggeration of their peninsula.

857
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:36,470
Kyushu itself was bigger than usual.

858
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,270
Well it is the place where I live so, I made it stand out a bit.

859
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,260
Following that, this person too...

860
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:48,660
This sure is flustering.
What the heck is that?

861
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:49,370
Here is Noto peninsula as it should be on the map, like so.

862
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:52,170
Sado peninsula and here is Noto peninsula.

863
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,190
Over here is Hegurajima.

864
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,940
Indeed, they exaggerate the area which they are living in

865
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,910
to the extent that one would believe that the center of Japan was their peninsula.

866
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,780
I wonder if her son
is living in Naha.

867
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,820
How did it come out?

868
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,820
It became a bit too big.

869
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:07,350
Since this is the important part.

870
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,800
It came out big because it's the important part?

871
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,500
Continuing our investigation.

872
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,770
Where is the Noto peninsula?

873
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:18,810
It's very easy to tell.

874
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,770
Here.

875
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:17,730
Ah, there.

876
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,590
Isn't the Noto peninsula a big too large?

877
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,060
It's big indeed.

878
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,920
That's how it naturally comes out.

879
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,820
For people in Tokyo they do not draw the Noto peninsula however...

880
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:36,150
as expected for people living there . There was an emphasis in their drawing.

881
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,890
However on the east side

882
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,830
they draw it clearly.

883
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,360
What about

884
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,930
an even smaller peninsula?

885
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,080
The next place we will explore is where Namahage is famous

886
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,260
Akita Prefecture - Onna Peninsula

887
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,600
Can I ask you to draw a map of Japan?

888
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,880
Map of Japan?

889
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:57,880
Yes.

890
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,880
This is how it goes.

891
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:03,880
Aomori prefecture should go like this.

892
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,760
Since I'm old and my sight is bad I can't draw so well.

893
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,920
Wait, what did he say?

894
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:19,930
However even with a small peninsula it appears on their maps.

895
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:22,290
And then thereafter...

896
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,960
What about the Onna peninsula.

897
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,860
It's right here.

898
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,380
It's sticking out.

899
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,180
It's here.

900
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,280
Yeah it sticks out.

901
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,400
I drew it.

902
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,400
I see.

903
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,060
Since we are in Akita prefecture I guess it is overrepresented on the map.

904
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,220
And the guy looks like a certain male figure.

905
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,520
The peninsula they live on clearly appears on the map.

906
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,880
Stop it. It ain't me.

907
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,160
For everyone who lives on a peninsula

908
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:54,110
exaggerate their own place.

909
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,130
However...

910
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,120
Hello.

911
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,310
Ah welcome.

912
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,080
Do you want some candy?

913
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,510
Eat some candy, here.

914
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:02,510
What?

915
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,190
Eat candy.

916
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,190
Candy?

917
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,970
I don't need any.

918
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:05,970
Do ya dislike candy?

919
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:06,970
No I like it.

920
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,470
You like it? Do ya?

921
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,470
Yes.

922
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,890
Is this your hometown?

923
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:14,250
It is. I was born and raised here. Hehehehe

924
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:17,000
I will live here until death. Hehehehe

925
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,280
Hokkaido #####

926
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,420
What!?!?

927
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,320
Hokkaido is diamond shaped.

928
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,590
How do you feel about the drawing?

929
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,000
This looks strange.

930
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,130
Why didn't you draw Onna peninsula?

931
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,780
What!?

932
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,870
This is Onna pennisula right here.

933
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,260
Her voice is high.

934
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,530
Because I lack common sense.

935
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,440
Lacks it.

936
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,380
Lacks it.

937
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,080
I'm without common sense.

938
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:45,510
These two lines should be connected.

939
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:51,560
This is the ocean around it.

940
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:51,560
It's the ocean that's around it.

941
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,840
Around it?

942
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:57,590
The ocean... it's the ocean...

943
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,930
Our conclusion is that besides a person without common sense they do draw it with emphasis.

944
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,610
Please stop with the close-up on peoples mouths.

945
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,240
Besides people who lack common sense.

946
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,240
Without.

947
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,410
How was Hokkaido?

948
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,450
It was different indeed.

949
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:16,970
I was wondering if this is also a peninsula.

950
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,250
Where?

951
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,980
Oh this thing?

952
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:21,760
This one?

953
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,730
I was wondering the entire time.

954
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:28,190
If you ask him "what peninsula is that?" he will tell you something incredibly funny.

955
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:31,420
What peninsula is that?

956
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,420
This little thing?

957
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,730
The peninsula of TamuTamu

958
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,730
Eeeew.

959
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,380
Why give me that response?
It's your fault for asking.

960
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,740
Matsumoto.

961
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,950
Matsumoto.

962
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,970
Don't leave your juniors out to dry.

963
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:49,510
Next time... the sumo match that occurred last month.

964
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:55,470
Let's recruit teams where their collective weight is under 170 kg.

965
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,960
To learn more go to our website.

966
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:24,940
Check out our Facebook and Website for more Wednesday Downtown! This video was subbed by a community run project called the Wednesday Downtown project. Thanks for watching!

968
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:04,320
Next week we have a theory about finding the contact info of comedians only by inquiring through their ex-partners

969
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,130
And the former girlfriends of comedians will suddenly appear.

970
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,650
Won't this clip cause major concerns?

971
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,650
Furthermore...

972
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,640
Do you think you can win?

973
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,640
Osu

974
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,480
Mr. Osu will appear in a national karate tournament.

975
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,150
How will it end?

976
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:24,920
Let's look into for how long people in different age groups can go out?
