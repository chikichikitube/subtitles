1
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,860
It finally started snowing, didn't it?

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,660
And with that it will get colder.

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,230
Hey, old man.

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,230
The coffee today is more
bitter than usual, isn't it?

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,070
That's not possible.

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,340
For 20 years the blend
here has gone unchanged.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,170
I guess.

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,380
More than the coffee...

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,480
...I am wondering, even
though it's Christmas Eve...

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,580
...you are all alone?

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,080
About that...

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,920
...we broke up last week.

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,520
Is that so?

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,060
You both looked so happy together.

15
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,030
Maybe I could put on a song?

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,030
Thank you.

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,470
Well.

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,670
How about "Christmas Eve"?

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,480
It fits my mood right now.

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,410
Ok.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,980
Maybe with this you'll forget faster, right?

22
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:10,850
Yeah.

23
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,020
This will help me forget.

24
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,840
Why the hell are you singing?!
