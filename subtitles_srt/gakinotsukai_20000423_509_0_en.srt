or die trying

00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,720
"KiKi" Curry Tournament !!

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,010
Alright then

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,660
We're back again

8
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,390
We've done Coffee, Tea, and Cigarette competitions

9
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,460
Downtown

10
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,460
Hitoshi Matsumoto

00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,460
Masatoshi Hamada

12
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,420
This will be our fourth tournament

13
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,190
The theme is "Curry"

14
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,690
This time we actually get to eat

15
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,970
Make sure to get it right early

16
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,370
Cocorico

17
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,370
Naoki Tanaka

18
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,370
Shozo Endo

19
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,580
otherwise, you won't have a chance because you're so full

20
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,180
Hosei Yamasaki

21
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,600
What do you all think ?

22
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,990
Have you noticed how much instant curry we have here ?

23
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,020
This won't be easy !

24
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,480
Have you had any of these ?

25
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,830
I'd say about a half...

26
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,180
Seriously ?

27
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,650
Yes, at least half of these

28
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,080
I've had this "Makanai Curry" before

29
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,330
I've never seen that one before !

30
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,570
So you've tried these before...

31
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,790
Like this "Kukure" and "LEE Curry"

32
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,550
But I don't know this one...

33
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,420
"Ginza Curry"

34
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,000
It's made by Ginza and Shiseido

35
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,020
I see

36
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,590
By the way, are you guys hungry ?

37
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,690
I gotta admit, I'm not really hungry...

38
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,730
I forgot about the taping today and

39
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,130
I just had curry for lunch !

40
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,080
So, I'm pretty full right now

41
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,910
I forgot about this too and

42
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,060
I went to the dentist who gave me a shot of Novocaine

43
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,380
We've heard enough from you...

44
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,400
So you're saying you had curry for lunch,

45
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,990
even though we were taping this show today ??

46
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,870
What a crazy story ?!

47
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,350
You're such an idiot !

48
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,570
It's the same rules as usual

49
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:27,600
"Kiki Curry" Rule
Taste one of the curries blindfolded
And then correctly identify it from the 20 choices

50
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,500
Step onto the podium if you think you know the answer

51
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,800
If it's not the one you tried, throw the package in the trash

52
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,180
What if you don't get it right ?

53
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,580
I hate this part !

54
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,310
We're all very aware by now but,

55
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,090
let me point out there are some Indians hanging around the set

56
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,420
They're here !!

57
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:42,070
Downtown Presents:
Gaki No Tsukai Ya Arahende

58
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,480
Matsumoto Kiyoshi

59
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,480
Sponsor

60
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,320
Endo claims he doesn't eat much instant curry,

61
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:54,130
Assigned Curry for Endo

62
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:54,130
Good Old Time Curry

63
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,990
but here, he's having "Good Old Time Curry"

64
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,450
Endo, memorize the flavor

65
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:25,420
"Good Old Time Curry"

66
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:25,420
Assigned Curry

67
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,920
Yes, indeed

68
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,000
You need to eat the curry, not just the rice

69
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,790
The sweet flavor points me to...

70
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,620
This "Kukure Curry - Mild"

71
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:25,420
"Kukure Curry - Mild"

72
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:25,420
Currently tasting

73
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,950
Damn, I have no idea

74
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,970
Really ?

75
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,890
Are you serious ?

76
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,990
You serious ?

77
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,330
I'd say this is the toughest series yet

78
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,230
I've already forgotten the flavor

79
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,830
I don't have a clue right now

80
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,010
This curry, "Kukure Curry - Mild"

81
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,640
is NOT what I had !!

82
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,800
"Bon Curry - Mild"

83
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:48,680
Endo clears 5 consecutive choices !

84
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,040
This is NOT what I had !

85
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,300
"Digi-Mon Adventure Curry - Mild"

86
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,090
"Beef Curry" is NOT what I tried !

87
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,820
Despite his sluggish start,

88
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,070
Hotel New Ohtani Beef Curry

89
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,080
he's managed to clear 5 different curries

90
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,280
"Oufu Beef Curry"

91
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,490
He already had curry for lunch,

92
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,680
"Our House Curry"

93
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,040
but he's making this round of "Kiki" look easy

94
00:02:50,550 --> 00:03:27,650
"Good Old Time Curry"

95
00:02:50,550 --> 00:03:27,650
Assigned Curry

96
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,000
Did it have a distinct flavor ?

97
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,660
What's going on with him ?

98
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,470
I thought you two were Manzai buddies

99
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,050
He's focused right now

100
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,310
He needs us to shut the hell up

101
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,080
Why don't you just try them all ?

102
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:27,450
"Convincing Beef Curry"

103
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:27,450
Currently tasting

104
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,240
This one is close...

105
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,360
Here he goes

106
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,740
He's serious ?

107
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,630
What I tried today

108
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,730
is this "Convincing Beef Curry" !!

109
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,910
This is way too difficult

110
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,360
Apologize to the Curry !!

111
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,000
What did she say ?

112
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,770
Well, there was "curry" in there somewhere but,

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,970
"Apologize to the Curry" ??

114
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,160
Well, you tried your best

115
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,660
Matsumoto, how about it ?

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,450
What a tough game this was

117
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,610
Will you hold on and listen ?

118
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,510
I've done this before, and I should know what to expect but,

119
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,740
I'm pretty sure a man is ready to slap me, right ?

120
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,900
And it won't be pretty

121
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,910
Can I say I've never had "Mild" curry before ?

122
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,460
So this could be a troublesome

123
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,410
So a curry like "Bon-Curry - Mild"
could be disastrous

124
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,040
Shut up and put the eye mask on

125
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,540
You're not getting that now

126
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,560
Matsumoto prefers Hot curry and claims to have never tried Mild,

127
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:32,780
Assigned Curry for Matsumoto

128
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:32,780
Digi-Mon Adventure Curry - Mild

129
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,430
So here's "Digi-Mon Adventure - Mild"

130
00:04:34,300 --> 00:05:07,050
Assigned Curry

131
00:04:34,300 --> 00:05:07,050
Digi-Mon Adventure - Mild

132
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,120
How annoying is he ?

133
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,980
Why're you sucking air with it ?

134
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,170
Why ?

135
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,850
He's taking in the aroma

136
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,380
You got it ?

137
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,510
I have the flavor burned into my memory

138
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,010
How do you like me picking this one as my choice ?

139
00:04:52,170 --> 00:05:09,050
Currently Tasting

140
00:04:52,170 --> 00:05:09,050
Good Old Time Curry

141
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,460
Nobody's saying anything

142
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,030
We just completely ignored you

143
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,430
This one is way different

144
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,050
What I had is

145
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,960
NOT the "Good Old Time Curry" !!

146
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,600
Of course, it isn't

147
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,190
You knew that one

148
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,340
Next you've picked "Our House Curry"

149
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:32,840
Assigned Curry

150
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:32,840
Currently Tasting

151
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:32,840
Digi-Mon Adventure - Mild

152
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:32,840
Our House Curry - Medium

153
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,320
Now that this is my second attempt...

154
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,010
How do you expect me to remember what the first one tasted like ?

155
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,620
But this is only your second try

156
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,740
I think the one I tasted was more plain

157
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,050
I did NOT have "Our House Curry" !!

158
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,850
Let me try this one

159
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:56,370
Assigned Curry

160
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:56,370
Digi-Mon Adventure - Mild

161
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:56,370
Currently Tasting

162
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:56,370
Is this Curry ?

163
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,340
This one's really similar to the previous one

164
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,530
I think there were more potatoes in mine

165
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:49,980
In your curry ?

166
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,000
They were more or less mushy though

167
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,790
I doubt this is it

168
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,840
I did NOT have "Is this Curry ?" !!

169
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,980
I think this "Makanai Curry" is really suspicious

170
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:23,690
Assigned Curry

171
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:23,690
Digi-Mon Adventure - Mild

172
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,670
Really suspicious !

Currently Tasting

174
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:23,690
Makanai Curry

175
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,010
I take it back...

176
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,700
So many flavors...

177
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,420
I did NOT have "Makanai Curry" !!

178
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,130
You're on fire

179
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:35,090
Matsumoto shifts to high gear and clears 8 consecutive curries !

180
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:40,650
Risking his life, his "KiKi" Curry continues !

181
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,010
Why can't I pick the winner already ?

182
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:59,130
Assigned Curry

183
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:59,130

Digi-Mon Adventure - Mild

186
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,790
I don't think this one is it

187
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,250
No, this isn't it

188
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,010
This isn't it

189
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:03,200
I did NOT have "Convincing Curry"

190
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:46,140
Assigned Curry

191
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:46,140
Digi-Mon Adventure - Mild

192
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,990
You must be close !

193
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,130
You only have seven left

194
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,310
I'm trying this "Digi-Mon Curry"

195
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:46,140
Currently Tasting

196
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:46,140
Digi-Mon Adventure - Mild

197
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,800
This one's a bit suspicious

198
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,830
I can feel it

199
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,980
What's with the potatoes....?

200
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,350
The potato flavor is wanting some attention...

201
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,120
I don't recall potatoes demanding this much attention from me

202
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,440
I don't recall potatoes demanding this much attention from me

203
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,270
What an idiot

204
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,950
I did NOT have "Digi-Mon Adventure Curry"

205
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,590
Go to the front

206
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,100
You're Curry-tone-deaf !

207
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,760
What do you want ?

208
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,850
He shook my brain

209
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,350
Yamasaki boasts about his tasting ability,

210
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,510
Assigned Curry for Yamasaki

211
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,510
Hotel New Ohtani Beef Curry

212
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,460
Can he identify "Hotel New Ohtani Beef Curry" ?

213
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:34,660
Assigned Curry

214
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:34,660
Hotel New Ohtani Beef Curry

215
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,910
Well, may I say...

216
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,050
Are you OK ?

217
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,610
That's nonsense

218
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,240
What ?

219
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,990
You already lost us when you purposely wore the eye-mask upside down

220
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,030
Is this one of those...

221
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,070
difficult ones ??

222
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,680
What the hell are you talking about ?

223
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,800
I don't get you

224
00:08:44,350 --> 00:09:00,990
Assigned Curry

225
00:08:44,350 --> 00:09:00,990
Hotel New Ohtani Beef Curry

226
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,960
Of course, it's difficult

227
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,950
Considering no one has gotten it right so far

228
00:08:49,840 --> 00:09:00,990
Currently Tasting

229
00:08:49,840 --> 00:09:00,990
Sir Prince Curry

230
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,220
You got that one

231
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,180
Not this one

232
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,370
None at all

233
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,320
This isn't it !

234
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,800
What the...

235
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,500
Don't you remember the rules ?

236
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,420
How many times have you done this ?

237
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,780
I did NOT have "Sir Prince Curry" !!

238
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,920
You need to use a better strategy

239
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:30,200
Assigned Curry

240
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:30,200
Hotel New Ohtani Beef Curry

241
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,670
After you try too many, you forget the flavor

242
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,250
Shut your mouth, I know !!

243
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,590
Pick one already

244
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,840
Oh, I'm in trouble

245
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:30,180
Kukure Curry - Hot

246
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:30,200
Currently Tasting

247
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,380
Remember the bitch slap

248
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,480
I don't think this is it

249
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,270
But the flavor is very similar

250
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,200
I chose this "Kukure..."

251
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,550
What do you mean, "I chose" ??

252
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,280
I chose that it wasn't the right one

253
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,200
You're supposed to say "I did NOT have..."

254
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,330
Of course, you chose this one

255
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,210
I did NOT have "Kukure Curry - Hot" !!

256
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,910
I did NOT have "Kukure Curry - Mild" !!

257
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,330
Despite his usual antics,

258
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,640
he battled through 4 more curries !

259
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,710
Let's try this "LEE Curry"

260
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:25,140
Assigned Curry

261
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:25,140
Hotel New Ohtani Beef Curry

262
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,210
You're going with "LEE"

263
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,680
Don't pick the box up !!

264
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:25,140
Currently Tasting

265
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:25,140
Lee - Hot x20

266
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,250
Will you get the procedure right, already ?

267
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,450
Can't he remember to taste the dish first ?

268
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,000
This is so far from...

269
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,510
Hot !

270
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,410
Spicy

271
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,000
Which is it, moron ?!

272
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,560
This one's spicy

273
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,510
There's no way it's hot

274
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,710
This one's spicy

275
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,180
I did NOT have "LEE Spice x20"

276
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,990
How spicy is that ?

277
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,450
He said, "Hot ! No Wait, it's spicy !"

278
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,490
It couldn't be hot; they've been out here the whole time

279
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:51,800
Assigned Curry

280
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:51,800

00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,360
I did NOT have "Beef Curry" !!

284
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,860
Even the Indians are stunned !!

285
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,310
He got knocked out

286
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,680
Are you OK ?

287
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,840
Nobody deserves to get hit for choosing the wrong curry

288
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,010
Are you OK ?

289
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,330
That's out of control

290
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,010
We feel for you

291
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,980
We feel for you but,

292
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,170
no need to cry out like this

293
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,630
Assigned Curry for Tanaka

294
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,630
Shiseido Parlor Beef Curry

295
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,570
The group chooses "Shiseido Parlor Beef Curry" for Tanaka

296
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,670
This has such a distinct flavor

297
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:05,440
Assigned Curry

298
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:05,440
Shiseido Parlor Beef Curry

299
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,570
This isn't your usual instant curry

300
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,290
I'm going for "Rou Matsumoto Curry"

301
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,440
Currently Tasting

302
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,440
Rou Matsumoto Curry

303
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,640
No, this isn't it

304
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,370
Where are you going with that plate ?

305
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,030
You aren't getting it either

306
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,340
After seeing that bitch slap,

307
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,480
my mind is way too occupied

308
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:20,240
I did NOT have "Rou Matsumoto Curry" !!

309
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,240
I did NOT have "Oriental Curry"

310
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,020
Tanaka makes it through 2 more curries

311
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,000
And he's about to keep his winning streak alive !?

312
00:12:32,560 --> 00:13:12,740
Assigned Curry

313
00:12:32,560 --> 00:13:12,740
Shiseido Parlor Beef Curry

314
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,020
This is only your third one

315
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,170
Could this be it ??

316
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,520
I remember the flavor was rich and robust...

317
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,590
It had an adult taste

318
00:12:44,540 --> 00:13:12,740
Currently Tasting

319
00:12:44,540 --> 00:13:12,740
Shiseido Parlor Beef Curry

320
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,130
Here's "Shiseido..."

321
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,290
This one looks like it's targeted for adults...

322
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,010
And I'm going for it

323
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,960
I just saw him formally greet the curry

324
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,800
Like, "Nice to meet you"

325
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,210
That's really close, damn it

326
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,670
The flavor didn't come through like the one I tried

327
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,070
"The flavor didn't come through" ??

328
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,090
I did NOT have "Shiseido Parlor Beef Curry"

329
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,010
You even pissed off Sathya Sai Baba !!

330
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,660
At least my brain didn't shake !

331
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,120
Nobody has been successful so far

332
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,890
Assigned Curry for Hamada

333
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,890
Digi-Mon Adventure Curry - Mild

334
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,130
Hamada, the last contender,receives the
the "Digi-Mon Adventure Curry - Mild" challenge

335
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,620
Get closer or you won't smell anything

336
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:38,920
Even closer ?

337
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,330
Yes, much closer

338
00:13:39,260 --> 00:14:24,780

A little closer

341
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,670
You're kidding right ?

342
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,300
I'm serious

343
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,350
The spoon is so far from your nose

344
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,280
Are you serious ?

345
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,890
You had it near your forehead

346
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,500
I'm trying "Hakodate Curry"

347
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:24,780

349
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,510
Could this be it ?

350
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,520
Are they close ?

351
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,150
Similar flavors ?

352
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,210
What I had today is "Hakodate Curry" !!!!

353
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,650
What I had today is "Hakodate Curry" !!!!

354
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,670
Here he comes !

355
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,400
How dare you market the "Curry Senbei Cracker" !?

356
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,710
You were right

357
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,020
What's wrong ?

358
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,000
My brain's swaying

359
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,740

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,220
So are we ready ?

364
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,470
Well, before we begin

365
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,740
How's everyone doing ?

366
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,690
I'm ready to do this

367
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,470
Well, hear me out

368
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,220
I've still got a headache

369
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,520
You need to know that today,

370
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,550
we got bitch slapped by some Indians

371
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,820
We were really stunned, huh ?

372
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,790
Yamasaki started crying for real

373
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,320
He really did

374
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,400
And he's like a 32 or 33 year old man

375
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,650
He got hit like this and literally flew into the table

376
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,470
I have a question for Matsumoto-san

377
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,870
since you're a licensed international aviation pilot

378
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,140
How do pilots kill time when the plane is in auto-pilot ?

379
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,660
First of all,

380
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,250
you're all aware of how much training it takes to get licensed, right ?

381
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,190
Then let me educate you about the classes we take

382
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,460
Well...

383
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,590
We don't really learn how to fly

384
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,460
How do you know what to do if you never learn how ??

385
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,470
It only takes pushing a couple of buttons to fly

386
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,800
But what's more important

387
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,600
than learning how to fly

388
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,610
is giving passengers a sense of security

389
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,370
"Yes, I have full faith in this pilot !"

390
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,110
You're talking about the passengers ?

391
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,710
Yes, you need to be confident for the passengers

392
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,450
I see

393
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,120
Yes ?

394
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,920
At the beginning, I might be little tense but

395
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,550
you go ahead and start to prepare like this

396
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,300
What're you doing ?

397
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,760
I'm getting ready

398
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,920
And the pilot pulls the throttle like this

399
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,200
and the plane takes off like this

400
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,420
That was quick

401
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,040
Well, I'm giving you the abridged version here

402
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,870
Then you start making connections like this

403
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,560
What's that ?

404
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,310
I'm connecting extension cords

405
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,800
Extension cords ?

406
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,790
You don't know anything about it, so shut up !

407
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,770
You connect these

408
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,780
And over here, you disconnect

409
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,760
And what are those ?

410
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,780
Why are you connecting and disconnecting ??

411
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,450
You can't be connecting all the time !!

412
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,360
But why disconnect when you're about to take off ?

413
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,250
OK, so once you're off

414
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,910
The pilot brings the throttle back like this

415
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,170
Good so far ?

416
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,130
Got it

417
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,100
And that's it, I don't have much left to do

418
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,870
So this begs the question, "What now ?"

419
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,440
Especially on an international flight taking up to 20 hours

420
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,870
What does a pilot do ??

421
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,330
Please educate them

422
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,290
What do they do now ?

423
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,680
I've actually stood in the cockpit to see what's going on

424
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:50,580
Really ?

425
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,440
I'm not kidding

426
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,780
First of all, they turn their caps backwards like this

427
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,120
What is this, an arm wrestling match ?

428
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,550
Wouldn't they just put it aside ?

429
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,930
And they loosen their ties and relax

430
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,330
Followed by unbuttoning these

431
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,150
Is that necessary ?

432
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,620
Why unbutton them ?

433
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,580
Well, it's one of their rules

434
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,340
Then they put them together and put them on a shelf

435
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:23,470
There's a little shelf inside the cockpit ?

436
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,380
I'm willing to share things you may not know about

437
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,120
Thanks

438
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,520
OK, so what's after that ?

439
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,350
Excuse me ?

440
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,620
What does the pilot do next ?

441
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,960
First, you need to keep in mind the amount of pressure they have

442
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,990
Yes, until the point they're in the air

443
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,430
Right, a few hundred passengers' lives
are in their hands

444
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,130
Now, think about how much relief they feel after a successful take off

445
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:43,880
It's a big relief

446
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,870
That's why they turn their caps backwards and unbutton these things here

447
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,830
Then they take off their coat

448
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,830
I thought, "Why unbutton these things then ?"

449
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,720
I didn't say it because the pilot gave me a dirty look

450
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,110
Anyway, he hangs his coat

451
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,410
And takes this off

452
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,180
Then he takes his shirt off

453
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,660
But why ?

454
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,500
He wants to decompress

455
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,660
And then he just takes it all off

456
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,740
What the hell is that ?

457
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,900
Why are you taking off a bra ?

458
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,260
It's not a bra

459
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,330
This is a pilot's belt

460
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,070
It looks like a bra but...

461
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,390
It's not good if it looks like a bra...

462
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,540
It shouldn't resemble a bra

463
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,940
He takes it off...

464
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,150
Folds the two cups over and wraps it up like so

465
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,790
And then...this happens

466
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,100
What the hell are you doing ?

467
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,200
He puts his foot on the control panel like this...

468
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,890
You're an idiot

469
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,080
What kind of underwear is this ?

470
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,970
Snaps these off like this

471
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,170
Roll it, roll it, roll it, and roll it

472
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,440
He now has two rings

473
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,430
Another shelf, huh ?

474
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,420
The bra doesn't get a shelf ?

475
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,500
Anyway, that takes about an hour

476
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,350
To be comfortable

477
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,550
The rest is like this...

478
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,570
What the hell...?

479
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,510
What're you doing ?

480
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,070
You're cleansing your pores ?

481
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,210
Of course, I'm cleansing

482
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,460
So, you're getting ready to sleep ?

483
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,580
Well, the pilot needs to look comfortable to the passengers so...

484
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,380
But why're you getting ready for sleep ?

485
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,450
One of the attendants knocks on the door at this moment

486
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,540
"Pilot"

487
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,000
Who, the Pilot ?

488
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,000
"Pilot, it's almost time !"

489
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,630
You hear ?

490
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,190
What do you mean by that ?

491
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,570
And he goes, "Alright"

492
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,600
Then what ?

493
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,000
Listen

494
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,540
Didn't you JUST get comfortable ?

495
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,490
Why bother getting undressed ?

496
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,260
Couldn't you have just stayed dressed ?

497
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,120
Cut it out !

498
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,150
Don't forget your cap

499
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,470
Right, turn it forward

500
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,870
And connect one here

501
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,120
This is for the seatbelt

502
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,090
And disconnect here

503
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,020
Finally push the throttle forward like so

504
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,730
And that's it

505
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,590
That's the pilot's duty

506
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,190
Didn't you say the flight is like 20 hours ?

507
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,840
Well...

508
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,990
10 hours from take off and 10 hours to landing

509
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,170
Show me the first 10 hours then

510
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,660
Well, so you finish cleaning up

511
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,400
The you sit down and have a Salem Light Cigarette

512
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,210
And you tearfully smoke

513
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,300
Why're you crying ?

514
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,320
Why the tears ??

515
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,130
Why're you crying ??

516
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,100
There's no need to cry

517
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,390
He's taking in all the beautiful scenery

518
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,400
But this isn't his first time seeing this, right ?

519
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,890
This isn't his first time flying, right ?

520
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,630
You know, I'm summarizing because I only have 30 minutes to work with

521
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:37,020
In reality, the pilot would be like this

522
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,410
Even then, it shouldn't take 10 hours

523
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,900
But the pilot is like this...

524
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,940
Why bother if you're in pain

525
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:57,420
How can the pilot fly if he can't even undo a button ?

526
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,710
So you're doing this and...

527
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,660
there's tears coming down...

528
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,060
And a cat jumps on your lap

529
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,460
The cat is like, "You're the only one."

530
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,390
Huh ?

531
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,540
"You're the only one I can trust"

532
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,800
Who's that supposed to be ?

533
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,190
What's that now ?

534
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,930
You're the only one I can trust

535
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,450
What the hell are you doing ?!

536
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,150
A sleeping passenger wakes up and says, "What was that ?"

537
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,220
"What's up with the pilot ?"

538
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,120
"You can trust me as your pilot"

539
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,590
Shut the hell up
