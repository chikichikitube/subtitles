00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,980
Are scary stories from around the world really scary?

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,340

We're talking about scary stories, I can't shout as usual

16
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,880
Amazing...

17
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,840
The way you said "World Ghost Stories" was something

18
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,700
Amazing

19
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,550
What are we doing today?

20
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:38,420
You know we're in that time of year

21
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,420
Where we hear a lot of Japanese ghost stories, right?

22
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,080
That's right

23
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,080
Yes

24
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,420
Yeah

25
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,920
How about other countries?

26
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,590
How about other countries?

27
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,690
Now that I think about it...

28
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,900
Never heard them

29
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,300
I mean, I don't know much about it

30
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,930
Is there any to begin with?

31
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,930
That's what I want to know

32
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,930
Yeah...

33
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,680
We've gathered TV stars from 6 different countries

34
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:55,440

Our first guest is Agnes-chan

41
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,080
Her face...

42
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,750
I mean

43
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,190
With that face?

44
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,390
Is she trying to make us laugh?

45
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,880
Really

46
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,620
Is that it?

47
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,620
No way

48
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,330
She'll tell us a scary story

49
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,330
That's too much

Our representative from Hong Kong is Agnes-chan

54
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,850
Agnes-chan

55
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,850
China ãƒ» Hong Kong Representative

56
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:45,820
China, Hong Kong

57
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,320
A well-know country and one of the leading economic powers

58
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,200
But which scary story hides within it?

59
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,820
Which scary story...?

60
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,100
A scary story from Hong Kong?

61
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,100
Yes, whenever you're ready

62
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,500
This is a real story happened in a region of Hong Kong

63
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:06,580
One night, there was a phone call in a
tearoom which was about to close

64
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,700
It went "ring ring ring",
and as the store manager answered

65
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:22,180
"I'd like to have... coffee... and sandwich... 3 of each, please"

66
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,770
Huh?

67
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,220
The manager thought

68
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,240
"Who the hell makes calls this late?"
and set out to make the delivery

69
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,250
When he got to the house, he angrily knocked the door

70
00:02:42,650 --> 00:04:55,180
Tearoom catering

71
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:50,260
And then, the door opened a bit

72
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,360
And a voice from inside

73
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,140
Told him "place them inside"

74
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,840
It was a ghastly voice

75
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,000
He then put the food through the small gap on the door

76
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,360
And after he did it, the door slammed shut by itself

77
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,620
He then realized the customer didn't actually
pay him and started to shout "pay me up!"

78
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,340
And then, money came out from under the door

79
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,020
He got so scared he immediately rode his bicycle back home

80
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,180
The next night, at the same exact time, he got the same call

81
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,260
Asking for 3 coffees and 3 sandwiches

82
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,240
Just like the day before

83
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,860
He slid the food down the door and got
his money without showing his face

84
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,010
He thought "could this guy be involved in some crime?"

85
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,700
So he decided to bring the police with him

86
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,400
The police came and the officer said
"it's strange, this should be a vacant house"

87
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,180
"No way!"

88
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,700
"It can't be true"

89
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,820
Then the two of them entered the room

90
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,760
And when they did, what they found...

91
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:09,020
Were the rotting corpses of three men

92
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,900
The policeman stated they must have been dead for at least 2-3 months

93
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,280
"It can't be" - said the shop owner, "I got some
deliveries from here the past few days"

94
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,720
But no one believed him

95
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,320
Some days later, the police called him

96
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,540
"We performed the autopsy..."

97
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:32,300
"And we've found something like a sandwich in the corpses' stomach"

98
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,300
Ohh...

99
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,200
The shop owner thought again about the money he received

100
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,740
And when he looked at it, he realized it had turned into

101
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,520
Few gold-colored coins, which in Hong Kong

102
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,760
Are buried together with dead people for their afterlife

103
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,780
The money he got that day turned into these

104
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,180
And that's it

105
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,440
What do you think?

106
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,150
You said this really happened, right?

107
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,580
It's a famous story

108
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,590
"Golden coins" are something I've heard before

109
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,760
"Golden coins" are something I've heard before

110
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,160
That's right, when he got them at first they were normal money

111
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,200
But when he looked back at them later,
they've turned into golden coins

112
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,200
They've changed

113
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,670
It's a scary story, you know

114
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,940
Quit laughing around

115
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,940
You're giggling like crazy

116
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,460
You too, Hamada

117
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,460
Not true

118
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,740
It was you

119
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,180
Agnes... she was laughing, wasn't she?

120
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,580
Agnes... she was laughing, wasn't she?

121
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,520
No doubt about it

122
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,650
What am I supposed to do?

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,650
Why was she laughing?

124
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,120
Yama-chan made her laugh

125
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,120
We started at the same time

126
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,460
See?

127
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,280
She said at the same time

128
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,920
Heard her?

129
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,760
I think that's because when she entered

130
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,760
she tried so hard to strike a scary look

131
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,760
It makes sense

132
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,660
The whole thing has become unbalanced since

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,660
You're right

134
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,960
She did too much

135
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,880
Next up is a scary story from the U.S.A.

136
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,220
Our U.S.A. representative is a comedian from Nabe Pro

137
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,550
Ike Nwala

138
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,550
U.S.A. Representative

139
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,220
Mr. Ike Nwala

140
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,860
Please tell us your scary story

141
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,320
This story is from the state of Wisconsin

142
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,460
And it's about a little girl

143
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,430
So, there was this girl called Jane

144
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,530
She used to wear a yellow ribbon around her neck everyday

145
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,320
She knew a guy named Johnny, he was her best friend

146
00:06:24,870 --> 00:07:24,060
Yellow ribbon

147
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,540
Everyday Johnny asked Jane:
"why do you wear that yellow ribbon?"

148
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,240
But Jane would never reply to that

149
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,440
When they grew up and became adults, they eventually got married

150
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,420
Jane gave birth to a baby, and he always asked her

151
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,620
"Mama, why do you always wear that
yellow ribbon around your neck?"

152
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,020
But his mom never replied to that

153
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,780
As time went by, Jane and Johnny became old

154
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
And one day Jane became ill

155
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,440
Johnny went to the hospital everyday to check her

156
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,880
And he asked her again

157
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,100
"Please, Jane, tell me"

158
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,780
"Why do you always wear that yellow ribbon?"

159
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,960
Jane replied "you can have it"

160
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,180
"Take it away"

161
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,860
As Johnny unfastened the ribbon from her neck

162
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,860
Jane's head fell off

163
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,240
That's the story

164
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,240
What a dynamic punch line!!

165
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,800
Really

166
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,540
That was sudden

167
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,840
The ending is so dynamic

168
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,240
Incredible

169
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,240
I see...

170
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,580
I don't think there are stories like this one in Japan

171
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,240
Nope

172
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,080
I mean, they don't usually

173
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,940
You're right

174
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,450
End with a black humor feeling

175
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,450
You're right

176
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,860
It was easy to follow, I liked that

177
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,660
Was it effective for you?

178
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,320
Yeah

179
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,790
You can tell it's from the U.S.A.

180
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,300
Yes

181
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,790
And that makes me wonder

182
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,560
Maybe we didn't need Agnes to join us

183
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,280
No way

184
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,970
She's from Hong Kong, it's different

185
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,970
Of course we needed her

186
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,000
But her face...

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,700
That's just for show

188
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,000
Our next scary story is from Egypt

189
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,560
Our representative from Egypt is miss Fifi

190
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,920
Egypt Representative

191
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,920
Fifi

192
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,720
Egypt is the home of countless myths about pharaohs and curses

193
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:31,900
Egypt

194
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,900
Which scary story are we going to listen to?

195
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,900
Which scary story...?

196
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,720
I think you all already know this...

197
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:44,180
But if we talk about Egypt you can easily picture stories of pharaohs such as Tutankhamon

198
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,860
Such as myths about cobras attacking you if you get close to a pharaoh's tomb

199
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,600
There are lots of stories like this one

200
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,700
I wanna tell you about a scary story I personally experienced

201
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,490
Since when I was a little girl, I used to see white dwarfs all around

202
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,380
White dwarfs

203
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,380
Dwarfs?

204
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,160
I don't think I was the only one

205
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,340
But since I was little, whenever I saw a white dwarf, something good would happen

206
00:09:08,670 --> 00:11:10,790
White dwarf

207
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,020
It was a long time ago, from when I was a high schooler

208
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,880
That day I thought "it's been a while since I last saw one"

209
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,660
And then

210
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,020
The doorbell rang

211
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,780
When I opened it there were around 50 men carrying vegetables

212
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,420
I recently moved in, so they were bringing me presents

213
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,180
So something good did happen

214
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,060
Whenever I happened to see another white dwarf, the doorbell rang

215
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,380
And people brought me sweets

216
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:48,140
But one day I was busy making a phone call and the doorbell rang

217
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,960
I was too bothered to go open the door

218
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,080
That night I had a dream in which I was in the same room I was in during the day

219
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,660
There was a door on the other side, and from its gap

220
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,480
I could see a black dwarf behind it

221
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,700
Its eyes were gleaming and it was staring at me blankly

222
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,860
Then I suddenly opened my eyes

223
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,140
I stared at that same door in my dream

224
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,540
And one of my neighbors was spying on me from that gap

225
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,500
I got frightened, but before I realized that man got closer

226
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,500
And he started choking me with a really menacing look

227
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,460
He kept on pressing until I passed out

228
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,360
The next day I woke up, it was a dream

229
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,640
I was talking to the landlord and told him I had this weird dream

230
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,930
I told him that nice man from that house which often comes over was choking me

231
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,100
He replied "no one lives in that house"

232
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,320
"You're kidding me, aren't you?"

233
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,680
He told me "no, it's true", and took me there

234
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,980
He opened up the front door

235
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,400
And there really was nothing inside

236
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,740
It was still morning and I had no idea
what I just saw the night before

237
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:08,620
I got near the washstand and when I glanced at the mirror, I noticed I had a mark around my neck

238
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,790
The end

239
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,430
What do you think about it?

240
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,330
More than "white dwarf", I'd say "small dwarf"

241
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,330
You know

242
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:26,170
I thought you said shiroi koibito at first

243
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,400
That sweet from Hokkaido?

244
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,400
It's a traditional Hokkaido biscuit

245
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,420
Next up is a scary story from Guinea, Africa

246
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,880
Our representative from Guinea is mr. Sankhon Ousmane

247
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,550
Guinea Representative

248
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,550
Sankhon Ousmane

249
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:55,300
Guinea

250
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,220
Guinea occupies the western edge of Africa

251
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:54,620
And lots of different tribes live in its vast pristine nature: which story are we going to listen to?

252
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,300
Which scary story...?

253
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,180
This story...

254
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,840
It's a fairly popular scary story in Guinea,
which is in western Africa

255
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,880
It's about a funeral

256
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,900
In Guinea, when someone dies

257
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,350
We bury them

258
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,740
You burn your dead in Japan, we bury ours in Guinea

259
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,290
In Guinea, they usually bury their dead

260
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:25,180
As a tradition, from when the dead is placed inside the coffin
until the burial is completed, you must not turn around

261
00:12:26,260 --> 00:13:25,220
Don't turn around

262
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:32,320
That's because it will disturb its ghost.
So, one day an eminent man died

263
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,640
And after his burial

264
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,080
Everyone thought it was time to go home, but one man

265
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,260
Was being pulled by something from behind

266
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,340
Something kept on pulling him

267
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,280
But no one could turn around to see it

268
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,640
And for half a day

269
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,280
He stood still, quibering

270
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,390
Hm?

271
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,130
Quivering

272
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,300
"Half a day"...?

273
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,500
Half day

274
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,880
And then he-- all time---

275
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,340
When he turned around, no one was there

276
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,340
There was just a cat

277
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,200
Which was pulling his dress

278
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,080
This is not a story to laugh about

279
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:23,050
When he got back home, all the houses in the village were burnt in a violent fire

280
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,220
It's over

281
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,900
It was kinda scary...

282
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,500
It had a sort of double turn

283
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,500
Yeah, kinda

284
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,270
But in a way it has a happy end, didn't it?

285
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,260
H-happy...?

286
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,000
It's not a happy story, is it?

287
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,310
What the-?

288
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,310
Matsumoto?

289
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,050
Is him our most non-responding guest or what?

290
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,980
Next up is a scary story from Nigeria, Africa

291
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,180
Nice dress

292
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,430
Our representative from Nigeria is Mr. Bobby Ologon

293
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,430
Bobby Ologon

294
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,430
Nigeria Representative

295
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,420
Nigeria is the most populated country in Africa

296
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:17,410
Nigeria

297
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:17,120
Which scary story is from this country of repeated civil wars?

298
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,410
Which scary story...?

299
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,360
Thank you for having me

300
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:28,300
This is a real scary story which is
still happening in Nigeria nowadays

301
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,780
Its name is "elbowrun granny"

302
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,860
The elbowrun granny is really fast

303
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,460
It's said to be faster than a Ferrari

304
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,800
It's a granny who could run up to 300km/h

305
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,840
This granny's story started a long time ago,
when she married a king

306
00:14:48,670 --> 00:17:12,350
300kmh fast granny

307
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,360
This king

308
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,480
He was kind to her

309
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,860
And still, he eventually got a second wife

310
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,780
But after he got married

311
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,900
He grew distant from his first wife

312
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,620
And told her "just focus on the task I give you"

313
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,800
So she went for a 20km walk

314
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,520
In order to get some water

315
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,220
One day, on her road to get water

316
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,780
She slipped

317
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,780
And fell down a cliff

318
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,300
When she fell down

319
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,600
Her body was cut in half

320
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,880
But no one couldn't find her for three whole days

321
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,160
And so she disappeared

322
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,790
And became tainted with rage

323
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,940
As she became angrier and angrier

324
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,260
She started to kill everyone from the village

325
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:58,440
Who came to the river to get water

326
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,020
Her speed was over 300 km/h

327
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,440
And if she goes lock-on on you, you couldn't escape from her

328
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,940
One after another

329
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,960
She started to kill every young men from the village

330
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,860
And so young men started disappearing from the village

331
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,620
And people thought "this is bad, the King has to do something"

332
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,740
So they decided to go see the fortune-teller old lady

333
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,680
The old fortune-teller

334
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,840
Said "your previous wife is filled with rage"

335
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,120
"If you don't do anything about it"

336
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,500
"The village is going to be destroyed"

337
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,650
He's not in the role at all

338
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,360
"But what should I do?"

339
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,140
And so it was decided

340
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,480
That each year, 7 young male virgins

341
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,420
Would be offered to her as sacrifices to ease her anger

342
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,670
Anyway

343
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,260
For now let's offer these 7 virgins

344
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:09,680
And so she can kill them and have her anger eased

345
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,350
This was the elbowrun granny's tale

346
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:20,490
I have no idea what he's

347
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,490
been talking about all the time

348
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,490
Sorry about this, Bobby

349
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,490
First of all...

350
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,530
First of all, what granny did he say?

351
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,530
Was it red-row granny?

352
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,630
It's elbowrun granny

353
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,630
Come again?

354
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,000
It's a granny who runs using her elbows

355
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,000
It's a granny who runs using her elbows

356
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,000
Ah, she ran with her elbows?!

357
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,000
Elbow-running, I see

358
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,200
And she's 300km/h fast, right?

359
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,200
Yes, yes

360
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,310
It's supposed to be a scary story

361
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,310
But you said "if she goes lock-on on you" and stuff

362
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:42,450
You can't just go and use english there

363
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,450
He's right, that's no good

364
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:48,680
He realized halfway through it that we weren't following

365
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,680
And just gave up trying

366
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,120
Eh? Really?

367
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,520
That's not true

368
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,820
He started talking like "yeah, whatever"

369
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,820
It's not true

370
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,820
Coming up

371
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,820
Coming up

372
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,820
The last storyteller narrates something absurd

373
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,820
The last storyteller narrates something absurd

374
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,140
Our sixth guest will be our last one

375
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,920
Our staff held an audition for foreigners living in Japan

376
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:05,770
Last Storyteller

377
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:05,770
They chose a foreigner living in Japan whose scary story


best represents the country from where they come from

378
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,860
And chose the one whose story best represents their home country

379
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,770
Ah, so it's not a famous person?

380
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,770
That's right

381
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,760
Please

382
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,920
Mr. Alif is our representative from Bangladesh

383
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,410
Alif

384
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,410
Bangladesh Representative

385
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,150
It's a pleasure to have you here

386
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,520
Bangladesh, a symbol of India

387
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:28,120
Bangladesh

388
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,560
Which scary story is born in this land?

389
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,120
Which scary story...?

390
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,090
You can start telling your scary story

391
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,460
This is a very famous story in Bangladesh

392
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,200
I first heard it when I got back to my country during Summer break

393
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,570
And since then I still think it's really scary

394
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:47,510
In Bangladesh we have two types of ghosts: male and female

395
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,900
Male ghosts are called "Jin"

396
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,720
And female ghosts are called "Pori"

397
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,260
And because such ghosts are known as "Pori"

398
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,390
They appear as beautiful girls

399
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,740
And they are always trying to lure men

400
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,920
So she went where this guy was

401
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,700
And she was beautiful and then she got closer and closer

402
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,560
And then he ran out

403
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,380
And she run and run and run after him into a paddy field

404
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:23,280
And then smack, smack and she got him from his neck down

405
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,320
And then

406
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:30,290
His friends are like "huh? He was sleeping, wasn't he? We gotta get him away", you know, from the ghost

407
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:34,720
They all went together all of them, they were all afraid

408
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,040
They all went out to search for him

409
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,320
"Oh! He's there and look!
His body disappeared there's only his head!"

410
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,180
He's--- he's been pushed till there and look,
that's all you can see

411
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,140
So they all went there

412
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,220
And ouuuuughhhh

413
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,820
They all lifted him up together

414
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,680
Some of those who lifted him then died

415
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,000
On the same day this story was already well known

416
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,500
And the same people, pretty much the same, the same guys

417
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,180
Were followed by the ghost

418
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,960
She was still a beautiful pretty lady and during their sleep

419
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,980
Those guys were forced to do different stuff,
so no one would know

420
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,340
In Bangladesh we have huge trees,
like 5 to 6 meters tall

421
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,380
And their branches, they're like extra big

422
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,600
They're big trees

423
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:33,540
They say if you get tangled in all those small and big
branches you can't get out from them by yourself

424
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,620
They were looking around there and they're like "hey where is he? Is he in the fields?"

425
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,820
"Look up that tree, look at it!"

426
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,980
They were like "Aaaah we're all gonna die"

427
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,130
"All our parents, all our kids, are gonna die! Quick!"

428
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,260
And lots of people here and there in the village,
they died, they were dying

429
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,770
It was Summer break and I really
wanted to spend time outside

430
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,640
But I didn't want to be alone outside

431
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,640
If I only happened to see a shadow on the ground

432
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,220
Like, if I walk I'd be like "woah, am I gonna get attacked?"

433
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,820
Like, I felt it in my heart and even if my feet would feel itchy

434
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,480
I felt like someone has always been
stare-stare-stare-starin' at me

435
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,760
I was so scared, that town--- mama told me

436
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,560
"Get back home as soon as possible, get safe inside"

437
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,360
The end

438
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,000
What the--!?

439
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,040
The hell was that story about?!

440
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,020
"The end" was so sudden

441
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,060
Really unexpected

442
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,270
Lots of people saw that too

443
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,270
I'm speechless

444
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,460
Listen to me, Hamada

445
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,100
Yes?

446
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,440
If you ask some

447
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,250
They would reply that they did see it for real.

448
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,940
You know? On the countryside we have these trees

449
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,540
They're like

450
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,060
Big horse heads shining like diamonds

451
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,490
So I got back home and was like "woah, uhg! I can't ohhhh"

452
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,330
Once again: what the hell are you sayin'?

453
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,560
We don't have much time left, mr. Alif

454
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,600
It's time to go

455
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,600
Yeah, right

456
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,730
This can't even count as a spin-off

457
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,480
We barely got anything out of his story

458
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,640
Here are the scary stories told by our six guests

459
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:07,610

Lastly

473
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,050
Keep in mind that the winner

we pick, the one with the scariest story

475
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:15,020
Will tell us the same story in their mother tongue

476
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,090
Will tell us the same story in their mother tongue

477
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,090
Mother tongue?

478
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,190
Mother tongue? Why?

479
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,190
Are we in hell?

480
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,380
I'm sorry for Ike, I really liked his story

481
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:27,730
But he's from the U.S.A., so in english...

482
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,940
Yeah, I know

483
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,130
We would sorta understand, more or less

484
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,130
Yeah, that's it

485
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,360
What do you think?

486
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,170
How about our last guest then?

487
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,180
It has to be him

488
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,170
What do you think about Mr. Alif?

489
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,320
But we barely understood anything

490
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,740

You can tell

507
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,300
kou yatte... [in bangladesh]

508
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,300
like this...

509
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,110
[in Japanese] people died like this

510
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,640
Japanese...?

511
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,100
He switched into Japanese

512
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,170
Oh, my bad

513
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,240
I'm sorry, I've been living here in Japan for so long...

514
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,840
I know I'm talking about my country

515
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,920
Just hold it down!

516
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,040
I even end up speaking it when talking to my mother, I'm sorry

517
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,040
You should have wrote it down beforehand, come on

518
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,760
I'm sorry about that

519
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,640
Does your mind switches to Japanese when you think?

520
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,640
It does!

521
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,880
It's a real story, so of course I'm gonna switch

522
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,320
It's so obvious

523
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,690
I've been in Japan more than in my home country

524
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,060
I'm here since the Showa period

525
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,060
Showa?!

526
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,560
That long?!

527
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,730
That's a long ago

528
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,530
That's why I didn't get some words he said

529
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,530
That's right
