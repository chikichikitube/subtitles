00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,740
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,220
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,870
It's Kawashima!

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,700
Thank you

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,690
Solo artist

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,770
I'm not a solo artist, my partner is still alive

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,610
He's just a little bit out of the TV business

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:36,820
Today is the 3rd edition of a super popular project

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,090
Does this program have a super popular project?

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,250
I think it has given birth to many masterpieces

11
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,830
Do you have a project in mind?

12
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,860
Akatsu system

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,430
Akatsu appears every now and then

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,400
Is today something that hasn't been seen for a while?

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,910
Yes, it hasn't been done for two years

16
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,580
Let's take a look

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,790
What i'm talking about it this

18
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,480
3rd Early Bento Sensei

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,450
Two years have passed
-Two years already?

20
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,130
Was it that long ago?

21
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,370
Do you all remember the first one?

22
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,990
Slightly

23
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,180
The project was how many bento can be eating during class without the teacher noticing

24
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,100
It was quite well received

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,830
Because of the good response, a 2nd edition came out almost immediately

26
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,470
Do you remember, Matsumoto?

27
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,140
Remember, I remember

28
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,770
Too many elements were added into it

29
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,740
It was a big jump from the school setting

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:45,180
Eating crabs in psychic attractions, it lost the original intention
-It was inexplicable

31
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,030
Too fast perhaps?

32
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,000
Too much going on

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,130
Just like mom's dinner

34
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,100
Give her a little bit of praise and then the next day's meal is awful

35
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,510
So, because of all of this, we have returned to the morning classroom setting

36
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,540
Also,

37
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,180
Will an athlete's plan to prank someone be more interesting because of their lame acting skills?

38
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,510
Also,

39
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,120
If you are a person who can supposedly sense when someone is behind you, can you evade an attack?

40
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,330
This time, we used a fake project to find three teachers

41
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,410
Students compete to see how much food they can eat in class without being caught

42
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:52,220
The resurrection of Early Bento Sensei

43
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,790
The challengers are

44
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,020
Unique

45
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,830
These candidates are

46
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,130
All fatties

47
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,970
Did you ever eat lunch early when you were a student?

48
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,880
Yes, I did, I ate it during class time.

49
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,770
And then again, the class is still...

50
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,040
I did sneak a little bit of food in class.

51
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,250
I had one of old-fashioned lunchboxes for Dad.
-Those huge ones?

52
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,550
They'd see that, right?

53
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,350
Not suitable for sneaky eating

54
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,820
It can keep miso soup warm.

55
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,690
The first hour involves eating cream puffs

56
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,330
Should be okay

57
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,680
They get 1 point for eating 1 in a 10-minute course

58
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,920
But if discovered the points go back to 0

59
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,240
The results of the seat lottery are shown above

60
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,190
Sitting in front is dangerous

61
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,620
The teacher for the first class was

62
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,940
It also depends on the teacher

63
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,850
Madame Devi

64
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,440
She'll be angry

65
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,900
Stand up

66
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,870
The topic of the class that Madame will be teaching is about the society

67
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,760
Bow

68
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,930
Sit down

69
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,920
The tension is amazing!

70
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,320
The student over there, why are you grinning?

71
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,340
Scary

72
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,810
Not just you but but the one behind you also

73
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,610
I'm sorry

74
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,340
You have to be more serious

75
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,630
As the teacher sends a warning almost instantly

76
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,720
The air in the classroom suddenly becomes heavy

77
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,590
Good morning

78
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,240
Please introduce yourselves

79
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,120
I am Hollywood Zakoshi

80
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,450
A very serious introduction

81
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,320
I'm Maple Leaf Super Alloy's Ando Natsu

82
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,280
Maple leaf super alloy?

83
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,810
Yes, that's the name of our group

84
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,370
Piqued her interest

85
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,370
Which part?

86
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,560
What is the origin of the name

87
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,860
Not interested in Zakoshi

88
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,630
For the name, I like sweet maple sugar sauce...

89
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,160
He's eating

90
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,910
A sprint!

91
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,310
Covered by Ando's huge body

92
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,090
Nishimura gets one point

93
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,410
Nishimura is super lucky!

94
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,830
Nishimura has a good spot

95
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,740
Superb wall!

96
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,910
I'm Tom Brown's Razor Ramon, please tell me more.

97
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,640
Hello, my name is Hikomoru

98
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,380
I'm Viking's Nishimura

99
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,630
Your name is like the name of that program

100
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,100
People often say this

101
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,340
I'm Trendy Angel's Takashi

102
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,110
I'm not sure I understand, honyuu Angel?

103
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,280
It's Trendy Angel

104
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,200
Trendy Angel

105
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,640
Not at all trendy

106
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,410
I'm the Angel
-Oh I see

107
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,450
Then let me introduce myself

108
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,440
Turning around is an opportunity

109
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,870
My name is

110
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,880
Now!

111
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,540
Quick!

112
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,320
The cheeks are protruding too much, right?

113
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,340
Go for another!

114
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,820
While the teacher is writing on the board

115
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,670
The students stuff the puffs into their mouths one after another

116
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,140
Ate a lot!

117
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,920
This will end soon surely

118
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,160
Ratna means gemstone

119
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,200
Go again?

120
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,550
This time

121
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,580
What's going on?

122
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,070
Choking on your food?

123
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,890
Oh no, Nishimura is in trouble!

124
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:27,880
Yes, in fact, one of the ten small puffs is filled with mustard

125
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,440
Is this necessary?

126
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,360
The students who don't know anything

127
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:41,160
Must deal with the surprise accordingly

128
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,350
What are you up to over there?

129
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,780
Gemstones yes

130
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,930
My name is the jewel of...

131
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,380
Luckily they've got water

132
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,170
Despite Nishimura's strange behavior

133
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,770
He's SAFE

134
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,460
After this, Nishimura's abnormal state goes unnoticed

135
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,110
And the other students continue to sneakily eat their food

136
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,550
So

137
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,080
Gradually, the mustard begins to rear it's ugly head

138
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:37,550
It is called Pearl of Orient...

139
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,440
What do you have in your mouth?

140
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,710
Eh...

141
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,510
Sorry... that's...

142
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,380
I'm just bleeding a bit

143
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,050
So I stuffed some tissue paper in my mouth

144
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,350
You put tissues in your mouth?

145
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,480
Are you okay?

146
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,290
I'm sorry if I hurt you a little bit.
-In the mouth, right?

147
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,150
Sorry

148
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,210
SAFE, right?

149
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,630
Despite using a messy excuse

150
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,350
He isn't exposed and the class continues

151
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,890
They're getting by

152
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,880
However,

153
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,300
A sudden streak of mustard attacks the class

154
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,630
What's wrong with you?

155
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,460
I'm moved to tears, I can't stop it

156
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,030
Because it's a good story

157
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,930
Another far-fetched reason, but nonetheless SAFE

158
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,930
Next

159
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,070
This is the end of 1st lesson

160
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,050
It's finally over

161
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,500
The results so far are revealed

162
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,690
Good work everyone

163
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,690
Everyone is exhausted, right?

164
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,420
No one said there'd be mustard

165
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,710
What the hell is going on?
-It's too much!

166
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,660
It halted the rhythm of eating completely

167
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,700
Did everyone eat everything?

168
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,030
No, I have some left

169
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,500
I ate them all

170
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:25,580
So the results of the 1st lesson are shown above

171
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,030
The next morning meal challenge in lesson 2 is

172
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,020
Please look over here

173
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,950
What, what?

174
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,420
A rice bucket
-Rice bucket?

175
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,370
※Still widely used for measuring sake and rice. 1 bucket is equal to 150 grams of raw rice, which expands 2.2 times when cooked.

176
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:46,270
This time, the whole team will work together to finish a meal

177
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,640
If they finish eating in the 10-minute course, they will all get points

178
00:09:53,810 --> 00:10:00,510
This rice bucket will be placed in the cabinet behind everyone

179
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,010
This will be exposed ah
-Definitely!

180
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,650
The seats after a lottery are shown

181
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,820
The teacher of the 2nd class is

182
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:24,510
Akira Yamane, former president of the Japan Boxing Federation

183
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,130
That's bad

184
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,790
I'm not good at writing, so please bear with me.

185
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,330
Despite surely having been seen

186
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,960
It is ignored

187
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,630
Contrary to his scary appearance, he is a teacher with many flaws

188
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,240
This is also time consuming

189
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,820
Takashi is responsible for serving the rice and then passing it in relay to the other participants

190
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:15,920
Then, they eat the chosen ingredients

191
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,200
I am Yamane

192
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,140
15 years-old?

193
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,880
Is that it?
-This is it

194
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,740
So handsome!
-Awesome photos!

195
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,480
Don't praise him

196
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,270
Be sure to look at all of them

197
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,490
Please write the release date and name of your book

198
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,710
Why are you telling him what to do

199
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,320
Thank you

200
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,330
What the hell is going on?

201
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,720
Close the cabinet!

202
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:58,090
After that, the teacher's vulnerability is taken advantage of as everyone eats

203
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,130
This will surely be exposed

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,950
The cabinet never closes

205
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,110
2 minutes left on the clock

206
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,510
I told you to close the cabinet!

207
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,510
There's now just a little bit of rice left in the bucket

208
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,370
State 5 points that you like most about your wife

209
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,810
Or if you were to say 3 points, what would they be?

210
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,280
Please write it on the blackboard

211
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,220
I'll say it with my mouth

212
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,820
Write it on the board so that we can take notes
-We want to write down

213
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,920
Don't use words

214
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,310
Ando's brilliant trick forces the teacher's attention toward the blackboard

215
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,700
And with that, the final dash

216
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,360
The sound of clacking chopsticks

217
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,800
I told you to close it!

218
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,880
There's only a little left

219
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,780
Can't close it

220
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,130
Not a bit of garbage is left, she cleans several times a day

221
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,360
His wife's strengths are really narrow

222
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,330
Not much time left

223
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,870
So...

224
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,660
But it feels like it will work

225
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,910
Lawlessness

226
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,380
How do you feel after all your hard work?

227
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,570
"Rikido" is written on the blackboard

228
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,710
It was possible

229
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,910
What was this class about?

230
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,420
How about the barrel? Is it all gone?

231
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,130
Impressive, its all gone!

232
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:39,790
So everyone scores an extra 10 points each

233
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,170
After a strange class

234
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,750
It's finally time for the final battle

235
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,970
Let's have a scarier teacher

236
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,860
Lesson 3 is buffet mode

237
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:56,160
Here there are 20 types of dishes to choose from

238
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,410
However much they eat will determine their points

239
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,800
What the hell is this?

240
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,790
You can make pancakes.
-With that?

241
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,300
You want us to cook?

242
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,060
Yes, that's right

243
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,830
In class?

244
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:16,310
This time, there is an expanded range of cuisine

245
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,560
And the score is determined by the difficulty level of cooking

246
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,440
Who is the teacher?

247
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:29,300
The lowest scoring students so far choose the most difficult dishes

248
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,820
And fight to get to the top scores

249
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,520
Depends on how dumb the teacher is

250
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,330
The teacher of the 3rd class is also from the world of boxing

251
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,740
When he's angry he's surprisingly scary

252
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,320
I'm Yoko Gushiken

253
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,220
Its serious

254
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,880
Today

255
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,970
First, let me briefly introduce myself

256
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,870
I used to be a boxer

257
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:05,020
I am using my real name, not a stage name

258
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,400
Where is it hidden?

259
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,510
A name with high ambition

260
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,880
Today's topic

261
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,630
It's like a normal meal

262
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,310
The proverbial broken teacher

263
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,000
And the students who are bolder in front of him

264
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,880
Too bold, right?

265
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,400
Then

266
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,980
Where do you go to work out?

267
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,380
Starting to cook

268
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,150
Sendagaya's...

269
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,740
Takashi is hard at work on his pancake

270
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,000
No noise?

271
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,080
How can I put it? It's hard just to make ends meet...

272
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,650
And so

273
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,830
Ready to eat

274
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,930
What's that?

275
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,040
Watermelon! Watermelon!

276
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,650
Gushiken!

277
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,670
The smell must be strong

278
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,870
Teacher, pay attention!

279
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,980
The WBA is now based in Panama

280
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:49,590
At this time, the three people in the back row all decide to make the loudest dish with the highest score

281
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,370
This will make a sound

282
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,140
But

283
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,780
If you win, you get a shot at the title

284
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,330
An unimaginable volume of spicy fried chicken with cheese heats up

285
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,160
Why are you so oblivious?

286
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,250
There's a sound!

287
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,980
But even with this, everone is surprisingly SAFE

288
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,610
So

289
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,800
The juice is coming out

290
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:48,860
The back of the classroom is as noisy and roaring as an industrial plant

291
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:56,990
But the teacher ignores this and continues the lesson

292
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,320
However, suddenly...

293
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,660
Oh, you're not eating watermelon are you?

294
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,330
Eh?

295
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,560
A mysterious claim

296
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,500
Is it okay to bring watermelon?

297
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,240
And so, the watermelon is exposed

298
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,410
And so, the lesson ends

299
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,680
I can't believe such idiots really exist

300
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,050
With both sound and fragrance

301
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,950
CHUUUUU, the sound of it

302
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,880
The final score is shown in the chart

303
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,660
Hollywood Zakoshi takes the top spot

304
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,020
Impressive

305
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,480
What does everyone think of this 3rd edition

306
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,900
I guess it's best to go back to square one

307
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,370
The class setting is best

308
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,630
But the teachers should make it more tense

309
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:57,160
Yes, Gushiken didn't even notice ice being ground

310
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,550
Maybe Gushiken can only hear the sound of the gong for the start of a match

311
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,680
Yes, the sound would definitely catch his attention

312
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,170
And the little puff is unnecessary

313
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,710
The ones filled with mustard?

314
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,330
It's like a punishment

315
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,900
But Hamada was smiling like a baby when they ate it

316
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,430
That man loves to see people in pain

317
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,030
I also enjoyed it to be honest

318
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,010
It really was interesting

319
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,440
,Let's welcome the next presenter

320
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,470
,Hello everyone

321
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,280
,It's Sanshiro Komiya!

322
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:42,130
,This time I'm bringing you the 2nd edition of a theory from 4 years ago

323
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,500
,4 years ago?
-The 2nd one?

324
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,630
,Do you know what it is?
-There have been many theories before

325
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,090
,Even if I know, I won't say it

326
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,400
,Just say it, please say it

327
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,240
,So, what is it?
-I don't have a clue!

328
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,520
,What type is it?

329
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,240
,It's a prank series

330
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,640
,A series of pranks?
-There were many.

331
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,580
,For example, Matsuno once appeared in it

332
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,660
,Ah!
-Remember?

333
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,960
,Is it some kind of project about a lame actor?

334
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,000
,Yes yes
-Athlete

335
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,920
,Athletes
-Yes, yes, yes

336
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,750
,So the theory I have brought this time is...

337
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:21,420
,Will an athlete's plan to prank someone be more interesting because of their lame acting skills?

338
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,240
,This fact was very interesting indeed

339
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,690
,The first edition was a long time ago, you still remember it?

340
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,240
,With Yu Sawabe?
-Yes, yes, yes.

341
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,780
,Last time Sawabe laughed because of the lame performance of Akemi Matsuno

342
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,480
,Isn't your tie pin too close to the top

343
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,380
,What are you saying?

344
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,390
,Your tie pin is too close to the top

345
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,270
,Ah, sorry

346
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,620
,So strict!

347
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,740
,This has nothing to do with the program

348
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,140
,I planned thoroughly in advance, please don't disrupt my rhythm

349
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,440
,Is it going the way you envisioned?

350
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,260
,Not at all

351
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:14,230
,Will an athlete's plan to prank someone be more interesting because of their lame acting skills?

352
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:22,470
,The first participant is Karina Maruyama, formerly of the Japanese women's national soccer team

353
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,440
,She may not be very good at acting

354
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,160
,It's the first time I've been able to prank someone

355
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,730
,Although I am often pranked by others

356
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,430
,But it's the first time I've done someone else

357
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,680
,The target for this time is...

358
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,640
,Do you know Hashimoto?

359
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,240
,Yes, I know. I've heard a lot about him

360
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,840
,Have you ever worked with him?

361
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,650
,Experience of working with him...

362
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,750
,About 5 times or so

363
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,690
,5 times, may be a little less than 10 times, maybe

364
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,720
,This time, Maruyama's plan is "she actually has psychic powers"

365
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,290
,For the setup, she will perform a séance

366

,The program team really likes Yamada

543
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,020
,Mr. Yamada, what happened to your face?

544
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,790
,I suffered an injury

545
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,130
,What happened

546
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:45,130
,While practicing, when you're older its easier to fall over

547
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,760
,I fell down and hit my face

548
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,070
,Are you ok now?

549
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,770
,It doesn't matter, it's just the face

550
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,440
,Why?

551
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:59,420
,This time Yamada is going to prank someone regarding memory loss

552
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:07,920
,The target is the current top SASUKE participants who also have a personal relationship with Yamada

553
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,350
,So, the prank begins

554
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,720
,With injuries like this...

555
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,730
,Are you OK?

556
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,570
,Hello
-Hello

557
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,510
,Are you OK?

558
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,470
,He's really hurt. Looks like the real thing

559
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:42,120
Are you all right?
-Good morning

560
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,920
,Are you OK?

561
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,730
,How are you feeling?

562
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,330
,What's going on?

563
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,470
,Ow ow ow ow

564
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,500
,Are you not feeling well?

565
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,610
,Well, it's pretty tough

566
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:10,080
,I'm sorry, what's your name again?
-Eh?

567
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,250
,I am Hioki
-I am Kawaguchi

568
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,850
,Hioki? Kawaguchi?

569
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:23,190
,What's my name again?

570
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,870
,He's going through a tough time

571
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:31,030
,Amnesia plan (1) Can't remember his name

572
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,200
,Aren't you Yamada Katsumi?

573
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,370
,Yamada?

574
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,030
,That's right, Yamada
-Ha...

575
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,580
,Ah, I got hit by a bike on the way here

576
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,010
Yes

577
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:47,220
,Perhaps because I hit my back and head hard when I fell

578
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,490
,No way!

579
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,190
,Someone brought me here and I don't remember anything

580
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,860
,No way!

581
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,600
,Putting aside the quality of Yamada's acting

582
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,840
,The script regarding the accident is moving forward in a very serious way

583
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,870
,What is my relationship with you guys?

584
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,570
,Didn't we meet through SASUKE?

585
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,510
,SASUKE？

586
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,210
,Ow ow ow ow

587
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,080
,Headache

588
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:19,380
,Amnesia plan (2)  Hearing "SASUKE" gives him a headache

589
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,710
It hurts

590
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,420
,What did you just say?

591
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,380
,I just said SASUKE

592
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,650
,Ow ow

593
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,250
,Ow ow ow ow

594
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,920
,What the hell do you mean by that? What the hell is SASUKE?

595
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,290
,Did you say SASUKE?

596
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,330
,SASUKE？

597
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,860
,Ow ow ow ow

598
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,360
,What does that mean exactly?

599
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,730
,What does SASUKE mean?
-The meaning!

600
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,960
,That's a tough question

601
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,070
,I get a headache when I hear it

602
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,570
,I don't think we can say SASUKE

603
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,270
,Can't say SASUKE?

604
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,670
,SASU...I told you to stop talking about it

605
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,680
,What exactly is SASUKE?

606
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:51,510
,SASUKE involves climbing walls, jumping, catching ropes

607
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,590
,Are you talking about some kind of athletic competition?

608
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,560
,Adults do this sort of thing?

609
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,030
,You're saying that?

610
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,800
,You have done it the most

611
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,230
,No, no, I don't remember

612
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,040
,This competition thing doesn't sound even the least bit interesting

613
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,070
,But you are Mr. SASUKE

614
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,040
,No, no, no, no

615
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,600
,Little by little, Yamada forgets the "headache when hearing SASUKE"

616
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,160
,Next

617
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:30,150
,Amnesia plan (3)  Use SASUKE actions to awaken his memories

618
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:33,360
,Is there anything that can make me recollect it?

619
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,850
,What is he doing?

620
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,900
,It's dangerous. It's dangerous.
-Very dangerous

621
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,660
,What? What is he doing?

622
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,240
,What? What's he going to do? Scary

623
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,770
What?

624
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,190
,Something like SASUKE?

625
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,550
,Have I done similar exercises like this?

626
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,620
,That is SASUKE's "Pipe Slider", it is the last part of the third stage

627
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,650
,Pipe Slider...

628
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,380
,Holding a pipe with both forehand and backhand

629
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:09,610
,This is the method for the pipe slider that Yamada came up with when he was young

630
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:14,660
,Yamada, you have reached this level many times

631
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,650
,What the hell is he doing?

632
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,070
,Dangerous

633
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,000
,What is all this

634
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,470
,Is this the way to do it?

635
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,950
,Like moving forward, swinging forward

636
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,080
,Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow

637
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,020
,Are you OK?

638
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,920
,Hand slipped

639
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:42,930
,An unexpected reenactment of a SASUKE performance

640
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,930
,Next is the final step

641
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:52,870
,Amnesia plan (4)  Repeatedly shouting SASUKE to awaken his memories

642
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,900
,Repeat what you just said

643
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,870
,I seem to be remembering something

644
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,470
,SASUKE？

645
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,200
,Yes, SASUKE

646
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,140
,Maybe I can think of something. Think of something

647
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,980
,SASUKE SASUKE
-Yes, yes, that's it

648
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,010
,Mr. SASUKE Mr. SASUKE
-Yes yes

649
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,550
,SASUKE SASUKE

650
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:06,150
,Only like SASUKE, most like SASUKE

651
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,550
,SASUKE Black Tiger

652
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,060
,Mr. SASUKE Mr. SASUKE

653
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,120
,SASUKE SASUKE

654
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,860
,SASUKE SASUKE

655
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,010
,Next the prank is revealed

656
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,520
,He snickered, feeling successful

657
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:25,240
,What is this?

658
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,270
,What cha la la la, what the hell is going on?

659
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,640
,Great success~

660
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,810
,What is all this?

661
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,380
,My first prank was greatly successful

662
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,920
,Give me a break!

663
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,170
,Next is the last person to be set up

664
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,600
,Former professional wrestler Animal Hamaguchi

665
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,460
,He definitely can't do it

666
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,830
,Can't do it can't do it

667
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:56,940
,In fact, this is the second time that Beast Hamaguchi has appeared in this project

668
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,930
,He was there last time too

669
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:57,580
,Yes

670
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:03,610
,I am a person who is actually very spiritual

671
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,070
,Really?

672
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,480
,Last time he acted as the pranker for the paranormal program

673
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,890
,And gave a perfect demonstration of lame acting skills

674
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,690
,This time you're going trying to trick Kyoko, your daughter

675
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,000
,He can't, can he?

676
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,020
,Leave it all to the old man, no problem

677
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,590
,The trap to be set for Kyoko this time is

678
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:33,240
,We invited Kyoko to our hotel on the grounds of a magazine interview

679
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:39,780
,You will be the journalist of the magazine

680
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,010
,We want you to disguise yourself

681
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:47,880
,Kyoko must not see through your disguise

682
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:54,440
,This time, Animal Hamaguchi disguises himself as a magazine reporter

683
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,440
And so

684
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,640
,Feels good

685
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,040
,If I put on a beard and glasses, I'll be...
-Totally unrecognizable

686
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,940
,That's awful

687
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,900
,It's bad. It's really bad

688
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,210
Although I do want to see him make a fool of himself

689
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:24,390
,What is your favorite type of man?

690
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,020
,Can you make your voice a little higher?

691
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:41,640
,Kyoko, what is your favorite type of man?

692
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,770
,At this level, Kyoko will not be able to hear who you are

693
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,510
,That's not good, is it?
-No, it's not

694
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,280
,Not bad

695
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,510
,You can hit such a high tone

696
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,330
,The staff are full of malice

697
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,880
,Of course

698
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:58,080
,Just like before, Kyoko is told all the details of the plan beforehand

699
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,830
,The prank begins

700
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,500
,Isn't it still him?
-That's Hamaguchi!

701
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:07,400
,Please come in

702
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,920
,Did he really think Kyoko wouldn't recognize him?

703
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,830
,Excuse me

704
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,800
,She is already laughing out loud

705
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,810
,What a mess

706
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,080
,Really, both sides are like this

707
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,770
,Definitely not. No, no, no

708
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,420
,I said no!

709
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,180
,Hello

710
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,980
,I am Ohara from the editorial team

711
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:34,920
,Also, this is Ohtani from our company

712
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,640
,It's bad, Ohtani!

713
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:43,130
,The incredible disguise

714
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,900
,Kyoko couldn't help but laugh out loud

715
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:51,120
,On the other hand, Animal Hamaguchi clearly saw Kyoko laughing out loud

716
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,080
,But is somehow completely unmoved

717
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,950
,He must have thought he hasn't been exposed.
-He must have thought so.

718
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,410
,By the way, the final task for Animal Hamaguchi this time is

719
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,790
,Get Kyoko's personal information

720
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,580
And so

721
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:19,200
,Disguise prank plan (1) The female reporter leaves the two alone

722
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,290
,So hard at the beginning

723
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:19,200
,Excuse me, I have an emergency call to take

724
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,270
,Excuse me, can I leave for a moment?

725
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,540
,Yeah, it's okay

726
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:28,080
,I'll leave you with Ohtani

727
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,810
,Ohtani, please.

728
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,390
,Ohtani, is it okay?

729
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,420
,So~

730
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:44,460
,Ohtani will ask a few questions

731
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,970
,What are we watching?

732
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,020
Your tie clip...

733
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,790
Yes, I'm sorry, i'll be careful not to let it slide up again

734
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,790
This is a very interesting section

735
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,790
I'm impressed!

736
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,530
It's better down a bit
-Enough! Stop focusing on it

737
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,350
,So~

738
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:12,520
,Ohtani will ask a few questions

739
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,760
,No way.
-This is too strange

740
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,230
,Kyoko, please take care of yourself

741
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,900
,What is this?

742
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:27,370
,So how do you spend your days off, Kyoko?

743
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,640
,Well

744
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:41,380
,Well that, drink a little wine, play a little bit, eat a meal or something

745
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,940
,Although Animal Hamaguchi's skills are quite clear

746
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,080
,Kyoko's acting is also quite lame

747
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:55,290
,Thus, a horrible parent-child lame rivalry battle ensues

748
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:56,650
,What the hell is all this?

749
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:05,980
,So, what is your favorite type of man?

750
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,110
,Please

751
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,420
,When it comes to the type of men I like...

752
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:17,450
,I can't accept one like my father

753
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:21,100
,Hearing this, Hamaguchi is clearly depressed

754
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:30,200
,Next, there is one more thing I want to ask

755
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,670
,Are you currently seeing a man?

756
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,680
,What follows is a counter prank

757
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,980
,In response to Hamaguchi's questions

758
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,620
,Kyoko suddenly announces that she is getting married

759
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,870
,I see

760
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:53,580
,Hearing this news, can Animal still hide his inner turmoil and continue to finish his job as a journalist?

761
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:03,170
,About the man i'm dating

762
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:06,040
,Now there is one

763
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,040
,I'm actually dating someone now

764
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:16,680
,And I want to use this interview to make it public

765
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,430
,Completely frozen!

766
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:31,460
,Today, I told the guy I'm dating to come here too

767
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:35,730
,I think he's probably on his way

768
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:32,970
,No watch

769
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,920
,Kyoko's lines are fragmented and don't make any sense at all

770
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:45,600
,To sum up, "Her boyfriend will appear shortly"

771
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,250
,I've called him over

772
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:53,020
,Excuse me.
-Just in time

773
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,280
,Ah, really?

774
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:00,860
,What the hell?

775
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,860
,It's such a mess. Is it okay?

776
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:11,670
,This is the person I started dating this year on the premise of marriage

777
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:17,610
,Professional wrestler Hollywood Stalker Ichikawa

778
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,690
,Although this person dresses very sloppily

779
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,150
,He is indeed a genuine professional wrestler

780
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,260
,And upholds his exaggerated performance to appear as the boyfriend

781
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:44,130
,Can Animal Hamaguchi continue to play journalist?

782
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:48,240
,Ah, why are you not the same as usual? Are you nervous?

783
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,410
,Well, a little bit

784
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,440
,At such times

785
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,080
,Only by kissing me, will you cure this kind of tension

786
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:02,420
,Seriously, kissing must be - saved - for - the future

787
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,820
,Ah, left until later

788
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,330
,What is all this?

789
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,660
,Animal Hamaguchi did not expect to see such explicit affectionate behavior

790
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:15,260
,After temporarily tolerating for a period of time, Hamaguchi finally...

791
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:16,570
,YOU BASTARD!

792
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,570
,HEY, YOU BASTARD!

793
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,810
,I'm talking to you, you bastard!

794
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:25,260
,What did you just say, you son of a bitch, you little brat?

795
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,140
,What's wrong?

796
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,080
,What are you, you bastard?

797
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,680
,Hey, why did you bring him here?

798
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:33,250
,Hey, when did I ever teach you to do this?

799
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:37,350
,We brought our marriage registration today

800
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:39,960
,You bastard!

801
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,760
,Look at this!

802
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,530
,What's the "prank big success"?

803
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:49,230
,This is a prank?

804
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,770
,Initially, he failed to understand the situation

805
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,290
,So, the staff took the time to explain the situation to him

806
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,240
,And then...

807
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,140
,Come on, let's have a successful ten in a row

808
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:01,710
Ready? Go!

809
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:07,080
,Big success, big success, big success, big success, big success, big success, big success, big success, big success, big success!

810
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:06,910
,So tough

811
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,950
,Big success!

812
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,780
,In summary
Yamada wasn't needed, and Stalker Ichikawa was even less needed

813
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,150
,What is all this?

814
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,210
,The end was indeed a little, well, how can I put it?

815
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,060
,A little too convoluted

816
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,200
,What was that last situation? Was he really angry?

817
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,470
,His eyes looked really angry

818
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,570
,It's true that he really was angry.
-Really angry?

819
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:33,420
,Yes, I know the feeling

820
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,210
,The last time I pranked Animal Hamaguchi

821
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,700
,He literally chased and beat me

822
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,600
,Chased and beaten?

823
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,760
,Yes, not only chased and beaten

824
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,970
,He also threw potatoes and pans at me

825
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:43,340
,His eyes then were the same as just now

826
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,720
So he is indeed angry

827
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,090
,I'm impressed.
-Yes

828
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:48,560
,To sum up, Animal Hamaguchi is a lousy actor

829
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,460
,Kyoko too, and what's more, even Hollywood Stalker was lame

830
00:45:55,370 --> 00:46:00,120
,It feels like this theory has played itself out already

831
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,180
,This has the feeling of a finale

832
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:10,680
Next is everybody's theories

833
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,900
The presenters is...

834
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,740
Kenji Tamura

835
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,200
Thank you everyone

836
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,640
Let me ask you, have you ever had such an experience?

837
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,440
When walking on the road

838
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,700
You suddenly feel something behind you

839
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:34,340
Have you ever had such an experience?

840
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,060
Being watched or something like that?

841
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,500
I guess so

842
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,560
I suppose I can't say I absolutely haven't

843
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,100
Occasionally something like that happens

844
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,500
Have you experienced it, Maggy?

845
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,080
I have, forcing me to suddenly turn around and look

846
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,480
Also, sometimes there's no one there

847
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:48,960
No one there?

848
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,020
No one

849
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,320
At home, for example.
-At home?

850
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:00,000
Have you never expereinced such a thing?
-I get it, I guess

851
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,680
When you open the door, you feel as if there is someone at home

852
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,760
Yes, yes, that feeling is super scary

853
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,640
So it seems everyone has experienced this to some extent

854
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,540
So, the theory that I bring you this time is

855
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,500
Please take a look

856
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,560
If you are a person who can supposedly sense when someone is behind you, can you evade an attack?

857
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,600
Oh, like this?

858
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,400
Yes yes

859
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:31,940
It's not often that people can feel an aura or someone's breath or something like that behind them

860
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,880
For example, if you feel a murderous aura

861
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,520
It would be pretty much impossible to encounter this in real life

862
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,440
And yet there is the impression that one could feel it

863
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,180
But after all, you can't feel it at all, right?

864
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,480
Wait a minute, I don't understand what you're talking about...

865
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:55,820
Shortly, we will verify if an attack from behind can really be sensed and dodged

866
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:04,580
If you are a person who can supposedly sense when someone is behind you, can you evade an attack?

867
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:09,440
This time there are 3 people who have signed up to participate

868
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,720
The first one is

869
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,580
The director of a comprehensive karate martial arts school with over 200 students

870
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,360
Kazuya Koike 35 years old

871
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:27,440
Students in this dojo are instructed on how to sense and avoid attacks from behind

872
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:34,860
If you just rely on the eyes to see it is easy to be fooled by fake actions

873
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:38,530
So do not rely on the eyes to feel the sense of air from behind and so on

874
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:42,300
We practice the habit of being able to decipher in different situations and so on

875
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:45,470
If it's something like detecting an attack

876
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:48,840
I feel I can do it, more or less

877
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:54,860
Can he really defend against an attack from behind?

878
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,720
We will verify it in this shopping street

879
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,040
Mixed in with the real members of the public are 10 assassins sent by the show

880
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:10,800
If they can defend against all attacks from behind, the challenge is successful

881
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:18,380
If they feel the breath behind them, they will cross their arms over their head for defense

882
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,720
But the number of defense must equal the number of enemy attacks and not exceed 10 times

883
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:27,110
In order to prevent spamming of defensive moves to muddle through

884
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:32,940
Can they all defend against the attacks of 10 people or not?

885
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,000
Start!

886
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,060
The attacks were communicated in advance

887
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,520
It is understood that someone will attack

888
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,220
Indeed, it is

889
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,200
Can you tell by the sound of footsteps?

890
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,400
Its normal to not realise

891
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,420
One's coming

892
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,740
Ah, like this should be obvious

893
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,240
Can hear the footsteps

894
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,560
Eh?

895
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,600
What is this?

896
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,400
No way!

897
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,620
This is completely different from the time of practice...

898
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,860
Couldn't even hear the footsteps?

899
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,960
It's completely different

900
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,590
Well, in the dojo, the rules are pre-determined

901
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,430
It doesn't feel the same at all

902
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:19,950
Hit him with a "bang!"

903
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,400
A nice sound

904
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,400
The next person is

905
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:28,260
A martial artist who explains "how to detect an attack with your heart" on YouTube

906
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,180
Shinsen Akira 30 years old

907
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,180
Seriously?

908
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,860
Obviously, he will attempt it without the mask...

909
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,000
The mask isn't needed

910
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:44,550
I heard that you can sense things behind you
-Yes

911
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,490
Is this true?

912
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,620
Well, if you know how to detect it, you can do it

913
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,390
Detect what?

914
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:56,830
Well, the human body emits energy and so on, aura and so on

915
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:58,830
Probably everybody has something like this

916
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:00,270
So it can be perceived

917
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,640
Start!

918
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,080
Seems interesting

919
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,960
He already knows, right?

920
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,400
Yes he knows

921
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,480
Oh, one's coming

922
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,740
What's is this?

923
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:29,540
What the hell?

924
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,980
Looked to the right

925
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,100
Can't do it at all

926
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,680
Sorry about that...

927
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,580
Sorry?

928
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,040
You were hit

929
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,510
Ah, sorry... was hit...

930
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,400
Why are you smiling?

931
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:41,180
I couldn't help it...

932
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,850
Maybe because the conditions were not clearly understood

933
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,500
Don't you understand the conditions?

934
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,220
Conditions?

935
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,120
Can I look back? Probably...

936
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,020
Can I look back?

937
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:53,420
Turning back to block? Something like that

938
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,520
It should be blocked like this

939
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,030
That has to be done in advance...

940
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,160
Go on the defensive, right?

941
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,300
What is happening now?

942
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,970
But you didn't do anything just now...
-Yeah

943
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,720
Didn't move at all

944
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:05,170
You didn't even look back

945
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:06,100
Indeed

946
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,240
Why is this?

947
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:13,780
Yeah, why?

948
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,160
Wanna see him get hit again

949
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,060
Because the feeling was not detected

950
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:14,810
Why?

951
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,360
And so, the final participant is...

952
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,940
Aikido 8-dan

953
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,160
Ando 62 years old

954
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,660
This person seems to be really good at it

955
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:32,320
In his 44 years of Aikido, the number of students he has instructed exceeds 200,000

956
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:38,440
To be honest, he should be in a different class from the two people just now

957
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:36,940
Don't say that

958
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,480
The others are also good

959
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,810
Is it true that you can detect presence from behind?

960
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:45,740
Yes, I can detect it

961
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:49,480
The qi is the "opponent's mindset", right?

962
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:55,380
You can feel it with your back

963
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:52,880
I want to believe

964
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:59,190
I've had training to sharpen my senses

965
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,220
I guess the first two people are actually different

966
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,700
Oh, using qi

967
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,540
No need to attack

968
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,240
No, no, no.
-What is this?

969
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,530
What are you doing?

970
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:15,270
When they're behind they're going "goo" and pushing their qi out

971
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,420
Pushing it out

972
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:16,880
Check it out

973
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,160
Did he really push it out?

974
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:19,960
Hamada, look!

975
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,280
Hey, don't laugh!

976
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,040
Can't touch him at all

977
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:23,900
No, no, no, no

978
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,300
Hamada, look, they're completely unable to touch him

979
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,920
I'll get 'em all!

980
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,720
Is this not a performance?

981
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:32,050
This is an opponent-oriented hold

982
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,180
No, he's a master

983
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:36,590
Well, in other words, "charm" something like that?

984
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,600
It's all about "charm"

985
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,340
More than just detecting presence

986
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:44,120
You can also "charm" to control your opponent

987
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,070
This is "Wife"

988
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:48,640
Eh?

989
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:50,870
His wife?

990
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:51,810
Correct

991
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:57,060
Using the power of qi, he has been able to charm a foreign women

992
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:03,340
Can he detect all 10 enemies?

993
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,960
Do you need glasses?

994
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,440
Start!

995
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,200
Why do you need glasses?

996
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,720
It's by qi, right?

997
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,640
Go for it!

998
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,400
Walking pretty fast

999
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,420
Very fast indeed

1000
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,420
Go go go!

1001
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,580
I hope he blocks them all perefectly

1002
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:29,510
It's over.

1003
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,720
In summary
It might be impossible

1004
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,520
What the hell

1005
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,760
I'm tired of it

1006
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,620
Very unsatisfying

1007
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,160
Why did he put on glasses at the end

1008
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,120
Can he not see in front of him?

1009
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,880
Perhaps to focus completely behind him he has to be able to see in front with ease

1010
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,380
So he put his glasses on

1011
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,620
Perfectly done

1012
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,260
The second one seemed to be under a lot of pressure

1013
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,640
Probably forced to do it

1014
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,300
The director seemed pretty impatient too

1015
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,960
That guy looks like he enjoys being bullied though

1016
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:34,940
