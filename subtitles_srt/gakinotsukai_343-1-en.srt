1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
The First Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende Chiki-Chiki

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,600
Yamasaki Hosei's Ass Open Sparring

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,900
Long time no see, Matsumoto san

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,400
Ass Open Sparring

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,300
That's correct

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,900
To simply put, that's Yamasaki's last chance

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,900
Already the last one?

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,600
Why's that, let's hear that from the man himself

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,100
I see

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,900
Right behind us, Yamasaki is standing by

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,600
So, why don't we enter

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,500
What a cool face

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,000
How are you feeling?

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,000
You see, I'm very angry today

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Angry? Yes, I worked hard

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,900
You're a real performer once you do something serious

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,000
When you're in an entertainment world, you either win or lose your butt

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,200
And in the end, the only way to get to the top is by getting your opponent's butt

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,800
Is that so?

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,700
Yes. Once I'll get my opponents' butts, I'll win

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Sparkling Yamazaki fights to protect his ass, saying that the entertainment industry is an ass whooping contest.

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,500
Yamasaki shall take the pants from two sets of five opponents each and keep an eye out for his own ass for as long as he can

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,500
So, after all the most important for me so far is to protect my butt

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,300
Who's saying that

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
And win by that

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
And to fight your best? Yes

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Once you'll get opponent's butts, you'll win?

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,600
That is so

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,000
I see

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,800
As a 35 year old

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,900
A thir... a twenty nine year old

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,800
What was the for?

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,800
Matsumoto san, let's start with the first group in this Sparring

34
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,800
You shall keep your pants for as long as possible

35
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,900
And you shall not lose your own

36
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,300
During this time

37
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,900
At any circumstances you should not lose them

38
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,500
Yamasaki, shall we begin?

39
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,000
So, let's start. The first Sparring Group please

40
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,500
Matsumoto san, that's quite a tough-looking group

41
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Will Yamasaki come out alive from this powerful American Football team?

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,600
Yamasaki, shall we commence?

43
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,400
Yes, bring it on!

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,100
9 seconds and 51

45
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,400
He was outnumbered

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So, that's how it went

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,500
You should have been more active a bit

48
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
They grabbed him so fast in the air

49
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,900
I've been outnumbered and didn't have anywhere to run

50
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,900
You didn't run at all

51
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,600
Thank goodness. Thank goodness?

52
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,300
What was good about that?

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,100
So, let's continue. The next Sparring Group, please

54
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,300
What's up with these elderly ladies?

55
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
It's getting heated

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500
That's amazing

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,500
In this one he may have some chances

58
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,600
In this one he has a considerable advantage

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,900
Will he be able to protect himself from these demon women? The Grannies

60
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,200
Hang on!

61
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,200
That was too ferocious

62
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
What's with him?

63
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,000
Is he an idiot?

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,900
Alright, Yamasaki san

65
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,700
You did it in 19 seconds

66
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,200
So, better than the last one? Thank goodness

67
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,400
But it didn't make to 30 seconds yet

68
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,300
But again you didn't run at all

69
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,800
He can make a gag with these pants

70
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,300
There's something in this

71
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,800
Ah, he did it

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,600
What about this time's opponent?

73
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,200
That's quite scary, but it's the last one

74
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,500
A strong champion

75
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,100
Top profile champion

76
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,500
No one decided that person to be a champion

77
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,500
Let's start

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,600
Champion's arrival

79
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,100
"Moriman"

80
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,700
Hilarious, that's going to end fast

81
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
That's quite an opponent

82
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,000
Will Yamasaki san be able to do it?

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This time, being not a sparring, that would be an achievement for Yamasaki to keep his pants this time, so let's look forward to it

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,800
He shouldn't be careless

85
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,400
Will he be able to fight back?

86
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,000
Absolute winner of all title matches, Champion Moriman

87
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,200
Let's start

88
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,500
They're kicking

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,100
That's bad!

90
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,100
Yamasaki san, do your best now! Yamasaki san!

91
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,000
Yamasaki kun, stand up!

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yamsaki san, stand up!

93
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,000
"Champion Moriman Victory!!"

94
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,900
You were so weak

95
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,800
"Yamasaki lost when he really meant to win"
Yamasaki san, couldn't you have tried more?

96
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Give me one more chance, please

97
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,800
I can't be done like this

98
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,600
This looks really bad, all jokes aside, he'll never be able to win

99
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,500
Maybe he needed some more time? I see

100
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,900
He really has a not so good looking face

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,900
Let's start!

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,500
At this point you can't tell

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,700
Throw him, throw him

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,500
Looks good

105
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,500
He's getting captured

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
"Champion Moriman Victory!!"

107
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,500
Yamasaki san

108
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,900
Yamasaki san

109
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,800
What's up with you?

110
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,900
No way

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Moriman, you're so dimwitted

112
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,800
You're not even funny, you're just so weak!

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,800
You're today's opening idiot

114
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,800
The hell you're saying, look at yourself

115
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,900
That wasn't fun at all

116
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,400
I don't understand what you mean by being fun

117
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,500
When Moriman came I always thought how cool she is

118
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,900
She always showed us his bare ass

119
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,500
Your little green pea looks through
