00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yamazaki Hosei's super-ass-magic!!

00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,000
Downtown

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi  Hamada Masatoshi

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,250
Good Evening

5
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:06,800
Good Evening!

6
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,500
So... what is it today?

7
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,160
I really didn't understand, actually, though I had a phone call

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,160
But they told me this will be a great success

9
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:21,580
~Opening~Today, Yamazaki will use his butt to perform various techniques

10
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,120
Actually this does remind me of our youthful cold-resistance contests

11
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:20,830
Is this going to be about coldness?

12
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,130
No, I don't think it would be so

13
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,830
But it probably would have been better that way.

14
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,500
Shall we call him here?

15
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,400
Yeah, let's call him

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,540
Please come here, Yamazaki-san!

17
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,340
What the hell?

18
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,000
Ass Magician Yamazaki Hosei

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,580
He doesn't seems anything mighty at all

20
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,000
Those are some nice dancing moves!

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,250
Totally nice, really!

22
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,540
So, this new kind of performance is about to begin, we're looking forward to it.

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,120
Right, our average-new-to-comedy-business Yamazaki-kun?

24
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,450
Your hand is kinda wet all over.

26
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,250
Yes.

27
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,660
Are you really supposed to act that cool?!

28
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:27,000
Translation, Subtitles, Encoding, Timing etc. etc. by Shion (youtube.com/user/ForegroundNoises)

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,000
Cocktail

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,000
What the hell...

31
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,410
What is this opening for?

32
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,200
Cocktails

33
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,700
Ass-produced cocktails.

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,790
What the--

35
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:02,790
What happens now?

36
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,410
It flied away!

37
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,370
Why did you do that?

38
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,370
There's nothing in there, Yamazaki-san

39
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,370
That strawberry flied away, you know...

40
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,950
It must have hurt a lot!

41
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,120
There isn't absolutely anything

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,750
The one you used wasn't fit to get in between properly, this one will do it better!

43
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,980
Hide it carefully, in the center!

44
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,200
E-excuse me for a moment, please

45
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,750
What now?

46
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,750
Wait a second...

47
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,660
It hurts like hell!

48
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,410
There's nothing again!

49
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:53,610
Ah!

50
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,580
Eventually he was able to make a cocktail!

51
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,250
He succesfully made a cocktail!

52
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,250
I don't want to...

53
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,250
Ehh? Are you serious?

54
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,250
You're the worst.

55
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,250
Makes me wanna kick you another time

56
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,830
You're really the worst

57
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,830
I can't even make a comment about what I've just done.

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,500
Lifting the Hot Pot

59
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,000
Ugh... Yamazaki-san... that's so...

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh! He's shaking!

61
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,800
He's totally shaking!

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,370
HOT!!

63
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,620
What are you exulting for?

64
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,330
Is it over?!

65
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,290
Impressive!

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,290
Long Pole Folding

67
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,330
His willpower vanished completely.

68
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,830
Is everything ok?

69
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,350
A long pole?

70
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,150
What the hell is he...?

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,790
You call yourself a comedian, right now?

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,410
Right now?

73
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:23,830
Let me try again.

74
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,850
Long Pole Folding - Second Challenge

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,680
Impressive.

76
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:36,910
Oh, shit.

77
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,170
Are you ok?

78
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,830
A comedian, a comedian!

79
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,910
Right now Yamazaki-san is nothing like a comedian!

80
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,990
Are you sure you're ok?

81
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,170
You're right?

82
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,980
What are you doing? It's impossible in this way.

83
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,100
It got inside!

84
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,300
Candle Service

85
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,300
What is he up to?

86
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,000
He's pointing his ass to us with such a resolution!

87
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,500
Why am I doing this?

88
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,560
I have no idea, you're the one who wanted to do it.

89
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,870
That's for the candle service, uh?

90
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,080
Oooh! Amazing!

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,560
He's shaking

92
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,140
Please don't move around, Yamazaki-san

93
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,140
Ok! it's lit!

94
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,620
Aww, isn't it lovely?

95
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,000

99

I beg your forgiveness!

100
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,160
So, that's what happened, uh

101
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,700
Fart

102
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,200

103
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,370
Don't laugh!

104

Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome!

106
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,770
Again?

107
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,580
That's impressive, he is accustomed to this.

108
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,080
He took it out.

109
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,620
Don't cry, don't cry!

110
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,000
Did I made it?

111
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,660
No more of this from now on

112
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,450
I'm begging you

113
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,410
Ok?

114
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,120
Uh-uh.

115
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,750
This looks very gay.

116
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,750
Not sure about this sentence, since I can't hear it very well. I do believe he says ゲイ (gay)

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I want to go home and sleep as soon as possible.

118
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,950
Do you want to sleep?

119
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,950
A revel, uh?
