Subbed by: Otviss

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,430
Alright, we're here!

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,790
So this next one has

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,840
been a very popular attraction since we opened.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,790
The jurassic park ride!

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,880
Wow it's coming. Look at this you guys!

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,180
Ugh this is one of these

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,300
Aaaand it lands!

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,190
Wow!

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,820
Everyone's laughing

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,400
Everyone's smiling aren't they?

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,050
We're in it now...

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,720
If we go on it will we be smiling like them?

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,530
You bet!

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,140
Uh so who's going?

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,010
Well, all of us and

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,530
It's about the talent power isn't it?

18
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,530
You're right.

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,500
If you do decide to ride with us today,

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,850
There's actually a spot that takes photos

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,820
and it'll take one of these of you while riding

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,490
Nope. No way.

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,050
What do you mean?

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,390
Well I mean...

25
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,390
And everyone with a smile on their face

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,320
I just thought it would be fun if we were to take a photo like this

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,090
Just a little fuuun

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,470
We don't know when we'll be photographed though

29
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,170
You can see it coming right?

30
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,170
Yes, you're correct!

31
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,360
Just as you're falling

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,810
So even as it's falling it'll turn out well right?

33
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,820
That's right

34
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,940
I'm not really convinced...

35
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,940
Why? You can demonstrate your talent power

36
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,040
You will be fine

37
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,040
Uhm...

38
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,790
I actually thought we were gonna go on the flying dinosaur

39
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,550
So if you compare this to that...

40
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,500
Your feelings must be flying then

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,230
No one's gonna laugh at shit like that

42
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:08,050
Are we doing this?

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,050
We'll be done in an instant!

44
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,890
Guess it can't be helped then

45
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,760
Yup let's go!

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,160
Let's use our TALENT POWER and take a fun photo!!

47
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,290
I'm not really on board with that though

48
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,290
I'll guide you to the spot

49
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,890
Let's go!

50
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,540
Come on now. Come on!

51
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,600
Nakamura-san! Call on him!

52
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,890
It's scary right??

53
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,550
OH MY GOD MATSUMOTO-SAN!!! â™¥

54
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,210
It's not scary, it's not scary

55
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,580
Haha you'll be fine

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,580
It's not scary

57
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,300
Since you all came as a family

58
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,560
you will be able to have this great memory in the end

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,240
No... Why?

60
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,090
As you could see,

61
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,980
You do get a little wet...

62
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,450
How about some ponchos?

63
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,450
Don't need any!

64
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,850
Okay understood

65
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,090
The hell are you deciding for?

66
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,090
Ugh I can't do this...

67
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,260
It'll be over in an instant

68
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,260
No but,

69
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,860
I'm still reluctant you guys

70
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,350
So I'm thinking the flying dinosaur would be better

71
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,000
Alright, let's go!

72
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,000
No way!

73
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,980
Huh what's wrong?

74
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,340
It was a joke!

75
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,910
A freaking a joke huh?

76
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,980
Charming!

77
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,980
Faces

78
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,980
Talent Power

79
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,500
Ok ok ok! Let's go now!

80
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,850
I'm pumped up!

81
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,580
In the middle?

82
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,270
Ok!

83
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,960
Wow it's all wet!

84
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,870
Yeah it's pretty wet

85
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,230
This is like Villa Villa

86
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,930
Oh it's wet here too

87
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,430
Look here too.

88
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,610
Unavoidable though isn't it

89
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,610
Woah wait, this is all we get?

90
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,650
Oh no this is...

91
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,310
Alright everyone! We're departing!

92
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,010
Look out for dinosaurs and have a great journey!

93
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,490
We're off!

94
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,820
Haha, that was the "Great Journey Boy" right there

95
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,760
Damn this is straight in the middle

96
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,210
Right in the middle!

97
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,200
Yay!

98
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,580
No..

99
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,880
Let's go!

100
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,880
No, this is already bad

101
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,520
Look look! That dinosaur thing is much worse

102
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,290
Nah, The dinosaur is way more...

103
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,840
Woaahh!

104
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,790
That was low

105
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,460
The dinosaur seems better...

106
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,450
Yeah we should've just done the dinosaur

107
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,450
Won't it get better than this?

108
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,550
Knock it off!

109
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,550
We could've gone twice on the dinosaur now

110
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,060
That's impossible you guys

111
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,320
Two times.

112
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,820
Oh shit!

113
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,170
It started talking suddenly...

114
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,200
Keep your face together now

115
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,170
I don't know what you're talking about

116
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,170
Talent power for the photo

117
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,720
We don't know when it's taken though

118
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,450
You know roughly right?

119
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,210
Yeah when it's falling we'll make the faces

120
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,140
Yahoo!

121
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,430
Just riding with the family like this is a little unsettling...

122
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,190
Everyone should be on

123
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,730
This guy's really scared

124
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,030
The dinosaurs are scared too so

125
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,670
Oh there's a baby one too

126
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,170
Enough of this. I'm nervous...

127
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,970
Huh?

128
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,970
What?

129
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,990
We're entering a strange...

130
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,990
This is no good!

131
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,620
It's torn!

132
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,590
You're right! It's torn.

133
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,570
I'm scared...

134
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,750
Ugh no! There's something here

135
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,240
There was something

136
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,630
Where's the person in charge?

137
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,730
I don't like this anymore

138
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,400
WOAH!

139
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,380
Eugh!

140
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,070
What the hell was that?

141
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,090
Look it's here! It's here!

142
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,970
Fall coming up

143
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,090
What is?

144
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,220
Ok use your talent power now for a good photo!

145
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,390
Aahh!

146
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,860
Hahaha!

147
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,990
Woah!

148
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,610
It's cold!

149
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,830
Ouch ouch ouch...

150
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,170
Ouch ouch!

151
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,810
Ouch ouch ouch!

152
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,540
I got so wet!

153
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,880
There's something up with dad

154
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,470
It hurts!

155
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,470
Hahaha!

156
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,840
Wait it hurts!

157
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,710
Ouch!

158
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,710
Haha he sprained it!

159
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,460
He sprained it again!

160
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,150
It hurts!

161
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,560
Did you sprain your shoulder?

162
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,520
Wait it really hurts. What is this?

163
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,890
You were too scared so you stiffed up

164
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,130
Daddy's injured!

165
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,840
He injured his shoulder!

166
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,330
Nakamura-san. He stiffed up and sprained his shoulder.

167
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,430
Hahahaha! Really? Are you okay?

168
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,790
I'm not okay!

169
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,790
It's cause ya stiffed up like that!

170
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,920
Did it get you too nervous?

171
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,650
It actually felt longer than I expected

172
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:21,390
Did we catch their

173
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:21,390
talent power?

174
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,760
Your pictures are done

175
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,460
Let's take a look

176
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,160
Okay, here I go

177
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,780
Ta-da

178
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:42,370
Did we catch their

179
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:42,370
talent power?

180
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,340
Ta-da

181
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,020
Hahahaha!

182
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,150
Hahahaha!

183
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,620
Just horrible

184
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,620
Horrible

185
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,120
This is awful!

186
00:07:58,890 --> 00:07:59,990
So the staff

187
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,900
are all looking down not to be on camera.

188
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,160
Just like you!

189
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,380
Show your face stupid!

190
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,370
Dad's getting it!

191
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,370
