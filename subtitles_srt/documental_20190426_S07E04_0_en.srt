1
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,920
I think the Tsukkomi is usually the funniest.

2
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,630
I'm Sakurai from Mr. Children.

3
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,030
I guess because I'm normally working

4
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,400
under that kind of system or something.

5
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,630
That's why I think it's difficult.

6
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,940
I don't like to talk shit on twitter.

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,610
I don't particularly mind it,

8
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,110
but I really worry it might be a bother to the show,

9
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,240
or a bother to Matsumoto-san,

10
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,080
or even to my fellow co-performers.

11
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,110
That's why this time,

12
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,320
I'd like people to say it was fun,

13
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,750
even if it wasn't all on me.

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,530
I don't know about the other nine guys.

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,860
—You're angry, aren't you?
—I'm not angry, I'm not angry.

16
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,660
You're really angry.

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,000
But I'm going to win this in three hours!

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,710
Good for you guys. You're going home soon!

20
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,040
Tenryuu?

21
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,510
That's not Tenryuu.

22
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,950
—He laughed!
—He laughed?

23
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,320
I'm sorry for using other people's passports.

24
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,370
You're out!

25
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,110
Here we go!

26
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,950
That's not all.
I made more for today.

27
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,850
Is it okay?

28
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,650
—Just one?
—Just one.

29
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,350
Fine.
—Just one?
—Just one.

30
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:10,650
Fine.

31
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,850
The short one, okay?

32
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,820
—Please do the short one.
—The short one, right?

33
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,390
I'm leaving it all to you.

34
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,630
Okay, I'm playing it, okay?

35
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,360
Here we go.

36
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,170
This is pretty bad.

37
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,140
"I'm gonna kill you."

38
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,450
It was a little funny.

39
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:42,550
Come on, Goto!

40
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,890
One more, one more!
Come on, Goto!

41
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,520
Should I play it again?
I'm gonna play it again.

42
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,480
Fine, fine, fine.

43
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,280
Let's do the short one again.
The short one, okay?

44
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,710
Wait a second.

45
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,380
Are you really watching?

46
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,650
Not watching is cheating!

47
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,150
I'm watching, really.

48
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,420
Yeah, not watching is cheating.

49
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,620
I wanna laugh!

50
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,690
I have another short one.

51
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,020
I wanna laugh!

52
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,520
—Alright?
—Sure.

53
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,590
Your attention, please.

54
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,680
Is this it for Goto?

55
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,580
"I'm gonna kill you."

56
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,890
Did you hold it in?

57
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,320
Did you, Goto?

58
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,460
You look straight out of "Family History", Goto! (Editor's Note: TV Show)

59
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,940
Michio?

60
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,370
It's Michio now?

61
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,940
What was that? What happened?

62
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,380
—What's my problem?!
—Gross!

63
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,180
I thought I managed to hold it!

64
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,280
I'm getting a cramp!

65
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,620
Why you, Michio?

66
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,490
I was in trouble all along.

67
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,830
I was thinking it was gonna be Goto.

68
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
Goto, you really looked

69
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,370
straight out of "Family History."

70
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,970
While you were crying.

71
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I thought I managed to hold it in.

72
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Was that it?

73
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,900
So I lowered my guard.

74
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,570
Tamuken-san got you.

75
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,080
That was too bad!

76
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,540
I thought I had lost my mind, man!

77
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,940
That was tough, huh?

78
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,890
I'm holding it in here!
Though I don't know if crying

79
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,730
is actually valid or not.

80
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,640
I think Tamuken was out too, though!

81
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,610
Tamuken-san!

82
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,810
That was insane, though!

83
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,410
Really, what's up with that?
It was really creepy!

84
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,310
It was creepy, right?!

85
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,480
Michio really laughed his ass off back then,

86
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,590
and since he got a direct orange...

87
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,890
You're out.

88
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,290
Too bad...

89
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,160
—The videos are really good, huh?
—That sucks.

90
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,070
Aren't the young guys having a tough time?

91
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,570
Thank you for everything.

92
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,540
My normal face looks like this.

93
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,040
I'm always smiling a little.

94
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,080
So I had to hold it down and down.

95
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,610
So if I let go, I just burst out at once.

96
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,480
He put this make-up on for one show
And then the next show also needs him to be in this make-up, right?

97
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,060
That sucks...

98
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,060
Oh man...

99
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,870
Here we go.

100
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,040
You have to watch, okay?

101
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,810
I'm making sure you watch for sure.

102
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,210
I'm gonna play it one more time.

103
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,180
Something was getting closer to the camera, right?

104
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,940
That was Sunplaza Nakano getting huge.
(EN: Japanese musician)

105
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,310
That was Sunplaza Nakano there?

106
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,910
Well, I was playing him, yeah.

107
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,580
It's no good if you think about it,
but it's also no good if you don't.

108
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,790
Yeah, that's right.

109
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,050
Didn't you just smile?

110
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,490
Right now...?

111
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,190
I didn't.
No way!

112
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,460
I was about to, normally.
He definitely just smiled normally!

113
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,800
Again?!

114
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,570
You did this before, right?

115
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,030
That was a normal smile just then!

116
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,500
A normal smile for sure!

117
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,140
It was a reflex.

118
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,640
—A reflex, huh?
—A reflex!

119
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,770
I know...

120
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,610
—What was that?
—Another reflex.

121
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,180
He was smiling like normal.

122
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,540
I didn't see.

123
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,110
I was just smiling at them.

124
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,780
Explain that...

125
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,380
Whose point is that going to be?

126
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,550
Something was getting closer to the camera, right?

127
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,390
That was Sunplaza Nakano getting huge.

128
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,860
That was Sunplaza Nakano there?

129
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,260
It's no good if you think about it,
but it's also no good if you don't.

130
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,560
That's a regular smile, right?

131
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,400
He's totally smiling!

132
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,830
I really just felt like it.

133
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,340
Then that's a yellow.

134
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,740
Okay, nothing I can do about it.

135
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,810
That was just a very "golden week" smile. (EN: A week in Japan with a lot of holidays)

136
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,840
Very superficial.

137
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,810
Okay, let's tighten up a bit.

138
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,780
So we were watching right?
What were we doing?

139
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,380
—I'm gonna do it.
—Ah, Jiro-chan.

140
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,750
—The video, right?
—Yeah, the video.

141
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,120
Here we go.

142
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,590
Alright.

143
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,420
—So can I watch?
—Let's do it.

144
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,830
Jiro-chan, right?

145
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,660
Guess I'll sit at the back.

146
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,360
So you get more distance from the screen, right?

147
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,800
That's too close.

148
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,330
I think I like it here.

149
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,870
Why don't you get closer?

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,340
Goto, you should sit closer.

151
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,470
Goto, here, here!

152
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,540
No, I think here's fine.

153
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,610
—Just do it.
—Are we watching or what?

154
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,580
This is too close.

155
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,010
I fought with Onita last year, you know? (EN: Atsushi Onita - Actor/Politician/Wrestler)

156
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,310
With the exploding death bat.

157
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,020
It was pretty rough.

158
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Are we going to see that?

159
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,150
There it is!

160
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,320
That's the exploding death bat.

161
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,730
—An exploding bat?
—Yeah, an exploding bat.

162
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,230
You wrap barbed wire around the bat,

163
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,170
run electricity through it and it explodes.

164
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,700
You did that, huh?!

165
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,800
So he did that to you?

166
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,110
This is from the ropes.

167
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,810
That's all barbed wire.

168
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,140
That must've been pretty hot.

169
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,540
Just for a second.

170
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,610
It was more like a pinch.

171
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,950
—It hurt?
—Must've...

172
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,480
And this is what it is.

173
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,120
—A new year's card?
—That's a new year's card.

174
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,650
It wasn't for new year's, though...

175
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,560
It's pretty flashy, though.

176
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,400
For 2018...

177
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,730
That's pretty funny, huh?

178
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,800
I really don't want Zakoshi to do me in,

179
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,430
so why don't we move on?

180
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,340
You see, my son is a real idiot,
and it kind of pisses me off.

181
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,670
Take a look.

182
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,940
—That's cute!
—He's so cute!

183
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,610
37

184
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,040
38

185
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,410
39

186
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,510
60

187
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,880
61

188
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,080
68

189
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,350
He got there faster than I expected.
69

190
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
30

191
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,180
He's all over the place.

192
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,450
I was so pissed off at my wife after that...

193
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,960
They sure can hold their own, huh?
I would've lost it there.

194
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,190
Huh?

195
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,100
Huh?

196
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,040
—Knock knock!
—There it is!

197
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:45,810
Hello...

198
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,880
—The hell?!
—What?!
Hello...

199
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,940
What?

200
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,350
I called her.

201
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,480
She's not a zombie?

202
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,550
She's cute.

203
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,920
She's Colette-san, the fortune teller.

204
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,050
So she's here to help you out?

205
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,820
I'm Colette.
Nice to meet you.

206
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,760
Your help is a fortune teller?

207
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,530
That's right.
Colette-san is amazing.

208
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,430
Was that two years ago?

209
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,200
—No, it was...
—No, I mean...

210
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,730
about God's voice.

211
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,030
—That's right.
—You heard it, right?

212
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,570
How do you know that?

213
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
—Am I wrong?
—No

214
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,970
you're completely right.

215
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,840
And your powers have grown stronger?

216
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,070
That's right.

217
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,910
Two years ago?
That's pretty recent.

218
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,580
She's been doing this for a long time,

219
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,680
but two years ago she heard God's voice, right?

220
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,950
I did.
I became able to hear God's voice.

221
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,350
From the heavens, right?

222
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,990
And you became enlightened?

223
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,820
Why don't you explain

224
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,590
the situation when it happened?

225
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,760
Were you sleeping?

226
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,930
No, it wasn't like that.
When I was little,

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,200
I met a shrine maiden that said she could hear God's voice.

228
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,930
So after meeting her,

229
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,470
we kind of got involved.
At first I didn't believe in God at all.

230
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,810
When you were a kid?

231
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,280
That's right.
I believed in our ancestors.

232
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,850
And I thought that since the ancestors would give us their blessings,

233
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,980
they and God were one and the same.

234
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,050
—You're taking too long.
—Too long?

235
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,420
I'm really sorry.
So that's how I met that maiden.

236
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,920
—And since she was able...

237
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,390
Right, she was able to speak to God,
so I also became able to speak to him.

238
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,720
So now you're able to talk to him?

239
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,260
—That's right.
—Isn't that rude? You brought her here.

240
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,360
—Sorry, that was too long.
—I'm really sorry.

241
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,630
So now we have to play along with her?

242
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,070
No, her predictions are extremely accurate.

243
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,070
—She's that good?
—Yeah.

244
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,940
Why don't we have one of you give it a try?

245
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,170
Goto?

246
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,010
Okay, okay, I'll give it a try.

247
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,010
Then please take a look at Goto-san.

248
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,850
Okay.
Nice to meet you.

249
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,050
You're friends?

250
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,080
—No, it's the first time we've ever met.
—We just met.

251
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,150
So you really looked for someone amazing?

252
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,850
Okay, let's see how it goes.

253
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,460
She really is accurate.

254
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,720
This is scary!

255
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,730
Is there anything you want her to look into?

256
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
What do you mean?

257
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,060
When you say "look into" do you mean
guessing something that's happened?

258
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,300
Or is it looking into the future
like about my job?

259
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,400
I think it's better to talk
about the future.

260
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,140
So can you look into his past for now?

261
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,900
—His past?
—Because he doesn't buy it yet.

262
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,800
I normally look at a person's habits
using their birth date.

263
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,940
Can we start with that?

264
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,010
Sure, sure!

265
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,410
When were you born?

266
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,250
I was born on June 18th 1974.

267
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,880
1974's... what was that again?

268
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,950
June 18th.

269
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,450
Since that's June—

270
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
This is his birth date?

271
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,590
That's right, the 18th.

272
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,660
You can tell things from his birth date?

273
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,890
I can tell his personality more or less with his birth date.

274
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,230
That works for everyone?

275
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,330
Yes, for everyone.

276
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,160
Does a one second difference change something?

277
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,870
Well, sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.

278
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,600
That's why some twins are so similar.

279
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,740
What happens with people who change date lines?

280
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,110
Well, when talking about fate,

281
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,810
even though they might share the same personality,

282
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,080
—their birth date may change.
—That's too long.

283
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,050
You asked her about it.

284
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,920
Okay, shall we get started?

285
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,720
If we were to discuss your comedy,

286
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,720
I'd say naturally you are a very collected person.

287
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,230
So whenever you're doing comedy, and lose sight of your goal,

288
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,130
and you can't think of anything funny to say,

289
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,530
you just stand strong for a little,

290
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,270
until you can come up with something.

291
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,540
That's more of less the general groundwork of your comedy.

292
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Yes.

293
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,740
I think you're a very work-oriented person,

294
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,510
so you seem to be more focused on work than romance.

295
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,880
-That's right.
so you seem to be more focused on work than romance.

296
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,710
—Is that true?
—When we talk about—

297
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,950
Wait a second.
You're really all about work?

298
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,450
—Work is—
—That means

299
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,850
Romance doesn't even get a memo?

300
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,550
—That's right.
—One hundred percent?

301
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,750
Hundred percent?
It mostly seems like it, yes.

302
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,090
Well, that's what she found so.

303
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,260
It's just as she says.

304
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,190
That's what I'm seeing.

305
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,460
See? She's completely right.

306
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,470
Since he's such a collected person.

307
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,640
He's not buying it at all.

308
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,540
That's not true!

309
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,440
You don't believe her at all!

310
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,710
Even though I called Colette-san here for you.

311
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,250
—You're so rude!
—You're one to talk.

312
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,650
—He's too rude!
—Hey, you...

313
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,420
Not at all.

314
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,920
You're one to talk, you're always interrupting her.

315
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,290
And you're the one doubting her the most, too.

316
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,620
I want to show him that it's totally correct.

317
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,360
Sure, sure.

318
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,630
What's the problem?

319
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,430
What do you mean? There's no problem.

320
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,430
It's just that you look the most doubtful about her.

321
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,330
No, I'm just checking if she's right.

322
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,140
You don't have to go that far to do that.

323
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,140
But you heard God's voice two years ago, right?

324
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,610
—That's right.
—See?

325
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,640
Well, yes...

326
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,350
Is she your friend?

327
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,610
No, I just met her.

328
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,850
You sure like to talk, huh?

329
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,350
Why did you call her?

330
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,850
Then why not have her look at me?

331
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
Sure.

332
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,990
If they're going to accuse me of that much.

333
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,320
Sure, here we go.

334
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,960
1974.

335
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,590
1974, right.

336
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,130
October...

337
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,230
25.

338
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,430
You seem to be very passive in romance.

339
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,040
Whenever someone falls in love with you,

340
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,540
you just accept it and play along even if you don't like them back.

341
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,370
No, sorry, it was the 26th.

342
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,440
The 26th, right?

343
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,980
In that case, I think the 26th
is still about the same in romance.

344
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,520
You seem to be the type to judge good and bad
based on your personality.

345
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,650
But since you can't tell what's true or not,

346
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,090
you get angry too easily.

347
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,860
I think that's probably how you were at a younger age.

348
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,760
No, not at all.

349
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,460
—It's way off.
—Is it?

350
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,130
Because I'm not like that normally.

351
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
I don't know.

352
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,360
—You're not dating anyone either.
—I really don't know.

353
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,040
To be honest, when I came here today,
I didn't even know your name.

354
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,140
You called out to me first.

355
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,410
I just called you Kato
because everyone else was doing it.

356
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,150
But even after knowing there was a Kato here,

357
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,950
I really didn't know it was you, to be honest.

358
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,080
What's with you?

359
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,190
For real.

360
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,090
What's with you?

361
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,320
For real, what's with you?

362
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,920
Well, this is a perfect example of that.

363
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,730
—What?
—You're a complete failure.

364
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,460
What are you talking about?

365
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,330
What's your reasoning here?

366
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Come on, tell us.

367
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,230
I thought we could keep going a little longer.

368
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,470
What are you talking about?

369
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,570
Colette-san.

370
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,170
Why bring Colette-san into this?

371
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,370
Keep going, then...

372
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,980
Let's see Hayashi Hiroko-san's young face or something. (EN: JP Actress)

373
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,480
Don't mind them.

374
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,520
So mean.

375
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,220
How many times are you gonna cry?

376
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,560
He's crying about something again.

377
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,760
So mean.

378
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,820
—You're mean.
—Yeah.

379
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:10,890
—You're mean.
—Yeah.

380
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,190
Yeah?

381
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,730
Poor thing.

382
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,030
Who?

383
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,170
Me.

384
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,600
—Well...
—I suddenly turned like this,

385
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,400
even though I was properly thinking about this.

386
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,140
You were thinking?

387
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,610
I was.

388
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,410
You've been playing the same trick all this time.

389
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,940
That's true.

390
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,450
There's no punchline.

391
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,810
You write any jokes normally?

392
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,050
I do.

393
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,820
Jokes? For Xabungle? (EN: Kato's Comedy Duo)

394
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,150
Give your partner a break.

395
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,650
So mean...

396
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
Who's mean?

397
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,990
I am.

398
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,460
Can you take her away?

399
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,900
—That's alright, isn't it?
—Is that alright?

400
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,660
Thank you very much.

401
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,230
—We're really sorry.
—No, I'm sorry.

402
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,070
This guy is too mean.

403
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,330
I wasn't expecting that.

404
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,770
Thank you very much.

405
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,270
I thought something was going to happen

406
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,140
back then...

407
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,810
Shouldn't we change the batteries already?

408
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,240
Ah, four hours.

409
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,410
—I didn't notice.
—The batteries.

410
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,650
I'm tired.

411
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,290
Of course.

412
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,620
—Of course you're tired.
—I'm tired.

413
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,160
He laughed?

414
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,760
He definitely laughed.

415
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,660
—It was just a moment.
—Just a moment?

416
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,460
He lowered his guard and after the "of course you're tired"
he grinned

417
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
No one smiled.

418
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,900
There we go.

419
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,340
You lowered your guard.

420
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,840
For real?

421
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,070
You got careless.

422
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,770
Just for a second.

423
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,880
It was just a second.

424
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,510
Hopeless!

425
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,110
I held it together for so long!

426
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,720
I was eating an onigiri,

427
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,290
and didn't see anything. Miyazako?

428
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,620
Miyazako-san laughed normally.

429
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,730
But well,
he's still a virgin.

430
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,630
He's the only one?

431
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,830
No, Koyabu too.

432
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,430
I'm getting worried, though.

433
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,300
Shouldn't we change the batteries already?

434
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,570
Ah, four hours.

435
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,570
—I didn't notice.
—The batteries.

436
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,080
I'm tired.

437
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,710
Of course.

438
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,450
Of course you're tired.

439
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,520
You got this far!

440
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,690
I did something unforgivable!

441
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,750
Unforgivable.

442
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,890
Yellow!

443
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,120
It can't be helped.

444
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Here we go!

445
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,670
Alright!

446
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,500
Two more hours.

447
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,400
This is too long...

448
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,180
Koyabu-san,

449
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,880
—What do you want?
—Your son

450
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,120
was too cute earlier.

451
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,350
He's an idiot.

452
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,420
That's what you said, yeah.

453
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,540
His mom isn't raising him properly.

454
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,520
No, it was way too cute.

455
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,860
That's right, that's how children are.

456
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,360
Just look at my own kid.

457
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,800
How old is he?

458
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,960
He was 7 when he did this.

459
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,230
Well the numbers were already written there.

460
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,870
Just looking at this

461
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,440
-I also felt like crying.
-That's just how it is

462
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,470
This is him trying his best.

463
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,540
He's great, huh?

464
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,070
He's really trying his best.

465
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,140
With the "ki" character.

466
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,710
That's difficult, isn't it?

467
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,980
And he's getting great marks, too.

468
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,550
Yeah, great marks.

469
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,750
He's even trying his best to write his own name.

470
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,750
Just like this.

471
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,350
With the "ra" character.

472
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,790
—That's difficult, too.
—He's trying his best!

473
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,190
With the "e"!

474
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,220
It's too hard!

475
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,990
—Well, I guess.
—He's crying again.

476
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,960
And here's "ku".

477
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,930
Is there any need to practice "ku" this much?!

478
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,970
Of course there is!

479
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,010
No, no, no!
"E" is hard for sure!

480
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,470
Let me see.

481
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,810
"E" is difficult, right?

482
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,140
"E".

483
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,910
He wrote it a lot.

484
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,350
Who was that?

485
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,420
"Ku".

486
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,020
Is there any need to write "ku" this many times?!

487
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,470
Who is he now?

488
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,300
He's meant to be High Waist?

489
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,780
Just who is that?

490
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,750
I'm Sakurai from Mr. Children.

491
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,770
I'm Sakurai.

492
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,670
What's with those clothes?

493
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,140
They're pants.

494
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,630
Huh?

495
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,100
This may just work.

496
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,430
It might work.

497
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,540
There it is!

498
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,220
That was close!

499
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,520
He's too strong!

500
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,960
Zakoshi-san is taking everyone out one by one!

501
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,900
So this is your pattern now?

502
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,100
That was bad!

503
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,730
Damn it!

504
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,400
I feel that Goto too...

505
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,870
It was close, for sure.

506
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,440
Let's take a look.

507
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,220
This may just work.

508
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,200
He was going all "fwah, fwah!"

509
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,070
When did you come up with that bullshit?

510
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,840
Okay, Koyabu.

511
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,610
Yellow!

512
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
Finally!

513
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,580
His first one.

514
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,780
That's everyone, right?

515
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,950
Now, yeah.

516
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,250
There are about two hours left.

517
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
Yeah, damn it.

518
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,260
Zakoshi-san is on a roll.
And he still has his V.

519
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,920
That's right, the V.

520
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,030
Yeah...

521
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,260
Here we go.

522
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,770
What were we doing?

523
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,830
The practice sheets, right.

524
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,970
That thing about "ku", right?

525
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,600
I don't see "ku" here.

526
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,670
What's that?

527
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,270
Who's that?

528
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,710
Nakajo-san! (EN: Kiyoshi Nakajo - Actor)

529
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,880
Good morning.

530
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,020
Huh? Good morning!

531
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,720
That surprised me.
That's a big name for sure.

532
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,790
What?

533
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,590
This is my help, Nakajo-san.

534
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,020
Who did you call?

535
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,560
He's finally here.

536
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,090
Why was he wearing a garbage can?

537
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,430
You know him?

538
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,100
He's always taken good care of me.

539
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,060
Nakajo-san.

540
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,630
They have to smile?

541
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,040
If everyone smiles, I win.

542
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,500
Smile.

543
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,140
No, we're not gonna do that!

544
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,840
But since Nakajo-san is saying it,

545
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,650
we have to go along with him now.

546
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,550
At least eat something...

547
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,880
Go and eat something.

548
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,120
What are you talking about?
Is that a bill?

549
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,350
It's hot.

550
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,490
That's the same gag as Azumax. (EN: Takahiro Azuma, nickname "Azumax" - Comedian)

551
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,590
Really?

552
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,290
It's the same thing Azumax was doing.

553
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
For real?

554
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,030
And then would come that ninja gag,

555
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,260
with the chainmail.

556
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,830
—The chanel, right?
—I think you mean chain?

557
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,900
—Chanel.

558
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,130
Chanel?!

559
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,570
Not channel.

560
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,640
Huh?

561
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,580
So you're not going to laugh?

562
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,080
No way.

563
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,780
I'd laugh if something funny happened,

564
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,010
but "chanel" and "channel" is just...

565
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,880
Yeah, we're not gonna laugh.

566
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,850
Yeah, if nothing happens,

567
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,190
we're just not gonna laugh.

568
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,320
Even if you ask us to do it, if nothing happens,

569
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,020
well no one's going to laugh.

570
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,290
—Why not do a staring contest?
—Where?

571
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,630
Right here.

572
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,760
No, do something.

573
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,930
And he's a big deal, too.

574
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,900
But I didn't feel like laughing in the slightest.

575
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,330
What about a funny face or something?

576
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,440
What were they trying to do?

577
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,110
Everyone, please make Nakajo-san laugh.

578
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,070
Now we're making him laugh?

579
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,540
Can you do it?

580
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,010
He's not gonna make us laugh?

581
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,380
No, you make him laugh now.

582
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,220
It's a staring contest!

583
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,920
He who laughs loses!

584
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,390
A-pu-pu.

585
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,530
He didn't even flinch.

586
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,030
He had this existencial stare.

587
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,540
He didn't even budge.

588
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,740
I thought it was kinda funny, though.

589
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,610
It's a staring contest.

590
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,280
He who laughs loses.

591
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,940
A-pu-pu.

592
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,650
What?

593
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,990
I'm sorry.

594
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,690
He's making me laugh?
Can he even stand this?

595
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,290
Make sure one of them makes me laugh.

596
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,360
I'm sorry.

597
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,470
That was scary.

598
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,770
He just whispers,

599
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,170
it's too scary!

600
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,470
What do we do?

601
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,910
Why don't we do something together?

602
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,510
Why don't we call the guitar samurai?

603
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,550
Let's give him a call.
Nakajo-san?

604
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,820
A book...

605
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,320
Do you remember

606
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,520
—the guitar samurai?
—I do, I do.

607
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,030
You know what he says?

608
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,630
"Didn't you say!"

609
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,030
I've never done that.

610
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
"Kitchen slice..."

611
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,770
You do it.

612
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,170
You should try something funny too.

613
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:30,610
But Nakajo-san.
I want you to do it.

614
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,480
—Can you do it?
—Can you give it a shot?

615
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,920
"I'm Imori Miyuki."

616
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:45,660
"Ikue Imori's Deli Deli Kitchen."

617
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:50,030
"Raw fish is definitely the best."

618
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,900
"It's delicious."

619
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,000
"Didn't you say"

620
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,870
What's with that?

621
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,340
"But you really are."

622
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,110
"Almost past the expiration date."

623
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,310
"Too bad"

624
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,120
"Imori Miyuki's"

625
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,290
"Almost-almost kitchen."

626
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,620
"Cut it up."

627
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,320
Who's he reading that to?

628
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,590
Read it.

629
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,030
Is that funny?

630
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,700
I can't do that, so read it at least once.

631
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,470
"I am Yakumaru Hirohi."

632
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,670
"Formerly known as Shibugakitai from Yakkun."

633
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:37,980
"Now I run a show for housewives every morning."

634
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,210
"Didn't you say."

635
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,980
That's funny!

636
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,920
Yours was funnier.

637
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,530
At first you were speaking normally.

638
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,300
Normally?

639
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,730
But not to make someone laugh.

640
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,870
"I am Nonomura Makoto."

641
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,500
"I try to discover this world's mysteries."

642
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,210
"I get all the answers."

643
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,940
"Today's is..."

644
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,910
"Borschwort."

645
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,140
"Didn't you say."

646
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,350
He's laughing a lot.

647
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,590
Huh? What?

648
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,720
It's not funny?

649
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,260
Well... we're not quite there yet.

650
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,060
—Why not do it again?
—No, that's well...

651
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,330
It's just not happening.

652
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,860
I think we should have him watch one of Zakoshi's videos.

653
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,930
Wanna watch them?

654
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,040
Can you watch one of my videos?

655
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,710
Then let's do it with the big screen.

656
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,240
Which means that we have to watch too, right?

657
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,310
Of course.

658
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,440
That's amazing.

659
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,880
—Ready?
—Sure, let's do it.

660
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,180
We just met at Kyoto station.

661
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,520
That's right.
Back then....

662
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,920
That's a subliminal effect.

663
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:11,910
I don't get it.

664
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,010
At all.

665
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,710
Well, it's not like there's anything to understand.
That's the point.

666
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,020
It's more of an experience.

667
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,250
So it didn't work, huh?

668
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,420
It's not happening.

669
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,050
It's not gonna make Nakajo-san laugh.

670
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,150
Yeah, exactly!

671
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,020
It's far too deranged for him.

672
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,330
I can laugh, right?

673
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,290
So I shouldn't be here, right?

674
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,360
No, not at all!

675
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,600
That's not the point!

676
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,570
Though you could go home if you wanted.

677
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,370
—Well, I guess so.
—Hey, you're rude.

678
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,540
I guess so.

679
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,270
We should have him leave already.

680
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,280
That's funny.

681
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,040
You can't do that.

682
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,510
We had him come all the way from Kyoto, too.

683
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,680
Aren't you leaving yet?

684
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:56,850
Watch out....

685
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,550
Really, watch out...

686
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,760
—So anyways.
—Sorry about this.

687
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,060
Really.

688
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,960
Sorry it turned out like this.

689
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,660
We're sorry, too.

690
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,900
No, no.

691
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Apologizing is...

692
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,030
Well, you see...

693
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
Are you apologizing?

694
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,370
No, no.

695
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,740
The fact that the mood turned so awkward since you arrived

696
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,170
is kind of your own fault, Nakajo-san, so...

697
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,710
—You could've just told me.
—Please apologize.

698
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,610
Okay! I'm sowwy!

699
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,490
1 hour 40 minutes!

700
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,300
Anything there?

701
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,570
I kinda wanna play something.

702
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:50,370
You scared me! What is it?

703
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,310
—What?
—What was that sound?

704
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,440
—A dog?
—No, it's this key.

705
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,980
What's that? That's scary!

706
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,980
That hurts.

707
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,150
That hurts.

708
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,750
We had that?

709
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,150
What's that?

710
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,490
Who brought that?

711
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,620
I'm sure it's just a prop.

712
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,020
(Audio from "Quiz Derby")

713
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:46,930
It's this.

714
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:47,700
"Too bad!"
It's this.

715
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,660
"Too bad!"

716
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,400
Was that a coincidence?

717
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,710
It's a coincidence

718
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,510
A coincidence for sure.

719
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,580
Which one did you press?

720
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,650
That's too dangerous.

721
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
It was close.

722
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,780
This one?

723
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,290
"Too bad!"

724
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,660
—Is that the real deal?
—It is.

725
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,820
Was that on purpose?

726
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,430
Who recorded that?

727
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,400
"The results are...!!" (EN: Hamada Masatoshi's voice)

728
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,770
Who was it?!

729
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,570
—Who?
—Who was it?

730
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,880
I held it.

731
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,180
—I held it, hey!
—Who was it?

732
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
I held it, of course.

733
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,750
—Me?
—I held it too!

734
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,750
It wasn't me!

735
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,850
Me?
No way, I held it!

736
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,620
I agree with everyone.
Tamuken was smiling.

737
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:54,030
I wasn't smiling, not at all.
I held it.

738
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,600
—No doubt about it?
—No doubt!

739
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,660
Let's take a look.

740
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,930
I definitely held it.

741
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,570
I can't tell for sure if it was a false alarm.

742
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,570
This one?

743
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,040
"Too bad!"

744
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,480
—Is that the real deal?
—It is.

745
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,680
Was that on purpose?

746
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,180
Who recorded this?

747
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,480
"The results are...!!"

748
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,350
He's smiling for sure.

749
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,490
He's smiling.

750
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,590
You were definitely smiling.

751
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,590
If you did that all of a sudden, you'd be smiling!

752
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:29,860
More than I expected.

753
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,700
Tamuken had an orange card already so...

754
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,030
No way!

755
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,300
You're out!

756
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,040
The lion dance ends here.
You weren't able to do it

757
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,550
I'm just taking it like this, so what?

758
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,820
Sure you are.

759
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,390
So you're not laughing even though you're allowed?

760
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,160
It's not like we were holding it, though.

761
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,890
I was tired.

762
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,460
Today was too rough.

763
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,430
With Zakoshi's beeping.

764
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,470
I really wanted to laugh.

765
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,970
For real.

766
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,110
And Kato's damned fortune telling was rough, too.

767
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,110
So you heard God's voice two years ago, right?

768
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,620
That's right.

769
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,950
I was waiting for something to come all the time.

770
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,250
Just like when you're in a haunted house.

771
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,820
"When is it coming, when is it coming?"
All the time.

772
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,490
That damned guy.

773
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,200
What's with him?

774
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,270
One and a half hour.

775
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,940
Can we do anything?
The six of us.

776
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,410
Why not press the sounds until we're used to them?

777
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,710
That's too dangerous.

778
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,550
Which one?
The "Results are..." one.

779
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,420
No, let's drop that one.

780
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,220
I remember which one it was, though.

781
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,960
"The results are...!!"

782
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,120
"The results are...!!"

783
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,390
"The results are...!!"

784
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,960
"The results are...!!"

785
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,370
I just think of the whole picture.

786
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,270
I think I'm used to it.

787
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,170
Something's here.

788
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,870
Hey, mine was better!

789
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,580
If you punch me, I'll punch you back.

790
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,810
Many many times!

791
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,590
If you punch me, I'll punch you back.

792
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,290
Many many times!

793
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,690
How many times?

794
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,660
Two billion times.

795
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,330
Two billion times.

796
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,430
Two billion times.

797
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,870
That's how many times to one?

798
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,170
Two billion.

799
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,840
What about four times?

800
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,710
Four billion times.

801
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,420
So it's not proportional, right?

802
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,920
—It's not proportional at all.
—That's right.

803
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,550
Four billion times.

804
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,690
I'll punch you back!

805
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,360
I'm sure you could.

806
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,330
Funakoshi Eiichiro's... wife? (EN: JP Actor)

807
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,030
Funakoshi Eiichiro's wife.

808
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,770
Is that working?

809
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,570
Mom!

810
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,140
Mom! Mom!

811
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,340
Mom! Mom!

812
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,610
Mom!

813
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,280
Mom! Mom!

814
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,980
Mom!

815
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,350
Mom!

816
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,590
Doing Hanzawa again? (EN: Naoki Hanazawa - Character in a TV Show with the same name)

817
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,870
Mom! Mom!

818
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,040
That was too hard.

819
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,740
And he kept going!

820
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,570
Come on!

821
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,010
It's always like this.

822
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:05,180
That was too long!

823
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,050
Well, you laughed.

824
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,920
Of course I would!

825
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,790
I was wondering what he was going to say.

826
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,660
I was waiting for Hanzawa or Mom!

827
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,030
You just have a yellow so far, right Gotou?

828
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,160
Mom!

829
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,730
Mom! Mom!

830
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,770
Mom! Mom!

831
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,040
Mom!

832
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,910
Mom! Mom!

833
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,880
He's locked on now.

834
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,450
Mom! Mom!

835
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,020
Of course you laughed!

836
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,490
That was completely impossible.

837
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,630
—Orange!
—Yeah, I'm sorry.

838
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,000
Next time...

839
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,700
...you're getting the red!

840
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,500
Zakoshi has too many points

841
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,470
Too many?

842
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,770
We have to do something about Zakoshi-san!

843
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,310
What does Zakoshi laugh at?

844
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,480
I laughed at Jiro earlier.

845
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,540
So far,

846
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,250
what has made him look like he was about to laugh?

847
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,780
When you were going all "gah!"

848
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,950
I was doing that?

849
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,220
With the boobs...

850
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,290
At the beginning, right?

851
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,720
Since they were boobs—

852
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,020
Those boobs, right?

853
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,160
I bit on those boobs,

854
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,960
and you went all "gah!"

855
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,360
It was nothing, but I was about to laugh.

856
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,100
With that?

857
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,100
My boobs!

858
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:39,840
They're gone!!

859
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,850
Here we go!

860
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,890
Okay, can I turn this on?

861
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,520
It's a little hot.

862
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,160
Don't you think it's hot?

863
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,230
Can I do a Yasumura impersonation? (EN: JP Comedian)

864
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,630
Do "Tonikaku Akarui"

865
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,730
—Can I?
—Sure.

866
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,000
Music! Come on!

867
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,940
Stay calm!

868
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,880
—I'm wearing them!
—It's coming out!

869
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,550
Yeah, my dick is.

870
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,350
No, even if you wear clothes, there's no point if it's sticking out.

871
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,120
My dick is, yeah.
But rest assured.

872
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,790
-I'm wearing clothes.
-It's sticking out.

873
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,620
Yeah, but my dick is coming out.

874
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,790
My dick is coming out,

875
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,460
but rest assured,

876
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,530
It's sticking out.

877
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:34,830
I'm wearing clothes.

878
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,100
Rest assured!

879
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,300
I'm wearing clothes!

880
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,530
My dick is sticking out, thought.

881
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,370
Can you stop it with your dick?

882
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,440
My dick.

883
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,940
Zakoshi is strong, for real.

884
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,210
And he's going to put it back, for sure.

885
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,420
I think the zombies should go soon.

886
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,520
Who can do it?

887
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,160
Let's go.

888
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,990
Zombie time!

889
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:05,300
I forgot about this!
Zombie time!

890
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,160
I forgot about this!

891
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,930
I had forgotten about this.

892
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,460
A zombie, huh?

893
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,900
Hey!

894
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,170
—It's been a long time!
—Long time no see!

895
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,540
Good to see things are getting heated around here.

896
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,770
It's the zombie.

897
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,710
Wai— Wait!

898
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,010
—What?
—I can't believe this.

899
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,250
What?

900
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,120
There he is!

901
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,950
—What's this?
—That's Iron Man!

902
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,360
—It's Iron Man.
—Iron Man?

903
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,820
Iron Man's here.

904
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,590
He came to the studio.

905
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,830
Take a look, Zakoshi.

906
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,900
Iron Man came flying in with his hands.

907
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,430
He came flying?

908
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Flying?

909
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,130
He crashed in.

910
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,810
Is he fighting an enemy?

911
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,210
Right, he's fighting.

912
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,280
Amazing. Let's go, Iron Man!

913
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:02,280
Alright, let's go Iron Man!

914
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,680
Those are too many locks!

915
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,360
I had never seen such a wrestling Iron Man.

916
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,560
Give it your all.

917
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,660
Above you, Iron Man! Above you!

918
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,530
Do it above you!

919
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,300
This is rough...

920
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,070
That was okay.

921
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,540
He's really filthy now.

922
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,150
What a bother.

923
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,350
Almost one hour left.

924
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,490
Really!

925
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,190
Just a little more!

926
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,930
An incredible monster appeared!

927
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,000
Other than Iron Man?

928
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,900
Yeah, look!

929
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,730
What's that?

930
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,040
That's a scary monster.

931
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,070
Looks like something out of Resident Evil

932
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,470
Yeah.

933
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:01,780
That's scary.

934
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,740
—I'm freaking out!
—Did you cut that off?

935
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,880
Ah, so I think he's the type

936
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,180
that doesn't really speak.

937
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,290
Can you hear that?

938
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,830
He's really weak to that music.

939
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,960
But he put it himself...

940
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,930
He's really weak to it.

941
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,140
He's falling asleep.

942
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,940
Maybe it's healing him, though.

943
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,250
And I thought he was terrifying.

944
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:46,690
It's over.

945
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,460
—He noticed.
—Watch out!

946
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,090
Watch out, watch out!

947
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,830
That's scary!
Watch out!

948
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,190
That's scary, yeah.

949
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,560
Now's the time for Iron Man to fight.

950
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:57,630
Watch out!

951
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,930
What's going on?

952
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,440
Zai-Zen-Naomi!

953
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,440
Zai-Zen!

954
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,270
Zaizen?

955
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,640
Nao—

956
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,150
That's the head of Zaizen Naomi? (EN: JP Actress)

957
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,750
Zaizen Naomi.

958
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:14,880
Why?

959
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,280
You shouldn't hold on to it that much.

960
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,120
Zaizen Naomi!

961
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,260
What happened to Zaizen Naomi-san?

962
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:23,660
A friend...

963
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,890
You can't do that.

964
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,090
Don't hold your friend's head.

965
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,830
A token of friendship.

966
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:31,360
Your friend's done for.

967
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,370
—It's over.
—A token of friendship.

968
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:34,570
That's not a token

969
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,570
Zaizen Naomi.
Token of friendship.

970
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:42,380
Zaizen... a token of friendship.

971
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,380
Nobu-san, can I take one last shot?

972
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,680
Sure, go ahead!

973
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:49,950
A shot?

974
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,750
Shwut up alweady!

975
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,820
What the hell are you doing?

976
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,630
Who's that supposed to be?

977
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,930
Master Sakata. (EN: Toshio Sakata)

978
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,460
Hey, Zakoshi!

979
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:03,530
Sakata's calling out to you.

980
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,830
—He has something to tell you.
—What is it?

981
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,730
Don't copy my act!

982
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,340
—I'm not copying...
—We're not friends!

983
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,600
Kato-san.

984
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,040
Hey, Kato!

985
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,410
I love you!

986
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:22,120
I wanted to be like you!

987
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,280
He's really getting into it.

988
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:25,790
Really?

989
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:28,760
I wanted to be you.
But I couldn't.

990
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,590
And I don't have time to chase after you.

991
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,560
So I'm trusting myself to you! Shit!

992
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,700
The timing is all over the place, though.

993
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:43,100
That's Hachimitsu Jiro-san.

994
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,440
I don't know who that is!

995
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,770
I've never seen him!

996
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,640
Does he have an NGK show?

997
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,410
Sure, he's on it all the time.

998
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,150
I see him and Sinktank-san all the time.

999
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:58,380
I don't remember that.

1000
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:01,650
Don't you like Sinktank-san?

1001
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,520
I love Sinktank!

1002
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,360
What a stupid question!

1003
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,090
That's a stupid comment, really.

1004
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,430
Since you love him so much.

1005
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,700
—Now do Goto-san.
—Goto

1006
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,530
I'm glad you're so unfunny!

1007
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,940
Just seeing if Goto retires someday

1008
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,080
is my only happiness month after month!

1009
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,750
Hoping he's quitting month after month!

1010
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:27,250
I'm not quitting, though.

1011
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:30,350
So you've held on for a long time.

1012
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,990
You're really hanging on!

1013
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,050
What about his hosting skills?

1014
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,920
When Goto hosts, it almost feels

1015
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:38,690
like a damned dog doing it!

1016
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,330
And not a cat?

1017
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,430
Whichever is fine!

1018
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,000
I just don't like how you do it!

1019
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,370
For example?

1020
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,940
For example, you were very unfunny

1021
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,700
when you stepped into my yard.

1022
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:53,870
What's the most unfunny example?

1023
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,010
When you squealed at the height difference.

1024
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:00,710
My relatives were frozen in their seats

1025
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,080
not laughing at all.

1026
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:06,790
The only ones who laughed back then were your manager

1027
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:09,360
and maybe the younger guys.

1028
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:14,590
If you can only make those close to you laugh,
then just quit already!

1029
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:17,500
I feel bad for Iwao!

1030
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,070
The M-1 in 2003 was your lowest level!

1031
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,140
And you managed to be on TV with M-1!

1032
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,270
He just won't shut up.

1033
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:27,640
And now,

1034
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,640
you expect people to play along to all eternity!

1035
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:31,140
Did Sakata really speak that much?

1036
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,650
Stop it!

1037
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,780
I'll make sure to study more, then.

1038
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:37,450
And you can't take it back anymore!

1039
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,220
I'd laugh if you made at least some monkey jokes!

1040
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,520
Why can't you do that?!

1041
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,660
Did you quit the theaters?!

1042
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,760
No, I'm still performing in theaters.

1043
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,390
Then do the monkey!

1044
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,230
Or for example~

1045
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,440
Does he normally stretch that?

1046
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:58,850
Of course I do.

1047
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,310
You too, Koyabu!

1048
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,310
How can they stand you?

1049
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,910
Your daughter, or your wife?

1050
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,620
I guess you're feeding them since you're in luck right now,
but don't get used to that money!

1051
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:17,360
I guess they're just glad lucky guy is getting paid every month!

1052
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,730
What about his chairmanship?

1053
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:21,530
He's the most useless!

1054
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,060
Are you trying to take down the NGK?!

1055
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:28,800
You're banned from the NGK now!

1056
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,070
Your NGK is now:

1057
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,640
nothing!

1058
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:36,140
With no time!

1059
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,150
Just pure improvisation!

1060
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,380
You know what I mean?

1061
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,520
No time? Just improvisation?

1062
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:48,020
You don't have anything!

1063
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:51,260
You're just tall and appear on TV!

1064
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:53,330
So you're stretching that part now?

1065
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,430
Why don't we go?
Why are all of you youngsters

1066
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,000
so damned unfunny?

1067
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,060
Let's go.

1068
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,670
Nothing since your Zakoba days!

1069
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,200
Um...

1070
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:04,100
What about this person right here?

1071
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:05,410
Who's that boy?

1072
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:07,840
Aren't you always fooling around with Sinktank-san?

1073
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:10,010
I don't remember any Sinktank-san!

1074
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,450
That was funny, really funny.

1075
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,520
What was that?

1076
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,660
Alright, let's do something.
Just to break the ice.

1077
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,360
I don't want this anymore!

1078
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,030
Do it!

1079
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:36,240
Alright let's go!
What are we making today?

1080
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:39,170
"What are we making today?"

1081
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,210
"What are we making?"

1082
00:49:54,990 --> 00:50:00,360
What is that?

1083
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,400
The answer was "anal"!

1084
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,470
What does he mean by "making"?

1085
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:15,880
This guy's an idiot.

1086
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,640
That's good, that's good.

1087
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,910
You held it in?

1088
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,350
We did.

1089
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:22,420
We held it in, huh?

1090
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,380
Zakoshi is going all out.

1091
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,450
I wish he could take it slow.

1092
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,760
That was unexpected!

1093
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,630
Hey, chairman!

1094
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:41,970
Hello.

1095
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:43,740
I'm a zombie.

1096
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:46,470
A zombie?
A helper?

1097
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:48,240
He's a helper.

1098
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,310
A helper.

1099
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,140
I'm here to make you laugh.

1100
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:52,210
I'm counting on you.

1101
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,450
I don't have any points, so I'm counting on you.

1102
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:58,790
Chairman, please touch my nipples.

1103
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,690
Touch my nipples.

1104
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:05,120
Please touch my nipples.

1105
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,360
—I have to touch them?
—Yes.

1106
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,230
Touch them three more times, please.

1107
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,010
Just tou-touch me
a-again.

1108
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,620
Me?

1109
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:35,590
Goto?

1110
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,820
—Miyazako-san?
—I haven't smiled at all.

1111
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:39,690
—Was it Miyazako-san?
—Who was it?

1112
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,960
No way, I haven't smiled!

1113
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:45,830
My hand just reacted instinctively,

1114
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:50,440
but I'd say Goto's and Miyazako's reactions
were a bit too big.

1115
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,700
Alright.

1116
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:53,670
No, no way. That's too—

1117
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,710
It wasn't that much.

1118
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,780
Let's take a look.
There's a good chance you're in the clear.

1119
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,510
Touch them three more times, please.

1120
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:16,230
Just tou-touch me
a-again.

1121
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:19,900
No, that's just...

1122
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,100
Is he safe?

1123
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,200
His face was just...

1124
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:24,670
I could feel his face going off track.

1125
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,610
And I just reacted instinctively.

1126
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,380
To be honest, it was really close.

1127
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,140
Alright, then.
You're safe.

1128
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:32,450
That was close!

1129
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,950
So does that mean I'm out yet?

1130
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,020
Do I still have a chance?

1131
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,750
You're still fine.

1132
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:40,820
That was bad!

1133
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:42,150
Pretty scary.

1134
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,590
Here we go!

1135
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:47,160
Alright!
46 minutes to go!

1136
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,930
46?

1137
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,970
Ah, there he is.

1138
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:54,070
What's with that paper?

1139
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:57,500
You see, I compiled everything in my life so far,

1140
00:52:57,570 --> 00:53:00,240
and wrote it down in a timeline?

1141
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,410
A timeline?

1142
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:02,980
So what's happened every year?

1143
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,380
That's right, yes.

1144
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:06,910
We don't have much time, so let's go with the events.

1145
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,410
Alright.

1146
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,950
"When I was just 0 years old,"

1147
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:16,760
"My father Tomoyuki, and my mother Yuuko gave birth to their eldest son."

1148
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,930
"My name borrowed one character from my father: Tomoyuki."

1149
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:23,000
"The name comes from finding your own path by yourself."

1150
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,900
"And so I was named Naoyuki."

1151
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:30,870
"My mother wanted to name me Gou."

1152
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:32,840
—That was 0 years old?
—Yes.

1153
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:36,810
Two years old.

1154
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:41,910
"According to my mother, I would catch a fever quite often."

1155
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,550
—You might not remember, though.
—Exactly.

1156
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,090
Four years old.

1157
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:58,600
"My father told my mother not to feed me too much."

1158
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,830
"The two got upset and started fighting."

1159
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:08,010
"My father told my mother not to just put yellow clothes on me."

1160
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:11,010
"The two got upset and started fighting."

1161
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,320
He's awful at turning the pages.

1162
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:22,150
Maybe he's just too dry.

1163
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,260
Maybe it's the texture.

1164
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,620
"Six years old."

1165
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:29,830
"Looking at my kindergarten pictures,
I can tell this is when I started to put on weight."

1166
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,670
"Trying to remember,"

1167
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,900
"I realize I was always exhausted as a child."

1168
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:40,570
"My mom took me to a gym to lose some weight,"

1169
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:45,510
"but the only people there were other housewives."

1170
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,580
"but the only people there were other housewives."

1171
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,750
Why did you say it twice?

1172
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,650
Maybe he thought it'd be funny?

1173
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,260
I just let it slide.

1174
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,320
So what's next?

1175
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,330
"Eight years old.
We went to Himeji Central Park for a field trip."

1176
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,930
"When I tried to get on the bus that was parked
in a corner of the park,"

1177
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,270
"I stepped on a big dog's shit."

1178
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,300
"Since we were about to go, my mom panicked,
and grabbed a stone."

1179
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:15,010
"She started rubbing the shit off the shoe."

1180
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:18,680
"And even tried washing it with the park's water,
but the shit was still there."

1181
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,180
"My mother hit me, angry at me."

1182
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:26,190
"I just got on the bus with my filthy shoe."

1183
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:29,790
"I get really carsick normally,"

1184
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,060
"and as expected, I had to withstand getting dizzy."

1185
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,800
"However, I hurried off the bus once we reached our destination,"

1186
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:39,630
"and puked in front of everyone.
So mom got mad and hit me again."

1187
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,340
Okay, why don't we leave it at that?

1188
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:45,570
Why don't you bring the other thing?

1189
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,910
I'll be back soon.

1190
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,410
What a great idea!

1191
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:51,940
Can I take a look?

1192
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:53,110
Sure.

1193
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:54,710
How old is he?

1194
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:56,480
A year older than me.

1195
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:58,080
He looks pretty battered.

1196
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,890
Well, he's 47 this year.

1197
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,460
Just like Tomochika.

1198
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,990
—So what now?
—Did he leave?

1199
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,390
No, I think he just went to grab something.

1200
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,830
Maybe he just got nervous?

1201
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,100
I wonder if he'll take long.

1202
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,160
Here we go!
I wonder if he'll take long.

1203
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:12,400
Here we go!

1204
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,300
There he is!
Here we go!

1205
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:13,400
There he is!

1206
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,540
Who is that?

1207
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:21,310
I'm Kusama Yayoi! (EN: JP Artist)

1208
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:22,370
He's loud.

1209
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,550
But he does look the part.

1210
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:29,880
—Are you leaving?

1211
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:31,980
Huh?

1212
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,290
I wanted to talk to Kusama-san.

1213
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,690
That was quick, Kusama-san.

1214
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,760
Is that it?

1215
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:41,130
He's changing everything.
I'm sorry, I think that's it.

1216
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:42,430
That's it?

1217
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,600
That's it.

1218
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:46,500
What's he doing now?

1219
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,400
—Wanna see?
—No, I'm fine.

1220
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:52,510
Just saying.

1221
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,370
Imabeppu!

1222
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:56,140
Yes?

1223
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,580
—Take off your shirt.
—Yes.

1224
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,580
What do you mean by what he's doing?

1225
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,950
Well, I don't know, I haven't done any of that myself.

1226
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:09,560
I was just thinking about seeing his "anal" again.

1227
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,020
Goto.

1228
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,630
You dug your own grave, huh?

1229
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,330
Wanna see, Goto?

1230
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:19,430
I was just wondering how an Imabeppu version would be.

1231
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:22,400
—Can you say "the answer was anal"?
—Sure.

1232
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,940
What are you doing?

1233
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:30,640
The answer is "anal"!

1234
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,480
That's not it.

1235
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,390
You see, Zakoshi

1236
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:42,760
did that on the VTR.

1237
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,520
—Didded you watch the video?
—I did, yes.

1238
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:46,890
"Didded"?

1239
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,360
"Didded"?
Did you just say "didded"?

1240
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,060
"Didded"? Why?

1241
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,930
That doesn't matter.
You can just do it now.

1242
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,200
That's alright.

1243
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,240
What are you doing?

1244
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,510
The answer is "anal"!

1245
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,610
That's dark...

1246
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,250
—He's too fat so I didn't see.
—You can't see a thing.

1247
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:09,480
You're too fat
and we can't see!!

1248
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:16,090
But if I put my contacts on,
the world changes.

1249
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,990
The answer was...

1250
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,230
"anal"!

1251
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:23,060
It's too dark and I can't see!!

1252
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,030
But if I put on my contacts,

1253
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,170
the world changes!

1254
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:35,310
The answer was "anal".

1255
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:38,610
It's too fat and I can't see!!

1256
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:43,450
But if I put on my contacts,
the world changes.

1257
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:46,220
The answer was "anal"!

1258
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:47,920
I can't see! It's too dark!!

1259
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:51,490
But you're about to break too.

1260
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,300
If you laugh, you're out, Gotou!

1261
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:04,740
We made you laugh.

1262
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,440
Why did I have to open my mouth?!

1263
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,410
You dug your own grave.

1264
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:12,140
Well, now it can't be helped.

1265
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:16,220
I didn't even have to see it!

1266
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,050
—I'm sorry.
—You're too fat.

1267
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:21,990
You all managed to hold it in.
I guess Gotou couldn't do it, though.

1268
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,060
I couldn't.

1269
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,690
We don't even need the replay.

1270
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:28,730
The answer was "anal"!

1271
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:30,530
I can't see! It's too dark!!

1272
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:34,100
But you're about to break too.

1273
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,040
This one's too bad.

1274
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,110
Yeah, it's impossible.

1275
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:42,070
He was basically bursting out laughing!

1276
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,610
He really was, huh?

1277
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,280
Which means?

1278
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,450
You're out!

1279
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:57,220
Well I guess that's that.
This can't go on like this.

1280
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:58,390
Everyone,

1281
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,360
Zakoshi has become far too powerful!

1282
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,260
That's right, his points are too high.

1283
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:03,560
20 million yen!

1284
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:05,600
He's too strong!

1285
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,230
With a single show...

1286
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:11,170
Well, I'm tired.

1287
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,810
And I managed to hang on for so long.

1288
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,040
It was always Zakoshi-san.

1289
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,010
Mom! Mom!

1290
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,220
But if I put on my contacts,
the world changes.

1291
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,650
Every time he gets close,

1292
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,560
I just get stage fright.

1293
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:40,470
You idiot!

1294
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:43,270
"Next time."

1295
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:46,210
"The season 7 finale."
"Next time."

1296
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:47,910
"The season 7 finale."

1297
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:05,160
I did think Katou had been pretty strong so far!

1298
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,930
He was amazing.
