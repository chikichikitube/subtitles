00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,450
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,890
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,190
Anyone there?
-Hard to say

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,000
Anyone?
-Must be

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,160
It's New York!

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,470
On this program we regularly bring you this project

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,840
It involves having to find something or not being allowed to go home for a long time
-Indeed

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,050
This time we bring you a theory relating to comedians outside

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,220
Please take a look

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:35,920
So long!

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,780
Hamada, please read it!

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,960
What!? Why're you shouting at me?

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,120
New York can read it!

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:54,000
When looking for someone whose ends sentences with "gesu" and you think "there can't be such a person" after a long time on location and fake actors appear who say "gesu", will they believe it?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,290
Can't figure it out

16
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,440
What is this?

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,780
Someone will be on location to find a person that says "gesu" at the end of their sentences

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,120
What is "gesu"?

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,340
Isn't it basically impossible to find such people?
-Yes

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,140
So, as they will naturally be out looking for so long, finally they will find one

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,110
But will they believe it?

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,450
I see

23
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,050
The first target is

24
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,700
Find someone detective group!

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,270
Yay!

26
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:40,460
Using a fake plan, Hatse is challenged to find a person whose ends sentences with "gesu"

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,490
There is no time limit
-Wait!

28
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,330
But this will be impossible

29
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,590
So what to do?

30
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,030
I'm going over there

31
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,730
Excuse me, can I interview you...

32
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,770
It won't take much time

33
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,700
Do you have any hobbies and interests?

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,910
I like photography

35
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,670
Photography
-Yes

36
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,860
No one will say "impossible"

37
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,510
I see

38
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,310
After this also

39
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,410
Do you have any hobbies?

40
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,050
Guitar
-Guitar?

41
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,480
Do you live in Tokyo?
-I live in Shizuoka

42
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,050
Originally from Shizuoka
-But i've lived in both places

43
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,250
The fruitless location shoot lasts for 4 hours

44
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,570
So desperate

45
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,180
At this point, actors whose words end in "gesu" will begin to appear

46
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,640
What kind of work do you do now?

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,640
I'm a civil servant-gesu

48
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,650
Civil servant? Eh...

49
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,720
But... but... can you say it again? Sorry

50
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,950
I said i'm a civil servant-gesu

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,350
Eh?

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,970
He's scared

53
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,620
Eh?

54
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,200
A civil servant-gesu? Eh? Eh?

55
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,330
Today is my day off-gesu

56
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,000
"A day off-gesu"

57
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,000
This one is so real

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,670
Is that so?

59
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,570
Eh...

60
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,310
What's wrong with gesu?

61
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,710
No, no, no, no, no, no

62
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,510
I found someone, it's a miracle!

63
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,780
Saying "gesu" is very common in the civil service

64
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,290
No, no, no, no, no...

65
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:34,960
The miraculous meeting with the person who used "gesu" at the end of the sentence makes Hatse finally calm down

66
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,960
Then the truth is revealed

67
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,110
This is Wednesday Downtown

68
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,980
Oh...

69
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,480
Eh?

70
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,470
At this point he is told about the theory

71
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,670
I'm sure you'll believe it

72
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,890
I've been talking to passers-by for so long

73
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,860
I really thought it was a miracle

74
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,430
So there are no such people after all!

75
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,760
It's really impossible for such people to exist

76
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Really cheated

77
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,940
The next target is

78
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,100
Good morning, i'm Abareru

79
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,070
The kind of people he's looking for is...

80
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,810
You will be looking for people who refer to themselves strangely

81
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,310
Impossible

82
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,700
Its bingo this time

83
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,820
It's impossible. There is no one who calls themselves this

84
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,140
He is tasked with looking for specific types of people

85
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,980
Those who refer to themselves oddly

86
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,670
It starts straight away

87
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,430
Good morning

88
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,770
Whose bike is this?

89
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,600
It belongs to me (jibun)

90
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,670
To you? (jibun) What a cool bike!

91
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,130
Straight away he gets "jibun"

92
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,820
The easiest one

93
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,340
Next up

94
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,740
Favorite food?

95
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,180
Anything with rice
-I like seafood rice

96
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,180
Who likes it? Who? Who likes seafood over rice?

97
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,350
I (washi) like seafood over rice

98
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,850
I (washi)? I (washi)?

99
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,560
Surprisingly he finds a wild "washi"

100
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,290
Suddenly, a chance appears to complete the game

101
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,760
This is the same as an unheard of word

102
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,430
But for two hours after that, no other words are found

103
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,770
I don't think i'll find anyone who uses that word

104
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,040
I think i'll just be interviewing people over and over for the next four hours

105
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,280
That's a scary thought

106
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,610
As Abareru's mood is low, at this point the actors begin to appear

107
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,420
Togetsu Ginza is a great place!
-It's true

108
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,660
I'm (shousei) here to buy something...
-Eh?

109
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,100
What an interesting reaction

110
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,730
What did you just say?

111
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,830
Buying something...

112
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,730
No, not that part

113
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,370
Eh... who is shopping here today?

114
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,610
I (shousei) came here

115
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,140
"Shousei", that's impressive

116
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,750
"Shousei"... incredible

117
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,420
"Shousei"...

118
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,960
One hour later

119
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,190
Good afternoon. Where are you going?

120
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,200
Shopping

121
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,930
Where are you from?

122
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,440
Kagoshima, Kagoshima, Kagoshima

123
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,840
Awesome, Kagoshima!

124
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,940
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

125
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,280
Do you have any favorite foods like udon or soba?

126
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,080
Compared to soba, i'd rather have udon

127
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,910
Who likes Udon?

128
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,080
I do (oidon)
-I (oidon)!

129
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,080
※おいどん (oidon) is Kagoshima dialect

130
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,320
Is that what you usually say?

131
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,690
What?
-When referring to yourself

132
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,760
Yes, me (oidon) me (oidon)

133
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,260
Really?

134
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,180
Awesome! Feels like meeting someone from TV

135
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,600
I waited so long

136
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,730
He has no suspicions at this point

137
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,260
And he is one person away in three lines

138
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,730
Next

139
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,710
Excuse me

140
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,610
Keep going!
-Thank you, I (seshita) will

141
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,080
Ah... eh?

142
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,610
What did you just say?

143
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:11,510
What?

144
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,380
You just said "seshita", didn't you?
-Yes, I (seshita) did

145
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,020
I happen to be looking for you

146
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,420
What's going on?

147
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,830
I'm looking for someone who refers to himself as "seshita"...

148
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,390
Wait!

149
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,620
Despite the unreal situation

150
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,620
He does not question it

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,410
So, we end with the least possible

152
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,580
For whom did you buy the stuff?

153
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,710
For my (shin) wife

154
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,410
Eh, wait a minute! Eh...

155
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,880
Eh

156
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,880
How is it possible to have such a self-proclaimed person

157
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,150
No, wait!

158
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,490
Wait a second, please

159
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,080
For whom did you buy the stuff?

160
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,820
For my (shin) wife

161
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,230
Do you call yourself "I" (shin)?

162
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,540
Never heard someone say this before

163
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,660
Sure enough, Abareru believed them all

164
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:12,680
The truth is revealed

165
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,240
Did he really believe it?

166
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,320
What? What?

167
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,680
We are Wednesday Downtown

168
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,020
I did think the timing of "shin" was a little too perfect

169
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,540
But I was more happy than suspicious

170
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,020
The feeling of "it's finally over"?
-Yes

171
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,960
Then the final target is Kishi Takano's Takano

172
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,140
For example, there's "hair buns" here

173
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,900
No one does this anymore, right?

174
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:41,040
The challenge includes having to find "hair buns" and "a reverse Mohican" and "a man walking backwards"

175
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,340
A basically impossible game of bingo

176
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,750
What kind of person wears iron clogs?

177
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:54,060
This time a new element is added

178
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,820
Sorry sorry

179
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,390
Can you be on TV?

180
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,160
No, sorry

181
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,790
Got it. Sorry. It's okay

182
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,980
This is the most unpleasant

183
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,980
Hard to find

184
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,490
Sorry

185
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,670
All people have to agree to be on TV

186
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,210
What is this situation? Seriously

187
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,880
Can't use this clip?
-No

188
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,640
Even the people I meet...

189
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,210
The unwilling ones can't be used either?

190
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,590
These people are not normal

191
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,550
People are so strange nowadays

192
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:36,100
After that, we also come across someone eating oden while walking

193
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,100
Awesome

194
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,090
Sorry, I shouldn't be on TV

195
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,890
Sorry

196
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,900
This one also naturally turned down an appearance

197
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,570
I don't think this project can be done

198
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,440
Everyone is smoking like crazy!

199
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,410
Smoking in the Toyota HIACE

200
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,240
Then there is the "Abe's mask"

201
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,130
Who also refuses to participate

202
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,010
Next to appear is

203
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,990
What's this guy doing?

204
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,930
The most unlikely "person walking backwards"

205
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,040
Excuse me

206
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,010
Is it OK?

207
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,810
What are you doing right now?

208
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,050
Be suspicious!

209
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,650
Sorry, I can't be on TV

210
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,780
Can't shoot

211
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,630
Why's he doing this sort of thing but doesn't want to be on TV?

212
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,470
He's angry

213
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,720
Even the guy refused

214
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,160
Nothing achieved today

215
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,720
After walking for 8 hours

216
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,850
With barely any usable footage, the shoot ended

217
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,370
Can you give me one more chance?

218
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,470
One more day of shooting...
-Is that okay? I'm sorry

219
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,810
We're the ones who are sorry.
-I'm really sorry

220
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,810
And so it came to a second day on location

221
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,880
That's nice

222
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,690
And he wandered the shopping streets for two hours looking for non-existent people

223
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,060
I don't think so.
-No?

224
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,260
A little...

225
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,670
Later we came to Shinjuku where people were prepared

226
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,600
Standing sleeper

227
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,340
Sorry, sorry

228
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,780
Sorry

229
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,470
What?

230
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,340
We're doing a TV show. Can I interview you?

231
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,180
I don't think so
-That...

232
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,190
Can we talk for a minute?
-No

233
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,720
That...

234
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,420
What is this location bullying

235
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,560
May I interrupt?
-No

236
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,360
I'm ashamed to be on TV

237
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,730
Just a moment, just a moment

238
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,030
No, no, no

239
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,400
Not today, i'm not cute today

240
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,470
Very cute. Very cute

241
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,140
Nah nah nah

242
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,770
Really, really, really, really
-Nah nah nah nah

243
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,340
Super ugly

244
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,770
What are you saying?

245
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,440
So irritating

246
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,460
He's the worst!

247
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,780
Eh, this...

248
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,950
Little brother
-What is it?

249
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,120
Can we talk?
-What is it?

250
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,360
Well...just a little chat
-I can't

251
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,420
Like a police interrogation

252
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,290
It's really nice to meet you...

253
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,720
I'm really sorry

254
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,030
Just a moment... just a moment

255
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,340
So much useful stuff not shot

256
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,680
Reverse Mohican Haircut

257
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,000
This is it, right?

258
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,040
Sorry to interrupt. Sorry

259
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,570
Can we have a chat?

260
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,570
Is your hair called reverse mohawk?
-Yes, it is

261
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,380
We are here to do a TV show, is it ok to shoot...

262
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,650
I'm busy right now. Sorry

263
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,580
Is it okay if we talk while we walk?

264
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,450
I'm in a hurry.
-Walking and talking

265
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,250
I'm in a hurry. Sorry

266
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,090
Let's talk as we go...
-You're so annoying!

267
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,320
Pain in the ass!

268
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,560
That shit is unforgivable

269
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,430
These kids piss me off so much

270
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,670
That gyaru was so damn annoying

271
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,840
Anger at not being allowed to interview takes over

272
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,780
And yet he has no suspicion at all that it is a set up

273
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,290
So, a third day of shooting

274
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,120
There there!

275
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,480
We have a situation

276
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,260
Look bread, bread!

277
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:36,870
Desperately catching up with a person holding the toast

278
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,640
He's like a policeman

279
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,900
Hey, brother!

280
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,100
Can we have a chat?

281
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,640
I'm in a hurry, I don't have time, sorry

282
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,800
Sorry, just for a moment

283
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,170
I don't have time... i'm in a rush

284
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,980
A guy running like this probably doesn't have time to be on TV...

285
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,720
It's a movie!

286
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,220
He's too anxious

287
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,420
I can't catch up with this one

288
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,330
Unbearable...

289
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,110
Later

290
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,430
This is the 70-year-old...

291
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,840
Hello, Grandpa

292
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,970
Can we take a moment of your time to film a TV program...

293
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,180
I'm working now

294
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,250
Now you should be suspicious!

295
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,680
Just a moment...

296
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,950
Can we talk for just a moment?

297
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,130
The noodles will be stuck together

298
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,520
I'm working now

299
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,690
And after work...can we talk after work?
-No

300
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,550
No?

301
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,510
Because i'm working

302
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:42,030
Can you put down the delivery? We want to talk to you

303
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,030
I already said no!

304
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,700
Stop filiming!

305
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,650
After this also

306
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,380
This one?

307
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,410
This is too suspicious

308
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,380
It is not convenient to go on TV and I cannot be interviewed

309
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,510
Of course, he was also rejected the next time

310
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,860
Does your hair get tangled?

311
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,230
So annoying

312
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,130
Can you take off your mask?

313
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,270
It's twins...

314
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,400
Double mask drop

315
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,070
We are filming a TV show can we talk?

316
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,510
No

317
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,100
Just a moment

318
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,580
Forget it, don't, don't, don't

319
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,180
It's embarrassing

320
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,850
I can't get fired up

321
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,680
It's usually so easy for me to get fired up

322
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,690
It's tough to be fired up, being rejected by everyone

323
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:45,150
After 3 days of shooting, he has not a single usable clip

324
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,880
His mental state has also reached its limit

325
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,970
So, we reveal the truth

326
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,310
This is Wednesday Downtown

327
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,810
What?

328
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,150
What?

329
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,960
We explained the project

330
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,650
It was all planned!?

331
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,490
All planned

332
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,890
That too?

333
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,530
All of them

334
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,200
Did you guys make these passersby say all that?

335
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,970
Are you kidding me? Really?

336
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,640
Was it all a lie?

337
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,370
Only the one eating oden was real

338
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,270
Only the one with oden?

339
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:38,720
In summary
It is difficult to find people who say "gesu" and for people to see through the prank

340
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,710
That was hard on him.
-3 days of hard work

341
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,220
A 3-day location shoot

342
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,050
Sure enough, they didn't expect it was all a setup

343
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:52,030
They just went along with everything

344
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,160
So the theory was successfully verified

345
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
Thank you

346
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,910
Thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
-Thank you for your hard work

347
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,340
New York just walked off...

348
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,710
New York

349
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,370
New York

350
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,130
New York
-New York

351
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,190
Do you want us to say more...
-Hamada has something to say to you.

352
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,950
What is it?
-There are a lot of people who say too much at the end

353
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,850
But you guys are going the opposite way

354
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,290
This is a Hamada-ism
-No, no, no

355
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,030
We don't want to talk too long and bore people
-No, no, no

356
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,360
Such a short summary

357
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,530
We still need a little more, right?

358
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,200
It is a bit too short

359
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,700
But most of all, I don't want to annoy Hamada
-No

360
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,200
I can listen for a bit longer

361
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,540
What we watched was very interesting

362
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,380
Everyone else probably has something to say

363
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,650
We'll do it differently next time then

364
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,000
Let's welcome the next presenter

365
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,800
Who is it?

366
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,670
It's probably that...

367
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,480
It's Fujiwara!

368
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,970
Although it's nothing to do with you, since you've come out it can only mean one thing

369
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,600
Its that one, right?
-That's it!

370
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,940
Everyone has been waiting!

371
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,740
MONSTER LOVE has appeared!

372
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,480
No, no, no

373
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,720
Its MONSTER LOVE

374
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,750
I work in the same office as Kurokawa-senpai

375
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,520
You care about your seniors' love, right?

376
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,510
The last thing I want to see is seniors in love, it's disgusting

377
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,030
It's weird.
-Yeah, because he's weird as hell

378
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,010
So here's a recap

379
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:38,790
9 women that claim to like Kuro-chan have appeared

380
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:44,750
But among them are some just pretending to like him

381
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,070
They started to live together in Okinawa from the last episode

382
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,960
One held Black's hand in the aquarium, and another went to his room to kiss him

383
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:00,440
Whereas another drank with him alone to gain his favor

384
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,360
But so far, his record is excellent, right?

385
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,030
He's only eliminated the pretenders

386
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,760
Kuro-chan can see through the lies

387
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,940
Good morning

388
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,010
Wow, impressive!

389
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,310
Who cooked this breakfast?

390
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,710
What kind of clothes are these?

391
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,680
I did!

392
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,590
Miku did, by yourself?

393
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,300
I did

394
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,250
Very impressive

395
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,360
That's awesome

396
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,640
Ah, this omelette is heart-shaped

397
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,760
Mine isn't

398
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,400
Ah, just mine?

399
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,050
Only Kurokawa's is heart-shaped?

400
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,870
Yes

401
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,530
So impressive, two hearts

402
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:53,900
Delicious!

403
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Ah, great

404
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,490
It's really awesome

405
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:02,750
We're eating so happily and getting along so well

406
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:08,320
I can't believe there are still liars among you

407
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,430
He came out with it!

408
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,700
You'd surely be paranoid

409
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,400
Sorry sorry sorry

410
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,790
I should just be happy with the life I have right now

411
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,240
Eat, eat, eat

412
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,220
He looks cute

413
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,750
Not cute at all!

414
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,910
No need for a drone shot

415
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,090
The girls footage is pretty good

416
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,720
A good opening, right?

417
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,080
Especially nice

418
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,080
So cute

419
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,070
Very cute!

420
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,240
This is not needed

421
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,350
Smelling again

422
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,080
He really likes to smell

423
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,080
What is this!?

424
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,640
Look!

425
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,440
What happened to the typhoon yesterday?

426
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,880
It's clearing up

427
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,630
This conversation is so boring!

428
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,480
Do you want to go to the beach?

429
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,870
Let's go!

430
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,840
Then everyone put on a swimsuit, let's go!

431
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,840
It's Okinawa after all

432
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,640
He's loving it

433
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,440
Awesome

434
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,560
Looks so happy

435
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,950
What the hell?

436
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,570
They're laughing

437
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,060
Save him!

438
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,840
No one except Miku is helping me!

439
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,730
So annoying!

440
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,610
So happy, so happy

441
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,880
Are you okay, Miku?

442
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,520
Let me help you~ yo, let me help you~

443
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,860
A bit too close

444
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,980
The pretenders must be super scared, right?

445
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,090
I'm here to save you

446
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,670
I'm gonna grab you

447
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,500
I am the bald sea monster

448
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,640
Wow, so boring

449
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,210
"Bald sea monster" is so boring

450
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,980
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

451
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,680
So sudden? What?

452
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,730
Don't stick together

453
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,930
Ah, wait, is this jealousy?

454
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,590
You can be a bit more jealous!

455
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,410
So close together!

456
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,360
I can feel the body temperature

457
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,950
I always want to talk to you, but everyone is very active

458
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,670
Take a seat

459
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,980
Everyone please consider if they're sincere or not

460
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,730
Mami, looking closer at you

461
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,540
You have a super small face

462
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,420
No, it's not.
-It is!

463
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,910
And beautiful.
-Thank you

464
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:55,150
I'm wondering if you really see me as a member of the opposite sex

465
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,430
Aren't we holding hands right now?

466
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,430
Can't you feel my heart beating so hard?

467
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,410
So disgusting

468
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:06,530
Can I lean on your shoulder?

469
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,000
Of course

470
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,570
I want to be with you all the time

471
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,890
Ah, so disgusting

472
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,910
Me too

473
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,280
Risa, what's wrong?

474
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,650
I hurt myself a bit

475
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,410
Eh? No way!

476
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,680
So I came away for a bit

477
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,320
Your foot?

478
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,280
Don't force yourself!

479
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,240
Thank you. Sorry. We were all having fun together

480
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,890
But if Risa is injured

481
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,490
It might as well be me getting hurt

482
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,760
What? What? So kind!

483
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,730
I'm so happy to hear that

484
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,190
Is your foot okay?
-Yeah

485
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,370
The bleeding has stopped, but it still hurts a little

486
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,500
I got some ice cream.
-Thanks

487
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,940
Is it ok to eat it?
-Please

488
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,670
Here I go

489
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,000
This is a little too natural
-She may be faking

490
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,610
Delicious

491
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,780
Too natural.
-Hamada is a bit suspicious

492
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,650
Super delicious

493
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,080
So kind, thank you for caring so much about me

494
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,620
Because we

495
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,690
Hamada is super into this

496
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,260
Everyone has been playing without Risa

497
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,060
I saw it. I saw it

498
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,020
But last night

499
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,430
You picked me first

500
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,300
So i've been wondering is it possible? Will you choose me again?

501
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,040
I was surprised when I was called...

502
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,970
Not only surprised, but happy and surprised at the same time

503
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,780
She was chosen first

504
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,110
I am very happy

505
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,480
I've told you already

506
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,570
Yeah, we made a deal, so I think I can trust you

507
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,250
What kind of expression is this?

508
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,280
Risa, do you really like me?
-Yes

509
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,750
I really like you, that's why I signed up

510
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:41,160
Yesterday, you realized someone was lying to you

511
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,130
So its understandable you're still suspicious at this point

512
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,600
But I really did come here because I like you

513
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,470
But i'm not sure how I can make you believe me

514
00:24:54,910 --> 00:25:04,010
No, because you are the first in my heart, I chose you first yesterday

515
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,110
What's this expression?

516
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,040
The expression is so angry

517
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,800
So, well, I believe you

518
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,920
Risa also believes in you, so I hope you can trust me

519
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,760
Yes, it'd be weird if I couldn't

520
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,060
Everyone is still waiting. Let's go back

521
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,790
Is your foot okay?

522
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,360
Yeah, and the ice cream is also very good

523
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,300
Thank you, really

524
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,740
What to think...
-Indeed

525
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,200
I don't get it

526
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,740
Eh? Is she, or isn't she?

527
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,440
Don't know, right?

528
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,400
Really can't tell the difference

529
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,510
After playing in the sea, I'm hungry

530
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,580
Yeah, I'm hungry

531
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:45,160
Yeah, since we couldn't do it yesterday because of the typhoon

532
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,120
BBQ?

533
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,610
I want to BBQ

534
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,620
Then let's barbecue. Let's eat!

535
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,910
Let's eat!

536
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,870
Well, it's important to buy ingredients

537
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,910
This Kuro-chan wants to go

538
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,670
Please do

539
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,870
Ri, want to go together?

540
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,110
Eh, is that okay?

541
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,310
Is just 2 people okay?

542
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,920
2 is fine
-2 is better

543
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,620
It's a big responsibility

544
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,400
Yeah

545
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,960
Great

546
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,540
Here here here

547
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,960
Wow, it's huge!

548
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,510
Really pretty good
-Yeah

549
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,920
I'm looking forward to the barbecue!

550
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,300
What should we buy?

551
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,440
You know what to buy for BBQ, right?

552
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,030
Is there anything you want to eat?
-I want to eat lamb

553
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,930
So annoying

554
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,560
Let's look for it then

555
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,960
Ah

556
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,260
What's that?

557
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,300
Goat?

558
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,000
Never eaten it

559
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,770
It should be similar to lamb

560
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,270
Isn't it a bit cold?

561
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,310
Feeling cold?

562
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,320
Here we go

563
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
This girl is very direct

564
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,900
We bought a lot but its a pity there was no lamb

565
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,350
I want to eat it!

566
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,050
Goats?
-Goats

567
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,690
We bought goat meat

568
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:54,690
Were you surprised yesterday?

569
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,360
He's taking the initiative!

570
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,280
That I was in 5th place?

571
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:05,700
I thought Kuro-chan would definitely rank me #1

572
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:11,670
At first, I pretended to be a little uneasy, but I thought I was going to be first

573
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,710
The expression is very obvious

574
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,690
But you didn't call my name

575
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,320
Honestly, it was tough

576
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,120
They've had a good relationship so far

577
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,220
Tough?
-Yeah

578
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,710
I don't want you to be with other people

579
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,160
This is my honest opinion

580
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,280
What a face!

581
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,430
I'll say it from the bottom of my heart

582
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,580
You said in the previous relationships you had

583
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,700
That you didn't mind your partner liking others, right?

584
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,240
It made me think you're a very casual person

585
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,920
Even with those that had other girlfriends

586
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,480
Saying it straight!

587
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,050
I thought "I like him so it's okay", so I kept going out with them

588
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,330
I think its a bit concerning

589
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,160
Do women like that really exist?

590
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:05,000
So i'm unsure whether you really like me or not

591
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,000
What kind of tone is that?

592
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,750
What kind of tone is that?

593
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,230
So scary

594
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,000
He's talking with his mouth closed!

595
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,880
What just happened?

596
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,260
It's like he's dubbed

597
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,120
No, he is talking

598
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,440
Before...

599
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,340
Like ventriloquism

600
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:30,550
Even if someone has a girlfriend, I'd still want to go out with them if I like them

601
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,080
She's crying!

602
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,540
So i've been in such relationships

603
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,810
She's crying!
-No way, Richi!

604
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:43,800
But now i'm only concerned about Kuro-chan

605
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,560
She's good!

606
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,200
I only like Kuro-chan

607
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,080
So I also hope that Kuro-chan only likes me

608
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,080
She's actually crying

609
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:57,880
So I don't want to fall in love like I did before

610
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,880
Can I change what I said?
-Yes

611
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,990
So cool

612
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:05,920
I hope you don't think I'm a casual woman

613
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,030
Don't think such a thing again

614
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,020
She's a nice girl

615
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,530
I'm sorry to say that you are a casual woman

616
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,720
Kurokawa too?

617
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,430
Kuro-chan's also crying

618
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:20,040
This is why I always fail in love

619
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,210
Whenever I like a girl

620
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,080
I obviously like them

621
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,510
But because I have no self-confidence

622
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,950
I have no confidence in myself

623
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,020
I act like i'm relaxed and everything is easy

624
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,560
Must be lacking confidence, right?

625
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:38,760
Because there is no self-confidence, i'm always just trying

626
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,820
Are there really tears?
-No

627
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,320
So it gets worse and worse

628
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,320
Fake crying?

629
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,130
I will also change, i'm sorry

630
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,870
I will also change

631
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,070
What is this agreement?

632
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,280
What kind of expression is this?

633
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,600
Sorry

634
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,540
It's ready to eat, right?

635
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,480
Eat it, eat it

636
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,380
Let's eat

637
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,450
Delicious!

638
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,000
On this day also, an elmination must occur

639
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,080
Who will be eliminated?

640
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,330
It's concerning

641
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:19,430
Up to this point, these three have been proactive in building a good relationship with Kuro-chan

642
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:24,220
And on this day, Mami was alone with Kuro-chan for the first time and expressed her feelings

643
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,240
Mami is good

644
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:30,680
But Mina has yet to express her feelings to Kuro-chan

645
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:37,230
Who will be eliminated tonight due to not being selected by Kuro-chan?

646
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,060
Wow, super nervous

647
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,890
Thank you for waiting!

648
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,880
He made them wait

649
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,370
The 2nd day of cohabitation is coming to an end

650
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,020
Don't make people wait!

651
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:58,000
The person whose name is not called at the end

652
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,800
Will go home today

653
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
1st place is

654
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,070
Who is it?

655
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:09,310
While crying and talking so much...

656
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,320
Miku

657
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,270
She's not first again!

658
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,690
Miku is first!

659
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,520
Next, 2nd place is

660
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,260
Mami

661
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,210
What about Richi?

662
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,600
Where's Richi?

663
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,930
Next 3rd place is

664
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,110
Mina

665
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,180
Not good not good

666
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,380
Richi's in a bad spot

667
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,230
It was clearly agreed

668
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,800
They said they would change!

669
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,190
The remaining two have been loved by Kuro-chan since the beginning of the project

670
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,980
I thought these two would be safe at least

671
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:57,490
The remaining two have been loved by Kuro-chan since the beginning of the project

672
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,700
Because Risa is No.1 in my heart

673
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,670
I like Ri

674
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,310
This expression

675
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,750
I am so happy

676
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,400
I can feel the tingling of fate

677
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,610
I'm sorry to say you are a casual woman

678
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,360
Who exactly will be eliminated?

679
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,420
In 4th place is

680
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,420
Which one is it?

681
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,320
Richi

682
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,360
Alas, Risa is eliminated

683
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,910
Eh, why?

684
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:37,030
Today we are saying goodbye to Risa

685
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,400
Hamada suspected Risa, right?

686
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,600
Beautiful. Glamorous

687
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:46,880
To be honest, I have never been liked by such a person

688
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:50,720
And never had a good relationship either

689
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,320
Although you said to me "I like you"

690
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:59,160
It's a little hard to believe

691
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:04,690
Honestly, you don't really like me, do you?

692
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,330
I thought so, so I didn't choose you this time

693
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:17,170
By the way, do you really like me?

694
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,690
Does she?

695
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,510
I do

696
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,310
Eh... eh?

697
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:27,450
I signed up because I really do like you

698
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,440
That sucks!

699
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,890
Eh? Deceitful, wait wait wait

700
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,550
Eh? Really?

701
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,680
Eh? Then why...

702
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,250
If it's too messy here, others will...

703
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,250
Eh? Why?

704
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,660
Eh? Wait, no, it doesn't count

705
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,590
Richi is also crying, what does it mean?

706
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,140
It doesn't count, it doesn't count

707
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,280
You can't go back!

708
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,700
So, you were sincere, huh?

709
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,240
Well, perhaps I failed to get it across to you

710
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,850
Poor Risa!

711
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,040
It's also my fault for not making you believe me

712
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,170
No, no

713
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:56,250
Why... why did I suspect you

714
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,120
Why did I suspect you!?

715
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,450
You really meant what you said
-Yeah

716
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,250
Dating older men

717
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,890
All of it was true

718
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,250
Not a single lie

719
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,970
Risa liked him from the beginning

720
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,130
I really thought you look like an actress

721
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,080
Yes

722
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:16,230
I do medical-related work

723
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:20,700
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute

724
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,730
What have I done?

725
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,720
Really...

726
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:27,990
I did not believe the girl that likes me

727
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,210
A famous quote

728
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:30,640
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry

729
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:35,690
Someone liked me, someone liked me

730
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,860
You expressed your feelings to me properly. I'm sorry

731
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,100
He's gotten super excited all of a sudden

732
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,560
I'm really sorry

733
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,060
A soon-to-be famous scene!

734
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,200
I'm really happy, either way

735
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,470
It's been fun to date

736
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,480
A bit sad, right?

737
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:55,310
I can't do this

738
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:58,800
Because maybe only Risa is sincere!

739
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,240
True

740
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,410
Indeed

741
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,610
I suspected you

742
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,040
Not sure about the mood of the other people there watching this

743
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,720
It's beyond saving

744
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,610
Yes, it's hopeless

745
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,860
Although I couldn't make Risa happy

746
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,130
I hope you'll be happy!

747
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:22,000
Okay, see you next time

748
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,810
She will
-Don't make it sound like you've been in a relationship

749
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:25,400
I don't want to part so soon

750
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:30,640
We probably can't see each other again soon

751
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,440
I'm really sorry

752
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,450
Really, thank you

753
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,510
Richi is crying!

754
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,800
Can I shake your hand?

755
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,410
Handshake

756
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,560
Thank you

757
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,590
I didn't expect to be able to meet you after I signed up, but I'm glad

758
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,120
So you really like him!?

759
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,780
Thank you

760
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,130
I am the one who should be thanking you

761
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,820
Once you let go, you're going home?

762
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,670
Aren't you the one sending her home?

763
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,560
It's his fault

764
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,610
I hope we can meet again

765
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,410
Really, thank you

766
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,810
I'm sorry. Thank you

767
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,750
Do you best

768
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,220
Goodbye

769
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,620
Thank you everyone

770
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,160
A big scene!

771
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,140
Really crying

772
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,140
Tears are flowing
-Snot is coming out

773
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,610
What is this?

774
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,620
Please consider the mood of the remaining people

775
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,310
What is this...

776
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:41,380
Why did I eliminate her?

777
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,080
Don't react too much here

778
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:45,750
What's going on here!

779
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,370
It's your own fault!

780
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,390
STAFF!

781
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,400
Is there anyone else besides Risa!?

782
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,660
Is there really a girl who likes me still left?

783
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,130
Yes

784
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,730
Great! Great!

785
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,080
The worst!

786
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,740
What?

787
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,410
Everyone is listening

788
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,470
A bad guy
-Changes so easily

789
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,960
It's like a bug

790
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,940
I was distraught, apologies

791
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,720
Psycho!

792
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,290
I'm sorry, I'm a disgraceful man

793
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,790
But now I've become stronger too

794
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,230
Let's continue happily

795
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,130
So annoying

796
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,310
Risa really liked him

797
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:41,470
I even suspected her.
-Hamada was suspicious

798
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,440
It was too smooth and natural so you though it was fake

799
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,960
What do you think now?
-I'm sorry

800
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,810
What are you sorry about, you weren't tricked
-Not tricked

801
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,210
I should say, you are super into watching this!

802
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,920
I'm not!

803
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,770
Probably the most into it out of everyone

804
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,770
At first he was watching like this, but later like this!

805
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,190
He's taking notes

806
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:08,860
It was really messy, especially with everyone watching

807
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,080
Yes, yes, everyone is watching

808
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,160
Even if they liked him to begin with they may hate him now

809
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,100
They might become disinterested

810
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,280
Miku ranked first again

811
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,390
Yeah
-He especially likes her, right?

812
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,710
Then shouldn't Miku be guaranteed last place?
-She's not a racehorse

813
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:27,240
It's not like betting on a horse

814
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,390
Miku's gate

815
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,390
Horserace woman

816
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,690
She's not a horserace woman

817
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:37,960
There's more to watch, so let's take a look

818
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:45,570
He eliminated her because he thought there's surely no way she actually likes him
-Yeah

819
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,950
Kurokawa's weakness is his lack of self-confidence

820
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,120
Where is this place?

821
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,990
Looks Frieza sitting in that chair

822
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,680
Kuro-chan, can we talk now?
-Ah, Ri

823
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,390
Are you free now?
-I'm free!

824
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,990
Can I sit down?

825
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,490
You can't sleep either?

826
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,430
Must have something to say!

827
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,700
Yeah

828
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,000
She's angry!

829
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,500
I'm very concerned about the results announced today

830
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,210
For sure!

831
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,200
Announced results?

832
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,170
I am 4th place...

833
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,180
Boss!

834
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,080
She wants to ask

835
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:27,110
Rather than the sadness of not being called

836
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:32,480
That Kuro-chan lied to me is the most shocking

837
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,050
So I came to ask

838
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,980
A low ranking

839
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,660
That... I'm sorry, Ri

840
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:46,360
I would have liked to put you at number 1 too

841
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,360
But

842
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,470
Intentionally...

843
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,430
On purpose?

844
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:59,510
I did it on purpose

845
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,200
What?

846
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,910
At the octopus party

847
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:11,550
When I blew, you said, "It stinks, it stinks"

848
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,440
It's here.
-Yes she did

849
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:12,620
When she closed her eyes

850
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,050
It stinks!

851
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,560
Feels so smelly, so smelly

852
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,570
What did you mean by that?

853
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:28,600
I originally thought you were saying that to just make things more lively

854
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:34,170
So I thought "Ri so interesting"

855
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,790
You've said it in private too, right?

856
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,640
Did you say it?

857
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,920
In private?

858
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:48,080
At the time I though it's okay because it was funny

859
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:56,440
But I heard that you also said my mouth stinks in private

860
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,710
What kind of conversation is this?

861
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,270
The other girls said that?
-Yes

862
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,610
Someone just now...

863
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,590
Talking about "if your mouth stinks, it's a bit..."

864
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,680
Richi?

865
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,420
If I say it, I will become a traitor, so I can not say

866
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,990
Eh~

867
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,490
It's a bit of a shock

868
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,960
But it's not really bad

869
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,930
So many different channels

870
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,600
When talking to others

871
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,900
I was referring to after you'd eaten wasabi

872
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,460
So it probably smelt a bit because of that

873
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,910
But usually when you talk, it doesn't stink at all

874
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,480
The BGM and the conversation doesn't match at all

875
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,380
This content should not be said in such an atmosphere

876
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,180
That's right, I don't stink, right?

877
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,850
Not smelly

878
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,660
Because you were saying this stuff about me

879
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,030
What a boring conversation.
-What the heck?

880
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,120
I've been very concerned

881
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,050
The theme has become bad breath

882
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:59,660
I'll say it straight, right?

883
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,500
For example, when we went shopping

884
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:07,270
I didn't know how to bring it up

885
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,650
This should be said while laughing

886
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:10,160
People would usually burst out laughing while talking about this

887
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,110
But I really don't think it stinks

888
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:17,580
I said "stink" just to make things more lively

889
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,490
They've talked about this topic for so long already

890
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,980
Actually, I don't think it stinks

891
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:28,960
So now I "ha", i'll blow on you

892
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,400
Again?

893
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,360
Can you smell it?

894
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,300
Ok

895
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,780
Ah, are you unsure?

896
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,630
No

897
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,970
It's fine

898
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:39,570
"Yes?" If you say "yes", then does that mean you didn't say anything bad?

899
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,770
No, I didn't

900
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,940
Really?

901
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,520
Hope she says it stinks

902
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,310
Then i'll blow

903
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:49,730
Say it!

904
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:51,980
Not smelly

905
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,810
It must stink!

906
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,990
It stinks, it sounds like it does

907
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,220
You're holding your breath, aren't you?

908
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,290
No

909
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,690
Really?
-Yeah

910
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:01,990
Then I'll do it again.
-Ok

911
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,710
You don't need to
-What is this!?

912
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,940
No need no need!

913
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,900
It must stink!

914
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,710
Her face is distorted

915
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,670
Not smelly

916
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,990
It must stink.
-Don't force yourself!

917
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,700
Really?

918
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,340
Not smelly

919
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,610
1 more time

920
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:19,800
The third time

921
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,420
Her expression!
-She stiffened up

922
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,510
Close your eyes

923
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,150
Whoa that's surprising!

924
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,250
Terrible, terrible.
-She did it!?

925
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,320
This is terrible!

926
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,120
Finally!

927
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,760
Proof that it doesn't stink

928
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,610
Don't say it like it's evidence of "I love you"

929
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:36,430
This expression

930
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,570
Great expression!

931
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,830
Sorry!

932
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,600
So fast! So fast!

933
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:47,050
Amnesia immediately after a kiss

934
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:52,910
To prove that it doesn't stink, you kissed me?

935
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,520
What kind of evidence is that?

936
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,380
Yes

937
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,480
Like "did you just kiss me?"

938
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,480
I'm sorry I suspected you

939
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,500
So, I hope you can trust me

940
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,600
Can this be true?

941
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,630
I really mean it

942
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:11,960
Did she overdo it?

943
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,370
Is it or not?

944
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,530
Ah, Richi

945
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,800
Not good not good

946
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,530
Don't touch her!

947
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,600
Sorry!

948
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,150
You said it already!

949
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:29,580
I won't do anything weird starting tomorrow

950
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:33,780
I believe in Kuro-chan

951
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,520
And I hope you can trust me

952
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,440
Look at Kurokawa's expression

953
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,280
A terrible face

954
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,290
I'm going back

955
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:47,080
An incredible scene!

956
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:58,240
It has been a long time since someone kissed me on the lips

957
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,790
Disgusting

958
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,360
Scared the hell out of me

959
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:01,430
Disgusting

960
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:08,320
So, that's it, what does everyone think?

961
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,950
So disgusting!

962
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,720
"Did you just kiss me?"

963
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,030
Nagashima's "Want to join my team?

964
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,030
※A line from Shigeo Nagashima's SECOM commercial

965
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,970
SECOM's "Want to join my baseball team?"

966
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,470
No intonation

967
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,560
Let's get a female perspective, what do you think?

968
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,080
Saying "doesn't stink" doesn't necessarily mean "love"
-That's right

969
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:34,010
For a woman to be able to say "it stinks" could also be a form of love

970
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:36,650
But Richi is a fake though, right?

971
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,980
Do you think so?
-I think so

972
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,900
But Hamada can also guess wrong

973
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,810
I didn't guess it at all!

974
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,920
Following Hamada's bets is a sure-fire way to lose

975
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,920
