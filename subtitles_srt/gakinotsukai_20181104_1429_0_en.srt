1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,850
On tonight's Gaki no Tsukai!

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,290
The conclusion to places we have never been before top 3 recommendations!!

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:13,030
They gathered up all the train stations in the Kanto area and put them in a raffle draw...

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,260
They will go to a place they have never been before
and ask the locals what the top 3 recommendations are

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,400
The place Endo chose was...

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,200
Where's that?!
- Nagata?

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,070
Nagata

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,510
Oamishirasato, Chiba prefecture, they arrive at the JR Nagata station

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,780
They ask around the station are for recommendation number 3

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,650
There isn't anything good around here...

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,990
Tell us where you always hang out

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,160
There really is nothing huh

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,970
Asking the locals is a tough call it seems

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,710
Wait a sec, isn't this number 1??
- No!

15
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,950
Then finally...

16
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,350
There is a Nagata Drive in

17
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,350
Drive in?

18
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,490
They found the 3rd best recommendation

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,460
In business for 60 years, the Nagata drive in boats a plethora of fresh fish

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,530
A wonderful feast from the sea!

21
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,470
Then after asking the customers what a number 2 would be

22
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,670
It's called Arare chan's house

23
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,280
They bake and sell direct

24
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,810
They make way to Arare chan's house!

25
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,820
Endo, haven't you been drinking?

26
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,420
No I haven't!

27
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:53,160
That took us through last weeks episode
But can they finish the rankings today?!

29
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,540
They arrive at Arare chan's house!

30
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,410
This is Arare chan's house... Right?
- It's a factory

31
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,480
It's completely different to what I imagined

32
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,980
We're here!

33
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,290
You can just buy products as normal here?
- So it seems

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,820
Oh! Look

35
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,390
It's a goat!

36
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
They have some goats

37
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,670
You took them by surprise with that

38
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,410
They're like, "some weirdos are here"

39
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,680
Good afternoon~
- 'Ello

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,340
Don't say 'Ello

41
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:50,950
(TL;Uncha (Uncha-Baicha Hey-Bye) was a phrase popularized by the
young female character from the Dr.Slump manga Arare-chan,
Matsumoto is word playing the situation and the company name

42
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,780
Arare chan!

43
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,120
There is some story to this train right

44
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,260
But... it's actually quite busy in there

45
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,960
It says factory shop here

46
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,200
There is loads of people here

47
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,840
The factory shop that sells direct, Arare chan's house

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,410
They sell over 200 different types of Senbei
rice crackers that are made in the factory

49
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:25,620
As the producer, they are able to sell at a discount
price, making it a popular spot for all the locals!

50
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,760
Wow that soft cream is cheap!
- 50 yen! (.50c/35p)

51
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,260
50 yen! (.50c/35p)

52
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,230
Wow check this out!

53
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,970
There is so many!
- It's so cheap!

54
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,940
Hm? Hamada-san

55
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,940
I found something great here
- What??

56
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Look look!!!

57
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,550
It says "I'm here~"
- It's Natsumi (Hamada's wife)

58
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,950
She was on Chakkari TV

59
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,590
A TV show you watch in secret when the husband isn't home...

60
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm pretty sure you'll get found out like this

61
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,630
They have some tasting samples

62
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,270
"Lucky Mayonnaise"

63
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,370
How is it?

64
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,840
Delicious!

65
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,910
Wow the mayo flavor is great!

66
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,450
And so Yamasaki orders the 50 Yen soft cream

67
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,850
How many? 5?

68
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,290
We don't need 5...
- 2 will be fine thanks

69
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,830
2 for 100 yen!

70
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,200
Thank you

71
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,640
Just 50 Yen

72
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,240
Sure is cheap for something this nice!

73
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,780
How cute!

74
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,880
We should have got one each

75
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,310
Shall I get another 3?

76
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,350
- I really recommend this

77
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,220
He is really into sweet things

78
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
It's great!

79
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,560
Wow it's great!
- So milky

80
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,930
Is the milk local?

81
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,570
No.

82
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,970
She was straight out with it!

83
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,310
It's really great tasting

84
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,610
I wonder how many years it's been here

85
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,020
I'm glad we could show it as we came all the way here

86
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,550
- How many years has this been here?

87
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,160
About 13 years now

88
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,390
What's the story with the train?

89
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,660
We made rice cracker for the Izumi train line

90
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,030
And the boss got it as a gift from them

91
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,200
It's the break room, go and check it out!

92
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,640
You use it for breaks?

93
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,140
Do you make all the snacks here?

94
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,140
We make all the rice crackers here

95
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,140
Wow you make them all here!

96
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,950
There is hundreds of varieties

97
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,350
You make and sell direct so that`s why they're cheap huh

98
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,360
Also out the from of the shop...

99
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,220
Free coffee!

100
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,990
- Get me a hot please

101
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,030
Isn't it amazing that it's free?

102
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,300
- Hamada what can I get you?
- I'm fine thank you

103
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,170
Hot coffee please

104
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,310
You started drinking coffee? You always drank tea

105
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,240
My tummy has got stronger recently...

106
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,480
What sort of shit reasoning is that

107
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,950
It got tough when you hit 50 huh

108
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,090
I'm glad you're able to drink coffee now!

109
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:49,890
Then!

110
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,890
The company president is here

111
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,360
Eh?! You're the president?

112
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,000
Your wife always comes here to buy...

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,100
We see her picture in the shop

114
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,600
She always buys these (Kaki no Tani)
We only sell them here

115
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,240
I'd like to give you them as a gift

116
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,510
Natsumi-san always buys them?

117
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,750
You definitely eat them!

118
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,080
- He's eaten them for sure

119
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,090
Thank you so much

120
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,390
He's not going home though.

121
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,790
I AM going home

122
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,990
Thank you

123
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,900
Yeah, you really shouldn't say 'See ya~

124
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:45,840
(TL;Baicha/Uncha Baicha (Hey-Bye) was a phrase popularized by the
young female character from the 1986 Dr. Slump manga Arare chan,
Matsumoto is wordplaying the situation and the company name)

125
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,210
Baicha!~
- Baicha!

126
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,520
A place where you can buy direct from the maker, Arare chan's house

127
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,220
Popular with the locals, this gets the number 2 official recommendation!

128
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,330
So we ask around to find the number 1 recommendation

129
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,830
Ask the president!

130
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,660
Yeah lets ask

131
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,470
'Ello!

132
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,000
The smallest voice came out

133
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:19,010
We have been looking around the area since we arrived at the station

134
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,120
We have spoken to lot's of people about
that the best places in this town are

135
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,420
Have you been here? The Nagata Drive in?
- Yes of course

136
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,190
It has a great atmosphere! And delicious

137
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,090
That was number 3

138
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,430
Then we have your company Arare chan's as number 2

139
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,560
So we are pondering over number 1, what would you recommend?

140
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,470
We want to go to somewhere you recommend

141
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Around here?

142
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,810
By the way, why are they goats over there?

143
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,550
They belong to one of our staff...

144
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,450
Really they are one of our staffs pets

145
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,590
The staff keep them...

146
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,730
So we don't have to cut the grass we keep them here

147
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,260
See ya!

148
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,070
You can't say that!

149
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,340
Number 1?

150
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,640
A place with nice scenery or atmosphere

151
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,540
A place with a nice feel or something

152
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,210
We are pretty close to the sea here

153
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,480
It's just down there

154
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,620
Kujukuri beach is probably the best

155
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,250
Probably just in time for the sunset

156
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,460
We might not be able to stay that late...

157
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,960
Well it's kinda nice...

158
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,030
You have been flustered this whole time

159
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,370
Shall we check it out then

160
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,910
A place more hype than Arare

161
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,410
We should go there

162
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,110
I like it there!

163
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,610
Thank you today

164
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:10,590
Before heading to the beach they check out the break room train

165
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,990
Wow it's so retro

166
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,630
I can faintly hear something...

167
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,100
It's Ootaki Eiichi playing

168
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,140
It really is!

169
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,580
This is the Siberia rail road song

170
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:39,650
It's sure is nostalgic but... Can't we turn it off

171
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,390
- Let's listen to it

172
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,390
- Why would you want to turn it off

173
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,460
We don't need it playing on the show I thought

174
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,530
(Staff) Are we going to the beach?

175
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,800
Kujukuri huh...
- We should go for a wander there

176
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,940
We should really drop something big for the finale

177
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,140
What's with the youth of today.

178
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,780
Just tell me what is with the youth of today!!

179
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,080
He is sensitive to that kind of thing

180
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,850
He was so quick to look away in disgust

181
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,120
They make the way to Kujukuri beach by car

182
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,530
The 5 of them exchange thoughts over the song in the train

183
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,230
What was that song...

184
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,470
Siberia rail road

185
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,670
Really?

186
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,170
Sorry Matsumoto-san, that is for real

187
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,840
- Really???

188
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,410
I know I have lied a lot up to now...

189
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,980
You're a liar!!

190
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,010
You're making me gag

191
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,010
- Really?

192
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,550
Ootaki Eiichi the Siberian rail road

193
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,320
(Staff in the back) The title is Goodbye, Siberian rail road

194
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,290
Half a lie then

195
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,290
You didn't have the "Goodbye" part

196
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,590
- That's why it's a bit...

197
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,100
I didn't specifically say it...

198
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,130
Ku~ju~kuri~ beach~♪

199
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,240
Who sang that?

200
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,770
What was the name

201
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,340
Mi-Ke?

202
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,780
(Staff in the back) The title was I remember kujukuri beach

203
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,690
And so let's listen to the song

204
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,930
It was quite the seller right?

205
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,900
I have heard this before

206
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,370
Yeah?

207
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,300
Sure takes me back

208
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,470
Was you already grown up then?

209
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,300
Around middle school?

210
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,940
How do you not know that Endo

211
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,210
What era of Kamen Rider was popular when you was that age?

212
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,210
v3 or...

213
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,180
No, no, V3 was my generation

214
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,180
That's mine

215
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
I was gen V3

216
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,020
Really?
- Yeah

217
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,130
Was you into Kamen Rider back then Endo?

218
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,830
Not really no
- I thought so much

219
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,700
All I did was play baseball as a school kid

220
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,070
The coach used to scream at ya all the time back then?

221
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,840
They used to chant "The pitcher is scared" and that

222
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,040
That used to really mess me up mentally

223
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,050
2nd base is in a rut!!

224
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,320
It was a real head fuck, it wasn't good for kids

225
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,150
What was it like?

226
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,550
The pitcher is scared~ hey hey hey

227
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,960
The catcher is scared~ hey hey hey

228
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,130
First base is scared too! hey hey hey

229
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,500
They said to every position

230
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,900
But they said the batter is scared too right?
- Yeah

231
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,770
If they said that then the opponent would get scared too

232
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,380
Just stop!

233
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,720
I wanna see the beach

234
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,320
Have you been here before?

235
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,190
I think so!

236
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,190
You're just parroting

237
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,030
It sound familiar to me

238
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,590
The wording and feeling

239
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,260
It's embarrassing to hear that

240
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,300
I think the sand is a little shade of black

241
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,040
Is it a cove like beach?
- It is

242
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,250
'Cove like?

243
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,620
Cove like doesn't just mean individual coves

244
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,360
Yes, it does have a cove

245
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,790
What's with this conversation, it's almost educational

246
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,900
But we don't have any God's with us this time though huh

247
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,600
(Previous episode "Gods")

248
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,300
I wanted to search for a God but...

249
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,740
We just found them last time

250
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,040
Ougon-sama was something else huh

251
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,080
Well, everyone had a full set of teeth this time round

252
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,620
A rare situation for everyone to have teeth

253
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,090
It seems that no teeth means you're a God

254
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,360
Those pieces of high value worth have been pulled out

255
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,670
And so the 5 of them arrive at the beach

256
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,540
We're here

257
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,380
Look at how nice the sand is

258
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,780
Is he surfing?

259
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,880
He's out there alone

260
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,750
Is it Honkon-san?

261
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,220
That would be funny as heck if it was

262
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,730
Imagine if it was him

263
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,390
It would be a miracle if it was Honkon-san

264
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,830
We're finally here

265
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,000
Wow it's great for surfing
- There is no one here!

266
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,210
Wow look at this place

267
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,410
It's vast down here

268
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,150
It's so beautiful

269
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,580
It feels so refreshing

270
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:51,360
Summer would be great here
- Those houses are right on the seafront

271
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,060
Whenever I'm at the beach with Hamada,
I can't help but think about HamadaJuku

272
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:59,000
Youtube v=6yQOgK-Uh6E

273
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,430
You can sing it now if you want... Quickly

274
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,100
Instant! HamadaJuku

275
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,440
The switch has been turned

276
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,740
It was nothing but a display of power harassment

277
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:16,450
It was just pure powerplay. The whole thing

278
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,520
I can see right to the horizon!

279
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,120
Right Tanaka!!

280
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,830
Nobody replied at all

281
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:39,140
Kujukuri beach, at 66km long it's the second longest sandy beach in Japan

282
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:46,040
It's very popular beach spot in the summer for all!

283
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,120
It's rare to see a beach this long

284
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,550
It's a shame Honkon wasn't here

285
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,460
Unfortunate

286
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,130
HONKON~~~~~~~~!!

287
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,030
It's worrying when there is on warning like that

288
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,510
What are yu duuing

289
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:34,290
Today, look, really, I have, everyone in the world has this problem

290
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,300
But I have finally solved it

291
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,070
It's another deep topic?

292
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,070
It's been going on forever now

293
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:47,010
"What's a vegetable and what's a fruit"

294
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,140
That discussion

295
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,140
Everyone has a different opinion on it

296
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,780
But I have finally got the solution to it

297
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,080
Whad do you think?
What classes a vegetable, what's a fruit

298
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,520
I can just say it now with full confidence

299
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,960
- Seriously

300
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,930
Like, where do you draw the line?
- What line?

301
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,100
People often say...

302
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,100
Fruits grown on a tree

303
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,140
And vegetable grow from the ground

304
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,610
But if that's the case, then what about strawberries and melon?

305
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,650
They're like...

306
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,120
Okay, well sweet things are fruit then

307
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,760
Then if it's not really sweet then it's a vegetable

308
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,200
But then how do you decide the level of how sweet is sweet

309
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:51,300
But you know what I say to anyone trying to give me that sweet talk?
- You're a fruit too!

310
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,040
That can't be helped, it's just natural

311
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,640
But you don't actually say it right
- No, no

312
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,610
You'd look stupid if you did
- Exactly...

313
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,380
Well what about you?

314
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,050
you just can't decide decisively right?

315
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,660
You can look it up on the internet and
there is all arguments for and against

316
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:19,160
It goes on and on, round and round, there is no consistency

317
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,600
Can we decide this for good?
- Please do

318
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,670
Right after this break!

319
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,140
After the break

320
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,410
It's still too soon since we began

321
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,240
I have really got the answer

322
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,180
The answer is really so simple

323
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,880
CAN IT GO WITH MAYONNAISE??

324
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,750
Can you or can you not eat it with mayonnaise

325
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,090
CAN IT GO WITH MAYONNAISE??
- Man you're noisy.

326
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,800
It's decided.

327
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,700
It's my flawless victory. 100% undoubtedly decided.

328
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,600
CAN IT GO WITH MAYONNAISE??
- You're too damn noisy!

329
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,040
IF YOU CAN EAT IT WITH MAYONNAISE THEN IT'S A VEGETABLE

330
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,740
IF YOU CAN'T THEN IT'S A FRUIT

331
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,310
No one has ever said or noticed this before.

332
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:11,380
Of course no one has ever said that...

333
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,960
Am I the only one that realized

334
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,590
No, because I've never eaten fruits with mayonnaise!

335
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,030
But there is one problem
- What's that?

336
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,300
Hurry up and say it

337
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,710
There is just one damn thing that keeps coming up in this discussion

338
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,850
It`s the fruit tomato paradox

339
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,920
When someone brings it up it`s like... Ah.

340
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,990
What`s with this final boss

341
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,890
But in the end, tomato can go with mayonnaise right

342
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,530
You have to say it doesn't go with it out of spite, so it can go with mayo

343
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,800
I see.

344
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,270
I see?!

345
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,840
You see?!

346
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,150
That's how it's gonna end then! That's your finisher

347
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:18,820
I know it's an extreme example, but take squid. It can go with mayo right

348
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,490
You can put mayo on squid and eat it right

349
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,930
It's extreme, but I think it's okay to call it a vegetable.

350
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,530
Because fundamentally, if it goes with mayo it's a vegetable. Absolutely

351
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,400
If you ever have a doubt about it,
The only way to decide is if it goes with mayo or not

352
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,940
Ok...

353
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,250
Get it? You understand right?

354
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,250
If you put it like that then

355
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,150
With that, this debate is concluded I believe.

356
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,460
Well, squid isn't a vegetable though.

357
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,630
But on the subject of squid though, I think it's a killing machine

358
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,200
What? What's with this now

359
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,700
You know when you grill squid and then open up the foil

360
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
You have that little brown line on top

361
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,440
The brown part of the skin

362
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,940
It's like Romeo reaching out to grab Juliet

363
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,850
But he can't reach

364
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,350
Half of the squid is in you already but

365
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,790
That's the moment it dies

366
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,220
Just then when it's like

367
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,260
Romeo is here but Juliet is already inside

368
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,070
That is just cold blooded murder!
Watch out for the squid, it's fearful

369
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
Is that so...
