1
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,520
Seven-colored dusk descended

2
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,560
The wind is somewhat cool

3
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,800
Saturday night is lively

4
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:48,410
Even a gloomy feeling is soon cleared up

5
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,680
And everyone is getting excited

6
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,490
Let's go DOWN TOWN

7
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,190
Let's go DOWN TOWN

8
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,130
Let's go DOWN TOWN

9
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,530
Hello.

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,600
It's amazing.

11
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,210
It's amazing.
It's packed.

12
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,850
Even the front rows are packed.
We've got people sitting all the way to the front row.

13
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,190
But you guys are looking forward to Shimashimans after us, right?

14
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,090
Shimashimans is the last performer.

15
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,130
-  I didn't know that.
- I thought you guys were waiting for them.

16
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,160
This is tough!

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,870
Hamada-san is very excited at times like this.

18
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,570
You guys know that, don't you?

19
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,940
- No.
- We all have those energetic annoying uncles right?

20
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:01,920
Suppose you go out for dinner with your relatives and get harassed by a thug.
And when that happens, your uncle is surprisingly not doing anything about it.

21
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,520
You are that kind of person.

22
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,350
- I'm not that guy.
- I am very lazy to do this.

23
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,520
This is hard to do.

24
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,930
Incredibly many juniors are watching us at the side of the stage.

25
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,200
It doesn't matter.

26
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,240
We were told to do something here.

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,770
But I'm a legendary comedian.

28
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,510
And I'm charismatic.

29
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,920
This is tough.

30
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,450
I can't get rid of my charisma by taking a bath.

31
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,790
I want to get rid of my charisma.

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,790
That sounds like a tough.

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,230
Yeah.

34
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,070
- They said to do it, so let's do it.
- Yeah, we don't have a choice.

35
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,740
- What was that like again?
- What are you talking about?

36
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,210
I mean manzai.

37
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,110
Yeah.

38
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,720
We haven't done that for decades.

39
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,560
Yes, and Hamada-san said that we only do manzai for money.

40
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,690
No, you said that!

41
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,930
I don't think that's a good idea.
But you got rich.

42
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,860
I see, you say that.

43
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,800
- I see.
- That's not what I meant.

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,740
Do it properly.

45
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,710
I was worried you were not going to do this because you're rich.

46
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,380
You have more money than me!

47
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,710
That's absolutely not true!!

48
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,120
- What are you talking about!?
- That's not true!

49
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,090
You DEFINITELY have more money than me!

50
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,290
You're scaring me!

51
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,190
Heeey!

52
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,360
Everyone come out!!

53
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,570
- What did we do in our manzai?
- We did a lot of things.

54
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:58,800
Audience: Kidnapping one!

55
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,070
Oh, yeah.

56
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,770
Who the hell are you!?

57
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,280
Sorry.
He is this kind of person.

58
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,810
He often shit talks everytime.

59
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,190
We've done kidnapping one and doctor one.

60
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,120
Audience: Researchers one!

61
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,220
Yeah, that's right.

62
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,620
So who the hell are you!?

63
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,890
If you do that twice, you're persistent.

64
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,900
Ah, we also did ghost one.

65
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,670
- Oh, the ghost one?
- Yeah.

66
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,870
And the quiz one.

67
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:45,410
How about a quiz once in a while, just to warm up?

68
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,250
Let's do a quiz.

69
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:59,290
- What should I do?
- Well, let's do a quiz to warm up. Then give me a common quiz.

70
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,030
You want me to do it?

71
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,470
It can't be helped.
We are a duo.

72
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,040
If we were a trio and Yanagida-kun was here, I would have asked him to do it.
But there is no Yanagida-kun.

73
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,910
There is only Matsumoto and Hamada.
It can't be helped.

74
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,480
I'll give you a common quiz.
Hmm...

75
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,050
- Whatever.
- Really?

76
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,520
How many meters is Tokyo Tower?

77
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,360
How many meters is that?

78
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,200
How many meters is that?

79
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,800
"How many meters?"
Hey, this is a quiz.

80
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,270
So how many meters is that?

81
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,600
I give you the quiz and I have to give you the answers?

82
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,870
It doesn't matter.

83
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,240
No, it's not.

84
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,410
I'm scared of you.
What's wrong?

85
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,410
It happens all the time.

86
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,650
You asked me to give you a quiz, so I gave you one.

87
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,120
And why are you asking me to answer?

88
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,020
Hey, it happens all the time.

89
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,560
I'm scared of you.

90
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,690
Okay, so I'm supposed to give you the answer?

91
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,030
Yes...

92
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,900
You don't know the answer?

93
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,370
For that matter, what is the answer?

94
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,840
It's 333 meters.

95
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,510
Huh?

96
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,280
Hey.

97
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,020
What's wrong?

98
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,450
This is pretty tough.

99
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,990
What do you mean, "this is tough"?

100
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,790
This is more than tough, it's heartbreaking

101
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,790
Heartbreaking!?

102
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,830
This can't be heartbreaking !

103
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,430
I just asked a question and gave the answer.

104
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,100
We came all the way to NGK(Namba Grand kagetsu) today.

105
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,980
- That's why I don't want to fight with you.
- Fight!?

106
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,750
Why should we fight?

107
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,680
We are graduates of NSC.

108
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,920
We are the first generation of New Star Creation.

109
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,620
We should not be fighting at NGK.
All right, that's enough, Okay.

110
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,560
Hey, what's okay?

111
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,090
I gave you the answer.

112
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,260
Yeah, I know that.

113
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,600
I don't understand what you mean by this.

114
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,370
Anyway, the Tokyo Tower is 333 meters tall.

115
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,870
Well, I'll tell you this.

116
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,080
It's not that tall.

117
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,180
Eh?

118
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,050
What do you mean?

119
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,750
It's not that tall.
Sorry.

120
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,020
Why are you apologizing?
No, no, no.

121
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,290
- Thank you so much.
- What are you talking about!?

122
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,800
I'll send flowers to your dressing room.

123
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,900
I'm so sorry.

124
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,100
The answer is 333 meters.

125
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,210
What do you mean, "it's not that tall"?

126
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,910
I said that because it's not that tall.

127
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,510
Eh?

128
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,280
I said that because it's 333 meters tall.

129
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,620
No, it's not.

130
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,220
No, it is 333 meters!

131
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:18,030
I might embarrass you because I said this.
Can I say this?

132
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,890
Go ahead.

133
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:25,830
I lived by the Tokyo Tower for a long time.

134
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,170
- I lived there for two years and renewed my lease.
- You renewed yours?

135
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:38,250
So I lived there for two years and a half.
When I woke up in the morning and looked out the window, I could see Tokyo Tower.

136
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,520
- Was it that close?
- I used to look at Tokyo Tower from my window every day.

137
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,890
Okay.

138
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,020
- There were days when the windows were covered with lace curtains.
- I don't care about that.

139
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,120
But even if there were lace curtains on the windows, I could still see it!

140
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:56,060
Even if the lace curtains was only slightly open, I could see it from there.
So I could see it almost every day.

141
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,670
so I say that it's not that tall.

142
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,440
That's all!

143
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,610
- Sorry. I'm so sorry!
- No, no, no.

144
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,010
- Does your stomach hurt?
- I'm fine!

145
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,510
Hamada.

146
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,580
Oh, his name is Hamada.

147
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,550
He's playing a rough character.
I wish you could at least remember his name and face.

148
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,660
Shut up!

149
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,060
How do you know it's not 333 meters long just by looking at it?

150
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,400
I know that!

151
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,100
I know that, Hamada!

152
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,340
No, it's officially stated to be 333 meters tall.

153
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,280
- That's 333 meters tall.
- No, it's not that tall.

154
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,010
I saw it, and I'm telling you, I'm absolutely right.

155
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,780
But you only looked at it!!

156
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,250
What you see is all there is.

157
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,390
What are you saying?

158
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,560
No, what are YOU saying?

159
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,360
- You're scaring me.
- Okay, how tall do you think it is?

160
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,190
I don't know!

161
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,260
I don't know that.

162
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,200
But it's not 333 meters tall.

163
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,170
It happens all the time.

164
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,800
You don't need to know the right answer to know that someone is wrong.

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,010
For example, suppose someone suddenly says, "Hello," and you reply, "Hello,".

166
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,010
But it is obvious that person is not Shoei.

167
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,120
That's what I mean.

168
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,190
What is this guy talking about?

169
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,690
It happens all the time.

170
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,960
And he is an elementary school student.

171
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,870
What do you mean?

172
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,940
I'm so fed up, I want to go home!

173
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,040
It happens all the time, right?

174
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,580
You don't need to know the right answer to know that someone is wrong.

175
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,380
But you only looked at it, right?

176
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,190
This is tough.
What's wrong with you?

177
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,320
Are you nervous!?

178
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,690
How could I be nervous!?

179
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,930
Are you nervous about the live viewing?

180
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,030
If so, let me know.

181
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,170
If so, let's take it slow.
Let's do it so you don't get nervous!

182
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,310
I really don't want you to be nervous.

183
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:25,910
we're getting nowhere with this.

184
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,050
Personally I don't want to get anywhere.

185
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,220
What's wrong?

186
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,720
So how tall do you think it is?
Just tell me that.

187
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,290
It is officially 333 meters.

188
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:46,030
You said you didn't know the right answer.
But if you saw it every day, how many meters would you guess?

189
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,040
200...

190
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,370
200?

191
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,110
More than 200.

192
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,710
"More than"?

193
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,380
"More than 200"?

194
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,150
This is the kind of symbol.
(200～)

195
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:11,490
There is a chance that your 333 meters is correct, too!
After all, that's MORE THAN 200!

196
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,690
So I'm sorry if you were right!

197
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,530
That's what I'm saying.

198
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,830
But really, that thing is 333 meters tall.

199
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,110
- But...
- 200 KARA (More than 200)?
"KARA"(more than)?

200
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,980
You know how they say,
"Yakyu - wa - 2 out - YAKARA".
(Because baseball is two outs)

201
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,110
"Yakyu - wa - 2 out - YAKARA".
(Because baseball is two outs)

202
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,180
No, no, no...

203
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,920
"Yakyu - wa - 2 out - YAKARA".
(Because baseball is two outs)

204
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,950
Wait a second.

205
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:45,660
- Baseball starts...
- Once, in a public bath, an older man was watching TV and said, "Yakyu - wa - 2 out - YAKARA".

206
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,960
- No, no, no...
- "Go for it! The game is about to begin!"

207
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,230
It's
"Yakyu - wa - 2 out - KARAYAKARA."
(Baseball starts with 2 outs.)

208
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,440
No, It's "Yakyu - wa - 2 out - YAKARA".
(Because  baseball is two outs)

209
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,180
"Daijoubu - ya! Yakyu - wa - 2 out - KARAYAKARA", right?
(Don't worry! Baseball starts with 2 outs.)

210
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,080
Too much KARA.

211
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,320
- That's kind of too long.
- I don't know what to say...

212
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,820
Forget it, it doesn't matter.

213
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,960
Weren't you the one who brought it up?!!!

214
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,630
It doesn't matter.
"NGK YAKARA".
(Because this is NGK.)

215
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,060
You don't have to say that.

216
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,170
That' s enough.

217
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,970
- It's okay.
- What's okay?

218
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,580
- Wait a moment.
- What?

219
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,940
Are you still going to do this?

220
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,850
Of course.

221
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,650
My heart is pounding

222
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,580
- That's why you're nervous, right?
- No, I'm not!

223
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,160
It's because you didn't talk with me.

224
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,560
It's tiresome to have a meeting, isn't it?

225
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,870
I'm worried about what you're going to say.

226
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,400
Maybe so, but we're doing this now, so why not?

227
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,010
- You're a great guy.
- You're the only one having fun.

228
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,740
For a middle-aged man, you're doing great.

229
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,280
- Is that so?
- Yes.

230
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,750
So I think you're good.

231
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,460
- Okay. So do you know how tall Mt. Fuji?
- Are you going to continue this?

232
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,360
Do you know how tall Mt. Fuji?

233
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,230
Do you know how tall Mt. Fuji?

234
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,700
Everybody knows how tall Mt. Fuji.

235
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,830
Then how tall?

236
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:38,140
3,77...

237
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,780
(5? 6?)

238
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,310
About 3,776.

239
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,550
- 3,776 meters?
- Yes.

240
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,820
That's for....real!

241
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,860
That's for real!

242
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,270
Hey, why couldn't you guess the height of Tokyo Tower?

243
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,970
It's not like that.
I saw it from a distance on the  bullet tarain.

244
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,270
You wouldn't know the height just from this!!

245
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,170
I saw it from a distance and that's how I knew how tall it is!

246
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,480
It was a great spectacle!

247
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,950
I've never climbed Mt. Fuji, but even if I had, I wouldn't know how tall it was.

248
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,760
The Rainbow Bridge is beautiful, but you would never know it by crossing it.

249
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,730
I understand that.

250
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,200
- Disneyland is not something you see from a distance, but you don't know how fun it is until you go there.
- That's enough!

251
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,830
Why are you laughing?

252
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,600
- What do you want?
- That's my line.

253
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,400
What?

254
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,070
It's hard to say.

255
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:54,050
I don't mind if I end up with this.
But this is why you get angry when you get home.

256
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,520
What the hell is that?

257
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,450
It's better to solve that right now. This is why you always get angry when you get home.

258
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,320
I want to eliminate uneasiness here.

259
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,030
No, I won't get angry later.

260
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,560
I don't want to make you feel bad.

261
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,500
You might be offended if I tell you this.
You are not the type to give quizzes?

262
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,970
Of course!!

263
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,210
You've been quizzing me all along, so you should be the one quizzing me today.

264
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,780
You only told me, "Think of one or two common quizzes."

265
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,810
"So that's it!?", I thought.

266
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,650
Hey.

267
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,220
And you keep talking about whatever comes to your mind!

268
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,060
It's okay if I'm a grown man like that.

269
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,330
Yeah, I get it.

270
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,370
Come on.

271
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,870
Give me a quiz.

272
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,340
Okay, you're not the quizzing type.

273
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,980
There are three types of people: those who give quizzes, those who don't give quizzes,

274
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,720
and those who don't use comforters.

275
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,990
- Was that funny?
- No.

276
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,760
Okay.

277
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,300
- Then let's do it.
- Hey, are you still going to continue this!?

278
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,270
Hey, why do you want to go home?

279
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,240
What do you have to do?

280
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,370
What are you going to say?

281
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,740
I'll give you a quiz, right?

282
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,010
That's what you want to do, right?

283
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,780
Well, I'm doing it because I have to do this.

284
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,750
Then give me a decent quiz.

285
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,530
You know Munch's Scream?

286
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,230
You know that?

287
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,360
Yeah, It's a picture of a man with his mouth wide open, right?

288
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,200
That's Munch himself.

289
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:03,110
- You think Munch is screaming because he has his mouth open.
- Yes.

290
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,650
But if you look closely at the painting, you will see that Munch is covering his ears with his hands.

291
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,880
But it's titled "Scream," right?

292
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,990
He is covering his ears because someone is screamng too loudly.

293
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:24,500
It is not "Munch's scream," but really "Munch is being screamed at."

294
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,400
What are you talking about?

295
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,170
So the answer is "Munch is being shouted at."

296
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,040
Answer!?

297
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,380
You didn't quiz me yet.

298
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,050
You didn't quiz me.

299
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,550
You were just talking to yourself.

300
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,990
You have to read the room!
You have to read between the lines!

301
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,820
This is that kind of quiz.

302
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,260
That's what this is!

303
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,400
When I say, "He is covering his ears..." answer "Munch is being screamed at"!!

304
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,440
- This is that kind of quiz.
- I can't.

305
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,000
This is a new type of quiz.

306
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,670
New types are hard.

307
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,240
So sorry.

308
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,980
(*The sound of an incorrect answer)

309
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,050
So sorry.

310
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,390
That's enough.
You still want to continue?

311
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,290
- Do you know what a bullet train's bar is?
- What bar are you talking about?

312
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,560
Right?

313
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,530
I said, bullet train's bar!!

314
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,930
So, where's the bar you're talking about?

315
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,130
I don't know if you said that.

316
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,170
I'll explain it to you now!!

317
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,440
Then tell me quickly!!

318
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,010
What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?

319
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,280
- No, I'm not.
- Is it a hormonal problem?

320
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,340
What the hell!

321
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,510
- Something wrong with your hormones?
- No, no, no.

322
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,610
- Are you not feeling well?
- I'm feeling fine.

323
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,550
- Are all your teeth hurting?
- No.

324
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,020
Are all your teeth hurting?

325
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,050
I didn't say anything.

326
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,560
I didn't say my teeth hurt.

327
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,330
Are all your teeth hurting?

328
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,930
If so, you should go home.

329
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,860
You seem to be having fun.

330
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,000
No, I'm not.

331
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:21,250
- It's the bar that you can grab in the men's restroom of the bullet train.
- Yeah, I know what that is.

332
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,950
That bar.

333
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,720
- You were talking about that bar.
- Yes.

334
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,660
I think that bar is the dirtiest bar in the world.

335
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:41,700
Because everyone grabs it with the hand that touched their dick.

336
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,510
There might be pee on their hands when the train arrived at Mikawa-Anjo station.

337
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,480
They will be grabbing that bar with their hands.

338
00:20:54,350 --> 00:21:00,790
If I grabbed that bar, I wouldn't want to put my dick in my pants with my hand.

339
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,230
That bar is even dirtier than dick.

340
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,130
That's how dirty I think it is.

341
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,670
I asked others if they would grab that bar.

342
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,870
They all said, "I never touch that stick because it's dirty."
Nobody touches that bar.

343
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,740
I mean, it's the cleanest bar in the world.

344
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,580
Give me a quiz!

345
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,150
I did!!

346
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,920
Ding dong!
"That's the cleanest stick!"

347
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,960
Of course it is!

348
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,530
Read the room!!

349
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,700
Are you nuts!?

350
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,470
Enough with the nervousness!!

351
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,570
- That's hard.
- No, it's not hard at all.

352
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,840
No, it's very hard for me.

353
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,410
Are you a fake-Hamada?

354
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,720
Give me a break.

355
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,590
If you want to give me a quiz, give me a decent quiz.

356
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,190
- Well...
- Hey, has the quiz started yet?

357
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,630
Tell me!

358
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,800
- There was a cafe.
- Is that a quiz?

359
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:25,240
- There used to be  a cafe called Rika in the neighborhood of Nippon TV in Kojimachi.
- Is that a quiz?

360
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,710
Cafe Rika.

361
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:35,180
When I was looking at the Cafe RIKA(りか) signboard, I couldn't let my guard down while I was watching RI(リ).

362
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,020
As long as I am only looking at RI(リ).

363
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,160
I can't let my guard down until I see KA(カ).

364
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:51,500
If there is a curve with KA(か), RI(り) is hiragana!

365
00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:00,910
But if there is no curve with KA(カ), it is katakana.
So you can't let your guard down!

366
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,010
Right?

367
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,090
You could say the same for both
Aichi(愛知)  and  Ehime(愛媛).

368
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,390
You can't determine which is which by the first letter

369
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:23,060
In other words, things should not be determined by the upper half of the body alone.

370
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,270
If an older man was in the bathtub, you still don't kno w if he is an older man or not.

371
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,770
If he stood up, he might be a centaur.

372
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:38,650
So don't determine things only by the upper half of their body!
I would say don't determine things based on the first half alone!

373
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,980
Wait!!

374
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,420
What's the answer?

375
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,960
- "Don't determine only by the first half."
- Weren't we just talking about Rika?

376
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,060
Cafe Rika.

377
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,170
Ding dong!
"Don't determine only by the first half!"

378
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,400
You were supposed to get 2 points for this.

379
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,700
I've never heard of points before.

380
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,680
Weren't we just talking about cafes?

381
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,140
What do you want?

382
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,180
- Eh?
- What do you want?

383
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,410
That's my line.
What do YOU want?

384
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,080
(Are you crazy?)

385
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,660
If anything, I'm on a roll today.

386
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,360
- Is that so?
- Yes.

387
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,660
It's hard.

388
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,030
It's better to solve that right now. This is why you get angry when you go home.

389
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:36,470
You keep saying that, but I won't get angry later.

390
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,080
I'm worried that you'll get angry later.

391
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,310
- You?
- Yes.

392
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,510
I don't care about that.

393
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,150
All right,

394
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,650
Let's play the quiet-quiet game.

395
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,960
What the hell is that?

396
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,360
So you get points for being quiet.

397
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,070
It's so easy.

398
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,600
What's the right answer?

399
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,010
You get points for being quiet.

400
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,110
I get it.

401
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:22,550
How many home runs did Sadaharu Oh have in his professional baseball career?

402
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,720
868.

403
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,960
Be quiet.

404
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,770
I just told you.
This is a quiet-quiet game.

405
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,940
Be quiet.

406
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,340
- Right?
- Okay.

407
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:49,240
- It's officially the quiet-quiet-quiet game.
- I don't care about that.

408
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,610
- That's what I call it by abbreviation.
- Okay.

409
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,740
What's the question?

410
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,180
Be quiet!!

411
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,350
Are you nuts!?

412
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,720
I told you.

413
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,650
You get points for being quiet.

414
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,620
The points go up like rats reproducing.

415
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,730
If you talk, you'll lose more and more points.

416
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:50,540
Okay, I get it now.

417
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,140
Oh, there's one thing I forgot to tell you.

418
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,740
What?

419
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,180
Don't talk!!

420
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,850
That's not fair.

421
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,020
Don't be such a cheat.

422
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,420
Don't talk.

423
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:26,040
How many liters are in a gallon?

424
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,080
A gallon...?

425
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,440
Don't talk!!

426
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,220
I'm scared.

427
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,050
Can't you concentrate?

428
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,420
Hey.

429
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,590
Is your article going to be in next week's magazine?

430
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,730
If that were the case, I wouldn't be in such a good mood to do this!!

431
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,200
Why are you so set on yourself that it's a scandal?

432
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,610
There is no way they would publish a good article about me in that one!!

433
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,940
You never know.

434
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,180
No way.

435
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,380
- Be quiet.
- All right.

436
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,080
- All you have to do is be quiet.
- I know!!

437
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,320
He's here.

438
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,000
My stomach hurts.

439
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,670
Ow...

440
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,280
Ow ow ow...

441
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,480
Wait a moment.
Ah damn it!

442
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,680
I just shit my pants.

443
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,320
Ow ow ow...I shit my pants.

444
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,020
It's serious.

445
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,030
I absolutely shit my pants.

446
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,830
Huh?

447
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,070
I didn't.

448
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,940
That's enough!!

449
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,840
Don't talk!!

450
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,410
What the hell is that?

451
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,210
Hey.

452
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,010
What the hell is that?

453
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,790
What the hell.

454
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,620
It's my line.

455
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,790
What do you want?

456
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,590
You just say whatever you want.

457
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:32,200
Give me a more clear-cut quiz.

458
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,100
Since we are standing on the stage.

459
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,980
How about a three-choice quiz?

460
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,150
- Three choices?
- Three choices is too hard for you?

461
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,520
- You're going to say something...
- It would be hard with your stamina.

462
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,920
I have stamina!

463
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,120
- You're going to say something crazy to me again, so give me two choices.
- Okay.

464
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,430
- Really?
- Yes.

465
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,330
- So, please.
- Two-choice quiz?

466
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,330
Yes.

467
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,430
Then answer with A or B.

468
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:16,540
My father passed away a few years ago.

469
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:30,390
At that time, who was the comedian who came to my house, offered incense, and sobbed with his hands together in front of the Buddhist altar?

470
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:33,890
A:

471
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,430
Hamada Masatoshi

472
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,130
B:

473
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,500
MASATOSHI HAMADA

474
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,510
It's me .

475
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,720
You finally get the point!

476
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,750
It's me.

477
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,990
You finally get the point.

478
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,020
It's easier to understand than the previous quizzes.

479
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,090
Okay, second question.

480
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,090
Are you still going to do it?

481
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,130
You're thinking of a question now, aren't you?

482
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,770
What is the sound of a bush warbler?

483
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,310
A:

484
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,410
"Ho - Hokekyo"

485
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,310
B:

486
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,610
"Mister...!"

487
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,020
"Mister, thank you so much for everything..!"

488
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,550
Stop that.

489
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,390
"Mister, Mister, thank you so much for everything...!"

490
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,930
Stop that.
What the hell.

491
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,400
The answer is all me.

492
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,800
Third question.

493
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,170
Are you still going to do it?

494
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,840
- That's enough.
- What did Gagarin say when he saw the earth?

495
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,680
- This is a good question, right?
- Yeah.

496
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,180
A:  "The earth is blue."

497
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,650
B:

498
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,120
"Why did you die, Mister!?"

499
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,590
"Mister!"

500
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,320
That's enough!!

501
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,030
Thank you!!

502
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,830
Let's go DOWN TOWN

503
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,560
Let's go DOWN TOWN

504
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,070
Let's go DOWN TOWN
