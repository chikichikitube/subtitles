1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,680
1st Time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,620
"Which Looks Most Like Hamada!? Hamada Photo Contest!!"

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,480
When I entered the studio, without Hamada here it felt so peaceful.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,660
When I entered the studio, without Hamada here it felt so peaceful.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,030
From the moment you enter, you're surrounded by such a gentle atmosphere.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,860
All of the staff are smiling.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,900
I thought it was really nice.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,600
Thank you for mentioning the nice atmosphere during the opening.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,370
This time, we went to a shopping district...

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,310
...and anything that looked like Hamada-san, we took a photo of it.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,200
Well everyone, this is Fuzashikōyama Shopping District.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,710
Find Hamada-san and take a photo.

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,350
Well then everyone, let's go.

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,860
Hamada has taken over the city.

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,460
Hamada has taken over the city.

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,060
More than you think.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,330
It's a little off.

18
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,880
I'm sure there's one here somewhere.

19
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,890
It's subtle.

20
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,490
I thought I had it there.

21
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,900
Pretty much everything looks like Hamada-san.

22
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,010
Like I thought, looking underfoot is the way to go.

23
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,810
Like I thought, looking underfoot is the way to go.

24
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,110
...for Hamada-san.

25
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,530
Ah, a bread shop!

26
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,150
There'll definitely be something here.

27
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,570
It's a little harder than I thought.

28
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,280
I see.

29
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,400
Surely one in there.

30
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,400
Right.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,350
Everyone seems so into this segment.

32
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,910
Ah, how about this?

33
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,060
Eye, eye and nose.

34
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,280
Maybe it looks too much like a monkey?

35
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,450
Ah, you're that drone guy, right?

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,440
Drone guy, huh.

37
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,250
The drone comedian, right?

38
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,250
I'm not a drone comedian.

39
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,820
Give it your best, I'll be watching.

40
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,110
What's with the weird behaviour?

41
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,370
I've kinda got this feeling there's something here.

42
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,700
I've kinda got this feeling there's something here.

43
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,710
How about this?

44
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,400
The mouth's a little rough.

45
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,200
How about that person over there?

46
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,220
I think it looks more like Hōsei-san.

47
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,220
Staff

48
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,480
You think?

49
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,760
It's all about the lips.

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,490
I think getting the mouth is more important than the rest.

51
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,970
If you can clearly see the lips, you'll be able to see Hamada-san.

52
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,030
If you can clearly see the lips, you'll be able to see Hamada-san.

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,510
I think this is...

54
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,650
When he's in Guam, he probably looks something like this.

55
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,620
When he's in Guam, he probably looks something like this.

56
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,150
When he's in Guam, he probably looks something like this.

57
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,990
See the lips here.

58
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,680
This over here.

59
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,000
It's Hamada-san!

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,330
The eyebrows, eyes, lips.

61
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,150
Thanks, it's Hamada-san!

62
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,710
Probably, rather than here...

63
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,540
Probably, rather than here...

64
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,640
...Hamada-san is more likely to appear in the back alleys.

65
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,000
See, look at this.

66
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,000
Look, look, look

67
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,750
It looks just like him

68
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,510
Look, look, look.

69
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,020
Hamada-san always makes this face.

70
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,800
I bet there's more around here.

71
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,900
It's amazing how many Hamadas there are.

72
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,700
It's amazing how many Hamadas there are.

73
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,800
So many Hamadas.

74
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,050
Coming up, we'll see what the six members found, the hidden Hamadas.

76
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,220
We're back from the location shoot. What did you think Matsumoto-san?

77
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,040
"There's so many Hamadas in this town."

78
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,460
They were everywhere.

79
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,660
Of course Hamada-san isn't in the studio.

80
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,060
Yeah, he's not here...

81
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,260
But the company has no idea where he is.

82
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
No way.

83
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,260
Stop it already.

84
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,080
You're making it sound like a weird situation.

85
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,480
At that time, Hamada...

86
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,150
Good morning.

87
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,970
Can I have a moment?

88
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,490
Today, I'd like to see a bunch of Hamada-san's emotions.

89
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,490
Staff

90
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,520
I want to take pictures of your various emotions.

91
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,520
What?

92
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,220
Hamada-san's spectrum of emotions.

93
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,060
It'll be a location shoot.

94
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,050
Eh, just me?

95
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes, let's go right now.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,100
I want to see all of Hamada-san's emotions.

97
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,880
I have no idea what you're talking about.

98
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,740
So everyone...

99
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,550
...we've got a bunch of photos of Hamada-san.

100
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,720
Who wants to start us off?

101
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,620
There's no losing here.

102
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,730
So if you don't mind, have a look at this one.

103
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,550
I think this one looks like Hamada.

104
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,560
Oh, it's Hamada-san!

105
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,130
He looks kind of surprised.

106
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,440
Sort of...

107
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,870
Happy, but also a little bashful Hamada.

108
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:04,180
Happy, but also a little bashful Hamada.

109
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,380
Like when he's been complemented.

110
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,880
When a B-class Gravure idol complements him.

111
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,850
I had to be told what Hamada-san's kind face looks like.

112
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,020
He looked like that after the Deluxe episode.

113
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,990
Hamada-san in a bit of a daze.

114
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,200
This is a little tough to see at first, so I also zoomed in.

115
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,130
Ah, I see.

116
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,910
Is that the mouth?

117
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:39,810
Eye

118
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:39,810
Eyebrow

119
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:39,810
Mouth

120
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,710
There's the mouth, the eyes and eyebrows.

121
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,880
He looks a bit like that when he's just woken up.

122
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,440
Can I show something sort of plain?

123
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,660
There's nothing that special about this.

124
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,420
But it's purely Hamada-san.

125
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,420
You see that face all the time.

126
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,880
That is just plain Hamada.

127
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,260
Isn't it super plain?

128
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,290
When he's calling out "Oi, Oi"!

129
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,560
Let's show off the other plain ones.

130
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,860
Ah, plain, plain.

131
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,620
So plain.

132
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,620
There's just so many plain ones.

133
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,530
Here's a plain drain cover.

134
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,150
I've also got another plain one.

135
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,570
I've also got this one.

136
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,290
That's amazing.

137
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,630
There's so many plain things that look like him.

138
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,640
Does this count as plain?

139
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,910
Is this plain?

140
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,470
This is quite good.

141
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,110
This is quite good.

142
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,750
It's pretty good.

143
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,710
The plain series has been pretty good.

144
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,180
At that time, Hamada...

145
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,380
After this, you can just take it easy.

146
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,000
Where are we heading right now?

147
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,730
I've prepared several locations.

148
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,730
Staff

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,770
Several?!

150
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,860
We'll be going to different places...

151
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,000
...and having fun.

152
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,890
Ah, that's good.

153
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,910
Recently, he's been using an e-cig.

154
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,060
Ah, that's it there?

155
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,060
That's the e-cig.

156
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,770
A bag, huh?

157
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,280
You haven't shown anything yet.

158
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,190
I've got a sort of travel series.

159
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,840
Can I show a vacation pic of Hamada-san?

160
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,510
You've got so many.

161
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,640
Not really.

162
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,800
It's a volleyball, isn't it?

163
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,150
Along with a volleyball...

164
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,260
Playing on the beach.

165
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,730
It's Hamada-san.

166
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,950
There's loads of 'em.

167
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,220
A family of Hamadas!

168
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,880
A family of Hamadas huh?

169
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,660
On vacation in Hawaii.

170
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,800
That's all my travel ones.

171
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,260
Speaking of holidays...

172
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,170
...I've got this.

173
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:27,260
Hamada-ya (Hamada's Shop)

174
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,510
I just happened to see it.

175
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,200
It's this kind of thing, right?

176
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,200
Yes, well, yes.

177
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,440
Is it time to show off the angry side?

178
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,140
The angry side of Hamada-san.

179
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,440
Oh, he's pretty angry there.

180
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,420
"WHO ARE YOU!!"

181
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,150
"DON'T TAKE A PHOTO!!"

182
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,330
I've seen that so many times.

183
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,770
So, I've got one.

184
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:48,200
Hamada-san often looks like he doesn't quite understand what you just said.

185
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,430
"Eh?" like that.

186
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,840
This is that Hamada-san.

187
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,950
I see "Eh?"

188
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,820
This is another angry Hamada.

189
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,380
It's Hamada when the unit price hasn't gone up.

190
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,420
When the price is lower than expected.

191
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,370
Continuing with the angry series.

192
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,730
I think this one is pretty angry.

193
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,300
What is that? A crab?

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,300
A crab, yeah.

195
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,170
That's pretty scary.

196
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,770
It's taken from the front.

197
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,220
He's like that just before we start filming.

198
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,890
He looks like he's about ready to shout.

199
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,880
I think it's hard to top that one.

200
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,110
Impossible to beat that.

201
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,520
We could go with animals next.

202
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,550
Sometimes he wears that bobbed wig right?

203
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,700
At that time, he looks like this.

204
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,730
I saw someone carrying one of these.

205
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,200
It looks exactly the same.

206
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,210
"Can I take a picture?"

207
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,110
New Year's Eve.

208
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,110
The New Year's Eve Hamada-san.

209
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,580
This is one of the staff but...

210
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:23,450
Fukuda Ryu

211
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:23,450
Program Director

212
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,450
There are even Hamadas
among the staff.

213
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,110
Is he sneaking around in here?

214
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,360
He's even found himself...

215
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,560
...as a Japanese national rugby star.

216
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:38,970
Inagaki Keita

217
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:38,970
Rugby Japan Representative

218
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,500
That's a good find.

219
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,330
An in-shape Hamada.

220
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,970
"Time to get in shape."

221
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,940
Alright if I go next?

222
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,680
Where is Hamada-san in this photo?

223
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,200
Where is he?

224
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
This is pretty hard.

225
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,930
There he is!

226
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,930
There he is!

227
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
There it is.

228
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,910
Ah, I see it now.

229
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,420
That's Hamada-san for sure!

230
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,100
Cute!

231
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,060
Well found.

232
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,780
I was pretty happy finding this.

233
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,250
Hamada, when he's just arrived on set.

234
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,530
Ah, he does look like that.

235
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,370
That's the character for "Tani".

236
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,370
It's Tani, but also Hamada.

237
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,330
Yes, he looks sleepy.

238
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,930
That's odd, it's supposed to be Tani-san.

239
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,930
Yes.

240
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,260
Late at night.

241
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,260
He was being chewed out by Natsumi (Hamada's wife).

242
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,940
Hamada-san on a good day.

243
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,370
That's a good one.

244
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,370
That's so Hamada.

245
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,820
I think this is one when we're greeting each other.

246
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,420
That's good.

247
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,410
Yeah, that's Hamada.

248
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,460
Definitely Hamada-san.

249
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,020
Here's a "surprised" one.

250
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,020
Yeah, there are times when he's like that!

251
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,200
I've got another surprised one.

252
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,840
This one looks super surprised.

253
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,340
That's good.

254
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,340
So surprised.

255
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,640
I've also got a surprised one.

256
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,330
Even if it's a broken item, it can become Hamada.

257
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,720
How's this one?

258
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,040
Ahh, this one is pretty interesting.

259
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,680
It definitely looks like Hamada-san.

260
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,570
At that time, Hamada...

261
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,620
Here we go.

262
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,480
Ow!

263
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,610
Should I play 1-bingo?

264
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,610
Yes, to start with.

265
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,420
7 next.

266
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,800
Eh? I hit it!

267
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,900
Eh? I hit it!

268
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,770
Hamada-san when he was young.

269
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,770
This kinda feeling.

270
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,110
I see.

271
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,810
When he was young?

272
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,830
His lips were the main focus.

273
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,160
With that in mind, how about this Hamada?

274
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,730
A young Hamada.

275
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,640
From, "Yojidesuyo~Da"! (An old variety show Downtown hosted in the 80's)

276
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,470
He was super popular back then.

277
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,340
A worn out Hamada-san, like when he's drunk.

278
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,430
A worn out Hamada-san, like when he's drunk.

279
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,880
That's gross.

280
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,220
What is that?

281
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,880
Gum stuck on the ground.

282
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,990
After that Hamada-san, we have a hungover one.

283
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,280
This is that Hamada-san.

284
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,910
The face, there's the eyes and mouth.

285
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,090
Hamada-san's sleeping and snoring face

286
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,130
A Tree

287
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,000
Speaking of trees...

288
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,940
..."Kekka Happyō no toki" Hamada-san.

289
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:46,660
"Kekka Happyō no toki" = "It's time for the results"
Hamada shouts this often and has become sort of a catchphrase of his.

290
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,280
There's the mouth...

291
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,850
...and the hair.

292
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,570
I also have a "Kekka Happyō no toki"

293
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,020
What is that!

294
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,020
To begin with, WHAT IS THAT!

295
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,970
Oh, that's funny.

296
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,940
Well, this is sorta like "Kekka Happyō!"

297
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,730
I think I've got some other "Kekka Happyō!"

298
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,750
How about this one
"Kekka Happyō!"

299
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,150
Then, how about this one?

300
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,910
"Kekka Happyō!"

301
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,090
Me too, "Kekka Happyō!"

302
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,520
There's way too many!

303
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,460
This one too,"Kekka Happyō!"

304
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,060
"Kekka Happyō!"

305
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,800
Zaki-san = Hōsei

306
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,800
Zaki-san's "Kekka Happyō!"

307
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,800
What is that! It's GROSS!

308
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,510
That's not a "Kekka Happyō!"

309
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,510
Ugh. Go with the flow!

310
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,430
It's pigeon droppings.

311
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,700
He's gonna be truly mad at you.

312
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,840
He's gonna wanna hit you.

313
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,980
When he watches this, he's gonna come for you!

314
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,620
I've got a couple's photo.
Look at the Hamadas.

315
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,690
I've got a couple's photo.
Look at the Hamadas.

316
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,090
I've got a couple's photo.
Look at the Hamadas.

317
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,390
They're close, aren't they?

318
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,620
I can see the eyes and nose.

319
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,750
That's amazing.

320
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,300
This one's a part of his body.

321
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,480
Hamada-san's calf.

322
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,510
Hamada-san's calf.

323
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,800
It's okay to do calf?

324
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,150
Oh, that was his calf!

325
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,370
Calf, do I have something...

326
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,350
Nope.

327
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,710
Could go either way.

328
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,950
He did have something like this.

329
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,850
I think this looks like Hamada close up.

330
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,240
Ah, that's Hamada-san.

331
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,240
What is that?

332
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,480
A chestnut?

333
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,550
A cross section of a chestnut.

334
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:45,140
At that time, Hamada...

335
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,880
Nice shot!

336
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,970
I wonder if it's alright just doing this.

337
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,040
I see him quite a lot in his private time.

338
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,360
This is Hamada-san playing golf early in the morning.

339
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,820
He looks like that?

340
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,820
What is that?

341
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,700
It's a plug outlet covered up with putty.

342
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,200
Hamada really appears everywhere.

343
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,530
Here's another Hamada.

344
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,530
Oh, you're right.

345
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,040
That's so Hamada.

346
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,640
Is that the backside of a shoe?

347
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
If you squish your shoes, it's Hamada.

348
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,110
The face looks similar.

349
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,120
It's scary close to Hamada, right?

350
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,350
He's in a good mood.

351
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:35,250
If it's a good mood, here's another one.

352
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,570
This is a rare one, you might see it once a year or not.

353
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,040
He's winking.

354
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,820
He had to have two good days in a row or else you wouldn't see this.

355
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,400
This is a truly happy Hamada.

356
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,820
So happy.

357
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,820
He's having a great time.

358
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:07,830
This is a dead Hamada.

359
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,530
Just the mouth.

360
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,880
He looks this featureless?

361
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,880
This is... Yes, this.

362
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,150
What sort of death causes that?

363
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,170
He passed away peacefully.

364
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,040
Yes, you're right.

365
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,350
I don't get any sense of suffering.

366
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,350
Yes, very peaceful.

367
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,960
The future Hamada.

368
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,720
He's become a robot.

369
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,770
What the future holds.

370
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,770
The future.

371
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,440
There's someone I'd like to introduce you to.

372
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,670
He's a junior but...

373
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,180
...he seems to be imitating Hamada-san a lot

374
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,180
Who is that?

375
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,680
Wes-P.

376
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:11,650
Wes-P.

377
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,520
The one who does the tablecloth skit.

378
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,710
Hamada just shows up everywhere.

379
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,650
He's even appearing among the juniors.

380
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,620
He's infiltrated the juniors.

381
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,250
Hamada seems to have aged a lot recently.

382
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,470
This is the worn out Hamada.

383
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,730
Totally worn out.

384
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,710
He's looked like this since the start of the year.

385
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,610
This one definitely isn't Hamada-san...

386
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,520
...but I found Matsumoto-san.

387
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,260
Maybe a few years ago.

388
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,260
A few years ago.

389
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,240
Before the blonde hair.

390
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,770
We've come to the end.

391
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,660
One more thing?

392
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,760
Should we make this the last one?

393
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,500
This is definitely the most unbelievable one.

394
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,210
*Not Abashiri Prison

395
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,210
Hamada-san was at Abashiri Prison Museum

396
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,020
The real one.

397
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,610
It may have been.

398
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,910
I'm sure this is the real one.

399
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,350
Isn't this close!

400
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,040
He did look like that when he was younger.

401
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,160
Truly young.

402
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:37,080
The ones that are left aren't that bad.

403
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,280
How about this one?

404
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,640
Me too.

405
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,770
Vegetables? Vegetable series.

406
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,260
I can't decide which one of these is him.

407
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,310
I just couldn't decide.

408
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,630
There's just so many.

409
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,930
This one is him when he's super angry.

410
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,740
This one?

411
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,770
This one's great.

412
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,930
There's also this one...

413
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,780
...and this one.

414
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,950
Those three are great.

415
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,460
At that time, Hamada...

416
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,130
Is that a caffè latte?

417
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,290
That's right.

418
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,880
Are you adding sugar to it?

419
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,860
Of course!

420
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,860
You add it?

421
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,820
It's bitter!

422
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,930
Is it bitter?

423
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,950
Then why have you got ice cream in yours?

424
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,000
That's true, but does a caffè latte really need it?

425
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,130
It does!

426
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,890
We've come to a close.

427
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,530
I would've gone with this one.

428
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,060
Barii-san

429
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,060
Imabari City, Ehime Prefecture mascot

430
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,110
You've left the best 'til last.

431
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,530
I thought it'd be lame to put this down.

432
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,570
This ain't it.

433
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,860
I had a lot that weren't quite right.

434
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,210
I'd like to have another go at this.

435
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,480
If you looked all over Japan, you'd probably find some crazy stuff, right?

436
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,050
If you looked all over Japan, you'd probably find some crazy stuff, right?

437
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,230
With that said, have a look around your town and find the hiding Hamadas.

438
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,230
Whatever it may be, people, things, animals, plants...

439
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,880
...If it looks like Hamada, anything is OK!

440
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,640
Please visit the show's homepage!

441
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,710
That was a good one.

442
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,940
This one is so good.

443
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,930
Couldn't you use this in your home somehow?

444
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,950
If your family was okay with it.

445
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,000
It's like a funeral portrait.
