Yeah like straps quite often...

I know...

16
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,800
No, I wasn't like that, was I?

17
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,130
You were...

18
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,130
You really were...

Otomo

Umm, yes?

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,970
Tachi?

26
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,970
Tachi?

27
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:00,170
Who's going to play Tachi?

28
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,610
Who's going to play Tachi?

29
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,410
Tachi?

30
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,810
I'm talking about Tachi Hiroshi!

31
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,240
It's stupid just doing this all by myself

32
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,880
It's stupid just doing this all by myself

33
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,110
So Tachi...

34
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,480
Tachi from Seibu Keisatsu?

35
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,820
Tachi from Seibu Keisatsu?

36
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,820
That's right

37
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,920
Naoki...*

38
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,560
*Suga is addressing Tanaka by
his first name to be intimidating

39
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,950
Tachi Hiroshi...

40
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,120
Decide with that!

41
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,620
Decide with that!

42
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,900
For some reason, Suga producer hands

43
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,900
Tanaka a bouncy ball

44
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,900
r

45
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
Decide who's going to be

46
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,300
Tachi Hiroshi, Naoki, you sort it out and decide...

47
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,230
Got it?!

48
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,840
He's so pissed off!

49
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,570
That was so scary!

50
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,680
What the hell was that?

51
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,680
And why is he ordering you like that?

52
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,180
Otomo, what's going on?

53
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,280
Well umm...

54
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
He's a huge fan of Seibu Keisatsu

55
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,320
Director

56
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,320
Ootomo Yuichi

57
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,420
He's a huge fan of Seibu Keisatsu

58
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,350
And as you saw, he's Daimon, right?

59
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
Yeah, I got that

60
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:53,390
Daimon Keisuke

61
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:53,390
Producer

62
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:53,390
Seibu Police

63
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:53,390
Suga Kenji

64
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,590
And he's been saying for a while he wanted to do this...

65
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,390
Producer Suga wanted to
do Seibu Police kind of things

66
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,390
r

67
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,890
But this isn't really the program for it...

68
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,630
So if someone could

69
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,030
play Tachi Hiroshi

70
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,300
play Tachi Hiroshi

71
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,930
Just do it

72
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,930
among the staff...

73
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,040
The talent shouldn't have to...

74
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,040
Exactly

75
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,040
I'm above that...

76
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,170
Oh no~ we can't be the only ones to...

77
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,340
right Ootomo~?

78
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,540
Let's all do it...

79
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,540
Are you gay?

80
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,110
Heipo

81
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,510
Heipo-san?

82
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,380
So decide with the Bouncy ball...

83
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,950
They must use the bouncy ball and

84
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,950
decide who will play Tachi Hiroshi

85
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,950
r

86
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,950
who will play Tachi Hiroshi...

87
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,950
Wait, I don't get what we have to do...

88
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,050
So we have to decide who is going to do it?

89
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,660
One of us...

90
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,660
Ok then...

91
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,930
We'll go around the table

92
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,930
For example, throw the ball against the wall

93
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,730
and then when it bounces back, we

94
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,600
catch it one handed

95
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
and whoever can't do it

96
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,570
plays Tachi Hiroshi

97
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,570
okay?

98
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,540
I don't want to man..

99
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,540
No no, that's like the only thing I can think of...

100
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:52,680
They take goes throwing the ball

101
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:52,680
Throw the ball against the wall and catch it

102
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:52,680
Whoever is the last one able to

103
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:52,680
against the wall and catch it with one hand

104
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:52,680
catch the ball plays Tachi Hiroshi

105
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:52,680
r

106

text

107
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,480
We go one by one around the table and they throw the Bouncy ball against the wall and catch it one handed

108
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,680
Whoever is the last one to do it has to play Tachi Hiroshi

109
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
Here I go then

110
00:02:52,880 --> 00:05:04,150
Bouncy ball

111
00:02:52,880 --> 00:05:04,150
Don't catch it and
become Tachi Hiroshi

112
00:02:52,880 --> 00:05:04,150
Gold

113
00:02:52,880 --> 00:05:04,150
White

114
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,090
This is...

115
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,820
Yeah, it's fine

116
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,090
That was fine

117
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,330
He did it so softly

118
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,930
Wow, amazing

119
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,930
That was dangerous

120
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,500
That was dangerous

121
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,640
That was close

122
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
So close

123
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,940
He threw it so softly...

124
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,950
So I can do it as soft as I want, right?

125
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,950
They're getting nervous

126
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,250
No one has failed...

127
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,250
Because of everyone's sweat, the ball is so slippy...

128
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,680
This is...

129
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,320
He'll be fine, no?

130
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Surely...

131
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,630
That was awful!

132
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,900
Your eyes couldn't keep up at all!

133
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,000
That was so bad!

134
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,970
That really was!

135
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,970
Tsutsun, you're up

136
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,440
That was dangerous

137
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
It was...

138
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,780
To be honest, the slower you do it, the harder it is...

139
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,310
Yeah

140
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,850
Because it bounces weirdly

141
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,850
Yeah, if you do it too soft

142
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,850
it goes weird

143
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,990
Oh this is bad!

144
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,690
No good...

145
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,760
Out

146
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,760
Okay, here we go

147
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,100
These guys suck so bad!

148
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,100
That's awful!

149
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,530
The talents are just amazing though...

150
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,540
I guess it's our youth!

151
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,970
Heipo now

152
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,970
Here I go

153
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,940
He was skipping there...

154
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,910
He like hit it

155
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,350
You got to catch it...

156
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,350
You got to catch it...

157
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,180
Second round

158
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,520
I think he's in trouble...

159
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,250
He is

160
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,520
We told you not to throw it softly!

161
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
He got it though

162
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,120
You smug piece of shit...

163
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,130
Right then...

164
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,130
What are you on about?

165
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,860
You're an idiot

166
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,870
If your kids were watching...

167
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,870
He's so bad!

168
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,300
So bad!

169
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,800
Surely you're not feeling pressured here?

170
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,440
Oh, he caught it!

171
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,440
So if Heipo catches this

172
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,310
If Heipo catches this, Nakamura
becomes Tachi Hiroshi!

173
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,310
r

174
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,170

175
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,140
Here I go...

176
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,480
So that means Tachi Hiroshi...

177
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
is going to be Nakamura-san!

178
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,150

191
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,120
You always say that and never play

192
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,560
Otomo

193
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,660
Yes?

194
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,900
Have you decided who'll play Akira?

195
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,860
Akira?

196
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,130
Tachi just went to you...

197
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,270
Akira I said, Akira... Tera Akira!

198
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,330

203
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,470
We can't do anything, just the two of us

204
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,110
Naoki

205
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,350
Naoki, you decide using that, who will play him

206
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,120
Naoki, you decide using that, who will play him

207
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
Naoki, you decide using that, who will play him

208
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,790
Suga hands Tanaka a deck of cards this time

209
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,790
r

210
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,890
Tera?

211
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,890
That's right, Tera Akira.

212
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,690
I have to?

213
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,320
Yeah, Naoki decides...

214
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,130
Damn, he's rough

215
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,130
So rough...

216
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,870
What's that about?

217
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
He has no delicacy...

218
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,040
And what's with the 'Naoki' thing?

219
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,270
I have no idea...

220
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,810
It's the first time I've ever heard him say that

221
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,980
Yeah

222
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,180
So what shall we do with this deck?

223
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,180
I don't know man...

224
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,180
What should we do...

225
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,690
Just make it simple

226
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,550
You're right

227
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,350
Like we all take a card and flip it over at the same time

228
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,360
Like we all take a card and flip it over at the same time

229
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,360
and whoever has the lowest number...

230
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,620
Oh yeah, I do like that idea

231
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,160
Oh man, so scary

232
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,630
This is quite scary...

233
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,630
So the lowest number...

234
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,630
Oh, wait!

235
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,670
So, If before I draw

236
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,830
I say "hearts"

237
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,740
And then I flip over the card

238
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,740
and it's hearts then I'm safe

239
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,740
and it's hearts then I'm safe

240
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,540
Oh, that's a good idea.

241
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,540
Wait, you'd be safe?

242
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,740
Should I be out?

243
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,180
Because it's a 1/4 chance.

244
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,840
If we do that,

245
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,480
It'd be better if you were out.

246
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,910
If you were safe no one would...

247
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,920
That might be better.

248
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,920
I think so too.

249
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,720
Continue this until there is only

250
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,720
Guess the Card Suit

251
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,720
If the suit of the card is the suit

252
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,720
Pick a card and guess the suit,

253
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,720
and then flip it over.

254
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,720
called out, the player is out.

255
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,720
one person left. Loser becomes Tera.

text

259
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,890
Flip a card over, and if it is the same suit as the one the player called out, he is out.

260
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,760
The last person to be out will perform Tera Akira.

261
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,060
If you guess it right, you're out.

262
00:07:26,120 --> 00:08:58,720
Gold

263
00:07:26,120 --> 00:08:58,720
Guess the Suit,
Tera Akita

264
00:07:26,120 --> 00:08:58,720
Playing Cards

265
00:07:26,120 --> 00:08:58,720
White

266
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,060
If you're right, out.

267
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,360
If you say hearts and the card is hearts, you're out.

268
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,360
Hearts

269
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,300
Safe!

270
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,470
Are we putting it back in the pile?

271
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,470
Nah, just leave it out.

272
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,640
Ah, okay.

273
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,770
Say it out loud.

274
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,770
Hearts

275
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,470
That was close

276
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,440
Thank God

277
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,980

Wow, nice

279
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,880
There's a 1/4 chance so...

280
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,590
It's over with just a flip.

281
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,590
Endo's the 4th turn, so...

282
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,020
Clovers

283
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,030
No way, I don't wanna...

284
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,030
Right, right

285
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,030
There's still a chance.

286
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,630
Go ahead, Tanaka.

287
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,640
Diamonds

288
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,500
Yes, okay.

289
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,540
It's lookin' like Endo...

290
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,540
Right?

291
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,110
Say it!!!

292
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,080
Hearts

293
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,480
If you don't call it first, you're automatically out.

294
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,020
Diamonds

295
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,520
Just two people left.

296
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,230
It's gonna be Endo!

297
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,230
Just two left, Endo.

298
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Three-Leaf

299
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Three-leaf?

300
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,970
What the hell is "three-leaf"?

301
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:49,710
If Heipo Guesses Wrong
Endo Will Perform Tera Akira!

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,170
So it's all on Heipo now.

305
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,140
It's gonna be Endo.

306
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,140
It's already Endo, though.

307

00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,410
You pick.

341
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,980

344

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,990
pick Gen-san.

346
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,990
Alright...

347
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,990
Understood?!

348
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,990
Y...Yes.

349
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,200
He really had trouble closing that door.

350
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,000
How should we do it?

351
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,970
What do you mean, we already know how.

352
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,070
Explain the rules already.

353
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,070
Every one will pick

354
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,240
their own recorder...

355
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,750
And only one of these recorders

356
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,620
And only one of these recorders

357
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,980
doesn't make any noise.

358
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,620
doesn't make any noise.

359
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,590
will be Kariya Shunsuke

360
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,590
The person who gets that recorder

361
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,590
will be Kariya Shunsuke

362
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:51,260
If sound comes out, safe! The person who

363
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:51,260
Pick one of the recorders from the

The person who picks the silent recorder becomes Kariya Shunsuke.

371
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,330
Should we all pick at the same time?

372
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,070
It's a 1/8 chance, so...

373
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,170
If I'm gonna get picked after all this time,

374
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,170
I would have preferred Tachi Hiroshi.

375
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,780

Alright.

381
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,820
I'm begging you...

382
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
We just have to blow togeth...

383
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,190
Oh right, One by one.

384
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,190
Let's start blowing.

385
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,560

Yup, got it. No problem.

443

Decide already.

448

He has no idea what he's doing.

449
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,090
I thought he loved that show.

450
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,450
That way of playing it off,

00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,990
That way of playing it off,

Bright red!

455
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,200
He said "Just kidding"...!

456
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,040
Such a stupid way to cover it up

457
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:47,810
So what's this?

458
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,440
This is a towel for each of us.

459
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,080

460
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,550

463
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,320
Each person will choose a prepared towel and wipe their face with it,
