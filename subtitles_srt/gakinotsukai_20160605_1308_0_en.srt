00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,150
This is scary

600
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,150
What?

601
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,150
For real?

602
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,390
What?

603
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,490
Nothing you can do about it

604
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,660
Oh, they've got a professional to do it

605
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,660
Oh, a real professional.

606
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,830
Ow, ow...

607
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,440
They actually do this as well...

608
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,240
Damn it's hot

609
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,080
Is it hot?

610
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,510
She's shoved this like right up there but is that okay?

611
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,120
She won't reply or anything

612
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,680
Quiet

613
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,620
Ouch

614
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,530
Ow, ow, it hurts...

615
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,530
Oww.

616
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:41,170
Until it hardens

617
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,170
We need to wait

618
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,370
You guys, like seriously

619
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,510
No no

620
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,510
Right?

621
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,510
Yeah, it's a problem

622
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,250
We've just been lucky though

623
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,410
Yeah

624
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,410
You have to do one punishment at least...

625
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,220
We can't do anything about it...

626
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,450
since we haven't picked the skull card at all

627
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,690
Matsumoto-san, do you want to pull that one out?

628
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,060
Ready, set

629
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,630
Holy shit!

630
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,600
It's all on there

631
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,600
Yeah

632
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,640
Please don't show it

633
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,510
So embarassing...

634
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,880
Yeah, it is, I guess

635
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,310
There was some weird stuff on it...

636
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,020
It is a bit embarassing

637
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,680
There was weird stuff all over it, huh?

638
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,550
I've had so much weird stuff put in me, so loads of weird stuff came out

639
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,730
Loads of stuff came out from inside
