00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,920
Today, a certain man's special segment

5
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,150
Everyone, could I have your attention for a moment?

6
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,150
Everyone, could I have your attention for a moment?

7
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,000
Somehow...

00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,720

14
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,530
This weather is pretty heavy, isn't it.

15
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,960
You can feel it, yeah.

16
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,960
So, this time...

17
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,060
Endo has, in the past,

18
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,230
done a bit where he dressed up as Mori Shinichi, and performed as him in some situations.

19
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:32,280
"I'd Like to See Mori Shinichi Do This"

20
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:32,280
Endo responds to requests to see
Mori Shinichi in a variety of situations

21
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:32,280
m 0 0 l 0 20.5 l 24.5 20.5 l 24.5 0

22
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,200
I vaguely remember something like that.

23
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,630
Just a very faint memory.

24
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,800
It hasn't been that long since he did it, though.

25
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,280
No, it hasn't, but I was feeling like it had been at least 8 years ago.

26
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,020
Well, you see, regarding that segment

27
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,910
Endo himself actually really liked it.

28
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,020
Endo himself actually really liked it.

29
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,860
Why?

30
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:38,380
Why exactly?

31
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,120
Why exactly?

32
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,230
Probably, um...

33
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,530
I mean if he liked it, that's fine, it's his preference.

34
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,960
Yes, he really enjoyed it.

35
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,160
He really did like it.

36
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,160
I mean it, he actually did.

37
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,400
So for this time...you're familiar with the program 'Uchi Kuru!?', right?

38
00:00:46,160 --> 00:01:02,040
(Uchi Kuru!?) is a program on Fuji TV that began in April 1999. It's a show where they and other guests visit a celebrity's home and/or hometown to try local specialties and showcase the guest.

39
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,370
He said he wanted to do Uchi Kuru

40
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,060
Endo said he wanted to do it?

41
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:02,040
A program where the hosts visit a featured guest's favourite shops
and ask them about their memories and personal stories

42
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:02,040
Uchi Kuru!?
"You're Coming to My House!?"

43
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:02,040
m 0 0 l 0 20.5 l 24.5 20.5 l 24.5 0

44
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,700
Yes, he said that he wanted to

45
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,700
do Uchi Kuru as Mori Shinichi.

46
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,760
Yeah.

47
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,430
Sounds annoying...

48
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,110
So...

49
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,280
How many people do you reckon are actually going to watch this?

50
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,280
How many people do you reckon are actually going to watch this?

51
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,410
He's very excited about it.

52
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,280
Mori Shinichi himself doesn't make appearances

53
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,280
on variety shows very much.

54
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,520
And for that very reason,

55
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,520
Endo wants to come do Uchi Kuru as Mori Shinichi.

56
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,460
This is Gaki no Tsukai though, so I mean...

57
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,660
This isn't actually Uchi Kuru and he isn't actually Mori Shinichi

58
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,030
This isn't actually Uchi Kuru and he isn't actually Mori Shinichi

59
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,530
It's like wearing another person's dirty underwear, isn't it

60
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:38,540
Brought to you entirely by Endo's imagination

61
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:38,540
Brought to you entirely by Endo's imagination

62
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:38,540
Mori Shinichi's Favourite Eats and Personal Stories

63
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,730
And now, handing off to our guest of the day,

64
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,460
Mori Shinichi's favourite foods, memories, and personal stories

65
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,530
will all be brought to you according to Endo's imagination!

66
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,380
So let's introduce our guest!

67
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,510
Mori Shinichi, in person - Here he is!

68
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,980
Mori Shinichi, in person - Here he is!

69
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,220
Good afternoon, everyone.

70
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,150
I'm Mori Shinichi.

71
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,390
Mori Shinichi?

72
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,390
Today's Guest

73
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,700
So, just now,

74
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,660
I think Tanaka has already explained a bit...

75
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,660
Huh?

76
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,430
I think Tanaka has already explained a bit about this.

77
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,900
I've received a lot of requests to see what it

78
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,900
would be like if Mori Shinichi were to appear on Uchi Kuru!?

79
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,240
I've really been hearing it from all over.

80
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,260
So today we're going to see what that might be like.

81
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,210
Sorry to interrupt, but

82
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,380
How long of a delay is Gaki running on today?

83
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,650
(Staff)

84
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,650
It's scheduled for a 30-minute delay.

85
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,650
30 minutes, huh?

86
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,310
Would've been nice to push it back further, though

87
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,030
We won't be going home until the middle of the night.

88
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,030
I don't know about that...

89
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,320
So this is just like a segment of Uchi Kuru, or more accurately Uchi Iku ("going to your home").

90
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,490
Can you give us the title call of the day?

91
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,930
Uchi Iku ("We're Going to My Place")

92
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
Goin' Goin'

93
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,030
Uchi Iku!?

94
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,030
Uchi Iku!?

95
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,030
Uchi Iku!?

96
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,930
Shall we get started?

97
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,330
Let's go, let's go.

98
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,330
Let's get a real early start on this one.

99
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,460
Let's head out to our destination.

100
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,900
The one you personally selected, yeah?

101
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,900
(Staff)

102
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,900
Alright, that's finished!

103
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,740
Excellent work.

104
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,210
(Manager)

105
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,210
Your vehicle will be over here.

106
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,830
I guess this is because he's supposed to be Mori Shinichi.

107
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,880
He's got an amazing entourage with him.

108
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,150
What are they talking about?

109
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,280
We're not getting that level of of treatment!!

110
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,290
We're not getting that level of of treatment!!

111
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,890
Who is that, anyway?

112
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,420
That's supposed to be his manager, I guess.

113
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,360
We haven't even started moving yet, so where the hell are they going?

114
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,330
Good working with you all.

The four go with Mori Shinichi to try out some of his favourite eateries. Let's see our first stop of the day!

131
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,150
And right here, is a restaurant

132

that Mori-san comes to quite regularly.

I can't quite get the hang of it...

136
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,230
What could they be chatting about?

137
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,560
Is there a point to coming here so early just to meet us like this?

138
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,260
It's amazing, really.

139
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,700
Oh, hello!

140
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,630
I kind of, uh,

141
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,970
got here a bit ahead of time.

142
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,870
Of course you got here first, you left before we did.

143
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,540
Of course you got here first, you left before we did.

144
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:53,550
2nd Floor 1-3-1 Komazawa, Setagaya Ward

145
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:53,550
Multinational Cuisine George

146
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,100
Mori Shinichi's first selection is right near Komazawa University Station

147
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,430
"George", a restaurant specialising in multinational cuisine.

148
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,150
So Mori-san, do you live somewhere around here?

149
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,650
Ah, well you see,

150
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,450
I'd really rather not say...

151
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,880
I'd really rather not say...

152
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:07,690
¤ Endo will answer questions and give personal stories based on what he imagines Mori Shinichi would say

153
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,100
This is Uchi Kuru, right?

154
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,500
You'd expect some info like that right?

155
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,500
You would, wouldn't you?

156
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,190
In any case, I come here about

157
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,200
three times a week.

158
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,430
That's quite a lot.

159
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,200
Three is, yeah, a few.

160
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,760
So when you come here,

161
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,530
Where do they usually seat you?

162
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,870
Well when the weather is nice,

163
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,300
I sit out there on the terrace.

164
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,010
How about private rooms, you don't use those?

165
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,940
For private rooms...

166
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,210
if I can get a reservation I'll use them.

167
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,810
If it's you, you certainly should be able to get one!

168
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,160
So there's times where you can't get a reservation?

169
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,480
Yes, there are.

170
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,950
That expression you made

171
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,320
That was the same face you made when you retired!

172
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,730
Ehh...

173
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,320
I'm fine with it, really.

174
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,320
You just looked really sad for a moment there.

175
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:46,030
Pasta with Lobster

176
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:46,030
Using the entire body

177
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,560
And here we have Mori's first selection,

178
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,900
this prepared pasta with lobster

179
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,600
How did you hear about this restaurant?

180
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,600
Well, you see...

181
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,240
A close friend of mine...

182
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,010
Who are you talking about?

183
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,160
Yeah, who?

184
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,340
He's just a friend I have,

185
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:55,510
H-His name's Inoue.

186
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,510
H-His name's Inoue.

187
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,000
So he's just an ordinary guy?

188
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,700
Okay, sure, but-

189
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,130
And he's the one who introduced you to this place?

190
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,720
Yes, it was Inoue who told me about it.

191
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,920
What sort of work does Inoue do exactly?

192
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,450
Well Inoue, he...

193
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,590
Over in Sakura-shin, he runs a Teppan-yaki place.

194
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,960
Over in Sakura-shin, he runs a Teppan-yaki place.

195
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,430
So wouldn't it have been better if

196
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,430
we went to his place for lunch instead?

197
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,230
Ow, ow, ouch...

198
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,730
And Inoue would've gotten something out of it too.

199
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,000
Ow, ow, ouch...

200
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,400
Yeah, for his Teppan-yaki place.

201
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,810
There's water right there.

202
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,230
It's right in front of your face!

203
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,710
Could I get a cloth?

204
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,100
Let me have that, thank you.

205
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,030
Well let's ask for some too, then.

206
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,180
What, you mean a cloth?

207
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,210
He's got loads of assistants here.

208
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,210
I wish he'd introduce some of them to us.

209
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,220
The make-up assistants are seriously up there in years.

210
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Are there really 3 make-up assistants?

211
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,400
So first of all, the lobster

212
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Let's eat.

213
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,760
Let's eat.

214
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,130
When I heard about this, I figured people would watch it on TV and some Mori Shinichi fans might come out.

215
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,130
You'd hope so.

216
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,130
I think we have an opportunity here.

217
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,270
To ask him about stories from before he

218
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,270
made his debut as a singer...

219
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,110
I imagine you must have had a hard

220
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,110
time in the industry until you hit it big?

221
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,400
Well, I was born in

222
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,200
Yamanashi, you see.

223
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,850
Huh?

224
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,920
So he actually is giving some real info here.

225
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:24,100
Mori Facts - Profile

*'Group Employment', or 集団就職, was a system of finding work
wherein unemployed graduates (usually of Junior High Schools)
would come to urban areas for employment of varying quality.
It seems to have been more prevalent in the decades just after WWII.

227
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,500
Via group employment,

228
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:24,100
Born in Yamashi Prefecture, then lived in Kagoshima Prefecture
After Junior High, he came to Osaka via group employment*

230
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,100
I came to Tokyo

231
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,800
How old were you at the time?

232
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,100
Around 20 years old

233
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,360
Right around there.

234
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,360
That's pretty late.

235
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,230
You were 20?

236
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,430
20 is definitely late, man.

237
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,260
He should've been in his teens back then.

238
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,960
Somewhere in the middle, yeah.

239
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,760
Apparently he started working after Junior High.

240
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,970
That's not what he said at all.

241
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,240
Ah, well...anyway.

242
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,940
Ah, well...anyway.

243
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,540
Anyway?

244
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,380
You have to support your family.

245
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,310
You have to support your family.

246
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,660
And you weren't married back then, were you?

247
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,190
I just mean the family from before I got married-

248
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,750
the family that raised me, you know.

249
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,360
So who, for example?

250
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,730
Do you have any siblings?

251
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,730
Oh, as for that,

252
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,730
I do have some, yes.

253
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,100
Please tell us!

254
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,730
Actually tell us about them!

255
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,360
Sisters? Brothers?

256
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,000
I had an older sister as well.

257
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,330
Yes, an older sister.

258

Mori Facts - Profile

259
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:09,810
Together with a younger brother and older sister, the Moriuchi (Mori's real name) family had 3 kids.

261
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,810
So, in the beginning-

262
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,810
How about a dog?

263
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,850
Did you ever own a dog or anything like that?

264
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,850
A dog, right...

265
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,580
"Let's get a dog" or anything, but,

266
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,580
It's not like I said

267
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,250
there certainly was one.

268
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,430
What the hell are you saying?

269
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,760
You have no idea, do you?

270
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,730
What was its name, then?

271
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,300
It was called Pera...Bera

272
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,600
Pera...Bera

273
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,560
Pera...Pera.

274
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,200
Pera?

275
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,100
Pera...Pera.

276
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,270
It was called Pera?

277
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,140
There was Pera and there was Bera, you see.

278
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,930
So you had two dogs?

279
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,200
Ah, I see, two dogs.

280
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,200
He had two?

281
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,910
Who debuted around the same time as you?

282
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,540
At that time...

283
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,510
There was Ikuzoh, Yoshi Ikuzoh.

284
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,680
There was Ikuzoh, Yoshi Ikuzoh.

285
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,050
That's definitely not right.

286
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,330
Yeah that can't be right.

287
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,490
His debut was a bit later, I think.

288
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,850
Well actually, most of them are already dead.

289
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,120
Well actually, most of them are already dead.

290
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,020
If they were really dead, you'd remember them a little better than that!

291
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,360
If they were really dead, you'd remember them a little better than that!

292
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,500
Yeah, you tend to remember dead people.

293
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,800
Anyway, so-

294
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,130
As for the types of work you've done, I've heard

296
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:19,710

298
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,460
you've had close to 20 different types of part-time jobs. Is that true?

299
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,700
That's true, I have.

300
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,700
I was a roadie once,

301
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,600
and I've also worked at cafés.

302
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,600
Cafés?

303
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,680
Let's see, what else...

304
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,320
Being a ticket man at the aquarium and stuff like that.

305
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,390
Being a ticket man at the aquarium and stuff like that.

306
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,390
You mean you were a ticket collector?

307
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,960
Are you okay?

308
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,690
This is terrible, man.

309
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,690
What sort of circumstances brought you to an aquarium?

310
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Hmm...

311
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,130
What's the matter?

312
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,900
It's just,

313
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,100
today's been pretty exhausting.

314
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,300
Exhausting?

315
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,900
Are you alright?

316
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,710
It's just my face...

317
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,410
Your face?

318
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,540
Ah, I bet his face is tired.

319
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,530
So that's what's exhausting.

320
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,150
I see, I see

321
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,980
What job made you quit the fastest?

322
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,390
My job at the aquarium.

323
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,920
How long were you there before you quit?

324
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,160
It might've been my first morning, actually.

325
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,100
Really?

326
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,100
That very same morning?

327
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:15,800
A surprise visit from one of Mori's friends

328
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,800
After the break, an old friend of Mori's comes by for a surprise visit!

329
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,640
So I've already heard this, but

330
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,540
You've even had a job at a furniture store in the past.

331
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,580
You've even had a job at a furniture store in the past.

332
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,010
And while you worked there,

333
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,810
you learned some unique skills.

334
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,560
That's what I've heard.

335
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,560
Unique skills?

336
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,450
Like for a piece of furniture-

337
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,120
Being able to carry a heavy cabinet with your shoulders

338
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,550
Being able to carry a heavy cabinet with your shoulders

339
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,020
Ohkawa Eisaku  had a trick like that

340
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,120
Ohkawa Eisaku  had a trick like that

341
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,100
Yeah, that's Ohkawa's thing

342
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,930
Well,

343
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,160
Eisaku actually saw me doing it first

344
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,260
Eisaku actually saw me doing it first

345
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,530
Eisaku actually saw me doing it first

346
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,470
So he copied you!

347
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,460
I see, so you started it

348
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,900
We've actually prepared a cabinet

349
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,900
just for the occasion

350
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,230
Looks pretty heavy.

351
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,880
He's going to carry this by himself?

352
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,230
I mean, if he can pull it off,

353
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,860
it'll be be quite something.

354
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,860
He's amazing.

355
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,860
What's the trick to doing something like this?

356
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,860
It's his back, I'm guessing.

357
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,930
Right, of course.

358
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,800
Ah, this takes me back.

359
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,160
So is that how you used to do it?

360
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,320
You were measuring it by sun*

361
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:17,460
*(a unit of measurement that equals roughly to 3cm)

362
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,820
Yes, in suns*

363
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,820
You measured it in suns*

364
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,390
Back in my day we would measure these by sun, you see.

365
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,460
That's how you're doing it right now!

366
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,360
You take this...

367
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,530
He did this for over 20 years...

368
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,300
I have to be careful

369
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,670
Those people over there are looking really concerned.

370
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,770
Those people over there are looking really concerned.

371
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,510
"Don't make him do something like this!"

372
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,510
They're making a face like

373
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,030
Excuse me, but uh-

374
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,460
Yes of course, go ahead.

375
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,460
I'm not sure where to grab it.

376
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,320
It's comin' out, man.

377
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,420
This is gonna be the scariest part.

378
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,230
That's dangerous!

379
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,000
Mori-san?

380
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,600
What the hell is wrong with this guy?

381
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,100
Did they really write that this is a skill I have?

382
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,830
Hmm, yes, we heard this was a unique skill of yours.

383
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:02,160
The thing is I just did it once way back when...

384
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,960
Well if you push yourself too hard you'll just get hurt.

385
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,980
Ah, he got it up there.

386
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,450
Just like we expected, you did it just fine.

387
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,460
And you'd carry it like that, I guess.

388
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,700
Experience from his old part-time job

389
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,090
Why did he kick it?

390
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,290
What reason could he possibly have to kick it?

391
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,290
What's the matter?

392
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,960
Maybe they didn't tell him about this in the meeting.

393
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,470
We're very sorry for all that.

394
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:34,140
A Big Surprise From His Youth

395
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:34,140
Once more from back then

396
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:34,140
And now, to relive moments from his youth, a surprise guest is here!

397
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:40,450
Apparently, the longest part-time job you ever held

398
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,450
was as a waiter at a cabaret in Shinjuku.

399
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,880
At the time, at that cabaret...

400
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,320
There was a co-worker who

401
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,320
really supported you, wasn't there?

402
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,620
That same person has come to see you today

403
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,460
It's a co-worker you came to know very well - Honda-san!

404
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,600
Wow, it's Honda-san!

405
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,830
Long time no see!

406
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,740
Honda Kiyozumi

407
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,740
Old Friend from Work

408
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,600
How've you been, Mori?

409
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,100
It's certainly been a while.

410
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,230
And you haven't changed a bit.

411
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,400
I guess these things really do happen.

412
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,000
You don't really change much?

413
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,510
Yeah, I suppose so, but-

414
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,250
You lost a bit of weight, didn't you?

415
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,220
I just got old, that's all.

416
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,220
He he he

417
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,660
Well of course, I've aged a bit myself.

418
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,550
Did you just know each other at work?

419
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,590
Or did you go out to drink some nights, or anything like that?

420
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,100
Back then it was all about Mahjong~

421
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,360
We enjoyed it a lot.

422
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,930
And you'd go 'Honda Reach'*!

423
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:42,770
*(Reach is a Mahjong term)

424
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,300
Ah yes, I remember that one.

425
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,300
Eeeh...

426
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,440
What is this 'Honda Reach' crap?

427
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,200
So Honda-san, what was his work like at the cabaret?

428
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,820
Well, you see, the place was a cabaret,

429
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,260
so naturally, we had quite a few scary customers come in.

430
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,220
But, at times like that

431
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,190
Mori would, with his personality and character, respond really well to those types of situations.

432
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,730
Mori would, with his personality and character, respond really well to those types of situations.

433
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,460
Mori would, with his personality and character, respond really well to those types of situations.

434
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,270
So there were times where you had to deal with that sort of thing?

435
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,370
I would say something like "please stop that..."

436
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,370
One time though, he was like "let's take this outside,"

437
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,380
One time though, he was like "let's take this outside,"

438
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,940
but when he came back,

439
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,580
he was shaking the guy's hand and had a smile on his face.

440
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,410
Do you remember that?

441
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,320
...there was that, yeah.

442
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,890
If you don't remember, that's fine too.

443
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,460
I don't remember it too well.

444
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,160
Of course, it was quite some time ago,

445
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,730
and usually third parties remember it better anyway.

446
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,360
After this time in his life he would go on to

447
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,070
After this time in his life he would go on to

448
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,070
pursue the life of a singer.

449
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,770
So we'll be hearing about that

450
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,770
at our next stop on the trip.

451
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,660
Thanks so much.

452
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,580
(Staff)

453
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,580
Alright, that's it!

454
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,580
We got it!

455
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,300
Alright, well until next time...

456
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,880
Mori-san?

457
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,620
He's super pissed.

458
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,260
I think he probably lost it at that

459
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,260
thing with the cabinet.

460
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,260
He was really angry after that.

461
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:12,230
A Trip with Mori Shinichi: Trying out local cuisine in Komazawa

462
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:12,230
A Trip with Mori Shinichi: Trying out local cuisine in Komazawa

463
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,560
Thanks for being with us Honda-san!

464
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,230
Now we once again head back towards Komazawa Park~!

465
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,900
Now, right here,

466
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,330
we would like to make one of Mori-san's old dreams a reality!

467
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:22,040
Mori Shinichi's dream comes true!

468
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:22,040
Mori Shinichi's dream comes true!

469
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:22,040
Surprise Segment

470
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,300
What do you say?

471
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,040
Yes, of course.

472
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,110
As for what will make his dream come true - Let's see it!

473
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,480
As for what will make his dream come true - Let's see it!

474
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,930
Well, well...

475
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,660
Here it is, here it is!

476
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,130
Wow, that's impressive.

477
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,130
It's arrived just for you

478
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:34,900
And it is,

479
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,760
The sidecar of a

480
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,760
Harley Davidson motorcycle

481
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,900
Ah, wow!

482
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,530
Say something, for fuck's sake.

483
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,630
That's irritating, is that how he acts when he's happy?

484
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:53,000
The ultra-classic sidecar of a Harley Davidson

485
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,300
Mori-san's thoughts on this bike are...

486
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,870
Mori-san's thoughts on this bike are...

487
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,460
I grew up in a very rural area, you see,

488
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,150
out in the sticks and stuff,

489
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,120
There'd be bikes for plowing the fields and things

490
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
Sort of like tractors.

491
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,900
Right, like tractors.

492
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,630
And basically that's all I'd ever seen

493
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,320
I thought, so there are bikes out there with leather on them

494
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,390
I thought, so there are bikes out there with leather on them

495
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,030
And from there, I just sort of fell for them.

496
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,330
And from there, I just sort of fell for them.

497
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,860
Do you have a license to drive one of these?

498
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,860
Well,

499
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,670
I went and got one, just for that reason.

500
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,270
I went and got one, just for that reason.

501
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:28,540
Even though it was your dream, and you even got a license,

502
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,540
you didn't actually buy one?

503
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,540
It was a bit dangerous as well, you know.

504
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,980
It was a bit dangerous as well, you know.

505
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,130
You do like bikes, though.

506
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,180
Driver

507
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,180
m 0 0 l 0 20.5 l 24.5 20.5 l 24.5 0

508
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,020
The driver's going "uh-huh, uh-huh"

509
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,230
"Uh-huh, uh-huh"

510
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,420
with that crap.

511
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,420
You can't just jump in

512
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,490
I am happy about this, though.

513
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,390
Yeah, you're going to fulfill your dream today.

514
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,300
Can I get in?

515
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,300
Go on, go ahead.

516
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,700
So this time, he'll-

517
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,100
He's going for the side.

518
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,930
Why the hell did he get a license then?

519
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,700
It was his dream to ride in the sidecar, I guess.

520
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,200
Are you sure you don't want to drive?

521
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,370
I'm pretty sure he can hear you.

522
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,470
Hey!

523
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,470
Hey!

524
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,710
MORI!

525
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,710
MORI!

526
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,480
Let's be going then.

527
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,480
You'll be riding in the sidecar then.

528
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
I see, I see, have a nice trip!

529
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,500
I'm going!

530
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,060
I wish he'd just ride that fucking thing all the way home.

531
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,290
I wish he'd just ride that fucking thing all the way home.

532
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:49,850
His Sought-After Harley Davidson

533
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,190
Mori Shinichi's dream came true.

534
00:16:54,190 --> 00:17:00,130
A Trip with Mori Shinichi: Trying out local cuisine in Komazawa

535
00:16:54,190 --> 00:17:00,130
A Trip with Mori Shinichi: Trying out local cuisine in Komazawa

536
00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:00,130
Our next stop on our trip with Mori-san is~

537
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,400
6-14-2 Fukusawa, Setagaya Ward

538
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Meshi-Dokoro Den

539
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,160
A restaurant known only to those in the know, Meshi-Dokoro 'Den'

540
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,460
We'll be having the Soba Gozen, with this season's tempura and a side of sashimi.

541
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,970
Soba Gozen

542
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,080
I'd be curious to hear about the concepts behind this meal.

543
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,260
Like the proper way to eat it,

544
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,080
what's the etiquette?

545
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,080
Well this, you see...

546
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,780
You totally just opened it to check what was inside.

547
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,450
You totally just opened it to check what was inside.

548
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
Anyway, Mori-san,

549
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,560
I've been told that the catalyst for your debut was when you won a singing contest on TV.

553
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,960
Yes, that's true.

554
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,830
That's right

555
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,160
Which record company

556
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,160
were you contracted with?

557
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,560
It was with Victor・JVC...

558
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,170
Tanaka, is that...

559
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,170
I don't have that

560
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,170
info on here.

561
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,370
(Staff)

562
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,370
That's correct.

563
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,110
You were surprised to hear that just now, weren't you?

564
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,080
You were completely taken aback.

565
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,750
Mori Shinichi's Passionate Singing

566
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:50,230

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,760
Release coming in the next few days!!

573
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,230
The manager you had at the start of your career

574
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,630
was there for both good times and bad, wasn't he?

575
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,630
Yes...

576
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,340
Actually,

577
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:19,340
Here today, we've invited your

578
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,340
first manager, Nomura-san, to come see you.

579
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:19,880
Hey, Mori!

580
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,610
Hey, Mori!

581
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,450
It's been so long since I last saw you...

582
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,650
Mori's First Manager

583
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,650
Nomura Shinji

584
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,000
This is just so moving...

585
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It is, isn't it.

586
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,500
I mean, it's someone he's known for a long time.

587
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,490
Isn't he crying?

588
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,490
Ah, he's not even tearing up.

589
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,500
He'd cry at this, you'd think.

590
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,100
But, I guess he isn't going to.

591
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,530
So Nomura-san, how many

592
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,530
years were you with Mori as his manager?

593
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,340
Well, Mori-san was...

594
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,200
Wait, Mori-san was what?

595
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,240
We're talking about Nomura-san.

596
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,030
It's been such a long time since you've seen each other, I'm sure-

597
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,860
But,

598
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,130
this time,

599
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,780
with memories of your struggles together as a team,

600
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,210
Nomura-san has brought a letter

601
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,250
Nomura-san has brought a letter

602
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,250
he wrote just for you.

603
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,860
Would it be alright if

604
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,860
he read it aloud for us right now?

605
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,090
Mori-san's face is a bit...

606
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,500
To Moriー

607
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:20,640
In my time as a manager,

608
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:20,640
the three years I spent working with you are irreplaceable.

609
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:28,650
When you came to stay at my house,

610
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,650
3 years after your debut and hadn't made it yetーI remember that.

611
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:38,660
At the time, when we were coming back from an audition

612
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,660
in Uchisai-cho for NHK, we only had ￥80 between us.

613
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,260
The train fare back to where we lived in Kamata was ￥40 per-person.

614
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:53,500
We were starving, and there were two choices in front of us:

615
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,500
Eat the cheap tanuki udon at NHK's cafeteria, or take the train home.

616
00:19:53,570 --> 00:20:00,280
We really stressed over it, but in the end, we went with the udon, didn't we.

617
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,280
We really stressed over it, but in the end, we went with the udon, didn't we.

618
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:06,480
On our way back home, you said just a few words to me.

619
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:16,160
"Don't worry Nomura-san, I'll definitely become a big star.

620
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,160
And when I do, I'll treat you to shrimp tempura udon."

621
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:22,070
It looks like you were telling the truth back then.

622
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,400
(His face) is just getting worse and worse.

623
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:31,710
I look forward to the day we'll

624
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:31,710
share that udon together.

625
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,710
-Nomura

626
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,360
Thanks so much, Nomura-san.

627
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,080
So the shrimp tempura udon, have you...?

628
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,950
So the shrimp tempura udon, have you...?

629
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,090
I haven't gotten it for him yet.

630
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,850
I haven't gotten it for him yet.

631
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,560
That was a very Osakan way to say that.

632
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,400
"I haven't gotten it for him yet."

633
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,360
Well it's important to you both.

634
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
I see, well,

635
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,600
here today,

636
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,070
Mori-san has something

637
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,070
very important to tell us about.

638
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:58,940
Uh...

639
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,540
I have, for this very day-

640
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,880
There's a poster for it up there in the back as well, but,

641
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,310
I'm putting out a CD.

642
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,300
"For this very day?"

643
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,900
It's planned to go on sale

644
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,100
starting this Autumn...

645
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,150
It's called "O-Fukuro Botaru" (Mother Firefly)

646
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,390
Ah, so this is actually a promo for the CD?

647
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:21,290
I asked if I might be allowed to sing it for you here...

648
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,100
Really?

649
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,730
The song, you mean?

650
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,730
Yes, is that alright?

651
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,530
Let's get started then.

652
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,860
As Mori Shinichi:

653
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,000
"O-Fukuro Botaru"

654
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:42,810
Lyrics: Kageyama Hiroshi | Composition: Aoyama Haruki

655
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:42,810
O-Fukuro Botaru (Mother Firefly)

656
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:51,890
When the sea calls out,

657
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:58,300
a man's heart burns

658
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:05,470
He turns to drink to mask the fear

659
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:10,940
Seeing dreams of fortune, he seeks a ship

660
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,950
"The reckless and foolish son"

661
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:23,690
Leaving nothing but harsh words

662
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,660
Holding a vigil at the shore,

663
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:35,830
the mother prays for her son's safe return

664
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:42,340
At the cape of Erimo,
