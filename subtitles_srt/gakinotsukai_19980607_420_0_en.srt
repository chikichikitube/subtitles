1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
The Third Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende Chiki-Chiki

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:10,500
Fateful showbiz revenge match! Yamazaki vs Moriman - an endless battle!

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,900
About that, they're doing that again

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,700
How confident today do you think Yamasaki san is?

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,700
He is definitely confident today. He already did two times before.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,100
That is so. But you know, how should I say it? He lost in such ways that we can't even talk about them. A complete failure.

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,300
Prior to this match, Yamasaki and Moriman had two battles

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:42,800
However, Yamazaki's struggle was in vain, as he was unable to match Moriman's astonishing power. Before your eyes, real men are born.

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,500
This time I've thought of all kinds of different ways to fight

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,400
And I think there's something wrong with the way Yamasaki fights

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,600
That must be it

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,500
Our contestant now is 30 years old. Will Yamasaki be able to take his revenge?

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,400
Our fighter, Yamasaki san's entrance!

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,500
~"Yamasaki is No.1"~

15
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,800
Here comes our good-for-nothing guy

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,200
That's right, I'm wearing it.

17
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,800
The first and second time you were completely defeated.

18
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,200
That is so, I did quite bad the second time, but it was unfair!

19
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,400
But we saw it all, how you fought there. We were not unfair to you.

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,000
But I will do it today! I will definitely win!

21
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,400
Everything that happened before doesn't mean anything anymore, because Yamasaki san is a Benz owner now.

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,400
A Benz owner would never lose.

23
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,200
Are you ready, Yamasaki san?

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Champion Moriman's entrance!

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,200
There she is

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,300
There it is

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But nothing can be helped. Next time be prepared.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,400
That was an unarmed attack. That's bad.

29
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,300
Anyway, go ahead.

30
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,500
"Pre-match cheering song "Love" ~hohohoho-i~"

31
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,100
"I don't need friends"

32
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,900
"Because it would be hard to fight back"

33
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,000
Thank you for your performance

34
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,600
The first Yamasaki's round - "Pantyhose" showdown

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This round is going to be very interesting

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,400
I've already lost Yamazaki-san in comedy

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,100
Do your best!

38
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,100
He agreed with that

39
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,700
Let's start

40
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,500
Let's begin the first round

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,600
What a scary faces they have

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What a frightening faces

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,100
That's a good move

44
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,100
He is locked!

45
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,300
Moriman's Victory

46
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,000
You got him now

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He was like that

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What happened?

49
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,000
I couldn't breeze

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But we can't do anything, you have to fight.

51
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,200
Second round - "Slippers" showdown

52
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,200
Moriman's second victory

53
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,200
Yamasaki san

54
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,600
You got your face hit quite tough

55
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,700
For Yamasaki san is too difficult not to be caught

56
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,200
He really was captured

57
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,600
When he was caught, he stopped fighting

58
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,900
That was so weak

59
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,000
That was...

60
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,900
~It hurts~ It was painful?

61
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,600
I wonder if Yamasaki is already done?

62
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,600
He can still do it

63
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,700
Yamasaki san

64
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,600
Yamasaki san

65
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,500
Yes?

66
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,300
Yamasaki san

67
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,000
Yamasaki san, can you still fight?

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I will do it!

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,300
Then please choose from the board

70
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,900
Low kick showdown!

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,900
I have a bad expectation about it

72
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,400
Third round - "Low kick" showdown

73
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,500
Moriman's third victory

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,400
That was funny

75
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,300
Please win next round

76
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,600
The final showdown! The final one?

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,900
The final one?

78
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,900
Piping hot ankake showdown!

79
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,000
Fourth round - "Piping hot ankake" showdown

80
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,900
"If you run away or give up to the hot ankake - you lose"

81
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:33,900
Let's do it!

82
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,000
"Do not attempt to do this as it is dangerous"

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,200
You ran again off the stage

84
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,300
Moriman's fourth victory

85
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Moriman!

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,300
It's not over yet!

87
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,400
Don't let him get from the ring

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,500
This time, I'm in the lead and this is a vigorous fight

89
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,300
The hell you're talking about, last time you nearly died, you moron!

90
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,300
Shut the hell up!

91
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,200
Alright, let's do the final round

92
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,300
When it'll be hot next time, use water

93
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,800
Let's go with the towel battle? Let's start!

94
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,000
The final round - "Wet towel fight" showdown

95
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,600
That was good!

96
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,500
He's just fighting with himself

97
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Oh that was good

98
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,000
Go, go, go!

99
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,900
Save me!

100
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,200
Moriman's total victory

101
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,000
The only thing that he told was "Help me!"

102
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
Yamasaki's defeat!!

103
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,900
That's the only thing you must not say when you fight

104
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,900
He said "Help me!"

105
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,500
He pleaded for his life

106
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,600
He begged for his life

107
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,600
He really said "Help me!"? He did

108
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,600
Let's watch again that part

109
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
~Help me!~
