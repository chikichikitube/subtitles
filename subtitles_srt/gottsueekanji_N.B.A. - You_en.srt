Translation: eChie

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,200
If I miss this,

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,100
I'll ask Hamada-san

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,370
To hit me in the face.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,740
Will you?

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,450
Oh no!

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,150
It's gonna hurt!

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:32,650
Excuse me.

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,450
You asked the wrong person.

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,700
What angles is good?

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,870
Hamada-san won't go easy.

12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,270
Where?

13
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,570
Excuse me.

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,700
No way...

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,600
I'll hit this way,

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,200
Your face will turn that way.

17
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:56,670
Ready?

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,920
Are you going to cry?

19
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,120
I'll say "Hai" then hit.

20
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,020
Ready?

21
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,220
Thank you.
