1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,120
Gaki no Tsukai's backstage

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,730
We're here before the filming of a Gaki episode

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,890
Downtown

4
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,890
Hamada Masatoshi

5
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,890
Hamada strained his left leg during the filming of another show

6
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,890
Matsumoto Hitoshi

7
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,220
This guy strained his leg

8
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,160
Yeah, it surprised me

9
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,860
He's almost 50 now, this ain't the right time to do that

10
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,430
Maybe he wanted to go through that experience

11
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,300
He's been fine all these years

12
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,270
Cocorico

13
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,270
Endo Shozo

14
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,270
Yamazaki Hosei

15
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,300
Intact for so long... and now he goes

16
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,410
Now it feels like he has to sprain more than that

17
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,410
The hell are you talking about?

18
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,790
Man...

19
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,790
Oh?

20
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,440
Where's your partner (Tanaka)?

21
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,710
I don't really know

22
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,710
Where's jaw?

23
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,880
He's not even here to say hi

24
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,580
That's odd

25
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,820
'Morning

26
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,520
Fujiwara Kazuhiro

27
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,520
Inomoto Takafumi

28
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,520
License

29
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,520
Good morning folks   It's License

30
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,320
About Tanaka... I don't think he's coming today

31
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,490
Yes?

32
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,300
Again?

33
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,320
He's not?

34
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,320
Why is he not coming?

35
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,360
What does he mean?

36
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,030
He says he's getting very angry lately...

37
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,030
Oh, cut the crap...

38
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,400
What's the deal with him getting angry? I don't get it

39
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,660
He's not like that

40
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,400
No idea

41
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:57,470
On March Tanaka got mad at something Matsumoto said

42
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,820
That was because of Matsumoto, right?

43
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,820
That's right

44
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,200
But we're fine now

45
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,670
We've reached a compromise

46
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,500
Did you really?

47
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,470
I mean, it was a 800'000 yen worth compromise

48
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,470
With money?!

49
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,980
No idea why he didn't ask for a million

50
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,120
It doesn't make sense

51
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,120
So close yet so far

52
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,720
He said "I showed them how angry I can get and yet they still don't understand it"

53
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,660
I have no idea what he's talking about

54
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,660
What the hell?

55
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,390
He also said "I'm never filming Gaki again!"

56
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,300
He can't say that, come on

57
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,300
Oh, really?

58
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,960
We don't actually know what he's mad about

59
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,600
So we asked a staff member to go check him out

60
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:30,440
The reason why he's angry:

61
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:30,440
The staff asked Tanaka Naoki about it on this VTR

62
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,200
Do you mind watching it?

63
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,270
Oh boy...

64
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,670
What just happened?

65
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,940
It's getting hard to deal with him

66
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,940
Sorry for this

67
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,360
True, it's getting hard

68
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,980
Now that I think about it, that time we had his wife on our show she said he's hard to deal with

69
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,980
Kohinata Shie

70
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,780
He's a problem child

71
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,700
His wife said so?

72
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,850
Yes, his wife said so

73
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,850
She said he's hard to deal with?

74
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,560
Heading towards Tanaka's meeting place

75
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,910
Hey!!

76
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,300
(nickname)

77
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,300
Eraser!!

78
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,800
He's shouting so much

79
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,800
I'm here!!

80
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,240
Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

82
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,880
WHY IS HE ANGRY?
IS SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENING TO TANAKA?!

83
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:15,390
Why is Tanaka so angry?

84
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,540
What caused Tanaka's anger?

85
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,990
What is he angry about?

86
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,490
We went to our meeting place feeling uneasy

87
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,530
Hey!!

88
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,840
(nickname)

89
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,840
Eraser!!

90
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,840
He's shouting so much

91
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,190
I'm here!!

92
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,940
Here he is

93
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,270
staff) Good morning

94
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,840
There's something in his mouth

95
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,270
Hey!!

96
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,840
'Morning

97
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,190
We're glad no one was around

98
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,820
Because his voice was way too loud

99
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,140
Even his appearance left us speechless

100
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,280
Good morning

101
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,280
Hey!

102
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,330
We got to experience that same
out-of-place feeling from last time

103
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,390
Hey

104
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,760
staff) What's the deal with the luggage, Tanaka?

105
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,270
I had lots of away-from-home jobs lately!

106
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,400
Use the right word for it!

107
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:07,400
staff) So you're just carrying them around?

108
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,400
Yeah, lots of 'em recently...

109
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,120
We have a word for that

110
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,270
What the...

111
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,200
staff) Can we ask you something?

112
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,110
Where?

113
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,110
staff) Here, come with me

114
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,210
Creepy...

115
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,460
Oh, sorry

116
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,520
What do you want?

117
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,620
Rude!

118
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,520
staff) We want to ask you a lot of things

119
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,120
Is the easygoing Tanaka we see on tv just a facade...?

120
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,460
Why are they showing this again?

121
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,590
staff) Alright Tanaka, we want to hear something  from you

122
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,380
The weather is perfect though

123
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,380
- It's great

124
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,440
This is crazy

125
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,080
That thing is huge!

126
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,440
He ignores our questions and bites down
a huge chicken on the bone

127
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,500
Look at him go

128
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,900
Looks tasty...

129
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,860
It's way too large

130
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,860
Maybe he was hungry...

131
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,560
He's eating so much

132
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,550
Not the cleanest
scene to look at

133
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,850
He ate it all!

134
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,680
staff) We heard that you recently got really angry...

135
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,120
Yeah, it's 'cause of that

136
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,990
It's 'cause of Yamazaki's "Comedy Guidelines"

137
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,230
Remember the watermelon bit?

138
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,420
Yes

139
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,100
I'm angry 'cause of that

140
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:05,960
Huh?

141
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,750
But he helped us

142
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,750
What is he talking about?

143
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:14,200
DID YOU MISS THIS EPISODE? IT'S SUBBED! FIND IT ON:
SHIONNOTSUKAI.WORDPRESS.COM/2019/03/13

144
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,040
Tanaka denounces a Yamazaki-focused episode aired before

145
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,200
That was all about
Yamazaki, wasn't it?

146
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:21,360
Looks like the reason was this gag in which he dropped
a watermelon on Yamazaki's head from 10 meters...

147
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:23,710
And making it fall on Yamazaki's head: here's the trigger...

148
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:23,710
Dropping a watermelon from a 10 mts height

149
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,300
I remember this...

150
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,300
Nice one!

151
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,210
Incredible...

152
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:33,090
Tanaka's role was to drop the watermelon on him

153
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,940
At that moment, Tanaka's role was to drop the watermelon from above

154
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:38,530
But what did really happen here?

155
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,700
What made him so angry?

156
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,060
What happened?

157
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,330
I went up here (the 10mt platform)

158
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,800
And everyone down there was excited, like "yay yay yay"

159
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:52,480
What about me, huh? Didn't think of me up there, huh?

160
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,920
No way, man...

161
00:04:52,940 --> 00:05:06,120
Before the drop

162
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,680
We looked at the footage again, and it's true that they're
having a good time before the watermelon was dropped

163
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,850
Oh, don't you lie to me like that!

164
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,850
No, we won't

165
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,570
And Tanaka was left behind

166
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,120
Left behind...

167
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,710
Did that hurt him?

168
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:16,700
After the drop

169
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,290
Comedy and effort are completely different

170
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,210
Yeah, but we kinda...

171
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,130
Even after the performance, there was no highlight for Tanaka...

172
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,700
No place for him...

173
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,970
It's safe to say I came to this world to drop watermelons

174
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,670
Is he for real?

175
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,410
staff) But that was... I mean, you shared roles...

176
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,410
I can't hear ya!

177
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,940
Well, he's right

178
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,750
I can't hear ya, Eraser (staff)!

179
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,620
So, I drop one watermelon, it splits up nicely

180
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,920
And I'm like "want me to drop another one?"

181
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,830
Do you remember what Yamazaki told me?

182
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,240
Sorry, Tanaka

183
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,890
Was it not good?

184
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,890
Yeah, not good...

185
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,560
Don't you need more? I have plenty here

186
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,630
What do you think?

187
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,630
Are you an idiot?

188
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,340
I've been told "idiot" so many times before

189
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:59,610
But that's the first time it came from an idiot

190
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,040
Hey!!

191
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,040
- Whoa, slow down

192
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,610
That's too much

193
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,480
By the time I got home, anger kept on building up...

194
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,840
He's an idiot!

195
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,620
How did he even hear that?

196
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,620
- That's so dumb

197
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,520
staff) So, is Yamazaki the cause of it?

198
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:13,660
It's not really about who it was or who did it...

199
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,560
It's about how I don't feel fit for Gaki anymore

200
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,660
He's making such a
big deal about it...

201
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,060
staff) And that's why you're this angry?

202
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,370
That's why my ass

203
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,370
The hell is this?

204
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,370
What the hell...

205
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,870
Yep

206
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,820
Who cares about that?

207
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,110
staff) Is something wrong with your hand?

208
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,510
Don't touch it

209
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,580
It stinks

210
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,210
Yeah

211
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,690
The smell won't come off

212
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,260
That's 'cause you ate

213
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,230
His teeth are so dirty

214
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,230
- So dirty...

215
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,340
Just look at his eerie, soulless smile

216
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,530
His creepy smile felt very strange...

217
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,600
This is disgusting

218
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,500
- Really-- what?

219
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,500
He's freaking me out

220
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:03,640
I would have love to see him hurrying his way down the stairs
and get right in front of the camera

221
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,800
In haste?

222
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,640
You're right

223
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,680
They should have set a camera up there too

224
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,680
Yeah, that's right

225
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,680
There was no camera following him step by step

226
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,680
That's the issue

227
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,980
That would have required more staff
Makes sense, he's angry at Gaki

228
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,400
I guess that's right

229
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,550
By the way, did you know that

230
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,360
He recently made this group called "Tanaka party"?

231
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,660
Never heard of it

232
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,720
You know? When groups of comedians regularly do meetings and stuff? He made one of those

233
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,320
Well, it's a private thing

234
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,320
Nothing wrong with that

235
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,300
Actually we got invited to it ourselves...

236
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,300
To "Tanaka party"?

237
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,300
Yes

238
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,070
We took a video of it,
how about we watch it together?

239
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,400
Sure

240
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,120
Can't deny I'm interested in it

241
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,120
Me too

242
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,910
But I'm scared

243
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,660
Why would such an introverted man
found a meeting group?

244
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:51,450
We can't help but be concerned about this "Tanaka Party"...

245
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,720
We're worried about his mysterious meeting group...

246
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:59,660
P.M.5:52, Tanaka Party Infiltration Day

247
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,360
On this day, License were invited to Tanaka Party for the first time

248
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,740
- It's always so nice

249
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,740
Nice weather again

250
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,300
staff) I can tell by your pace you're nervous

251
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,170
They're moving quickly

252
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,200
That's right...

253
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,360
Maybe with License it's not impossible
for us to get some nice footage

254
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,810
But we can't help but notice the gloom
of those who know Tanaka's other face

255
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,640
And then...

256
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,280
Whoa!!

257
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,180
Holy crap

258
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,180
That caught me off guard!

259
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,840
Gimme a break...

260
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,680
Geez, what was that for?

261
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,960
He's evil

262
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,020
What are you doing?

263
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,020
Hey!

264
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,760
That's really something

265
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,330
watermelon

266
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,750
What Tanaka threw down from above their heads...

267
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,240
- It is

268
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,240
That's dangerous

269
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,690
Was a watermelon

270
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,600
It's not like Yamazaki's

271
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,600
Yeah, that was all gravity

272
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,520
Maybe he couldn't control his emotions

273
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,020
Exactly

274
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,080
Why?

275
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,310
I'm coming back

276
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,310
Sure!

277
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,930
Is that the shop?

278
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,580
'Evening

279
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,210
Good evening

280
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,810
Hi guys

281
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,210
His teeth again...

282
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,980
Did I scare you?

283
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,980
Stop it...   Give us a break

284
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,850
Shall we go?

285
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,850
Sure

286
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,880
staff) Is it ok if we film this, Tanaka?

287
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,880
Ah, today we have Gaki's cameraman...

288
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,880
Sorry about this

289
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,420
It's fine but this isn't gonna be fun at all

290
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,220
Is that ok?

291
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,220
staff) Yes, it's fine

292
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,400
Is it ok? Sorry

293
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Let's go!

294
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,160
Thank you

295
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,780
His voice...

296
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,430
Thanks for that

297
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,780
I know...

298
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,530
Don't be so tense!

299
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,530
Of course I'm gonna be after that!

300
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,900
That's not the
person I know

301
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,160
It appears a violent Tanaka lived somewhere inside him

302
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,700
- That's messed up

303
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,700
He's not that type of guy

304
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,600
His look spells "danger"

305
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,170
They're gonna meet up in a Izakaya

306
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,550
I think everyone's already there

307
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,550
Already?

308
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,120
The atmosphere inside feels different

309
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,070
And that's what made it frightening

310
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,620
Hey!

311
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,320
'Evening

312
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,540
Hi there

313
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,940
Hey hey hey hey hey!

314
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,590
Excuse us

315
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,940
Good evening

316
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,300
Welcome

317
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,030
It's a pleasure

318
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,760
That's the cameraman for Gaki

319
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,760
Ah, really?

320
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,400
Here's License

321
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,940
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you

322
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,440
It's a pleasure

323
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,140
Is that Nezumi Senpai...?

324
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,540
- Oh?

325
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,660
- Eh? This is...

326
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,140
That's right

327
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,340
I didn't know he was part of this

328
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,710
Nezumi Senpai

329
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,880
- It's really him...

330
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,710
There's a lot of people, yeah

331
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,710
Ohhh, I see...

332
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,710
- It's Nezumi Senpai

333
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,380
staff) I don't know most of them, I see Q-Taro here but everyone else...

334
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,350
You should be able to tell

335
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,260
Such a burden

336
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,830
- Who's this?

337
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,830
- Have I seen him before?

338
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,120
Cheers!

339
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,420
Cheers to us!

340
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,980
What's the relationship between him and these people?

341
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,630
We didn't get an answer from him

342
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,660
Look at him go

343
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
He's going for it

344
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,020
That's impressive

345
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,840
He doesn't drink much,
does he?

346
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,840
- Yeah...

347
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,480
One more beer please!

348
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,480
A draft beer, please

349
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,920
You surely can drink...

350
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,150
Who's this guy?!

351
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,150
- I have no clue

352
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,120
Never seen him before

353
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,420
Eat up, Tabe!

354
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,420
Ah, sorry!

355
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,470
- "Tabe"?

356
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,890
staff) Are you Mr. Tabe?

357
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,890
Yes

358
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,560
They're Tabe and Tanio from Hiyashins

359
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,770
We're Hiyashins, nice to meet you

360
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,660
Hiyashins

361
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,660
Tabe

362
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,660
Tanio

363
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,630
No idea who they are

364
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,100
As always, his appetite is immense

365
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,450
Food is disappearing in a blink of an eye

366
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,520
License are observing the situation

367
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,410
Some words a member let out...

368
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,850
And they're surprised to hear something the members often say...

369
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,940
Why is his arm broken?

370
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,710
Are you familiar with Tanaka?

371
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,350
Yeah, Our Tanaka has taken good care of me

372
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,350
Oh, is that so?

373
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,050
"Our Tanaka"?

374
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,320
"Our Tanaka"...

375
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,320
Yes   Eat up!

376
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,790
Everyone seems to refer to him as "Our Tanaka"...

377
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,220
"Our Tanaka"

378
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,220
Nickname

379
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,840
Our Tanaka...

380
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,990
It's like I was totally captured by him, you know

381
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,130
I'd say I went through a complete change

382
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,130
Tonfer

383
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,130
Yamanishi Akihiro

384
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:40,320
Q. Why do you refer to Tanaka as "Our Tanaka"?

385
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:26,500
It's like Tanaka is the nucleus and I've been absorbed as a part of it

386
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
The hell is he
talkin' about?!

387
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,980
Nezumi Senpai

388
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,980
It's Q-san who introduced me to him, and since I got here I started to call him like this

389
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,220
What the hell is this?

390
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,570
I don't get it

391
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,510
After all I've always respected Our Tanaka even before

392
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,860
And now I feel like I respect him even more

393
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:47,160
Charisma

394
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:47,490
According to the members, it seems
like Tanaka has a lot of charisma

395
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,290
Kohama Ryuuji

396
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,290
Tonfer

397
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,290
We're all "Our Tanaka", including Our Tanaka

398
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,760
I get my ideas because Our Tanaka exists

399
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,760
Konda Mitsuo

400
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,760
Zatsuki Sakka

401
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,900
We all work here, and...

402
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:02,540
Hiking Walking

403
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:02,540
Suzuki Q-Taro

404
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,370
It's really starting to look like some kind of cult

405
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,540
So, we're all here and...

406
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,580
Feels like I'm dropping feathers, you know?

407
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,580
The party goes on...

408
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,580
Are you still losing hair?

409
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,010
Eat up, Noe!

410
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,010
Sure, I'm diggin' in

411
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,150
staff) Miss Noe, how did you get in here?

412
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,030
Yes?

413
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,390
She just got in on her own

414
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,390
On her own?

415
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,190
By the way, I'm currently banging her

416
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,580
- What the hell is he saying...

417
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,530
- That's so unlike him

418
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,530
He's always joking like this

419
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,290
This is messed up

420
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,700
Hey, you gotta deny that!

421
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,900
In a way we can say it's like that

422
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,640
Ageha Noe

423
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,640
He's a senpai I really admire

424
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,640
Q. Is that the relationship you have with Tanaka?

425
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,640
Who's this?

426
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,640
- No clue

427
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,040
It's like...

428
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,040
Maybe she's worried about Tanaka's family

429
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,040
I like this place and...

430
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,810
Unclear statements...

431
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,440
But the way she talks is ambiguous

432
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,940
At any rate, it's good being part of "Our Tanaka"

433
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,850
This meeting looks boring as hell

434
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,850
Yeah, it's so stupid

435
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,880
Now that Tanaka is drunk and is feeling good, we asked him about women

436
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,390
Asking Tanaka about his relations with women

437
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,990
Wanna go for one of the ladies?

438
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,530
Eraser (staff), use your dick some more, use it!

439
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,470
What is he saying...

440
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,400
I've been drinking so much

441
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,670
- He's not the type
who would say that

442
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,670
Yeah...

443
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,360
Yeah, I know

444
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,360
- Yes...

445
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,300
I drank way too much

446
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,860
We're only left with a smile with no room for answers

447
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,280
Tanaka is always hanging out with somebody, lately

448
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:19,050
Second day of filming

449
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,050
Today it's Q-taro again

450
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,420
staff) Where are you going today?

451
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,920
To Kanaria's Bon's house

452
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,190
And do what?

453
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,420
He's got the key

454
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,290
We wanna scare him for good

455
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,570
staff) Do you often do stuff like that?

456
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,570
All the time

457
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,220
Come on, they're over 40...

458
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,890
They got the key of a junior they don't like by threatening his manager

459
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,410
Breaking into the house of a junior he doesn't like

460
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,410
I mean, that's something
you'd do when you're young...

461
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,610
And now they're breaking into his house

462
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,680
That's a crime

463
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,280
Q-taro is evil too

464
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,280
- He is

465
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,950
Lemme step in!

466
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,950
Oh shit you scared me!!

467
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,790
'Morning!!

468
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,190
Bon Mizokuro

469
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,190
Kanaria

470
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,000
Lemme see ya house!

471
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,000
No wait---

472
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,260
Look at this!

473
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,260
So dirty!

474
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,930
Hey, clean up!

475
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,930
What's going on?

476
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,560
Let's get rid of this

477
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,560
Sure thing

478
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,100
Wa-- wait, what are you doing?

479
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,500
Please stop, Tanaka!

480
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,500
Let's clean up

481
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,640
Don't joke around

482
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,460
I'm helping here

483
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,460
What the hell is this?!

484
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,440
Et voilà!

485
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,700
Voilà!

486
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,270
Wait a moment--

487
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,270
What are ya gonna do about it?

488
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,310
Stop for a second, please!

489
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,740
Your house is so dirty!

490
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,740
So dirty!

491
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,510
That's not true--- what's going on?

492
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,520
Is this where you live?

493
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,720
No! Wait! Don't!

494
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:29,390
Tanaka's abuse goes on...

495
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,760
Tanaka's abuse knows no bounds and it's going on

496
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,300
Wait a sec!

497
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,490
He's laughing so much

498
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,930
Maybe we should have stopped him...

499
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:39,210
But that wouldn't have stopped Tanaka

500
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,730
We'll come back again, Bon!

501
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,730
No wait--

502
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,950
That's crazy

503
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,650
What's this about?

504
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,100
staff) Are you just leaving it as it is?

505
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,100
That's the plan!

506
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,140
I don't care!

507
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,170
Let's go

508
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,170
Yeah let's bounce

509
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,870
We won't interfere in comedians' business

510
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,480
It's something between comedians...

511
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,080
No way

512
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:04,050
4th day of filming

513
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,800
One morning, he called License to a certain shopping district

514
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,540
He's got piercings now

515
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,920
Q-taro is with him again

516
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,290
And he's always eating something

517
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,290
- Why though?

518
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,190
Is there something good?

519
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,190
Let's see...

520
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,690
I really like backpacks

521
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,030
Oh, backpacks?

522
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,030
Yeah...

523
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,030
It happened when Q-taro was looking at the backpacks...

524
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,030
That one?

525
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:24,040
Oh, stop it, Our Tanaka!

526
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,940
What's with that name?

527
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,820
Oh please don't

528
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,040
- "Stop, Our Tanaka"...

529
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,220
Your pants

530
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,500
What the hell, man...

531
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,410
That's no good for tv

532
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,350
It sounds so weird

533
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,450
He got caught on tape

534
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,710
How can you address
someone as "Our Tanaka"?

535
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,280
These grownups surely love kids pranks

536
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,680
Come on

537
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,030
So stupid

538
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,940
And now he stops before a beauty salon

539
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,460
It's getting crowdy

540
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,460
- Is he peeping?

541
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,800
That chick is hella hot

542
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,980
That's so dumb

543
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,000
He's not ok

544
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,670
He just found a woman he likes

545
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,860
Ah, he's chewing a gum,
that's what it is

546
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,070
Oh shit, I'd love to bang her!

547
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,070
Oh, is that it?

548
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,070
- Yep

549
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,960
Can't you just--

550
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,640
Look, there's a crowd around us

551
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,990
I don't care, this is important

552
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,840
No I mean--

553
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,990
There are so many people watching us

554
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,980
Tell me your (phone) number!

555
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,980
Tanaka, please...   Wait, Tanaka-

556
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,380
Hey, calm down

557
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,380
Tanaka...

558
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,480
Your number, please!

559
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,480
Calm down, Tanaka

560
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,080
Oh boy

561
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,820
Let's leave

562
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,820
Tanaka, please--

563
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,760
Once his lust kicks in, there's no way to stop it

564
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,110
Wow, they're surrounded

565
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,860
Oh boy, I wanna have sex

566
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,860
Your voice is too loud, Tanaka

567
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,330
We're in a shopping district...

568
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Tanaka is even more outspoken than before

569
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,840
staff) You speak a lot about girls, don't you?

570
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,670
Well, my dick is always ready

571
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,680
But recently my sexual desires are impressive

572
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,680
The way he said "dick"...

573
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,980
He put so much stress on the word "dick"!

574
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,020
His growing desires are slammed against a vending machine

575
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,440
Oh!

576
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,440
Is that you?

577
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,900
You can't do that

578
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,590
That's messed up

579
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,590
- The hell is he doing?

580
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,520
Do you hate him?

581
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,690
No, I'm not angry!

582
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,360
Let's just stop doing this--

583
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,700
What are you doin--- seriously? Stop it!

584
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,180
What the hell, man

585
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,160
He has lost it

586
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,900
You're the worst!

587
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,820
I would have killed him

588
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,820
- He's crazy

589
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,970
Man, you're the worst!

590
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,970
It's fine

591
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,040
Inomoto, that's fine I say

592
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,040
Are you serious?

593
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,010
Fine? What's fine?

594
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,980
This is close to madness

595
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,980
Come on now

596
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,110
That's too much, man

597
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,850
And his fangs are ready to bite everything in this world

598
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,180
That looks delicious

599
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,320
Is that meat?

600
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,320
That's dry-cured ham

601
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,560
Don't tell me...

602
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,660
Oh no, quit it!

603
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,620
You can't do that!

604
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,620
- Oi...

605
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:27,100
He merciless bites off a dry-cured black iberian pig ham

606
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,680
He's pissing me off

607
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,060
It's hard to watch

608
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,600
This is too much

609
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,960
What are you doing?

610
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,870
That was so delicious

611
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,870
We thought "let's quit filming this"

612
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,570
But just before we could finish that thought...

613
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,960
We felt a thirst for blood in his eyes

614
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,580
Looks like there's something in front of him

615
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,220
What's wrong?

616
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,070
What happened?

617
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,740
No way

618
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,200
Wait!

619
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,200
Eh!?

620
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,240
Hey, hey, hey...

621
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,600
Wait, calm down

622
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,360
That's too much

623
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,990
What the hell are you doing?

624
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,990
What was that for?

625
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,600
Oh man, it's hard to watch

626
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,060
Was that necessary?

627
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,060
Camera!

628
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,410
That must have triggered him

629
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,410
- That's right

630
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,740
What--- how much for these?

631
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:15,030
Just like a volcano, Tanaka's dormant
dangerous sentiments exploded

632
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,080
Dangerous sentiments...

633
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:21,050
Forbidden watermelon

634
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,930
It was the forbidden fruit, the watermelon...

635
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,790
It's always like that

636
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,790
Is that so?

637
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,960
Whenever I see a watermelon, I start punching 'em around

638
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,650
And yet, his eyes looked lonely to us

639
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,030
That sad look in his eyes worried us...

640
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,210
One day we happened to see a new
face at the game center at night

641
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:42,040
6th day of filming

642
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:48,940
A paradise for lovers

643
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,210
That's a place commonly associated with couples

644
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,880
And then we realized Tanaka was part of them

645
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,160
I like you!

646
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,540
That's it?

647
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,420
We couldn't believe our eyes...

648
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,420
And there we saw something we couldn't believe...

649
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:09,800
Coming next

650
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:09,800
Something unprecedented at the game center!!

651
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,680
What is he doing?   No way

652
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,800
This guy...   That's not ok

653
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,240
6th day of filming

654
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:17,570
We happened to see Tanaka in a game center during the night...

655
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,210
The reason why he's here today...

656
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,240
Is to spend his free time with his secret lover...

657
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:29,050
Secret date with his lover...

658
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,080
You're pretty good at this

659
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,080
I'm almost there

660
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,380
Come here, come here!

661
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,040
It feels as if they just fell in love with each other

662
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,040
That's a lot

663
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,820
So we decided to quit filming

664
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,080
But as soon as we decided that...

665
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,030
This one here

666
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,730
That's really cute, isn't it?

667
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,100
It is

668
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,930
It's cute

669
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,570
Just like you

670
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,640
What are you doing?

671
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,620
No way

672
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
It's so embarrassing!

673
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,940
I hate this

674
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,970
Tanaka was completely defenseless

675
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,690
What the hell

676
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:04,270
If this kind of info gets on the media, Tanaka's comedian career could be ruined for good

677
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,090
Given that he has a wife and kids

678
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,160
I'm embarrassed...

679
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,160
Come on, baby

680
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,160
The hell is he doing?

681
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,360
What the fuck

682
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,030
What are you embarrassed for?

683
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,200
Just stop it, please

684
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,200
- What's this?!

685
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:23,450
We can say he's the first comedian who made such a complete transformation

686
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,100
Is this legal?

687
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,810
I don't know anymore

688
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,210
Check out her calve muscles

689
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,410
They felt incomplete

690
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,810
We couldn't just stay still in front of a colleague of ours

691
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,410
- You're right

692
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,450
staff) Tanaka, Tanaka

693
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,520
Sorry

694
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,590
You...

695
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,590
'Evening

696
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,320
What are you filming?

697
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,320
Sorry for this

698
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,390
staff) Is that your girlfriend?

699
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,390
That's right

700
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,300
staff) Have you been dating for long?

701
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,580
Not really

702
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,500
staff) I've been filming you for some time by now

703
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
staff) It's been some time

704
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,470
Why are you filming us?

705
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,690
As a tv star, you should avoid doing such things

706
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,010
But-- I mean...

707
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,050
I have no problems with it

708
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,600
The hell is he doing?

709
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,600
- Seriously, what the...

710
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,580
We are left speechless

711
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,880
It's hard to watch

712
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,880
- I'm really sorry

713
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,600
This went way beyond what we would have thought of

714
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,880
I don't know what to think

715
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,880
- Yeah...

716
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,000
Quit filming, you

717
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,000
The hell is this?

718
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,770
We couldn't sense any happiness in him leaving with his lover

719
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,910
All we could sense was his poorly concealed loneliness...

720
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:32,170
Carrying loneliness on his back...

721
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:36,220
I'm not used to see him stand out so much

722
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,220
Yeah, that's incredible

723
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,450
I agree

724
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,950
Even the other folks were awful, saying "Our Tanaka" here and there

725
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,800
Yeah, right

726
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,540
Q-taro couldn't stop saying it

727
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,100
Yeah, that guys sucks too

728
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,560
You could explain to me the meaning of
"Our Tanaka" a thousand times, I'd never get it

729
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,560
I have no clue

730
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,560
Same for us, actually

731
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:55,430
By the way, that guy you saw sometimes
on camera is an actor called Mr. Taka

732
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,430
Oh, is he an actor?

733
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,460
That's a big problem

734
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,740
Coming next

735
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,740
The eccentric man appears!!

736
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,660
Is that his type?

737
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,280
Oh?

738
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,280
'Morning

739
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,350
What should we do?

740
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,810
I mean, he felt very lonely...

741
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,810
Even if you say so

742
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,680
He still has his calve muscles lady with him

743
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,680
Yeah, she had some bruises too

744
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,380
That's a big problem

745
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,900
Is that his type?

746
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,900
Yeah...

747
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,320
Oh?

748
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,320
'Morning

749
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,530
It's Tanaka

750
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,190
Tanaka?

751
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,190
Wait

752
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,350
Man, you're...

753
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,700
Good morning, Matsumoto

754
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,700
Have you lost it?

755
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,360
Don't just... Not like this

756
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,790
It's all out, man

757
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,790
Quit it already!

758
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,990
I've said it before, haven't I? "I'll go around naked", didn't I?

759
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,430
And here I am, naked!

760
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,780
Yeah let's just stop---

761
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,780
We got it, alright...

762
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,430
This is a small watermelon

763
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,530
It's really good

764
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,880
You're shouting so much

765
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:36,040
This is really good, please eat it up guys!

766
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,040
Got it, got it

767
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,040
Sure...

768
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,810
Now, let's go filming!

769
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,660
Go wear a jersey

770
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,800
Dress up first

771
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,010
Your jersey

772
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,120
If you wanted to go naked, then why are you wearing panties?

773
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,250
Oh fuck

774
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,020
This guy is pissing me off so much

775
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,940
Quit it, Tanaka

776
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,940
What now

777
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,420
What are you-!?

778
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:57,330
Nakamura Yoshinobu

779
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:57,330
Producer

780
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,540

781
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,080

782
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,630
You can't

783
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:02,000
That's what ya get from the watermelon dropper!!

784
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,730
Remember that!!

785
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,730
It's our producer, you know

786
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,100
I'm going ahead first!

787
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,910
How can we start filming with this atmosphere...?

788
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,910
Yeah...

789
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:11,940
He's crazy

790
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,880
Do we have a towel here?

791
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,880
My partner has lost it

792
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,630
I'm sorry about this

793
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,220
And for some reason Nakamura got involved in this

794
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,220
He snapped at him

795
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,460
He's --- oh no

796
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,820
Oh shit he's back

797
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,820
Watch out!

798
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,880
What the hell, man...

799
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,180

800
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,140

802
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,390

804
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,440
Wear your jersey, man!

805
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,100
Nakamura is completely drenched in watermelon

806
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,100
That's too much...

807
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,100
Sorry about this

808
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,860
It's fine

809
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,840
Anyway, what should we do about---

810
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,540
He's here again

811
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,540
Again?!

812
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,440
Let's go!!

813
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,440
Stop it!

814
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,000
I'll wait for ya

815
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,820
We're coming

816
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,880
It made a weird sound

817
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,880
Come on!

818
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,780
We're coming, we're coming

819
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,450
What are ya waitin' for?!

820
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,640
His head made a weird sound

821
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,640
He has lost it

822
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,290
Let's just go

823
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,290
Yeah, let's not waste time

824
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:04,190
The Tanaka stalking VTR are all fictional.
Even the objects Tanaka interacted with
And the people he came in contact with
Were all staged and prepared in advance.
