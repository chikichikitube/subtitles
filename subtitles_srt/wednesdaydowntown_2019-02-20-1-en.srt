00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,680
Hello everyone, welcome to Wednesday's Downtown.

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,580
Today's presenter is this person!  Welcome!

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,820
It's Viking Kotouge!

4
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,920
I'm not a pin mic!

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,240
I'm not a pin mic.

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,860
I thought my pin mic was standing over there.

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,740
What kind of system is this?

8
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:49,020
Today we have that annual series, which is:

9
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,020
2018 Advance Prank Notice

10
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,400
This series has become a staple at this time of year.

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,400
We investigated who was pranked the most throughout the year...

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,400
...and told them in advance that we would prank them over the course of a week.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,460
At the end of the week they tell us what they believe to be a prank.

14
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,920
Doesn't the person who gets pranked the most usually present this segment?

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,100
That's how we've done it every year.

16
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,940
But...enough of that.

17
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,420
So in 2014 and 2015 I was first place in back-to-back years.

18
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,240
And one of the pranks they did on me was all the way in Nagoya.

19
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:35,940
We were waiting at a traffic light when my own car passed in front of me.

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,000
Who are the most-pranked entertainers in 2018?

21
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,000
This year we'll be doing the Advance Prank Notice with "that" comedian!

22
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:55,100
We'll be starting the Scream-1 Grand Prix! Get points with screams and laughter!

23
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,260
Getting screams is rather easy.

24
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,520
As well, finding the guy with the longest hair in Japan!

25
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,350
And a chanting competition with Nakamori Akina's DESIRE!

26
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,700
The most-pranked entertainers of 2018...

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,120
Three people are tied for 8th, having been pranked seven times.

28
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,240
Karina Maruyama, who become popular last year.

29
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,080
Nadal from Korokoro Chikichiki Peppers...

30
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,230
...and Kotouge from Viking.

31
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,020
By the way, Kotouge is the only one...

32
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,740
...to have made the Top Ten rankings for five years in a row.

33
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,600
7th is Otake from Jungle Pocket with eight times.

34
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,280
6th is Okarina from Okazu Club with nine times.

35
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,620
Most Pranked in 2018 Rankings

36
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,620
Next at number five is...

37
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,590
Viking Nishimura, with ten times.

38
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,140
Instead of having a "pranker" and a "prankee"...

39
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,440
...they both end up being pranked a lot.

40
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,440
The two of them are in the rankings.

41
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,040
They're a weird Combi right?

42
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,860
It's pathetic, isn't it.

43
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,720
Next, two entertainers are tied for third.

44
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,400
Ganbareruya's Yoshiko, with eleven times.

45
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,960
Even with a long break at the end of the year...

46
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,260
...the popular entertainer secured a third place finish.

47
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,620
Tied for third is Fujiwara from Fujimoto.

48
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,680
So far, all the faces we think of when we think "dokkiri".

49
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
Next is number two...

50
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,100
Ogata from Panther with fourteen times.

51
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,900
The man whose career started with the help of "dokkiri"...

52
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,600
...is getting "a second break" thanks to dokkiri.

53
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,460
He has been pranked on shows on every channel...

54
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,020
...leading to a respectable second place.

55
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,000
Finally, the one who rose to take the number one spot is...

56
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,870
Sanshiro's Komiya, with fifteen times.

57
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,710
He just barely missed the top spot in 2017...

58
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,520
...but this time it was he who won
by the slimmest of margins.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,920
Our most-pranked entertainer of 2018 is Komiya!

60
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,390
Tecchan, you don't really get pranked any more?

61
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,430
For me nowadays it might happen two or three times a year...

62
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,940
...right around the time when the seasons change.

63
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,460
Occasionally it happens.

64
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,300
So Komiya was number one for 2018, but...

65
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,980
...Komiya already did this challenge last year.

66
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,520
So this time we got this man to take the challenge instead.

67
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,020
This time, the man stepping up to the Advance Notice Prank challenge is...

68
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,040
Second place in the dokkiri rankings, Panther's Ogata.

69
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,830
Staff: Ogata-san...

70
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:43,810
Staff: In 2018, out of all the entertainers who were pranked...

71
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,810
Second place? Is that so?

72
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,140
Is that a good thing?

73
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,060
I'm not quite sure.

74
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,040
There was only a one point difference between Ogata and the champion, Komiya.

75
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,750
As someone who was pranked 14 times throughout the year...

76
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,480
...Ogata should be able to tell when he is being pranked.

77
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,600
If we prank Ogata seven times throughout the week...

78
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,280
...will he notice all of them?

79
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,090
One Week Advance Notice Prank Investigation.

80
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,270
Honestly I think I'll be ok.

81
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,570
I'm quite sensitive.

82
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,080
Staff: Sensitive?

83
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,080
Yes.

84
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,220
Compared to the previous challengers...

85
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,260
...of Kotouge, Saito, and Komiya...

86
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,600
...he is, by far, the most obtuse.

87
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,800
I think I will realize right away, to be honest.

88
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,600
For the extremely confident Ogata, we have the following pranks:

89
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,520
#1 - Slightly far-away Kan (one of Ogata's partners in Panther) is not really Kan.

90
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,920
#2 - Car navigation audio recording is fake.

91
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,440
#3 - Setsubun (end of winter holiday) event demon is a very tough opponent.

92
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,560
#4 - The living room at home is a little smaller.

93
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,140
#5 - Anmika with no makeup is really somebody else.

94
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,620
#6 - Squid (instead of octopus) inside of takoyaki.

95
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,840
#7 - Walk past the same scary man every day.

96
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,320
Cameras are following Ogata around all week.

97
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,860
We will execute each of these pranks during this timeframe.

98
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,560
After one week, Ogata will tell us what he believes was a prank...

99
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,370
...out of the things he experienced.

100
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,360
As someone who is sensitive to pranks (according to himself)...

101
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,210
...will he be able to point out all of the pranks?

102
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,550
One Week Later

103
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,890
Good morning!

104
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:45,220
I was constantly searching and looking. Yeah...

105
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,540
It was tough.

106
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:51,220
Staff: Are you confident?

107
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,220
I am!

108
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,560
Ogata wrote all of the suspicious events that he experienced in his notebook.

109
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,380
Will Ogata manage to call out all of the pranks?

110
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,780
The first event he thinks was a prank was...

111
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,540
First off, this one has to be a prank.

112
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,380
I went to a bean-throwing event at a preschool.

113
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,720
At this event, I would throw beans at the demon.

114
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,930
When I threw the beans, the demon would fall to the ground.

115
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,500
However, no matter how many times I hit him with the beans...

116
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,730
...he kept getting up!

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,730
When I did this, he was smirking under the mask.

118
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,600
I thought to myself, "this has to be a prank."

119
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,200
But I pushed through to the end.

120
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,380
Demons, get out!  Good luck, come in!

121
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,860
He ran out of beans.

122
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:36,400
For 10 long minutes Ogata would continue fighting this formidable demon.

123
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,160
We're both huffing and puffing as we're tussling.

124
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,660
He hit me so many times with the stick.

125
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,540
Such a thing...

126
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,540
If it was, that school is sick and wrong.

127
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,070
If that's real...that's one messed-up preschool.

128
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,570
If that's real...that's one messed-up preschool.

129
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,570
The second incident Ogata thinks was a prank.

130
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,610
We used my house one day for work...

131
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,500
...my house was the location...

132
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,010
...and the director for that...

133
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,310
...had the smelliest feet!

134
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,580
It smelled SO bad!

135
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,590
He had the face of a man with smelly feet.

136
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,830
You could see yellow fumes coming out like in a comic book.

137
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,390
It was so bad I thought it had to be one of the pranks.

138
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,800
It was just a staff member from one of his regular shows.

139
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,060
Ogata unnecessarily insulted him.

140
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,070
Ogata's hopes for 100% are already gone.

141
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:47,070
The third incident Ogata thinks was a prank.

142
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,510
There's a bathhouse I go to frequently...

143
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,080
...about four times a week.

144
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:55,220
The water at the bathhouse...

145
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,910
...was a little bit slimy.

146
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,590
The employees looked a little nervous, too.

147
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,080
This is the first we've heard of this type of hot water.

148
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,100
Ogata, supposedly sensitive to pranks, gets two wrong in a row.

149
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,100
...and then...

150
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,610
I have a junior called Ichikippurin.

151
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,910
He tells me, "there's this really good ramen place."

152
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,910
So I went.

153
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,910
And it was really bad.

154
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,920
My wife...

155
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,250
She was snoring so much...

156
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,790
...like an old man.

157
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,930
If this isn't one of the pranks, then I seriously...

158
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,730
...it would turn me off from my wife a bit.

159
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:49,140
Ogata continues to insult the people around him of his own accord.

160
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,140
The sixth incident Ogata thinks was a prank.

161
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:57,810
I bought a car...

162
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:02,020
I converted my Land Cruiser 80 to a Land Cruiser 60 body.

163
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,020
I was very particular about the details.

164
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,820
It's a car that I cherish.

165
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:12,690
On the right side, by the handles, there was a 10 yen punch mark.

166
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,500
Do you know the 10 yen punch?  It leaves a scratch.

167
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,430
I definitely think it's one of them.

168
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,970
That was really vicious.

169
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,270
It's right up Wednesday Downtown's alley.

170
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,070
As if!

171
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,790
Isn't that really sinister?

172
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Even we wouldn't go that far.

173
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:40,240
At the end of the day, the notebook was full of issues from his daily life.

174
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,140
Finally, the seventh incident Ogata thinks was a prank is...

175
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,170
I had a job where I walked around town.

176
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,330
Just around the town...

177
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,480
There was a meat store with lots of fried things, like croquettes.

178
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,340
The person who worked there...

179
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,640
...previously worked for Wednesday Downtown.

180
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,180
I was pranked like, "what if a weirdo was disturbing your job?"  Do you remember that?

181
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:13,120
This is the dining room "Solitary Gourmet" comes to.

182
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
...excuse me...

183
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,380
Everyone becomes more energetic with... the fish...

184
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,020
...excuse me...

185
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,830
...we're filming for TV right now, I'm sorry... YES...

186
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,540
The employee was that weirdo, definitely.

187
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,040
Yes, during the fake walking around town filming...

188
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,860
How long have you been doing this? 40 years?

189
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,860
46 years.

190
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:45,720
Dressed as the owner of the meat shop was the weirdo that Ogata had previously encountered.

191
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,880
I see...

192
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,660
His face is like,
"No way right?"

193
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,000
His energy is so low!

194
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,010
That face left such a strong impression on me. It's like - I still have dreams about it.

195
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,840
I will never forget that face.  Ever.

196
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,820
A regular person I wouldn't have noticed, but THAT guy...

197
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,550
I'm already looking...

198
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,160
...that guy was definitely one of the pranks.  Yes.

199
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,340
However, this time...

200
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,690
The prank wasn't just at the "walking around town" gig.

201
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,960
Even if it was just a moment...

202
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,720
...he passed by this man every day.

203
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,600
Ogata's answer that the owner of the meat store was the weirdo...

204
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,040
...was close, but no cigar.

205
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,220
So, here we reveal the pranks to Ogata.

206
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,960
Staff: You only got one correct.

207
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,230
Only one?!

208
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,220
We told him which one we got correct.

209
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,190
Wait, what about the slime?

210
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,190
Staff: That was wrong.

211
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,070
Ehh, that's scary!

212
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:15,310
Fact: The bathhouse has slimy bath water.

213
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,170
What was that slime?

214
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,310
That's so disgusting!

215
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,480
Staff: The director with smelly feet was real, too.

216
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,480
Oh no...I was so rude...

217
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,290
The 10 yen punch on your Land Cruiser is also real.

218
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,290
Who does that?

219
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,780
Does that mean someone is messing with me?

220
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,400
Ogata, who could only identify one out of seven pranks...

221
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,170
...is about to find out about the other six pranks.

222
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,160
Is it the handshake event?

223
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,990
Staff: What handshake event?

224
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,990
Yoshimotozaka.

225
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,220
Staff: It's not the handshake event.

226
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,220
Oh, it's not?

227
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,020
Staff: Didn't you have another job at Yoshimotozaka?

228
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,180
Wait, is it the car navigation?

229
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,720
We're going to have someone handle one prefecture each...

230
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,520
...and provide the voice for the car navigation.

231
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,070
Ogata-san, we're going to have you do Hokkaido.

232
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,880
Staff: The car navigation recording was all fake.

233
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,080
That was fake?

234
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,080
I was saying normal things...

235
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,900
Turn left, thank you.

236
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,900
"Turn left, thank you!"

237
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,420
"Up ahead is a dedicated left-turn lane, thank you!"

238
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,250
Could we get "continue straight" in the four different variations?

239
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,900
"Continue straight for one kilometer."

240
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,480
"Continue straight for ten kilometers."

241
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,370
"Continue straight for 100 kilometers."

242
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,880
"Continue straight for 1000 kilometers."

243
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,880
"Continue straight for 1000 kilometers."

244
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,180
Oh yeah, I guess if you think about it...

245
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,180
...that would mean you're driving straight for 1000 kilometers.

246
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,510
"1000 kilometers ahead, turn right."

247
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,280
"10,000 kilometers ahead, turn right."

248
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,070
Wow, he doesn't notice with this?

249
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,740
This guy's a moron.

250
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,740
He doesn't realize with this!

251
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,060
Next we're doing some destinations.

252
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,720
There are some kanji I can't read.

253
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,300
"Shimukappu." (a real place)

254
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,900
"You have arrived in Shimukappu!"

255
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,190
What's this next one?

256
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,250
Katocha. (a fake place)

257
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,590
Katocha?

258
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,740
"You have arrived in Katocha!"

259
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,500
There's more...

260
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,920
"A bear has appeared."

261
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,270
It's Hokkaido...

262
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,940
Bears come out, don't they?

263
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,100
"A bear is causing this 10 kilometer-long traffic jam."

264
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,610
Next, please.

265
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,140
You're kidding me!

266
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,600
"You ran over a bear."

267
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,620
Could you lower your tone a little?

268
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,120
Kind of like you feel bad about it.

269
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:24,630
"You ran over a bear."

270
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,470
He treated every demand very seriously...

271
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,140
...completely ignoring the weird things he had to say.

272
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,090
Rurururu...a fox has appeared!

273
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,720
A crab has appeared!

274
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,640
For the next prank reveal...

275
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,760
Staff: Did anyone come say hi to you in the green room?

276
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,290
Do you know what show this was for?

277
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,260
The King's Brunch.

278
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,620
Anmika-san?

279
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,280
Anmika-san?  What about her?

280
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,740
Excuse me...

281
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,140
I'm Anmika, nice to meet you!

282
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,560
The person who came into Ogata's green room was "Anmika without makeup"...

283
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,800
...but in reality was a completely different person.

284
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,480
She came in with no makeup.

285
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,640
I was thinking to myself, "she looks pretty old."

286
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,490
I did think her face looked a little different.

287
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,490
But isn't that what the entertainment industry is like?

288
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,460
An acquaintance of mine...

289
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,330
...gave me me a bunch of these new dog treats.

290
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,170
I've been handing them out to other dog owners.

291
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,170
Oh, is that so?  Thank you very much.

292
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,660
Excuse me for not having makeup on.

293
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,510
Anmika-san? That was really Anmika-san?

294
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,450
So that's Anmika-san...

295
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,680
The voice seemed like her.

296
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,690
Yes, this time the face is completely different, but...

297
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,140
I'm Anmika, nice to meet you!

298
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,840
...we recorded her voice beforehand.

299
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,370
We put a speaker in her mouth and played the audio.

300
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,280
Going on...

301
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,150
Arinkurin brought me some takoyaki.

302
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,560
Staff: Those were filled with squid.

303
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,320
It wasn't octopus?

304
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,490
What kind of prank is that?!

305
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
As for his living room...

306
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,480
By making part of the wall 10cm thicker...

307
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,800
...we made the room slightly smaller.

308
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,270
Staff: We made the wall 10cm thicker.

309
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,710
Eh...

310
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,660
...what kind of prank is that?!

311
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,680
Ogata didn't notice the slightly smaller living room through the whole week.

312
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,780
Next...

313
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,220
Staff: Didn't you go to the Yoshimoto offices?

314
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,170
Yeah, I did.

315
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,460
Staff: Did you see anyone there?

316
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,170
Ohh, like Mukai and Kan...

317
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,400
Kan-san (fake Kan)
standing in the distance.

318
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,030
Ogata-san!

319
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,840
Ogata-san, what time do you finish today?

320
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,080
Mukai is real...

321
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,710
...but the person next to him is not their partner Kan.

322
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,540
...but an artist who looks a lot like Kan:

323
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,350
Keiji Muranaka from wacci.

324
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,000
What time do you finish?

325
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,200
Around 11 for me.

326
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:40,390
Ahh, someone was saying they wanted to grab a drink with you.

327
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,790
What?

328
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,790
Someone was saying they wanted to get a drink with you.

329
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,970
What are you doing?

330
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,220
Filming.

331
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,740
He doesn't know
his own partner?

332
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,610
Who the hell is this?!

333
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,250
Ehhh!

334
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,730
So that wasn't Kan?!

335
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,400
Finally, we have the weirdo that Ogata partially noticed.

336
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,960
Staff: For seven days, you crossed paths every day.

337
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,180
Ehh?

338
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,630
The whole time?

339
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,760
What do you mean?

340
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,460
Seven times?

341
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,000
Every day?

342
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,580
Ehh?!

343
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,780
So scary!

344
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,240
What kind of ending was that?

345
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,580
He got so many wrong!

346
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,440
Is it really that hard to tell?

347
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,590
Seriously, with the car navigation - what's wrong with him?

348
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:50,030
It means he thinks that kind of situation is realistic, right?

349
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,870
That if you run over a bear, your car can detect it...

350
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,400
...and let you know you ran over a bear.

351
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,700
If you run over a bear...

352
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,020
...your car would be destroyed.

353
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,310
He thinks today's car navigation systems can let us know these things.

354
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,020
But isn't it crazy he didn't recognize Kan-san?

355
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,020
It's someone you work with every day.

356
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,240
Kan is one of the partners in your group!

357
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,500
Yeah, but if you lined up our staff here with a chimpanzee...

358
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,460
...I might think it was Hamada.

359
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,460
If it was behaving like this..
