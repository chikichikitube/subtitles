00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,850
It's like an old lady doing what she wants

8
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:13,360
I always wanted to try this!!

Absolutely tasty Okonomiyaki challenge

9
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,590
Trying innovative recipes!

10
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,360
It's the absolutely tasty Okonomiyaki challenge!

11
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,760
First up was Hamada

12
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,330
Hamada's innovation was curry

13
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,960
Oh I get it

14
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,330
It's curry

15
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,330
Wow

16
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,330
This is good!

17
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,100
Are you gonna put it on now?

18
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,300
Well since it's curry sauce

19
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:26,470
Of course that's gonna be good

20
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,270
Of course that's gonna be good

21
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:28,840
How did it taste like?

22
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,980
How did it taste like?

23
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,840
Can I say something?

24
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,680
This is so freaking delicious

25
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,220
Honestly, I can eat 2 of these!!

26
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,550
Then there was Endo with his diet menu

27
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,730
Endo's innovation was protein

28
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,260
Protein okonomiyaki

29
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,730
This is bad for sure!

30
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:52,100

Yellow

34
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,100
Thoughtfully picked ingredients with low calorie content

35
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,100
Endo why don't

36
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,470
just go to Matsumoto's house and make it there

37
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,000
However, how was the taste?

38
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,640
However, how was the taste?

39
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,280
I didn't think it was going to be this stiff

40
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,850
this is awful!!

41
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:07,480
It gets all over your gums doesn't it

42
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,620
It gets all over your gums doesn't it

43
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,320
The concept has changed a little

44
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,600
Tanaka's dish was foil cooked salmon

45
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,600
Then Tanaka with his well thought out foil cooked salmon

46
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,260
Wow it's properly steamed

47
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,960
The scent is amazing

48
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,330
The scent is amazing

49
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:23,860
But how was the main taste?

50
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,830
But how was the main taste?

51
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,730
It's all gooey, absolutely disgusting!!

52
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,240
It's all gooey, absolutely disgusting!!

53
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600

60
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,280
but who will be the winner?

61
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,460

each person presents two dishes

Pickles?

85
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,200
Kyo! (Kyoto style)

86
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,860

94
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,850
That doesn't make sense 'cause it has stuff from Akita and Fukuoka too

95
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,170
Iburigakko (Akita)

96

Mix the pickles into the batter

105
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,110
Aren't you putting too much in?

106
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,910
It's better for the taste if they soak together

107
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,220
Ooooh okay...

108
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,350
This might have potential

109
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,290
As soon as I heard we were doing this, this idea came to me

110
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,570
Instantly?

111
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,900
THE OIL

112
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,650
He forgot the oil

113
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,070
50.000 yen!!

114
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,140
I've said it so many times and you still don't get it right!!

115
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,340
Another 50.000 yen

116
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,820
Hang on a second here

117
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,980
The colour of the oil is odd though

118
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,110
Aren't you gonna use the meat?

119
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,480
Aren't you gonna use the meat?

120
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,680
Well, because the...

121
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,750
pickles have a crunch to them

122
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,720
I'll fry it so that the meat doesn't become crunchy too

123
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,820
I'll fry it so that the meat doesn't become crunchy too

124
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,910
Seriously this is starting to...

125
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,930
kinda...

126
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,960
This idea might get stolen ya know

127
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,280
Good isn't it?

128
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,370
The lining up pattern, Yeah it's good

129
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,820

Put the pork over the batter

133
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,340
His dishes were so messed up it was awful

134
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,420
Do we even need the meat?

135
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,880
He could've just went with the taste of the pickles right?

136
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,380
With a simple approach cause it's not negiyaki is it

137
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,380
Yeah you're right

138
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,250
This looks good

139
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,910

Cooking Step 3

145
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,660
Cover and cook for
3 minutes on medium heat

146
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,490
There hasn't been any real taste until now

147
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,270
There hasn't been any real taste until now

148
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,270
There hasn't been any taste huh?

149
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,700
We had curry didn't we

150
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,070
We had curry didn't we

151
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,640
Just tasteless and flat

152
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,300
The curry had taste though

153
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,510
The curry had taste though

154
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,370
Tanaka's was really tasteless wasn't it?

155
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:22,870
Exactly

156
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,780
That's why I'm saying we had curry

157
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,750
Look at the balance to the right, it's -150.000 yen

158
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,740
You're right

159
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,420
Look it says 150.000 yen

160
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,090
There's also a skinhead

161
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,390
Even though it says skinhead

162
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,960
We can see Tanaka's hairline clearly

163
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,260
If he was a skinhead you wouldn't be able to tell would ya!!

164
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,270
What a face he's making

165
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,140
So how did Housei's dish turn out?

166
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,440
What's up with this water?

167
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,240
There's so much water

168
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,310
Did it come from the inside?

169
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,800
Oh I get it, because of the pickles

170
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,920
I think he's done

171
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,920
Yes I'm ready

172
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,890
Looks great

173
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,860
Housei's first dish

174
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,860
Pickles from all around the country Okonomiyaki

175
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,880
How does Housei's confident creation taste?

176
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,680
If we had some sauce

177
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,800
this could be dangerous

178
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,200
First we try it "plain"

179
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,200
First we try it "plain"

180
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,110
That's what I'm scared of the most though

181
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,250
Itadakimasu

182
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,280
Smells nice

183
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,410
Delicious

184
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,600
This is delicious

185
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,680
I guess this is how it tastes huh

186
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,620
Seriously though, it's great

187
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,620
It's delicious

188
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,420
Delicious!!

189
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,190
What is this even?

190
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,160
It's good but

191
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,960
I wouldn't say it with such a loud voice

192
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,190
I really think this is delicious but

193
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,330
I really think this is delicious but

194
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,730
Don't you think there's too many pickles in this?

195
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,820
Then you can go change it yourself

196
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
How many points?

197
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
I think I'd give it

198
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,980
9 points

199
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:04,980
Wow..

200
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,750
If I were to say it super strictly though then a 2

201
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,620
If I were to say it super strictly though then a 2

202
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,400
Housei who is currently at the top gets 9 points!

203
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,050
What can we expect of the second dish?

204
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,020
It can't get better from now on so...

205
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,340
I'll do even better don't worry

206
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,030
Nope, no good

207
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,570

This might be a little...

215
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,770
This is straight up trash

216
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,340
This is just a normal pancake

217
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,770
Its not a pancake. Do pancakes have cabbage in it?

We already get it's bad before cooking

Bare with me Hamada-san

223
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,120
We need some kind of dessert

Grandpa's gonna have the cucumber

330
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,370
Grandma's gonna have the dried gourd

331
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,910
That's mine! I'll have the dried gourd!!

332
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,240
There will be smiles on everyone's faces

333
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,110
Cause I'm putting the rice facing upwards

334
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,050
Cause I'm putting the rice facing upwards

335
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,880
I wonder how it'll turn out when I flip it

336
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,220
Any brainless fool can figure it out right?

337
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,090
Huh?

338
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,760
Won't it turn crispy?

339
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,890
I want you guys to enjoy this crispiness

340
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,230
I want you guys to enjoy this crispiness

341
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,310
So this is the technique huh

342
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,800
Will this really be good?

343
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,140
It's completely changed now

344
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,470
It's a completely different thing now

345
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,740
This is so comical

346
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,510
Well...

347
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,080
Well it is something but we're doing Okonomiyaki

348
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,350
Worth noting is that I'm adding the tastyness of the fried rice

349
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,720
Worth noting is that I'm adding the tastyness of the fried rice

350
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,120
It's called the aesthetic of failure

351
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,650
We also have the fact that fried rice has kind of strong negative image to it

352
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,160
I'm scorching my opponent

353
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,360
turning it into a negative surprise

354
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,100
wanting to turn minus into plus

355
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,740
I'll just keep repeating myself won't I

356
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,740
I'd just be repeating myself

357
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,940
Okay then everyone

358
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,080
It hasn't changed a bit from before has it

359
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,280
The "Okonomiyaki" in this is weak as thin ice

360
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,850
The "Okonomiyaki" in this is weak as thin ice

361
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:51,090
We haven't had anything we can flip over like this. I don't think its strange

362
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,450
Isn't this nice?

363
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,590
This is basically just fried rice

364
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,430
The crispiness is definitely doing its thing

365
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,970
Bing instructions

366
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,970
Coat it with soy sauce instead of standard sauce

367
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,970
Cooking Step 2

368
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,110
Finish up with a soy sauce coating

369
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,070
Cause they wanted some moisture

370
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,570
These little guys are sucking it up nicely

371
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,510
These little guys are sucking it up nicely

372
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,940
You look thirsty there you go

373
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,480
Maki Zushi Okonomiyaki

374
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,480
Matsumoto's first dish

375
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,970
Taken straight from the heart of Japan, how will it taste like?

376
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,110
Is this Okonomiyaki?

377
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,450
Yeah i guess so...

378
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,420
This sure is small

379
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,290
Are we supposed to use these?

380
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,940
Right?

381
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,940
What are you doing?

382
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,900
It's fine like this then

383
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,400
You may turn it upside down of course

384
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,420
eating it like this too if you want

385
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,440
I'm getting a Singapore vibe from this

386
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,210
You're right!

387
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,280
It's just like that hotel

388
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,280
Marina bay sands

389
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,420
Just like in singapore right!?

390
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,800
Alright let's eat

391
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,540
I don't really see the Okonomiyaki in this

392
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,510
Hm?

393
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,360
It's delicious

394
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,530
This isn't bad at all

395
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,860
Yeah it's good

396
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,000
Not bad is it?

397
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,220
Well it's not really that big of a...

398
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,700
Nope it's definitely not bad

399
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,940
I did it, it's good isn't it!?

400
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,410
The sushi rice doesn't disturb the other tastes at all

401
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,250
I thought the cucumber was gonna be hard to eat but it's really good

402
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,340
It's binded nice together but

403
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,820
the heat didn't get through

404
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,050
How many points is this?

405
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,960
This gotta be quite high don't you think?

406
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,990
7 points

407
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,650
Well because...

408
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,020
You gotta be joking

409
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,770
Do you even understand numbers?

410
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,400
The pickle okonomiyaki gotta be the king

411
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,340
The pickle okonomiyaki gotta be the king

412
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,050
No that just happened to be in line

413
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,480
Mine should definitely be ahead of yours

414
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,110
No the pickle Okonomiyaki is just the king of them all

415
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:59,480
The Okonomiyaki's from before were properly done like they would transform into

416
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,390
new concepts and all

417
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:01,790
You just put these on top!!

418
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,260
You just put these on top!!

419
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,590
Because these are just exposed like this

420
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,450
If they were inside then..

421
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,530
That's just how you make it

422
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,360
Putting it on top like this is no good?

423
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,970
I just happen to be hearing this for the first time

424
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,310
Just be careful from now on then

425
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,470
I just happen to be hearing this for the first time

426
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,140
I mean that's not really what we mean

427
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,650
It's not quite like that

428
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,410
Well of course it's like that

429
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,140
It didn't say that in the script

430
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,910
You gotta mix it together

431
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,750
How many points are ya holding back?

432
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:29,750
3 points

433
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,950
Holding back 3 points is freaking strange!

434
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,350
I haven't heard any kind of rule

435
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,750
that says I can't put it on top!

436
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:57,310
Absolutely tasty Okonomiyaki

437
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,310
Matsumoto's Attempt

438
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,310
Second dish

439
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,310
rec

440
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,310
Can Matsumoto's second dish turn this around?

441
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,240
Until now

442
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,640
We haven't really had anything crunchy have we?

443
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,710
We had something didn't we? The pickles

444
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,210
We had something didn't we? The pickles

445
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,880
In small pieces though right?

446
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,820
What we'll be having this time

447
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,790
I guess it's a snappy kind of feeling

448
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,800
Only the good stuff here

449
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:21,170
I'll make a meal from only the suction cups of the octopus

yellow

454
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,800
Make a meal from only the suction cups?

455
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,470
I think it's good if we take a look at from what I'll be making this

456
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,110
It's this

457
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,610
It's all thick

458
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,780
What do you think of when I say octopus?

459
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,510
Ink...

460
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,850
You're correct

461
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,370
It's octopus ink

462
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,590
Bing instructions

463
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,590
Cooking Step 1

464
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,590
Put the octopus ink into the batter

465
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,650
Octopus ink

466
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,050
I've never had that before

467
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:41,920
Exactly!

468
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,750
Is it edible?

469
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,720
Whether it's edible or not I don't know yet

470
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,690
Whether it's edible or not I don't know yet

471
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,600
Are you for real?

472
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,770
Wow it's all black

473
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,400
Compared to squid ink it must be stronger

474
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,600
It really really looks like it

475
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,600
You're not gonna mix these in?

476
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,220
No I'm not

477
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,650
So that's how octopus ink looks like...

478
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,010
This is what demons eat

479
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,340
You bet

480
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,340
A few of these...

Put the suction cups on top of the batter

484
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,280
This is unclear

485
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,280
It's becoming one with the grill

486
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:15,110
He does like putting it on top doesn't he

487
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,110
Absolutely, as he's putting them on top once again

488
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,190
Again with the stuff on top

489
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,890
Makes you flinch at first sight doesn't it

490
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,880
Why?

491
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,510
Just looking at it being black and all

492
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,510
Exactly

493
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,200
Well, like with all dark food

494
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,370
That looks like raw oil

495
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,470
It's like fusing together with the pan

496
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,140
The heat is gonna

497
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,110
get trapped in the sunction cups like crazy

Cover and cook for 3 minutes

501
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,550
The pan is fighting back. The sunction cups are fighting back

502
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,750
The pan is fighting back. The sunction cups are fighting back

503
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,750
with each other. None of them can lose

504
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,850
Their will not to lose is just too strong

505
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,390
Their will not to lose is just too strong

506
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,650
I wonder how it'll turn out

507
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,630
It's hard to tell if its burnt or not

508
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,370
Yeah looking at it is difficult...

509
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,710
It's kind of dissolved into the pan though

510
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,480
It looks like Sludge

00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,380
With an amazing first impact, how will it taste like?

514
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,190
This isn't food

515
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,740
You'll find out soon

516
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,910
I wonder how this will taste

517
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,940
Let's dig in!

518
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,970
What the fuck is this...

519
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,040
There's no distinct taste either

520
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,910
Yeah the taste is...

521
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,910
It doesn't taste much

522
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,680
I need lots of salt for this

523
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,200
Ah, sorry thank you...

524
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,020
There's no taste?

525
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,940
With a little bit saltiness...

526
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,330
Woah!!

527
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,400
Yummy!!

528
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,200
Huuuhh!?

529
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,770
It came instantly didn't it?

530
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,410
Yaaaaaaaay

531
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,680
He said "Yay"

532
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,910
How many points?

533
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,450
Well about 3 I guess

534
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,280
That's just strange

535
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,480
What kind of calculation is that?

536
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,450
Well everyone...

537
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,690
If the one from the before

538
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,060
The hosomakisushi one is an 8

539
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,990
The hosomakisushi one is an 8

540
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,990
Then this is certainly a 7 isnt it?

541
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,910
Definitely not a 7

542
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,740
No way

543
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,740
Not a 7

544
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,430
How many points?

545
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,470
4 points

546
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,020
no way no way

547
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,870
An octopus will come tonight ya know

548
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,880
Through the curtain Whoosh! and it's there

549
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,350
It just tastes of octopus and I don't feel the Okonomiyaki in this

550
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:54,950
Honestly I would give it a 3

551
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,710
Honestly I would give it a 3

552
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
Yeah I get ya

553
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,280
That makes Housei the winner

554
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:06,160
9 points

555
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:06,160
Current top

556
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:06,160
Current top

557
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:06,160
Current top

558
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:06,160
Current top

559
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:06,160
Housei's dish

560
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:06,160
Pickles from all around the country Okonomiyaki

561
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,880
It's confirmed then

562
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,170
Since it's confirmed...

563
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,170
So that's the winner huh?

564
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,740
Exactly. Thank you very much

565
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,690
Let's go back to the hosomaki one for a moment

566
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,490
We havent resolved why the hosomaki

567
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,200
was bad yet

568
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,530
Why was the hosomaki no good again?

569
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,440
'Cause they were just placed on top!!

570
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:26,710
The winner is Housei with his pickles from all around the country Okonomiyaki

571
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,850
Well with Endo having a kid and all...

572
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,350
My neck is in place now after 3 months

573
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,030
Boys and girls are completely different after all aren't they?

574
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,560
Boys and girls are completely different after all aren't they?

575
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,570
Completely different

576
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,650
Like the way they frenzy is extraordinary

577
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,300
One time I was taking a nap and then

578
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,040
All of sudden he jumps on me and

579
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,010
goes WAAAAAHH!!

580
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,010
How old is he?

581
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,340
3 years old

582
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,340
3 years huh?

583
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,910
It's really amazing

584
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,910
Girls don't really do things like that often

585
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,570
You're right it's rare well because they're weaker but

586
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,920
they listen to what they're told. Completely different from boys

587
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,690
They don't listen to a single word

588
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,140
I wondered what to do

589
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,310
my two daughters were watching a film and

590
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:19,230
well they were watching it together with my son and

591
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,300
It was about a kappa getting killed*

592
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:29,510
*Kappa is a turtle-like creature from Japanese folklore

593
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,570
It was about a kappa getting killed*

594
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,940
There are films like that?

595
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,100
Where a kappa gets slain?

596
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,510
You were voice acting in that film

597
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,940
"Summer days with Coo"?

598
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,200
Yes yes yes!

599
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,310
In his mind where,

600
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:37,820
the scene where

601
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,820
he was slain in his father's arms?

602
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,940
Ah yes that happened

603
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,850
So he got killed and made this "Kuweeeeh" sound

604
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,150
So...

605
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:49,130
My son was watching that scene

606
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,130
and said that the kappa scared him

607
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,970
I went "Let's go change your diaper"

608
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,500
and when he said "no I don't want to"

609
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,170
My wife went Kappa will come The Kappa will come

610
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,070
My wife went Kappa will come The Kappa will come

611
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:59,140
My wife went Kappa will come The Kappa will come

612
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,900
Then I went like this while staying hidden

613
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,800
Is that really how a Kappa sounds like?

614
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,510
Does a kappa really go Koooh?

615
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,970
Well of course they don't but thats how mine went and

616
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,520
then he said "I'm scared!"

617
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,340
And we ended up doing it so many times

618
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,480
One time maybe half past midnight or something

619
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,510
I always sleep apart so

620
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,400
my wife and my son sleep together and I in a distant room

621
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,930
Then my wife in the middle of the night woke up and was like

622
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,870
Can't you do something about this?

623
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,880
Despite finally being able to sleep but then I'd hear

624
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,780
It's scary It's scary! I'm scared of the Kappa!

625
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,780
and he would wake me up

626
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,110
It happened so many times

627
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,380
Now he's too easily scared my wife said fiercely

628
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,520
Now he's too easily scared my wife said fiercely

629
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,170
Cause you overdid the Kappa thing?

630
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,170
Exactly

631
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,710
Alright then I said, we'll sleep together tonight

632
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,730
So my wife, the kid and me here

633
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,960
In a shape of a river*

634
00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:04,540
*He's refering to the shape of the Kanji as it has 3 vertical lines.

635
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,090
Then my son...

636
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,500
The shape of a river is certainly hard for a Kappa to understand

637
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,400
The shape of a river is certainly hard for a Kappa to understand

638
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,500
Figuring out whether you're liquid or not

639
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,540
Figuring out whether you're liquid or not

640
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,140
Sleeping as an actual river right?

641
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,140
Anyway, "It's fine its fine" I said and

642
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,080
and he finally fell asleep

643
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,400
Finally I thought and took a look at my wife and she also had her eyes closed

644
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,880
Finally, I guess I'll go to bed too then I thought

645
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,820
Then my son kind of woke up startled

646
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:26,820
"It's scary! I'm scared of the Kappa!"

647
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,360
What the hell?

648
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,360
Yeah what the?

649
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,330
As I looked at my wife with all her might she let out a snore like this

650
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,900
As I looked at my wife with all her might she let out a snore like this

651
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,470
This is just you putting up a show now

652
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,700
I'm absolutely serious!

653
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,740
That was a brilliantly crafted story!

654
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,020
It's true!

655
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,020
Is it really?

656
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,880
This is true

657
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,480
Then I woke up my wife and went

658
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,480
You've been snoring this whole time!!

659
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,920
and we both burst out laughing

660
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,050
"Oh so it was my snoring?"

661
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,490
Looking from above now, It's just like a Kappa*

662
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,890
Looking from above now, It's just like a Kappa*

663
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:06,630
*Kappas are depicted as having a big bald spot

664
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,400
That's the end of that

665
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,630
What do you mean "That's the end of that"?

666
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,680
I wonder how girls are though right?

667
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,640
My daughter went to "Kidzania"once

668
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:21,280
Kids can use various tools and get to experience
real vocations just like adults in "Kids-in-Charge City"

669
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:21,280
Kidzania

670
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:21,280
Txt

671
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,000
and then well there are people like...

672
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,910
Variety comedians

673
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,910
Oh really?

674
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,910
Like those vocational schools yeah

675
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,410
And I got shown a video where

676
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,010
My daughter was doing manzai

677
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:26,150
My daughter was doing manzai

678
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,150
Wow that's amazing

679
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,690
With her friend

680
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,800
I wanna see that!

681
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:29,950
So...

682
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,990
There was a Shochiku area*

683
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,460
There was a Shochiku area*

684
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:38,300
*Shochiku is a movie studio

685
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,620
and there these young comedians

686
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,310
would teach out different skits

687
00:23:36,390 --> 00:24:09,760
This video was brought to you by Tofu Panda Fansubs

688
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,000
Obviously they didnt know it was my daughter

689
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,280
And then they'd remember and do it?

690
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,280
Yeah and I watched it and it wasn't funny at all

691
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Well of course

692
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,080
%!¤#!"#%

693
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,370
That far?

694
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,370
That wasn't needed though was it
