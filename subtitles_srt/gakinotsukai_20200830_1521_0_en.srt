1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,010
The First Annual Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende, Chiki Chiki

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:07,520
"Absolutely Tasty - I've always wanted to try this": Pressed Senbei championship!

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,440
That was close

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,130
You almost got it wrong

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,490
Pressed...

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,360
So now, Matsumoto-san

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,600
It's been 7 months since...

8
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,180
Why are you leading us, dude!!

9
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,160
No, no, no

10
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,460
Let me explain this...

11
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,630
Just look at the cue card, it says "Hamada-san"

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,640
I was told to stand here 15 seconds before they started filming

13
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,660
Should you really do so just because they asked though?

14
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,230
A normal person should refuse that

15
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,760
This is such a precious chance dude

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,710
This is basically a neo-Bully

17
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,970
Pressed Senbei can be found at tourist spots

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,850
It presses shrimps or squids directly with the machine

19
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,130
And here comes the absolutely tasty snack Senbei

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,540
This time, we will be focusing on the potential of Pressed Senbei

21
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:01,850
Each member will present 2 original ingredients to be made into Pressed Senbei

22
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,340
While it's important to be tasty

23
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,250
The appearance is crucial as well

24
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,380
To be instagrammable

25
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,470
Ah, we need consider that as well?

26
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,420
Maybe it can even be commercialized

27
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,420
Yes, exactly

28
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,590
Like a new type of Pressed Senbei

29
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,610
So let's start with Tanaka-san

30
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,610
That should be Hamada-san's line though

31
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,480
Yes, Hamada-san should be the one doing this

32
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,400
But they suddenly asked me to do it

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,310
Let's start with Tanaka's Pressed Senbei

34
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,310
Here it is

35
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,570
Canned mackerel

36
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,620
Canned mackerel pressed senbei

37
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,620
Tanaka presents #1

38
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,240
Everyone knows that this is very popular right now

39
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,650
Oh, really?

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,830
Well, yeah

41
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,830
It's actually good for diet too

42
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,880
Oh, I see

43
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,450
It's affordable and nutrient-rich

44
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,190
Is it really popular now?

45
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,090
It's very popular

46
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,290
To be specific, it's popular 2 and a half years ago

47
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,610
A little bit ago

48
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,890
He's pissing me off

49
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,730
You're treated as a newbie only at this TV studio right?

50
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,840
The staffs at other TV studios are like "Oh, Tanaka-san!"

51
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,030
"Here comes Mr.Tanaka!!"

52
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,410
Wear it quickly dude!

53
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,330
You won't find this kind of TV studio anywhere else

54
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,120
The staffs from Atsuki Pressed Senbei will be guiding the members

55
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,240
Put this at the center

56
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,140
I hope he put the whole can of it directly

57
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,700
You're right

58
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,480
Just go like "Kapu"

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,310
The sauce as well...

60
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,610
So you could have put the whole can of it right?

61
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,050
I thought it's because you can't put the sauce

62
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,410
That round shape must be more instagrammable

63
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,370
That must be better, what's wrong with you?

64
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,810
Idiot!!

65
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,810
So press it now

66
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,140
Interesting

67
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,290
Start to turn it slowly now

68
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,400
Turn it slowly

69
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,590
It starts to smell good

70
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,140
Yeah, of course

71
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,830
It smells so freaking good

72
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,370
Let's open it

73
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,980
Okay

74
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,400
It's a bit burnt, but, well...

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,690
It's fine

76
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,190
It's quite nice

77
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,520
The members will now try Tanaka's Canned mackerel pressed senbei

78
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,040
It smells really good

79
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,580
Yeah, it smells good

80
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,040
And it's cute too

81
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,370
It's super cute right?

82
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,120
Cute?

83
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,450
It's super cute isn't it?

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,260
Is this cute?

85
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,600
It should be instagrammable, of course it's cute

86
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,160
Is this really edible!?

87
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,160
This should be absolutely tasty

88
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,230
Let’s eat

89
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,470
Tasty!!

90
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,470
Tasty!!

91
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,480
Ah, this is tasty

92
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,820
This can even be the snacks to go with sake

93
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,800
This tastes freaking good

94
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,720
Yeah, it's just tasty

95
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,770
How many points would everyone give?

96
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:01,590
The members will discuss and give a score out of ten

97
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,770
Well, two points

98
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,850
So two points

99
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,220
There's nothing we can do

100
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,100
No way

101
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,780
The main cast said so

102
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,860
No way

103
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,100
I was here since the show was first established

104
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,690
I was here since the first meeting

105
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,570
Yeah, but...

106
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,560
Is this instagrammable though?

107
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,860
That's a minus point

108
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,860
5 points

109
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,270
Canned mackerel pressed senbei 5 points

110
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,270
Okay, so Tanaka-san 5 points

111
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,200
The second one that Tanaka presents is a bit adventurous

112
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,250
This is my second item

113
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,120
Doria pressed senbei

114
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,120
Tanaka presents #2

115
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,710
It's Doria

116
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,130
Senbei Doria

117
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,910
Doria itself is already instagrammable

118
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,820
Doria pressed senbei

119
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,820
Tanaka presents #2

120
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,360
Then just eat the Doria

121
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,480
I think this one could go wrong though

122
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,740
No way, it won't

123
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,310
Is this instagrammable?

124
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,080
It will be burnt again anyway

125
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,240
Tanaka, what is your final academic background again?

126
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,400
Osaka design school

127
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,370
Oh, really?

128
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,750
So he should know how to make it instagrammable the most

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,400
So that's why his sense is a bit weird?

130
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:06,480
Lemon Print Shoes

131
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,190
Like those shoes with lemon print

132
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,580
Ah, yes

133
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,850
Normal people won't wear that

134
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,850
No, people wear it

135
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,850
So it's because he went to the design school

136
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,080
I see

137
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,330
He should be familiar with these then

138
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,530
Yes, you're right

139
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,190
So I'll press it now

140
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,450
It's fine right?

141
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,080
Yes, it's fine

142
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,250
But I think I should be good at turning the handle

143
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,110
*"Densha de go!" is a Japanese train simulation game series

144
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,110
I did the same thing in "Densha de go!"*

145
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,840
This is completely different with Densha de go!

146
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,800
Did you play "Densha de go!"?

147
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,550
They said yes

148
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,900
They're not playing it for practice purposes

149
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,800
I'll open it

150
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,480
Let's see

151
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,090
This is Doriya Senbei

152
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,660
It looks tasty

153
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,620
Looks like pizza

154
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,220
Oh, yeah

155
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,380
Tanaka's second dish, Doria Senbei

156
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,980
How does it taste?

157
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,730
This is quite instagrammable

158
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,810
It's instagrammable right?

159
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,810
Yes, it is instagrammable

160
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,900
Those broccolis are so instagrammable

161
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,710
This is well instagrammable

162
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,280
Huh? This is tasty

163
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,290
Eh, really?

164
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,290
It's tasty

165
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,360
This is delicious

166
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,500
Yeah, it has a rich taste

167
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,220
Well, if Uber Eats delivered this to me, I'll be pissed off though

168
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:16,820
Doria Senbei 7 points

169
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,560
Like what the heck is this?

170
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,460
Hamada will now present his senbei

171
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,040
First item is this

172
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:37,410
Abalone Senbei

173
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:37,410
Hamada presents #1

174
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,070
Oh, I see

175
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,780
How far can it be stretched though?

176
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,850
Yeah, that's the point

177
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,220
This is quite thick

178
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,790
But I really want to try this

179
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,200
Yeah, I want to try this

180
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,030
This is luxurious

181
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,740
This is amazing

182
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,790
I'm going to press it

183
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,120
Is this really going to work?

184
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,130
It's crying

185
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,960
Yeah, it's crying

186
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,780
It's groaning

187
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,210
Because it's really thick

188
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,360
Eh, what's this sound?

189
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,620
Is this Hamada-san?

190
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,620
No way!!

191
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,400
I thought so too

192
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,300
Just think about how he always behaved

193
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,400
This is really hard

194
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:13,650
Scary!!

195
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,080
Scary!!

196
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,610
Scary!!

197
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,340
So this is how it looks like

198
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,370
This is instagrammable!!

199
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,930
This is amazing

200
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,790
Never seen something like this

201
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,810
One more step?

202
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,040
Put some soy sauce

203
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,140
Done!

204
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,720
Hamada's first dish, abalone senbei

205
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
Let's try it!

206
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,480
You can add more soy sauce too

207
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,710
So my comment is

208
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,300
It's such a waste

209
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,850
Abalone senbei 3 points

210
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,840
For such a luxurious abalone

211
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,950
And the abalone's groan was awful too

212
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,220
You just made that up yourself

213
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,000
That groan was horrible

214
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,890
Today's theme is for young girls like high school students right?

215
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,800
Fujita Nicole is probably crying right now

216
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,420
Well...

217
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,060
Nicole hate this kind of things

218
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,260
Well, we're not doing this for Fujita Nicole anyway

219
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,530
Of course we are doing this for Fujita Nicole

220
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,020
Are you joking?

221
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,750
Of course it is

222
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,990
Hamada's second dish is a much more affordable senbei

223
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,680
This is the second item

224
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:41,630
*Peyoung is Hamada's favorite fried noodles brand

225
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:41,630
Hamada presents #2

226
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:41,630
Peyoung senbei*

227
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,590
You really like this

228
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,620
It suddenly becomes affordable

229
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,770
I believe this will taste even better after being pressed

230
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,340
Yeah, it must be tasty

231
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,570
Well but...how will Nicole feel about this though

232
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,560
No, no

233
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,270
Then ask her to come!!

234
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,460
Let Nicole watch this contest here

235
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,700
Well this show is on TV, so Nicole will watch it anyway

236
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,900
I think she'll watch this

237
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,290
And see herself being mentioned so many times, although she's not even here

238
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,800
She must be shocked

239
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,980
For being mentioned by these old men

240
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,440
It should be fast this time

241
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,560
Looks good

242
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,170
So it will be pressed now

243
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,880
I'll press it now

244
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,060
It should be pressed into a rectangular shape

245
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,460
Sounds good too

246
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,940
That's just the sound of frying fried noodles

247
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,050
It's fast this time

248
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,600
Yeah

249
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,550
I'll open it now

250
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,950
Never seen something like this

251
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,790
How does the Peyoung senbei looks like!?

252
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,350
Sounds good too

253
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,250
I'll open it now

254
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,550
Never seen something like this

255
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,220
This is different to what I've imagined

256
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,200
It's like the top view of an old lady

257
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,040
How does Hamada's second dish, Peyoung senbei tastes like?

258
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,060
I'll put some mayonnaise on this old lady

259
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,330
I'll put some on this old lady too

260
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,990
Anyone else want to put mayonnaise on this old lady?

261
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,960
I'll put some sauce on this old lady

262
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,960
They're gonna hate you

263
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,710
It tastes good with mayonnaise

264
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,650
Yeah, it's tasty

265
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,840
So what's the score?

266
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,770
The members will discuss and give a score out of ten

267
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,970
Well, four points

268
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,970
Yeah, four points

269
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,140
Are you joking?

270
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,460
This tastes good just because of the Peyoung

271
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,950
Add some points for being instagrammable too

272
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,580
Well, is it instagrammable?

273
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,430
But everyone is calling this an old lady

274
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,180
That's just you guys

275
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,760
Maybe you should put a ribbon and press it

276
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,620
It feels like this old lady gave up being fashionable

277
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,620
Peyoung senbei 4 points

278
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,620
Yeah

279
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,540
Endo will now present his senbei

280
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,760
The first item is this

281
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,500
Endo presents #1

282
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,500
Sushi senbei

283
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,490
Wow

284
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,350
I like your adventurous spirit

285
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,500
Thank you

286
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,620
I want to try making it a senbei

287
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,460
And press it directly

288
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,130
This may possibly be instagrammable too right?

289
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,830
Yeah, it's colorful

290
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,350
Why did you choose so many white ones

291
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,160
Yeah, the ingredients

292
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,510
Put the ones with color to the sides dude

293
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,520
Why are you putting those two in a row?

294
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,540
He's so angry

295
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,020
The power harassment since the Shōwa era

296
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,730
And Endo can't talk back to him right?

297
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,760
But I'm enjoying this so it's fine

298
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,220
I told you to put the salmon on the side dude!!

299
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,730
Do you need to be so angry?

300
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,270
Done

301
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,160
The appearance should look good

302
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,130
Hopefully it will look like a menu

303
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,690
You can press it now

304
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,490
I'll press it

305
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,840
Press it for a bit longer

306
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,460
Okay

307
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,010
You can turn it now

308
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,720
"Hopefully it will look like a menu"

309
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,720
What does that even mean?

310
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,740
Everyone ignored it just now

311
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,270
Like a menu?

312
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,980
Calm down

313
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,350
That sticked in our mind right?

314
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,540
Yeah, it did

315
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,100
Everyone decided to ignore that

316
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,740
We all ignored that like "su-un..."

317
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,340
Something strange went pass

318
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,830
I noticed something passed by

319
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,420
But I thought never mind

320
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,680
But then the exhaust gas stayed here...

321
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,840
So I just felt curious

322
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,100
Just let it go, it passed already right?

323
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,180
You guys are having a good time over there

324
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,670
I was working so hard here and you guys are so pumped over there

325
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,190
I'll open it now

326
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,960
Please open it slowly

327
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,460
Here it is

328
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,660
Wow for what?

329
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,470
It's beautiful

330
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,330
What are you wowing at?

331
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,330
This is so instagrammable

332
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,770
This is just perfect

333
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,280
This is a complete failure

334
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,310
You can't even tell

335
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,310
what sushi it is

336
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,530
The sushi senbei that looks strange

337
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,580
How does it taste like?

338
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,520
What is this?

339
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,080
It should be Hotate

340
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,080
Hotate?

341
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,640
I don't want to eat this

342
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,160
Yeah, I don't want to eat this

343
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,740
Please try this toro salmon

344
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,080
This is?

345
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,370
That's tuna

346
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,730
Oh, this is tuna?

347
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,730
It's tuna

348
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,210
Please try the shrimp Hamada-san

349
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,770
The shrimp should taste good

350
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,770
You can even see it's tail here

351
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,550
I don't like this sour taste

352
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,140
I don't like this salty taste too

353
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,380
This is absolutely tasty

354
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,320
Those two people don't like it at all though

355
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,110
I don't really want to make Endo's part interesting

356
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,720
Sushi senbei 1 point

357
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,720
Can you stop that?

358
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,820
Endo's second dish is a dessert senbei

359
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,670
This is the second item

360
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,100
Decoration cake senbei

361
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,100
Endo presents #2

362
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,290
It's decoration cake senbei

363
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,080
Here comes the bad thing about you

364
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,270
No, please...

365
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,780
Trying to jazz it up in a wrong way

366
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,780
This is awful

367
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,540
Well, young girls like to eat warm fruits right?

368
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,580
Although that's unimaginable to us

369
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,010
Talking about young girls, this is instagrammable too

370
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,870
No, no, no way

371
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,880
No way

372
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,880
Maybe it'll be like crepe

373
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,280
Here it goes

374
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,120
I'll press it

375
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,970
No way, this is awful

376
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,360
This is amazing

377
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,510
Sorry that the cream is flowing down

378
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,630
It's melting

379
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,770
It's flowing down

380
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,870
This just looks awful

381
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,780
I wonder could this even become a senpei

382
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,050
Yeah

383
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,580
The person with the lowest score

384
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,400
Will be camping with Heipo

385
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,590
I’ve never heard of that

386
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,990
This is the first time I’ve heard it

387
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,910
Camping with Heipo-san is like being in hell

388
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,190
Seriously

389
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,060
Heipo always phone me

390
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,060
And say that he's ready

391
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,970
Will it be instagrammable?

392
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,200
This is looking good

393
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,620
Stop lying

394
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,320
But Nicole will probably love this color

395
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,570
No, no, no way

396
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,630
How does decoration cake senbei tastes?

397
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,010
Decoration cake senbei

398
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,050
Well, it smells good

399
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,690
This is so tasty right?

400
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,690
How the heck!!

401
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,540
This is awful

402
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,060
Really?

403
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,490
Why are you lying?

404
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,630
I can eat tons of this though...

405
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,630
Really?

406
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,350
To be honest...

407
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,030
No thanks

408
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,840
Decoration cake senbei

409
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,640
Housei will now present his senbei

410
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,650
My first item is this

411
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:44,060
Housei presents #1

412
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:44,060
Shark fin senbei

413
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,840
The luxurious shark fin

414
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,420
That's so expensive

415
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,410
Of course it'll be tasty

416
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:49,360
It's both instagrammable and tasty

417
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,340
Well yeah, maybe it's instagrammable

418
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,600
This one must be expensive

419
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,510
Yeah

420
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,310
Just look at it

421
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,060
If this is not tasty...

422
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,620
This is just...

423
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,220
That's just sinful

424
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,710
Yeah, exactly

425
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,550
So who will be camping with Heipo

426
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,780
He's putting pressure on me

427
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,780
But for now...

428
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,640
I scored the fewest points for now

429
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,990
Wait a second

430
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,810
You're pressing it now

431
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,810
So saying you're pressured is not appropriate

432
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,010
Yeah, agreed

433
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,260
This is good

434
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,800
This is looking good

435
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,100
Go further dude!!

436
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,710
Why are you just turning it over there

437
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,630
Is it instagrammable

438
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,660
I'll open it

439
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,740
Here it comes

440
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,810
Is it instagrammable?

441
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,810
I'll open it now

442
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,370
Here it comes

443
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,980
Huh!?

444
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,650
Where is it!!

445
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,630
That's enough

446
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,290
That's so old

447
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,290
Stop those old jokes

448
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,900
Just close it first and scrape it off

449
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,870
That's so Shōwa

450
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,020
Here comes the senbei

451
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,610
It looks like croissant

452
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,080
That's true

453
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,110
Housei's first dish is the luxurious shark fin senbei

454
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,010
How does it taste like?

455
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:26,360
This seems to be double layered

456
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,600
I will eat now

457
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,360
You can really taste the shark fin

458
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,570
This tastes interesting

459
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,940
It's just the same as the previous one right?

460
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,940
It's such a waste

461
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,670
I quite like this though

462
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,090
It has a unique taste

463
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,510
Shark fin senbei 5 points

464
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,490
Yeah, it's good

465
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:50,500
Housei's second dish is a soul food senbei

466
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,430
Here it is

467
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:58,320
Housei presents #2

468
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:58,320
Tonkotsu ramen senbei

469
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,380
Everyone likes this

470
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,550
Pork bone-broth

471
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
You're gonna put everything in?

472
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,320
Yes, everything

473
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,490
This must be good

474
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,260
It's unbelievable that the shop allows you do this

475
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,490
Seriously...

476
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,920
So I'll just put everything

477
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,390
The noodles first

478
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,610
I see

479
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,470
You won't put the soup in right?

480
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,710
Of course not the soup dude

481
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:17,740
Huh!!

482
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,350
What are you doing?

483
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,390
That's enough

484
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,800
Really?

485
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,450
Seriously!?

486
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,380
Are you joking?

487
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,090
Close it quickly dude

488
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,660
Really?

489
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,470
His face is pissing me off

490
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,470
Shall we just give him 2 points?

491
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,510
It changed

492
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,070
That face get even lower scores

493
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,250
I think Nicole already fell asleep now

494
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,810
Stop it, that's enough

495
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,810
Wait for me Nicole

496
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,250
It's gonna be instagrammable

497
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,500
I wonder how it'll look like

498
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,010
I'll open it

499
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,130
Here it comes

500
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,190
Well...

501
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,120
How does the Tonkotsu ramen senbei taste like?

502
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,570
Where is the egg?

503
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,050
Oh, yeah

504
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:20,930
This looks like the top view of a fashionable old lady

505
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,300
With accessories

506
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,120
With some hairpins

507
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,040
Why are you looking at an old lady from the top

508
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,040
I'll eat it now

509
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,110
This is absolutely tasty

510
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,440
The more you chew it, the more delicious it becomes

511
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,640
Maybe you should have put those Benishoga

512
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,160
So what is the score?

513
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,330
Well, I have no idea why,

514
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,330
But what about a skull

515
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,320
No, no way

516
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,730
I don't know why but anyway

517
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,730
No way, if you don't know why

518
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,900
Just give you a skull without any meaning

519
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,130
You can't give a skull if there's no meaning

520
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,140
Tonkotsu senbei 5 points

521
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,140
Because this has a lot of meaning

522
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,470
So the last one will be Matsumoto-san

523
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,240
Yes

524
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,110
I'm the last, because mine takes a lot of time

525
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,480
And I will bet everything with this one dish

526
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,820
All that I can say is that, this is absolutely instagrammable

527
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,820
Really?

528
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,740
What is the instagrammable senbei that Matsumoto presents?

529
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,620
Aiming to be instagrammable

530
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,210
This is the item

531
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,100
Matsumoto presents

532
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,100
Yellowtail Collar senbei

533
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,670
So I'll be making Yellowtail Collar senbei

534
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,110
It's impossible to make this a senbei

535
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,550
This is so exepnsive too

536
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,610
I actually want to press it vertically

537
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,690
No way...

538
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,370
But that seems to be too difficult

539
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,310
So I'll press it horizontally instead

540
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:43,620
And this takes about 40 to 50 minutes...

541
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,220
This will never be commercialized

542
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,070
The line will be very long

543
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,570
Which side do you want?

544
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,570
You can choose it

545
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,430
Huh!?

546
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,720
Do you want the left face or the right face?

547
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,870
No one cares about which side

548
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,880
No dude, this is something to enjoy as well!!

549
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,880
Not at all

550
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,190
It looks like this on this side, and like this on that side

551
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,020
It's the same!!

552
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,130
Maybe this side looks more handsome

553
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,200
Is it?

554
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,680
This side then

555
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,060
Looks like Matsudaira Ken from here

556
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,060
This is going to take forever

557
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,120
Yeah

558
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,300
It's impossible

559
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,970
So put it like this

560
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,340
Yeah, the better-looking side

561
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,500
Yep

562
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,760
This is just terrible

563
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,890
How could it be terrible!

564
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,840
I don't want to eat it at this stage already

565
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,500
No, no, no way

566
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,890
People will be fighting for this at Izakaya!!

567
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,840
Izakaya won't have this

568
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,420
You know, like a special menu

569
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,760
Well

570
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,900
I'll close it now

571
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,460
Ah, the crust at the bottom...

572
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,620
This takes 40 minutes...

573
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,690
That's impossible

574
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,220
This gonna take more than an hour

575
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,110
He need to do this for a whole day

576
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,960
Yeah

577
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,930
That's true

578
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,760
It's not letting me to close this at all

579
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,630
It keeps coming this side

580
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,190
It keeps moving right?

581
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,780
That being said

582
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,920
There's actually a completed version

583
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,870
There is?

584
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,770
How does the Yellowtail Collar senbei, which took 40 minutes to press tastes like?

585
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,930
It's instagrammable

586
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,560
Open!!

587
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,460
This is terrifying!!

588
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,820
Where is it?

589
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,520
This is scary

590
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,480
But isn't it amazing to be pressed like this

591
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,330
It looks like those illustration on the folding screens back in the old days

592
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,410
How does the Yellowtail Collar senbei that Matsumoto presents taste like?

593
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,600
Did they press it on the right side?

594
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,170
Well, that doesn't matter

595
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,740
They pressed it on the right side

596
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,740
It's just the same

597
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,110
Let's do it again

598
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,690
There's no need

599
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,250
It won't match on action

600
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,250
No one cares

601
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,300
It smells so good

602
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,260
Wow, this smells fishy

603
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,870
Let's eat it

604
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,580
This is fried fish

605
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,370
Yeah

606
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,040
It's so hard

607
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,840
This thing is so hard

608
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,230
Eat this

609
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:07,500
No!!

610
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:07,830
No!!

611
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,810
No!!

612
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,130
Don't press it on me

613
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,840
Just eat it, it must be tasty

614
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,050
I really don't want this

615
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,100
It's full of DHC though

616
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,850
We want to focus on this part now

617
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,490
We want to focus on Hamada

618
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,490
As he eats the eyeball

619
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,490
What are you doing Tanaka?

620
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,580
There's bone in this

621
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,910
This is so dangerous

622
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,150
This is unacceptable

623
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,760
Too dangerous

624
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,770
No it's not

625
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,980
What have you done?

626
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,930
We have to give this a skull

627
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,590
Seriously

628
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,060
He'll be camping with Heipo-san then

629
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,640
I won't go

630
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,590
I really want to watch that

631
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,120
I won't go for sure
