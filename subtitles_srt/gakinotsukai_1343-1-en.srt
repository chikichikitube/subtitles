1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,300
Are their hearts connected? No Smartphone Meetup

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,900
The Rule; They think of a location to head to based on a theme

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,100
The game doesn't end until everyone meets up

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,600
The first theme; A typical bridge intersection

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,500
Starting at NTV in Kojimachi,

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,460
I'm getting on

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,700
The 5 head off to the places they thought of in a taxi

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,060
It's gotta be this one! Everyone will head there

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,400
Look how clearly you can see it

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Namiki-Bashi

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,900
As expected nobody meet up, and Tanaka held everyone up

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,960
Tanaka is still driving

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,100
CMON!

14
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,860
DAMN IT!

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,200
Ikejiri-Ohashi, Ohashi, Ikejiri-Ohashi!

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,060
Ikejiri-Ohashi?!

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,430
For real?

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,060
The next hint; A restaurant with a lot of autograph plaques

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,060
Have you ever written one?

20
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,560
The only place I can remember is the Sex Museum in Atami

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,130
Once again, nobody met up

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:21,200
It's been 1.5 hours since the start; Nobody has met up yet, the worst outcome!

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,960
They wanna meet up soon! Time for the 3rd theme

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,930
What in tarnation?

25
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,000
No clue no clue

26
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,500
Tennis Court

27
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,530
"A huge tennis court" it says!

28
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,600
There's one that came to mind,

29
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,530
But the location, it's the Kinuta court

30
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,700
Tanaka was thinking of a tennis court in Setagaya

31
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,530
A tennis court they often use as a studio,

32
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,160
But to head towards Setagaya would take some time

33
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,360
And Hosei, in Nishiazabu?

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,100
Tennis courts are usually hidden from view!

35
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,960
There's one I thought that's really far away!

36
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,260
Kinuta!

37
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,630
The one I remembered right away,

38
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,630
The one you just remembered?

39
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,260
Near TMC, Kinuta court which we use as a studio...

40
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:35,600
The one I thought of right away, is the tennis court near TMC (Kinuta)

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,200
There's no way they'd go there
They'll ask "are you an idiot?"

42
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,860
This is difficult

43
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,960
But I came up with 2 locations, pretty quickly I'd say

44
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,100
In Hatagaya, by the aqueduct. The tennis court next to the Denny's

45
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,430
That one's been there for so long hasn't it?

46
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,630
I used to live near there, in Hatagaya. I passed by it every day

47
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,630
That one, and the Kinuta studio one

48
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,430
Everyone said the same thing; The tennis court in Setagaya

49
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,500
If everyone went with that option, they'd all meet up!

50
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,030
It's the Hatagaya one right?

51
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,360
Right?

52
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,560
I think Yamasaki will come

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,560
We used to pick up girls and go to the Denny's together

54
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,100
let's try and meet up with Yamasaki at least

55
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,000
This is hard to do alone

56
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,360
Aiminig for Hosei, Matsumoto chose a tennis court with a lot of memories

57
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,030
But will Hosei share in those memories?

58
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,760
Hold on please,

59
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,800
Towards [@!!#@#], ple@$3

60
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,130
Alright

61
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,530
He understood, he understood me

62
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,560
I stuttered so much but he understood me

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,330
Meanwhile in Akasaka, Endo considers his options

64
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,600
Isn't that Makku Akasaka-san?

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,860
Oh yeah
That's Makku Akasaka-san

66
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,840
Cocorico!

67
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,660
Excuse us, we're shooting right now

68
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,980
Makku Akasaka

69
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,980
Passing through coincidentally

70
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,900
What brings you here?

71
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,900
My agency is here

72
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,560
Ah, is that so?

73
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,220
You look low-energy,

74
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,720
SMILE!

75
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,720
Thank you very much

76
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,400
I kind of forgot, where was it again, what was it?

77
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,660
What location did Endo just forget?!

78
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,230
Matsumoto heads towards a tennis court in Shibuya

79
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,930
Do you think Hamada-san would go to Kinuta?

80
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,300
He might be, I thought of that place too

81
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,900
If I went there, I think if anyone would come it'd be Hamada

82
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:12,500
Everyone won't come, so it'll just be me and Hamada

83
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:18,300
And I really hate the idea of getting on the highway in the same taxi as Hamada for the next theme

84
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,160
That was something I considered to be honest

85
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,900
It's annoying isn't it?

86
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,730
Hamada heads off to his objective

87
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,930
What's the point of putting a vending machine there?

88
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,460
Ah, it's a studio?

89
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,130
And then,

90
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,660
It's for bands and stuff

91
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,050
GAN!

92
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,460
Hamada recieves heavenly punishment for disrespecting the vending machine

93
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,460
It's cause I was talking, you guys should've warned me too

94
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,200
So just where is Hamada going?

95
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,260
Jingu,

96
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,260
Head there please

97
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,860
Hamada relies on his memories, and heads towards Jingu-Gaen tennis court

98
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,900
I think I've seen a tennis court there...

99
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,160
Hmm, yeah nobody would go to Kinuta

100
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,630
So I've thought of another one,

101
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,430
Where?

102
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,630
[@#!@#!]

103
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,300
Kitagawa, alright let's go

104
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,500
DownTown can't meetup, but there's a chance 4 people might meet up

105
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:46,050
Will anyone be able to meet? Tonight we find out!

106
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:52,060
Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

108
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,860
No Smartphone Meetup!
Finale tonight!

109
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,460
Are their hearts connected? No Smartphone Meetup!

110
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,560
The theme; A large tennis court

111
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,260
Tanaka uses the highway to get to his destination quickly

112
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,760
This is the 4th time right?

113
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,800
This is the most confident I've been for any theme so far

114
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,400
The huge tennis court

115
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,460
There's no way I'll be by myself at this one

116
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,030
Tanaka heads towards his tennis court with absolute confidence

117
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,400
And Matsumoto arrives at the Shibuya tennis court

118
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,330
And then...

119
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,230
Is that taxi someone elses?

120
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,060
Will this be the first meet up today?!

121
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,860
This tennis court right? It's pretty big

122
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,960
Is that someone else?

123
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,860
C'mon...

124
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,060
It's just my manager

125
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,930
I thought it was one of them for sure

126
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,100
Well whatever, can we go in here?

127
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,860
This place here, I think this is pretty big for downtown

128
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,200
1, 2, 3, 5 - There's 6 courts here

129
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,330
Right?

130
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,530
And Tanaka as well arrives at his tennis court

131
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,960
Yeah, yes look there. Is someone there already?

132
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,100
Tanaka arrived at the tennis court beside the Shibuya Park exit

133
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,460
Even though the other members usually drive, this tennis court is visible from the road

134
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,460
I think they'll come for sure

135
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,160
Seriously, I'm so confident

136
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,200
Meanwhile, Hamada arrived at his destination

137
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,630
If they don't come here, then where the hell will they?

138
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,930
We even played baseball on the grounds there

139
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,330
They might have seen it while walking by it

140
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,660
If they think like that, Endo at least does play baseball

141
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,600
He might remember "Oh yeah, Jingu-Gaien had that tennis court"

142
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,500
Is he not coming?

143
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
I thought this would be a good one

144
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,360
HAMADA-SAN! WE DID IT!

145
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,200
HE'S HERE!

146
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,530
HAMADA-SAN! WE DID IT!

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,030
HE'S HERE!

148
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,030
Hold on, I just said "Endo isn't here"!

149
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,930
Thank you!

150
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,630
I even said I thought you wouldn't be here

151
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,660
Thank goodness!

152
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,900
It's gotta be here right?

153
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,900
Yeah, they have the grounds there,

154
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,200
Then, did the others meet anyone?

155
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,000
Possibly

156
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,360
Only Hosei is still in transit

157
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,160
There's no way he won't come here

158
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,500
You see? There's 6 of them!

159
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,200
There's no other place with 6 courts here in the city

160
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,000
Seriously, someone will definitely come

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,760
What other answer is there but here, sorry to be so persistent

162
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,230
Which tennis court is Hosei heading to?

163
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,230
Then the other guys are still driving right?

164
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,230
Right

165
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,730
Ah! There!

166
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,060
Wow! Yama-chan you're amazing!

167
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,460
You really got it!
You came!

168
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:50,300
This place is really wide, I was at the other end looking for the entrance

169
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,560
I see I see

170
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,330
Thank goodness!!

171
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,560
This is fantastic

172
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,660
I can't think of anywhere but here

173
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,230
Tanaka-san, it's time up!

174
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,900
You're lying! For real?

175
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,760
You're kidding me!

176
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,200
Eh?!

177
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,520
Time up

178
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,520
Noooo no no no no no

179
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,230
The 5 call to report their locations

180
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,700
There's 3 of us here already!

181
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,660
3 of you?!

182
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,360
EH?!

183
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,330
Excuse me

184
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,330
All the capable members have met up

185
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,260
Gaki's capable members have assembled

186
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,300
Where did you meet?

187
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,260
Meiji Jingu Gaien tennis club

188
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,960
Where the hell is that?!

189
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,260
How many courts are there?

190
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,000
How many you say?

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,700
There's like 50

192
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,760
50?!

193
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,060
There's no way that's true!

194
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,200
Tanaka where are you?

195
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,700
I'm at that place, the tennis court near Shibuya park's highway exit

196
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,530
How many courts are there?

197
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,400
There's 3 here

198
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,500
3!

199
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,300
What the hell is that? You can find a court like that anywhere!

200
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,900
Matsumoto-san, where are you?

201
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:21,900
I thought at least Yamasaki would come here, I have a lot of memories with Yamasaki here

202
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,200
The aqueduct,

203
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,400
There's those tennis courts next to the Denny's right?!

204
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,400
There's goddamn 6 of them!

205
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,630
Just 6!

206
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,860
That was there?

207
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,870
AHHH YOU LIAR! You know they're there! The 6 courts

208
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,200
I can't remember the tennis courts at all

209
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:50,100
No no no no there's 6 of them! I saw just now, everyone is having SO much fun!

210
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,400
That's not relevant

211
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,860
You guys should reflect on this

212
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,320
No you reflect!

213
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,630
What a troublemaker!

214
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,630
Yama-chan you don't remember those tennis courts?

215
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,130
I don't remember at all. I have no memories with him

216
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:13,160
2 hours from the start, and 3 people met up right away. Just Tanaka and Matsumoto left

217
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,200
Next, the 4th theme

218
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,030
Nobody came here...

219
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,400
"Long flight of stairs"?

220
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,330
There are some I can think of, like for the trains

221
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,700
Yeah train stations. Like the Ginza line maybe.

222
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,200
What the heck is this?

223
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,830
There's one that came to mind immediately

224
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,660
Is it close by?

225
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,660
It's close by yes

226
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,860
It's close by. That place right? I think that place for sure.

227
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,830
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

228
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,360
If you think about it, it's that one

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,360
You're right

230
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,560
Where did you 2 think of?
Yama-chan tell him

231
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,530
In Akasaka, Hie Shrine right? Yeah Hie Shrine.

232
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,400
Certainly! That place, yes.

233
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,230
It's a good one right?

234
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,230
That place is good I think

235
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:14,660
The 3 head towards their destination, Hie Shrine in Akasaka

236
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,160
It's gotta be that place

237
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,730
[!@!#!!@]

238
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:27,500
Cause Yoshimoto's headquarters were there too right?

239
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,330
So everyone has been in that neighbourhood for sure

240
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,330
I honestly can't think of anywhere else

241
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,320
I'm not considering my options, just that place

242
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,600
"A long flight of stairs" huh?

243
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,200
That place, Hiea Shrine? In Akasaka

244
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,600
I've never been there, but I have this feeling that place has long stairs

245
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,160
Let's go to [@!#!@#!], in [!@#!@#!]

246
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,430
The stairs at [!@#!#@]

247
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,030
I can't think of anywhere else

248
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,660
Should we bet on that place?

249
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,560
I wanna meet them

250
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,630
Will Tanaka's wish reach the other members?

251
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,860
Everyone wants to meet up with this theme!

252
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,960
Matsumoto heads towards his destination, Shinjiku south exit

253
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,660
Lumine huh?

254
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,660
TN: Lumine is a theatre owned by Yoshimoto.

255
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,760
I wanna be on stage there

256
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,260
Watch, you'll see me up there

257
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
I'll perform at Lumine for sure one day!

258
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,730
Meanwhile Hamada, Hosei, and Endo arrive at Hie Shrine.

259
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,260
Look how obvious it is

260
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,360
This is the only answer

261
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,360
Right in the middle of the city

262
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:57,860
If Tanaka doesn't come here, it's gonna be so unfunny when he's left by himself right?

263
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,360
That's true

264
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,600
Tanaka is slowing us down on purpose

265
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,910
He's not that type of guy

266
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,000
That's how he got the job on Zip!

267
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,900
Wow, so when you're not here they talk so much shit about you!

268
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,360
I feel bad

269
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,400
I can't think of anywhere else

270
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,900
I can't think of anywhere else

271
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,500
Will the 5 be able meet up at Hie Shrine?!

272
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,960
Tanaka is right out

273
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,640
The timing doesn't make sense

274
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,560
Yeah he's taken too long

275
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,660
Then just where did he go?

276
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,660
I actually am curious

277
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,060
EHHH???
He's here! He's here!

278
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,300
Tanaka is last after all

279
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Tanaka is last after all

280
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,800
Seriously?

281
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,300
What the hell...

282
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,200
This is it! Of course! It's here!

283
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,470
This is it! Of course! It's here!

284
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,660
I will say though, my tennis court was definitely the right one

285
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,710
No it wasn't

286
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,110
And you went there a lot before!

287
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:15,910
When I lived in Hatagaya, you went to the Denny's so often!

288
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,180
We picked up so many girls, and took so many girls there!

289
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,060
And then we would all go back to my place.

290
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,430
And then we F[@@!$] a lot!

291
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,830
Let's leave it at that

292
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,960
I said everything

293
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,100
Let's leave it at that

294
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:40,000
Just where are Tanaka's long stairs?

295
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,300
Where is Tanaka? They confirm his location

296
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,330
Where are you?

297
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,480
Me?

298
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,480
Yeah

299
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,230
I'm at the big stairs next to Fuji TV, the long ones

300
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,130
Odaiba...

301
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,000
Listen man, listen!

302
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,100
You can't go to Odaiba! They yelled at me for that!

303
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,300
We said Odaiba is out!

304
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,960
Seriously, we've said it so many times

305
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,400
Tanaka broke the rules they made and went to Odaiba

306
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,630
See! Look

307
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,300
Aren't they long?

308
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,900
Certainly, they are long. They fit the theme card.

309
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,800
They're even longer up close

310
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,930
That's inside FujiTV

311
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,030
Yes

312
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,660
It's private land

313
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,130
Odaiba...

314
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:38,600
We can't go there on an NTV show you idiot!

315
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,600
Seriously, c'mon seriously get it together

316
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,400
These stairs are really long!

317
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,500
Us 4 have already met up...

318
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,800
Eh?! Matsumoto-san you met up?

319
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,610
OF COURSE IDIOT!

320
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,600
Akasaka's Hie Shrine

321
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,810
There it is! Hie Shrine!

322
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,120
Hie Shrine! Oh damn they have stairs there?!

323
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,460
Of course they do!

324
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,560
Of course!

325
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,190
They're hella long!

326
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,990
We're gonna shave you with hair clippers

327
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:09,430
Please don't shave my head. Please don't shave my head.

328
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,060
We're in Akasaka, Tanaka

329
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,200
Please think about me too please

330
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,770
The hell we will!

331
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,560
It came up didn't it, Hie Shrine

332
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,530
You didn't think there were stairs?

333
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,830
I didn't think there were stairs. Why did I think of this place?

334
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,530
2.5 hours since the start, only Tanaka is left

335
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,760
They want to clinch it this time, time for 5th theme

336
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,760
Denny's

337
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,930
The one in Aoyama is famous right? The Aoyama Denny's

338
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,860
Ahhh! that place right?

339
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,700
It's a big one

340
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,030


341
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:53,130
Or there's the one on Kyuyamate, the Denny's in front of the Jojoen

342
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,240
Ah, by Shinsen intersection

343
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,760
They say Mori Shinichi goes there all the time

344
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,250
He orders 2 different plates,

345
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:06,530
He eats half of one and switches with his manager

346
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,290
He wants to try different things

347
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,290
What amazing information!

348
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,890
Can we go with my idea?

349
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,430
Why?

350
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,700
The Kyuyamate - "Why"?

351
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,500
Let's take a vote

352
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,660
Let's go with a vote
This is a tough one

353
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,860
Who says the Aoyama Denny's?

354
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,200
EHHH Really?

355
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,860
If you guys are wrong I'm shaving your heads!

356
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,730
Or I'll pull your eyelids off with pliers

357
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,400
Which one? Which one?

358
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,030
Neither

359
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:41,960
It's the first time we've had 4 people today, but maybe I'll split up

360
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,830
You go by yourself? Let's go already

361
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,930
I'm not convinced at all

362
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,560
It's gotta be the Aoyama Denny's

363
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,760
No no no no no no

364
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,460
So what will Tanaka do?

365
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,400
I got it! There's 2 of them though

366
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,530
There are 2 options

367
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,160
Damn this is hard!

368
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,630
Incidentally, could you tell us?

369
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:13,600
Aoyama, there's a Denny's in Aoyama right?

370
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,500
That one, or the Shinsen intersection one

371
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,360
That one -UWAH! This is hard!

372
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,530
Aoyama, or Shinsen?

373
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,430
[@!#!@#$%!]

374
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,230
[!@!@#@] Denny's

375
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,170
Are you good with that?
I'm good. Let's go

376
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,230
Tanaka chose from the same 2 options as the other 4

377
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,450
I gotta meet up this time

378
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,530
His 3rd time on the highway today

379
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,300
I've been on the highway so much today

380
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:57,500
We've been on the highway so many times...

381
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,200
I don't like feeling like a burden

382
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,330
Here right? Aoyama Denny's
Ah, here?

383
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,260
The 4 head to the Denny's in South Aoyama

384
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,560
One man is not convinced

385
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:21,430
If Kyuyamatei is the right answer, how will you bastards atone?

386
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,450
We're not your allies?

387
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,260
I was very insistent!

388
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,830
You filmed that right?

389
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,500
I think he'll come. Right Hosei-san?

390
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,730
Yeah, anytime now.

391
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,430
It'll take some time leaving from Odaiba

392
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,530
Tanaka gets off the highway, moments from his destination

393
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,010
text I want to end it with this one

394
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:51,100
But I can tell! There's no way he's coming.

395
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,460
Thank you!

396
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,330
So cold

397
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,600
If it comes down to that, you bastards...

398
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,730
It's fine if he got it wrong, I just wanna end this quickly

399
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,330
Yes, indeed

400
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,430
I'll bury you at Aoyama Cemetery

401
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,360
C'mon Tanaka

402
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,230
I said it right?!

403
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,660
What?!

404
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,460
Eh? YES!

405
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,700
TANAKA!!!!

406
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,530
TANAKAA!!!!!

407
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,050
YOU GOT IT DIDN'T YOU?!

408
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,650
Yay!

409
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,700
What the hell were you doing?

410
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,260
I feel great! It's gotta be here right?

411
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,730
Thank goodness!!

412
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,730
It's gotta be here

413
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,030
Why did you think of this place?

414
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,260
I was conflicted,

415
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,270
Between where?
Shinsen

416
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,800
AHHHHH
Yes

417
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,610
I tried to take us to Shinsen

418
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,510
Oh really?

419
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:54,070
But I knew you'd come here after all

420
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,330
No no no
Hold on hold on

421
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,760
He was so pissed off
He threatened us

422
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,300
He wanted to split up

423
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,330
He said if you didn't come, he'd bury us at Aoyama Cemetery

424
