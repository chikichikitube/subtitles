April 6, 2003

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,750
Gaki No Tsukai Dressing Room

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,780
Hey.

6
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,210
Hello.

7
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,780
Everyone: Hello.

8
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,150
Again?

9
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,850
You know what this is, right?

10
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,850
If I'm dressed like this.

11
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,620
No, I mean...

12
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,760
We've done this a few times before, right?

13
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,790
Yes.

14
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,190
Wait, could it be?

15
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,560
Wait, could it be?

16
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,230
Yeah, the duo partner has asked me again.

17
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,530
Again?

18
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,530
Don’t say “Again?” with that attitude.

19
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:25,960
But, I mean...

20
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,530
But, I mean...

21
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,630
What does he want to do this time?

22
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,600
This time...

23
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,100
it's weightlifting.

24
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,100
Why?

25
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,670
Weightlifting?

26
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,100
Why does he want to do that?

27
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,110
Right?

28
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,680
Weightlifting challenge!!

29
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,840
This time, Matsumoto has set his sights on a world record in weightlifting.

30
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,680
This time, Matsumoto has set his sights on a world record in weightlifting.

31
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:51,690
The world record in weightlifting at the time was 212.5 kilograms!!

32
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,550
At the time, the world record in weightlifting was

33
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:51,690
212.5 kilograms, by Hossein Rezazadeh of Iran.  However...

34
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,060
What he wants to lift is 220 kilograms.

35
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,690
What he wants to lift is 220 kilograms.

36
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,460
What he wants to lift is 220 kilograms.

37
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,990
To beat the world?

38
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,660
7.5 kilograms more?

39
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,200
A new world record.

40
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,930
But I will say,

41
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,230
you have to put in your effort.

42
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,340
He’ll get angry again if he doesn’t like your attitudes. Like before, he’ll just quickly leave.

43
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,000
He’ll get angry again if he doesn’t like your attitudes. Like before, he’ll just quickly leave.

44
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,770
No, we'll give it our best. But if he, himself, doesn't put the effort in,

45
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,240
No, we'll give it our best. But if he, himself, doesn't put the effort in,

46
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,080
No, we'll give it our best. But if he, himself, doesn't put the effort in,

47
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,880
we'll get pissed off, too.

48
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,020
That’s true.

49
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,020
Yeah.

50
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,020
But we’ll do it, for you, Hamada.

51
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,990
Yes.

52
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,450
Sorry about this. Help me out.

53
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,760
Sorry about this. Help me out.

54
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:25,760
Yes.

55
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,260
Once again, the four have stepped up for Matsumoto.

56
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,560
Once again, the four have stepped up for Matsumoto.

57
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,960
Matsumoto Hitoshi - the 220 kilogram weightlifting challenge.

58
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,200
220kg New World Record Challenge!!

59
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,200
Matsumoto Hitoshi

60
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,200
Weightlifting Snatch

61
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,200
Matsumoto Hitoshi - the 220 kilogram weightlifting challenge.

62
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,230
If we could just do it in one shot, and get it done.

63
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
Yes.

64
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,530
That's true.

65
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,140
If we could just do it in one shot, and get it done.

66
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,810
And keep him happy.

67
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,500
Right.

68
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,770
That's true.

69
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,970
No point in dragging it out.

70
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,310
Yes.

71
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,310
Yes.

72
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,310
Yes.

73
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,340
But this is tough.

74
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,280
This is quite a lot.

75
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,610
The world record really is amazing.

76
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,610
212kg, right?

77
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,550
He's here.

78
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,550
Huh?

79
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,620
Hey.

80
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,620
Hello.

81
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,050
Hello.

82
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,590
Hello.

83
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,290
We’ve already talked it over and we’re ready.

84
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,160
Yes.

85
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,790
Yes.

86
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,090
We’re ready.

87
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,900
Um, well,

88
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,900
Um, well,

89
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,640
To be honest

90
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,770
I don’t feel like being involved with you anymore.

91
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,470
I don’t feel like being involved with you anymore.

92
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Excuse me?

93
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,640
I don’t intend to be involved with you

94
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,970
on TV anymore.

95
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,640
on TV anymore.

96
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,410
But for this kind of thing, I don’t mind being involved for your sake.

97
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,320
But for this kind of thing, I don’t mind being involved for your sake.

98
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,760
Since the only ability you have is to lift me up.

99
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,660
Because you’re maggots that can’t turn into flies.

100
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,490
Because you’re maggots that can’t turn into flies.

101
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,500
Matsumoto's 1st Attempt!!

102
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,030
Matsumoto's first attempt.

103
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,500
Matsumoto's first attempt.

104
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,630
Ok. Let's go.

105
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,630
Ok. Let's go.

106
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,640
Come on.

107
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,710
He’s gone limp.

108
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,840
Yes, he's gone really limp.

109
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,580
He’s completely limp.

110
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,580
Come on.

111
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,580
Hold it.  What the hell?

112
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,580
You have to at least hold it.

113
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,810
You can't even freaking hold it?

114
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,820
Fasten it.

115
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,690
Geez.

116
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,490
Hold it. Geez.

117
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,960
Ok, put that on.

118
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,450
Ok.

119
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,960
Ok.

120
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,990
There’s no way he'll go up like this.

121
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,690
Bring him up. Excuse me. Ok, ok.

122
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,270
Lift the barbell with the buoyancy of a giant balloon

123
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,330
Ok, in one shot.

124
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,930
Even his neck is completely limp.

125
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,940
Ok, start it, please.

126
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,140
Ok.

127
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,340
Ok.

128
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,970
Lift it up.

129
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,580
All right.

130
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,210
Go up.

131
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,740
Go up.

132
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,080
In one shot.

133
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,710
Go up, go up.

134
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,610
220, 220.

135
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,510
Lift it up.

136
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,450
Go up, go up.

137
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,550
In one shot.

138
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,720
He tried to lift it a bit.

139
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,630
Yes, a bit.

140
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,230
He tensed up a bit there.

141
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,070
We almost had something.

142
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,570
This is good.

143
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,200
We almost had something.

144
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,570
You know what I think? His posture wasn't good.

145
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,210
You know what I think? His posture wasn't good.

146
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,310
That's true.

147
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,240
He's gripping it well but he can't go up like this.

148
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,480
He's gripping it well but he can't go up like this.

149
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,710
He’s got to get around here.

150
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,950
Right, with a better hold.

151
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,810
Right?

152
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,650
Oh, we have that.

153
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,650
Should we do that?

154
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,780
Let’s do these.

155
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:08,780
Yeah.

156
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,650
Can we put them on while he’s lying down? I don't think so.

157
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,290
Can we put them on while he’s lying down? I don't think so.

158
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,290
In any case, let's stand him up normally.

159
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,660
Ready and go.

160
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,660
Ready and go.

161
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,460
Ready and go.

162
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,460
Ready and go.

163
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,420
You can't stand up normally?

164
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,170
Hamada... Hamada...

165
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,530
Hamada... Hamada...

166
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,530
Huh?

167
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,400
He’s really staring at me.

168
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,800
He’ll probably jerk up really hard.

169
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,070
Lift him via his reaction to electric stimulation

170
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,870
As a reaction to it.

171
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,570
Yeah.

172
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,870
Ok, this should turn it on.

173
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,810
Ok, this should turn it on.

174
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,810
In one shot.

175
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Good, good.

176
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,680
He's, he's trying to, he's trying to lift it, he's trying to lift it.

177
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,080
I think he's going to lift it. He's going to lift it.

178
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,880
He's, he's trying to, he's trying to lift it, he's trying to lift it.

179
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,720
I think he's going to lift it. He's going to lift it.

180
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,680
He's, he's trying to, he's trying to lift it, he's trying to lift it.

181
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,120
I think he's going to lift it.

182
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,350
Go for it!

183
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,490
Lift it!

184
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,820
It's going up!

185
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,620
Lift it! Lift it! Lift it! Lift it!

186
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,660
Lift it! Lift it! Lift it! Lift it!

187
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,720
Lift it! Lift it! Lift it! Lift it!

188
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Lift it.

189
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,530
What is it?

190
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,860
Wait.

191
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,070
Matsumoto gets angry and goes backstage

192
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,670
Matsumoto.

193
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,470
So he can walk with those.

194
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,470
What was wrong with that?

195
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,340
That went well, didn't it?

196
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,770
It wasn't just one jerk like last time. He was trying to lift it over and over.

197
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,440
It wasn't just one jerk like last time. He was trying to lift it over and over.

198
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,940
He got angry.

199
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,510
Yeah, he got angry.

200
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,510
Yeah, he got angry at the end.

201
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,580
Let's go see him then.

202
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,320
He was really close to lifting it.

203
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,320
Right?

204
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,320
We're working really hard, too.

205
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,990
They go to the dressing room to see how Matsumoto is doing.

206
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,030
Matsumoto was carving a wooden Nandaro*.

207
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:36,630
*Note: Nandaro is a mascot of Nippon TV, which is the TV network that Gaki No Tsukai airs on.

208
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,240
We had two other things planned that we thought might work, but…

209
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,200
We had two other things planned that we thought might work, but…

210
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,810
What do you want to do?

211
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,050
The world record…

212
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,120
Yes. 220...

213
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,580
Yes.

214
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Yes. 220...

215
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,990
What happened back there,

216
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,530
People will think I’m being played around with.

217
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,990
That’s not what we're trying to do.

218
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes, we're trying to come up with things.

219
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,430
Yes.

220
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,430
Yes, we're trying to come up with things.

221
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,970
That's our intention.

222
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,770
If you’re just gonna screw around, then get out of here!!

223
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,170
Also,

224
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:16,310
when you're doing things to me

225
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,310
I’ll be staring at all of you.

226
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,520
So don't say things like,

227
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,520
“He’s really staring.”

228
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,290
Matsumoto's 2nd Attempt!!

229
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,290
Matsumoto's 2nd attempt.

230
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,450
... and he'll try to lift it.

231
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Here he is.

232
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,090
Let's go.

233
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,600
Yes, yes.

234
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Yes, sir.

235
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Yes, sir.

236
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,430
Yes, sir.

237
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,030
Prepare the next, that, the set up.

238
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,200
Prepare the next, that, the set up.

239
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,800
Prepare the next, that, the set up.

240
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,800
Ok.

241
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,170
You're wearing gloves so

242
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,170
I don't think you need the powder.

243
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,200
Ok.

244
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,870
Really?

245
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,010
Ok. Ok.

246
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,010
Ok. Ok.

247
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,210
This is fine, right?

248
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,210
This is fine, right?

249
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,120
His head goes on that side. Facing up.

250
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,890
His head goes on that side. Facing up.

251
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,460
Ok, facing up.

252
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,030
Yeah. No, not like that.

253
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,030
Yeah. No, not like that.

254
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,200
What the hell?

255
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,730
This should work.

256
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,240
There we go.

257
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,040
This will..

258
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,370
Right?

259
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,110
This will be fine.

260
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,110
This will be fine.

261
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,110
With this much going on, yeah.

262
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,310
Gloves.

263
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:25,880
Here.

264
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,250
Here we go. Ready and...

265
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,150
Here we go. Ready and...

266
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,150
Go.

267
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,920
Good, good. Good, good.

268
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,500
Ok, good, good.

269
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,500
Good, good. Good, good.

270
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,790
He got it.  Ok, the camera.

271
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,990
He got it.

272
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,990
Flip the camera.

273
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,490
Yes.

274
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,530
Hang Matsumoto and shoot the camera upside-down.

275
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,560
It's a success!

276
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,800
Yay!

277
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,300
A complete success!

278
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,940
His face!

279
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,340
Oh, wow. His face adds realism to it.

280
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,370
Oh, wow. His face adds realism to it.

281
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,810
Yeah.

282
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,280
Oh, yeah.

283
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,710
It looks real.

284
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,710
This is really good, right?

285
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,710
Great.

286
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,210
Slowly, slowly.

287
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,980
Ok.

288
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,550
Lowering him.

289
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,550
Yay.

290
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,550
It's a success.

291
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,620
I think it was completely successful.

292
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,050
Let's watch it together.

293
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,420
Yeah, see it again.

294
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,320
Yeah, see it again.

295
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,390
Let's rewind it and watch it together.

296
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,390
Let's watch it.

297
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,360
Let's rewind it and watch it together.

298
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,360
The playback.

299
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,360
Matsumoto gets angry and goes backstage again.

300
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,330
Huh?

301
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,330
Huh?

302
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,360
Matsumoto?

303
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,360
Huh?

304
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,300
Didn't that go well?

305
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,300
It was completely good.

306
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,300
It was good, no matter how you look at it.

307
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,300
Why is he angry, then?

308
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,570
Yeah, he was angry.  He kicked this and then left.

309
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,210
It was perfectly done.

310
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,210
They go to the dressing room to see how Matsumoto is doing, again.

311
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
It was perfect.

312
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,640
If we showed that to him, it should be fine.

313
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,140
If we showed that to him, it should be fine.

314
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,070
There'll be no reason for him to get angry at us.

315
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,120
Excuse us.

316
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,050
Excuse us.

317
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,380
Excuse us.

318
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,130
Matsumoto was eating nagashi-somen*.

319
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:52,520
*Note: Nagashi-somen is a food activity where somen (a type of noodle) flows down water in a bamboo to be caught by diners.  It is usually done outdoors during the summer.

320
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,700
In terms of the visuals, that should have been decent, I think.

321
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,700
In terms of the visuals, that should have been decent, I think.

322
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,040
It was.

323
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,980
It was, yes.

324
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,380
So... um... what..., what is it that you, um.

325
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:09,890
So... um... what..., what is it that you, um.

326
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,250
So... um... what..., what is it that you, um.

327
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:10,850
So... um... what..., what is it that you, um.

328
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,850
So... um... what..., what is it that you, um.

329
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,160
So, what... um.

330
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,200
Is it that you want to bully me or something?

331
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,830
Is it that you want to bully me or something?

332
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,830
Is it that you want to bully me or something?

333
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,000
No, we don't intend for that, right?

334
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,810
No, we don't intend for that, right?

335
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,610
No, we don't intend for that, right?

336
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,610
Yes.

337
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,810
Yes.

338
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,440
When you watch me

339
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,550
you can easily tell that I'm

340
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,550
straining in pain.

341
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,410
From my face.

342
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,780
So when that happens, like

343
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,180
"Oh, Matsumoto is... can someone... he's in pain."

344
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:42,680
"Oh, Matsumoto is... can someone... he's in pain."

345
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,350
"Oh, Matsumoto is... can someone... he's in pain."

346
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,890
"Is Matsumoto ok?" Nothing like that

347
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,790
"Is Matsumoto ok?" Nothing like that

348
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,660
happens, right? That's just unbelievable, you know.

349
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,460
happens, right? That's just unbelievable, you know.

350
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,430
That's what I'm saying.

351
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,770
It's dull to talk about this but right at the start

352
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,570
The velcro, the rough side, on my thighs hurt a little.

353
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,900
The velcro, the rough side, on my thighs hurt a little.

354
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,800
The velcro, the rough side, on my thighs hurt a little.

355
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,010
You put the smooth side on the skin.  That's what I would have done, if I was doing it.

356
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:10,880
But you guys purposely put the jagged side,

357
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,120
But you guys purposely put the jagged side,

358
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,750
all jagged and all on my skin. It's a dull thing but it hurts.

359
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,020
all jagged and all on my skin. It's a dull thing but it hurts.

360
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,550
We have to do that, since you won't really grip it.

361
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,190
We have to do that, since you won't really grip it.

362
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:22,660
You can blame me for not gripping it.

363
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,090
You can blame me for not gripping it.

364
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,460
Will you grip it next time, then?

365
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,270
Will you grip it next time properly?

366
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,800
So what I'm talking about is, not whether I'll grip it or not, but

367
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,100
So what I'm talking about is, not whether I'll grip it or not, but

368
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,770
Why was I put into that kind of situation and prepared to that extent and completely trifled with!

369
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,640
Why was I put into that kind of situation and prepared to that extent and completely trifled with!

370
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,640
Why was I put into that kind of situation and prepared to that extent and completely trifled with!

371
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,450
You're all responsible!!

372
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,220
I'm the one who

373
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,330
No, that's not it.

374
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,420
I don't want to have a long argument about this, so if you apologize to me and say you'll turn over a new leaf, then anytime,

375
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,270
I don't want to have a long argument about this, so if you apologize to me and say you'll turn over a new leaf, then anytime,

376
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,610
I'll go back into the ring, back into the dojo.  That's what I intend.

377
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,680
If we become the bigger man and apologize...

378
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,250
What's that, Tanaka?

379
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
Should we apologize?

380
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,790
We will apologize.

381
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,910
Then go ahead.

382
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Yes.

383
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,690
We will turn over a new leaf and do our best. We apologize.

384
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,430
We will turn over a new leaf and do our best. We apologize.

385
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,430
We will turn over a new leaf and do our best. We apologize.

386
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,270
We apologize.

387
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,270
We apologize.

388
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,900
This guy didn't apologize.

389
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,070
My bad.

390
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,850
Ok.

391
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,190
Matsumoto's 3rd Attempt!!

392
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,190
Matsumoto's 3rd attempt.

393
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,320
Let's go. Let's do this.

394
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,030
Ok, please.

395
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Let's go. Let's do this.

396
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,030
Yes, please.

397
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,830
All right, let's go.

398
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,830
Yes, sir.

399
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,830
Yes.

400
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,830
Let's go.

401
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
Lie down face up.

402
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,030
No, no.

403
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,330
It's the other way.

404
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,200
You can't do that for everything.

405
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,070
Ok.

406
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,000
Face up.

407
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,230
Ok, yes.

408
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,430
His legs, his legs.

409
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,640
His legs, his legs.

410
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,940
Is this wrong?

411
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,910
Like this.

412
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,440
Ok, that's good.

413
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,640
Ok, that's good.

414
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,640
That's good.

415
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,450
Ok, start it, please.

416
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,150
Please.

417
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,450
All right, this will definitely work.

418
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,480
Winch him up on an incline.

419
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,850
Good, good.

420
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,790
That's good.

421
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,550
It's going up.

422
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,790
Wow.

423
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,490
Yes!

424
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,860
A complete success!

425
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,900
Yes!

426
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,300
Ok!

427
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,170
Let me down.

428
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,070
Let me down.

429
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:51,870
Ow. Ow, ow. Let me down.

430
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,570
Ow. Ow, ow. Let me down.

431
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,460
Ow. Ow, ow. Let me down.

432
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:53,710
Can you... Let me down. Can you... Let me down.

433
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,340
Can you... Let me down. Can you... Let me down.

434
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:54,860
Can you... Let me down. Can you... Let me down.

435
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,180
Can you... Let me down. Can you... Let me down.

436
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,140
Can you let me down? Can you let me down? Can you let me down?

437
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,680
Can you let me down? Can you let me down? Can you let me down?

438
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,380
Can you let me down? Can you let me down? Can you let me down?

439
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,680
Can you lower him a bit? Ok, lower him a bit. Yeah.

440
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,250
Can you... Can you... Can you...

441
00:12:59,250 --> 00:12:59,540
Can you... Can you... Can you...

442
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,510
Can you... Can you... Can you...

443
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,320
Can you lower him a bit? Ok, lower him a bit. Yeah.

444
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,120
Can you lower him a bit? Ok, lower him a bit. Yeah.

445
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Until his feet touch the ground or so.

446
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,120
Yeah, that's good.

447
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,580
Ok.

448
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,090
How's this? It looks like you're lifting it.

449
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,090
No. No. No.

450
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,860
No. No. No.

451
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,090
How's this? It looks like you're lifting it.

452
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,160
No. No. No.

453
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,590
All right!

454
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,360
Nice!

455
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,530
It looks like you're lifting it.

456
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,000
Huh?

457
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,640
He's walking with the stoppers.

458
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:30,010
Matsumoto gets angry and goes backstage, yet again.

459
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,710
He's not going to skate with them at all.

460
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,210
It looked clean, right?

461
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,150
It was fine.

462
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,150
Yeah, it looked clean.

463
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,650
It was better than the upside-down one, right?

464
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,990
Much better.

465
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,990
Easier for him, too.

466
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,990
It wasn't good enough?

467
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,590
They go to the dressing room to see how Matsumoto is doing, yet again.

468
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,990
Gee, what is it.

469
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,560
What is the problem?

470
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,660
It's difficult.

471
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,010
Matsumoto was playing mahjong with his buddies.

472
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,180
Wow, all this smoke.

473
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,010
What an old mahjong board.

474
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,850
They're really into it.

475
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,360
Ready hand!

476
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,890
Man, that's fast.

477
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,960
Who are they?

478
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,770
I don't know.

479
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,270
Mahjong buddies.

480
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,270
Mahjong buddies, right?

481
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,970
Mahjong!

482
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,310
Seriously? Seriously?

483
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,000
Seriously? Seriously?

484
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,680
That was kind of slow.

485
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,550
Ready hand, all simples, no-points hand

486
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,550
Ready hand, all simples, no-points hand

487
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,550
Ready hand, all simples, no-points hand

488
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,550
One

489
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,550
shot

490
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,550
dora

491
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,550
dora

492
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,450
That's a haneman!*

493
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:48,050
*Note: These are Japanese Mahjong terms.  Matsumoto won the game with a high score.

494
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,450
You've never played.

495
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,220
I see.

496
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,220
What do you all want?

497
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,090
Was that not good, visually?

498
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,190
Was that not good, visually?

499
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,190
Was that not good, visually?

500
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,500
What I'm saying is, can you not tell when your duo partner is in pain?

501
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:54,930
What I'm saying is, can you not tell when your duo partner is in pain?

502
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,000
What I'm saying is, can you not tell when your duo partner is in pain?

503
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,230
In pain? Well...

504
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,400
The thing is, you all

505
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,720
The thing is, you all

506
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,270
To be honest, don't have love for me.

507
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,710
To be honest, don't have love for me.

508
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,340
Tell me how much

509
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,680
Tell me how much

510
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,680
you like me, all of you.

511
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,310
Make an analogy between me and a fruit.

512
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,450
Endo.

513
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,380
Yes.

514
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,520
A strawberry.

515
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,360
Right?

516
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,290
Make an analogy between me and a kitchen equipment.

517
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,160
A sponge?

518
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,160
What?

519
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,170
A sponge.

520
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,670
Ok.

521
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,220
Hey, Hamada.

522
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,220
Yes.

523
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,840
Sing WOW WAR TONIGHT*.

524
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:45,370
*Note: WOW WAR TONIGHT is a 1995 pop song by Hamada.

525
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,780
Sing it.

526
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,480
Why do I have to sing?

527
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,660
If you feel you were wrong, sing it. Hurry up.

528
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,660
If you feel you were wrong, sing it. Hurry up.

529
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:58,560
I'd like to sometimes have a drink, side-by-side, like this

530
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,060
And sto-

531
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,630
Sing it with more energy.

532
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,700
Like when you did it for Kohaku*!

533
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:06,700
*Note: The Kohaku Utagassen is an annual music show (akin to a Grammy Awards concert).

534
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,470
Do it.

535
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,980
I'd like to sometimes have a drink, side-by-side, like this

536
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,720
And have a stop over, just for a bit

537
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,380
That's enough.

538
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,480
Let's go, then.

539
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
Yes.

540
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,480
Hold on.

541
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,950
Do an impression as you leave.

542
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,020
Tanaka, do Saigo Takamori*.

543
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,020
Tanaka, do Saigo Takamori*.

544
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:31,020
*Note: Saigo Takamori is a 19th century historical figure.

545
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,370
A Saigo Takamori impression?

546
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,790
Hurry and do it, hurry. While you're worrying about it, just do it.
