00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
Note: Every kanji in Japan have at least 2 ways of
being read. The kun-yomi and the on-yumi reading.

00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,600
FENDING

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,100
Usually Kun-yumi is used when the kanji stands alone and
usually on-yumi is used when it's together with another kanji.

00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,770
We're all ready.. you may start!

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:16,100
Matsumoto is using the on-yumi reading of the kanji's,
so he's actually using the wrong reading and the words he says doesn't have any meaning.

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,450

Spring!

42
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,400
Using the kun-yomi. The
on-yomi reading would be "shun"

43
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,800
Thinking.

44
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,370

00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,050

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,600
England?

50
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,220
No!

51
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,570
Italy?

52
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,070

00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,670
No!

55
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,400
What?

56
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,400
Kun-yomi again. on-yomi would be "ka".

57
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,520
Australia!

58
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,870
Australia!

59
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,650
Australia!

60
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,250
Thank you very much!
