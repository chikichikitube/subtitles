00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,600
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,330
Letâ€™s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:23,050
Kazutoyo Koyabu, Tamura Kenji and Morita

4
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:34,180
This is the semi-annual everyone's theories special!

5
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,420
The Three Musketeers have the honor of gathering today
-Really?

6
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,940
Who gave you this name?

7
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,460
We are known as the Three Musketeers of Order and Comedy

8
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,090
Just the three of you?

9
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,560
It's the three of us. This time Morita is a newcomer
-Yes

10
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,350
Individual Morita
-Enough!

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,720
Don't mention that

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,760
Who has been replaced?

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,280
It seems to be changed many times
-The position often changes

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,700
For example, Kasuga, Kojima.
-Yes, yes

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,900
Kasuga can't show his face on TV anymore, right?

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,980
That's not the case

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,020
He should not be willing to show his face

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,540
If he was an individual it'd be over for him

19
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,120
Indeed

20
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,010
So who wants to be the first?

21
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,330
Let me take the lead, please.
-Wow, this guy's voice is loud enough

22
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,940
To open is a sharp and incomparable theory

23
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,050
I hope to meet everyone's expectations

24
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,720
The theory I bring this time is

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:53,110
If you run into your mother on the street but are treated with indifference, you will gradually think it's a stranger who looks like them

26
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,590
A long title

27
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,210
Good point, good point

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,020
This can happen?

29
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,670
This kind of thing usually does not happen, but we want to see what happens if it does

30
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,170
When I talk to my father, he doesn't change his look at all

31
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,210
That's something else, don't bring it up

32
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,500
Stop it, okay?

33
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,050
This may indeed be the case from an age perspective

34
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,380
He's already not listening

35
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,170
What are you talking about!?

36
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:20,990
"Not listening"

37
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,260
You're so insensitive!

38
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,290
No, it's like he's just saying the same thing all the time

39
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:36,690
If you run into your mother on the street but are treated with indifference, you will gradually think it's a stranger who looks like them

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,500
Assisting us this time is

41
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,740
Panther Ogata's mother, Meiko Ogata

42
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,750
Her son is being interviewed by a fake magazine

43
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,120
To make mom look more like a stranger

44
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,720
She wears clothes she would not normally wear

45
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,250
Already in a different category

46
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,940
And takes position in front of the building where her son is

47
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,930
Ogata, what are you going to do?

48
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,160
What will happen?

49
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,920
It's pretty scary

50
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,190
Even with the glasses, it's hard to tell

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,890
Ogata completely directly fails to notice her

52
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,550
After all, it's a different look

53
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,000
Due to the result, we retest

54
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:33,900
This time in front of Yoshimoto's head office, she's in position without her glasses

55
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,270
The result

56
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,530
Here we go, here we go

57
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,710
Here we go!

58
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,700
Should notice this time

59
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,750
This dress...

60
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,790
He's noticed!

61
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,480
What are you doing?
-Eh, eh?

62
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,820
Eh?
-Eh?

63
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,510
You're my mum, right?

64
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,480
What?
-You're my mom, right?

65
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,520
Why?

66
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,790
You have the wrong person

67
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,260
No, no, no. You're my mother.
-No, no, no, what?

68
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,380
Who are you shouting "mum" at?

69
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,590
Eh?
-Eh?

70
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,030
I don't know you.
-What the hell is going on?

71
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,130
Eh?
-Eh?

72
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,400
I'm just waiting for a friend here

73
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,030
What?
-You have the wrong person, right?

74
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,840
Eh?
-Eh?

75
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,770
I really don't get it.
-Stop, stop, stop.

76
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,510
You are definitely my mother!

77
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,380
Why?

78
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,510
You're definitely my mother.
-No, no...i'm not

79
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,120
Eh?
-Eh?

80
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,180
I'm meeting a friend

81
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,190
They haven't come yet, so i've been waiting here

82
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,590
No no no

83
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,890
Wait a minute...

84
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,090
You are my mother, right? Is that wrong?

85
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,700
Big mistake. I don't even know you

86
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,940
Her acting skills are explosive

87
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,330
You are definitely my mother!

88
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,240
Absolutely.
-No...no, i'm not. I don't know you

89
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,270
No, you're definitely my mother.
-I said no!

90
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,240
You're my mother!
-What are you doing?

91
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,510
Why are you being like this? It's too strange and rude, right?

92
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,150
One hundred percent.
-I said no. How rude!

93
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,520
I'm rude?
-Yes, you're rude

94
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,390
How is it possible to find two people so alike

95
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,060
I have never seen such a shameless person

96
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,300
You are definitely my mother, I can't be wrong

97
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,300
It's so weird

98
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,290
Starting to be a bit suspicious

99
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,570
Are you telling the truth? Where are you from?

100
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,470
Where am I from? I'm from Iwate

101
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,800
Not Miyagi?
-No.

102
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,340
Then maybe our ancestors are connected

103
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,580
We are definitely relatives, no doubt about it

104
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,360
Relatives!

105
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,810
He actually took the bait?

106
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,720
What is your last name?

107
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,190
Fujiwara
-Fujiwara?

108
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,350
My last name is Ogata

109
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,990
It's not Ogata?
-No.

110
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,430
Can this kind of thing can happen?

111
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,870
I'm so sorry.
-Yeah

112
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,700
Ah, the phone is not the same

113
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,570
You must have made a mistake...

114
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,870
But isn't it just too similar?

115
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,580
Similar, like, super similar

116
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,550
I've never seen a dress like this either

117
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,120
Are you sure you're not my mother?
-I'm sure

118
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,220
I always go out dressed like this

119
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,490
I can't believe this is happening...

120
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,720
Sorry about that.
-Yeah

121
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,730
In summary
Consecutive denials will lead to the person being assumed to be someone else

122
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,780
In the end, he really gave up

123
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,000
He really thought it was another person

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,240
Really took the bait!

125
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,360
The mother worked very hard

126
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Controlled her accent

127
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,180
Stayed close to standard language and spoke in a different way than usual

128
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,720
Not even a single smile

129
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,800
Aside from this I have many over theories for everyone

130
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,090
Please enjoy the following few all together

131
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,090
The rest of the theories selected by Koyabu are...

132
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:04,440
If the string on the pull-to-heat beef tongue lunch box is actually a party cracker, you won't even notice it

133
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,140
Another long one

134
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,100
This time, under the guise of a special test program meeting

135
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,860
Ganbare Luya

136
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,060
What is a special test program?

137
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,720
For a tasting session, what was put in front of them was

138
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,570
Special Beef Tongue Pull-ring Bento

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,170
What is the result?

140
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,250
Then please eat first
-Okay

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,510
Must be delicious when it's hot

142
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,040
A little scared

143
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,000
Look at Mahiru's face!

144
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,910
This was all for this reaction!

145
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:01,090
The next theory selected by Koyabu is

146
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,930
Do pachinko parlor clerks spend their days off playing pachinko

147
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,040
The investigation begins

148
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:17,040
How long have you worked at the pachinko parlor?

149
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,580
Been doing this since I started college

150
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,960
About 12 years now

151
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,580
What do you do on your days off?

152
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,490
I play pachinko

153
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,690
Does it make people forget reality?

154
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,790
Once you're addicted, it is like you're instantly in another world

155
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,630
There are times to win and times to lose

156
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,840
These moments are what make you forget about everyday life

157
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,830
It's just too fun

158
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,240
To deal with the hard life of working at a pachinko parlor

159
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,810
You can use pachinko to forget about it

160
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,310
What do you do on your day off?

161
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,310
On rest days I play pachinko

162
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,850
When on a break I will definitely go to play pachinko

163
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,650
Absolutely? 100%?
-Yes, almost always

164
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,850
What do you do on your day off?

165
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,820
I play pachinko

166
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,920
What time from?

167
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,490
As soon as the store opens

168
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,060
What do you do on your day off?

169
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,500
I usually play online games
-Online games?

170
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,550
We surveyed the days off of 62 pachinko parlor workers

171
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,170
In the lead was Pachinko

172
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,080
What's more

173
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,840
I also play on work days

174
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,180
I play pachinko before work

175
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,350
After work and I go back to playing pachinko, that's it

176
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,490
If i'm on the morning shift, I'll go to play after occasionally

177
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,220
So once pachinko is over, you move onto pachinko

178
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,520
An endless loop of pachinko

179
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,260
It's not just the days off, but even the weekdays

180
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,200
There are many people who play pachinko before and after work

181
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,640
After having fun in pachinko...
-After you've had fun, you go to work in pachinko

182
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,470
Basically I spend about 300 days or more a year on it

183
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,080
In the pachinko store?
-Yes

184
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,080
The next theory selected by Koyabu is

185
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:16,690
When calling someone to check the answer to an argument, and your opinion is correct, the first thing you will say after hanging up the phone is, "See?"

186
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,430
I told you!

187
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,240
So, Tsuneida will set-up the verification

188
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,180
How do you set this up?

189
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,210
By targetting his senior

190
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,510
And so

191
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:41,350
Komen is a junior high school graduate, right?

192
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,690
They say he's a junior high school graduate

193
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,960
He actually graduated from high school

194
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,000
No... junior high school graduate, right?
-He's not a junior high school graduate

195
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,970
Eh, really?
-Yeah

196
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,300
Eh? No way!

197
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,440
A debate begins

198
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,730
I want to make sure, seriously

199
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,110
Hello? Sorry to trouble you, Komen

200
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,980
Tsuneida is wondering...

201
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,550
We're both drinking

202
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,990
And he's talking nonsense

203
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,990
He says you're a junior high school graduate, but you're a high school graduate, right?

204
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,590
Right?

205
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,700
As Komen is actually a high school graduate

206
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,670
Will he say "See!"?

207
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,340
Okay, sorry

208
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,110
You were saying?

209
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,120
The next theory selected by Koyabu is

210
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:53,290
At the moment of crossing the finish line when winning the marathon, no runner will not raise their hands high in the air

211
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:00,470
To verify, we investigated the winning moments of Olympic gold medalists across all generations

212
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,900
First, the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro

213
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,610
Hands up!

214
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,380
Next is the women's race

215
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,280
Sure enough, they also lifted

216
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,490
Basically, they will

217
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,890
Then came the London 2012 Olympics

218
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,910
2008 Beijing Olympics

219
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,230
Next also

220
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,830
Two consecutive gold medals

221
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,170
Finally Takahashi wins the gold medal

222
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,970
Into the glorious final sprint now

223
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,240
The olympic gold medalist arrives at the finish line

224
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,180
Now Yegorova crosses the finish line

225
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,060
Arriving at the end

226
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,870
However, there were also less subtle players

227
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,890
Leaving the 10th win at the Olympics Breakthrough finish

228
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,050
Carlos Lupis now crosses the finish line

229
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,890
John Benoit of the United States crosses the finish line

230
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,730
Aside from the women's marathon standing race

231
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:10,900
Which was not included in the TBS broadcast, all the gold medalists raised their hands

232
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,030
What an old image!

233
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,300
Ah, raised his hands!

234
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,400
What a thin rope

235
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,020
Do you want to lift it? Do you want to lift it?

236
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,840
No lift

237
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,830
The final theory selected by Koyabu is

238
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:44,320
The hairstyle that appears most in lyrics is the ponytail

239
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:52,980
Flat hair

240
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:52,980
Braids

241
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:52,980
Bomb hair

242
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:52,980
Long hair

243
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,980
2x ponytail

244
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,440
The results of the 10th to 6th place are as follows

245
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,980
Next, we will publish the 5th to 2nd place at once

246
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,580
Today is also full of energy, a big bang

247
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,750
Drape yourself in a bachelor's suit and add an flat top

248
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:07,960
Bald headed Taro, under the sun

249
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:15,770
Short-haired me showing a smile

250
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,630
Slightly to the left perm

251
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:25,280
Finally, in the top spot is

252
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,840
Ponytail shake shake shake

253
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,650
A long way ahead!

254
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,220
Ponytail with 102 songs

255
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:37,260
Is a distant first

256
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,160
I see.
-Yes

257
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,260
Yoshida, what do you think?

258
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:47,510
Aren't Pachinko's clerks tired of being like that all the time?

259
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,510
They stay where they work all the time, don't they?

260
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,240
Yoshida, you watch the news even on your days off, right?

261
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
The concept is the same

262
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,110
That's not the right way to put it, is it?

263
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,500
I wanna know her opinion

264
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,940
In that case, is it true that the news anchors do not watch the news during their breaks?

265
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,280
Well, as an entertainer

266
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,250
I watch variety shows and also go see live shows at the theatre

267
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,150
Newscasts are not just about reading the news

268
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:18,070
If you think in this way, should people who grow rice on the farm eat bread?

269
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,760
What are you mad about?

270
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,000
Let's explore this in a theory

271
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,820
Next is a theory selected by Tamura Kenji

272
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,720
Have you ever played VR?

273
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,370
Sure.
-You have?

274
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,320
Yes, I think so

275
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,150
It's really awesome now

276
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,720
It's like another world

277
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,800
So its feels very real

278
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,820
So, I brought this theory

279
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,960
If you wake up in a VR world, you would be super surprised

280
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,170
What?

281
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,100
Sounds tough

282
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,070
How can you do it?

283
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,900
Yeah

284
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,000
First you need to put it on

285
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,570
It isn't easy

286
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,900
That thing is pretty heavy

287
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,720
And it is important for the person not to wake up

288
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,570
But this program has a king of not waking up if he falls asleep

289
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,750
Could it be...

290
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,150
Everyone's favorite monster

291
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,570
He once got home drunk and went under his bed

292
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,050
And fell asleep straight away

293
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,300
You can put it on, right? If it's that guy.
-Should be doable

294
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,970
Get him drunk and go home

295
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,250
And put it on before he sobers up

296
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,550
What happens when Kuro-chan wakes up in the morning to find himself in a different world

297
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:50,090
If you wake up in a VR world, you would be super surprised

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,970
So

299
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,250
My most recommended pubs

300
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,570
Start!

301
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:02,950
We start with this fake plan of drinking and talking

302
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,200
And so

303
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,540
Iwawawaaaa~

304
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,750
Ah, smells good!

305
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,320
Too close!

306
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,700
As usual, Kuro-chan drinks at a high speed

307
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,890
Then I will touch you

308
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,350
And follows up with sexual harassment in front of the camera as usual

309
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,400
You're really cute, Irina!

310
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,450
Ah, cute, like...

311
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,350
Whoa, today may be interesting

312
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,900
Another, please
-Good

313
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,170
The more he drinks, the stronger the result

314
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,100
How much are you drinking?

315
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,270
Drinking loads

316
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,350
I want to go out with you and I want to have sex too

317
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,180
But... but that's not what I mean

318
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,220
Completely drunk

319
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,700
And

320
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Danger danger!

321
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,550
Wall-to-wall

322
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,000
Really, I... I really think you are cute

323
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,000
I know

324
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,400
Careful

325
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,500
Monstrous as per usual

326
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,900
Bye bye

327
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,970
Irina... I... like Irina

328
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,570
Irina
-Ok

329
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,350
Preparation complete

330
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,020
Is there any other ending like this?

331
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,120
The location shoot?

332
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,900
It's over

333
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,220
Is it over?

334
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,350
Yes, please put on your shoes

335
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,470
He's farting

336
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:35,520
A man who doesn't drink like an adult in his 40s

337
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,370
Is stuffed into a cab

338
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,070
And forced to return home

339
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,520
Later, he arrives home

340
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,250
Irina

341
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,850
He immediately lays down on his bed

342
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,220
And falls asleep in a flash

343
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,350
So

344
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,220
Here we go, here we go

345
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,550
No need to wear the costume, right?

346
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:13,720
Finally, the VR equipment is brought it

347
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,900
Really can't wake up

348
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,120
Putting it on so early?

349
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,350
Who knows when he'll wake up

350
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,000
By the way, the VR Kuro-chan will see is this

351
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,070
An image of standing in a high place

352
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:38,020
The next thing to do would have been to wait until the morning but

353
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,020
Even if you know it's VR you'd still be afraid

354
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,800
As it will be more difficult to distinguish between virtual and reality in a drunken state

355
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,070
We wake him up immediately

356
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,300
However

357
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,400
He doesn't wake up at all

358
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,370
So the final resort was used

359
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,950
Sincere effort is expended to get him on his feet

360
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,020
So

361
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,500
Finally he's a little sober

362
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,470
The VR experience begins

363
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,500
What is this? A construction site?

364
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,070
What?

365
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,610
What what what what?

366
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,010
What? There's a bell. There's a bell

367
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,610
Bell, what? What's going on?

368
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,980
What's happening?

369
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,720
What is this?

370
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,420
Where is this?

371
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,020
Where? Where? Where? Where?

372
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,390
A ferris wheel!

373
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,730
Where? What's going on?

374
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,500
Like this, Kuro-chan has completely entered the VR world

375
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,570
But because he doesn't look down much he isn't that scared

376
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,470
At this point, the plan changes

377
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,620
And the image is replaced with a sexy one

378
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,690
Who?

379
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,390
Seriously, who is this? Very cute

380
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,800
He wants to touch

381
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,790
What is this? What?

382
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,160
What?

383
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,960
Who is it?

384
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,730
Change of clothes? Who?

385
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,400
What what what?

386
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,150
Really wants to touch

387
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,320
What is this?

388
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,120
Wait, the clothes...

389
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,170
Watching so intently

390
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
Looking at the ass

391
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,070
Crazyily looking at the ass

392
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,520
Constantly at this angle

393
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,420
He's watching!

394
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:22,950
Suddenly looking at the face now

395
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,500
And then

396
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,860
Seducing me? Seducing me?

397
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So scary

398
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
He pounced!

399
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,380
It hurts. What's wrong?

400
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,450
Ow ow ow!

401
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,620
He just tried to jump on her!

402
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,520
So painful

403
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,220
What? What is this?

404
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,620
What's going on now?

405
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,220
Pay attention to me!

406
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,060
You're not seducing me?

407
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,830
This, what, what is this, what?

408
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,790
Hey, what...

409
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,160
Completely inaccessible

410
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,060
What what what?

411
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,400
Hey, are you not seducing me?

412
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,740
What? What is this?

413
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,070
Don't say goodbye!

414
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,470
Don't say goodbye!

415
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,280
What's going on now?

416
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,150
What? What's happening? What?

417
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,080
Wait a sec

418
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,890
Wait, where did you go?

419
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,150
Then

420
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:32,920
Finally realised

421
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,760
What is this?

422
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,730
Where's Irina?

423
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,170
Irina?

424
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,740
This is my home

425
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,510
What's going on?

426
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,050
A dream?

427
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:03,020
In summaryA dreamlike VR experience

428
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,200
Haven't seen him for so long but he's still amazing

429
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,850
Really a monster

430
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,300
Usually this isn't the sort of approach you should use to get close to a woman

431
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,870
It's like a cartoon

432
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,520
So scary!

433
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,220
Ow ow ow

434
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,870
Lupin the 3rd in action

435
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,050
That jumping method!

436
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,250
Lupin's jumping method when only wearing underwear

437
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,270
Here are more theories selected by Tamura Kenji

438
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,170
The next is

439
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,790
If you get super mad, any living creature can feel your anger

440
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,000
Mammals like dogs or cats can certainly understand anger

441
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:45,700
So we investigate with a reptile

442
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,650
This time we use a turtle approaching food

443
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,550
Behind the food, an expression of anger with full force

444
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:00,470
Will it cause the turtle to stop?

445
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,070
Start!

446
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,980
Don't fucking come this way!

447
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,550
Putting on such a disgusting face

448
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,520
Don't approach me with that face

449
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,720
If you come here i'll wrap you up in this green vegetable and eat you!

450
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,230
I won't forgive even a turtle!

451
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,600
Oi, get the hell back!

452
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,860
If you come any closer

453
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,170
I'll beat you so hard you'll never reach land again

454
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,570
You bald bastard!

455
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,340
Hey, I told you not to get close!

456
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,340
Hey, don't come any closer!

457
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,540
Hey, I told you not to come any closer!

458
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,510
Oi, are you fucking listening to me?

459
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,650
Get the fuck out of here. Stop fucking around!

460
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:45,460
The next theory selected by Tamura Kenji is

461
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,120
Bulldogs with spiky collars do not actually exist

462
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,300
Do young people know this?

463
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,320
The studded collar was made famous by cartoons and BULL-DOG SAUCE

464
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,550
To put it bluntly, it's a cliche

465
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,720
And may even hurt the dog itself

466
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,020
So, surely no bulldog actually wears it

467
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,300
But after starting a investigation

468
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,300
We received a sighting in Osaka

469
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,470
So

470
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,850
We visit the family

471
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,170
Hello

472
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,870
Sorry

473
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,500
We hear you have a pit bull with a spiky collar

474
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,770
Ah, yes

475
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,310
Really?

476
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,210
Want to see it? Come on up

477
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,280
That's her. That's the kid

478
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
Yes, there is

479
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:56,170
This dog wears the owner's homemade collar

480
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,400
Why do you want it to wear this studded collar?

481
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,170
Looks good

482
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,970
Bulldogs have been wearing these collars for a long time

483
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,540
The bulldog's name

484
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,810
Comes from the fact that they were bred to fight with bulls

485
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,910
So why would they need to wear a studded collar?

486
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,080
To protect the neck

487
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,780
The neck is the weakest place of the dog

488
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,320
So this protects the neck when the dogs fight

489
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,220
It's protective gear

490
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,390
With the spiky collar

491
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,330
Will it not prick the dog?

492
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,990
It's okay, it's okay to be bitten and pricked

493
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,600
The skin is soft

494
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,860
Is that so?
-Yes

495
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,500
There is elasticity so it is soft and fluffy like this

496
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,220
Just like this

497
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,550
Really? I see

498
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Don't get bitten!

499
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,270
By the way, the master's skin is not so soft

500
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,970
As bloodshed has occurred after being jumped often

501
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:00,360
The next theory selected by Tamura Kenji is

502
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,970
People who buy crossword books have no immediate plans for after

503
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,170
We monitored a bookstore for 3 days

504
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,550
Too malicious

505
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,200
Not many sales

506
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,570
Did it take 3 days?

507
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,550
Finally, we found a purchaser

508
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,700
And so

509
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,020
We are a TBS program

510
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,690
What did you just buy?

511
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,020
Logic

512
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,520
Puzzle

513
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,590
Can I ask you something?

514
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:39,000
Do you have plans after this?

515
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,800
Yes

516
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,000
What plans?

517
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,900
Going to KFC

518
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,940
For lunch?
-Yes.

519
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,010
And after that?

520
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,010
Nothing

521
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,050
So... you're free?

522
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,710
Well, a bit

523
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,250
The last theory selected by Tamura Kenji is

524
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,500
Can Hikomaro make a bad dish look good?

525
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,300
Can Hikomaro make a bad dish look good?

526
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,200
A treasure chest!

527
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,870
Known for his unique performance

528
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,150
Hikomaru is one of the pioneers of food commentary

529
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:34,900
But, will he express the feeling that something is unpalatable?

530
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
So

531
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,870
This dish was prepared by

532
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,420
Here we go again

533
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,800
Working man!

534
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:42,860
Wake up

535
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,860
Hey, what what what?

536
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,770
Let's go

537
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,370
Where to?

538
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,040
You'll know when you get there

539
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,910
What is this Antonio Inoki "You'll understand when you go. Thank you."

540
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:56,370
Let's go

541
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,300
Did he ever say that?

542
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,320
So, with Kuro-chan, who has finally sobered up

543
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,150
Is this a metaphor you use if you just woke up?

544
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,200
So impolite

545
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,270
He arrives at the kitchen studio

546
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,550
Where?

547
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,650
What is it?

548
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:11,420
Now, Kuro-chan, please cook a dish in a blindfolded state

549
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,420
Huh?

550
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,490
Wait, I don't cook

551
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,430
Haven't done it in over 10 years

552
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,000
Don't you think it's strange to be blindfolded?

553
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:26,850
Despite saying this, he starts cooking blindfolded straight away

554
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,850
Stir-fried vegetables

555
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,040
I think it's a carrot

556
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,320
Kuro-chan recognizes ingredients and spices by touch and taste

557
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,080
Soy sauce

558
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,950
The hygiene level is a bit...

559
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,650
What are you doing?

560
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,450
Yeah, he doesn't know

561
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,700
Can only taste test

562
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,460
This is probably olive oil

563
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,430
Wait, this stuff does not seem to be drinkable

564
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,470
Afterwards, he boldly cuts vegetables

565
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,020
And carefully sautÃ©s them in a pan

566
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,820
Impressive he got this far

567
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,870
Talented!

568
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:07,950
However

569
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,850
Pepper

570
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,480
Is it in?

571
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,050
I can't tell if any has gone in or not

572
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,620
The finished dish is this

573
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,150
OPEN

574
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,940
What's this smell?

575
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,940
The vegetables are a mess

576
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,680
To be frank, it's more feed than a dish

577
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,400
So, the food review begins

578
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,200
Here we go

579
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,320
So hard

580
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,860
See? It's raw

581
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,030
These fried vegetables are past it

582
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:04,070
This is the Lehman Shock of the vegetable world

583
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:04,070
â€»Lehman Shock: An important trigger for the outbreak of the 2008 U.S. financial crisis

584
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,870
The collapse has already occurred

585
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,910
2nd try

586
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,910
Ah, a nice sound

587
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,910
Wow, what is this?

588
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,710
Too much pepper

589
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,150
Pepper's solo concert

590
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,620
This...

591
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,290
Horses won't even eat it

592
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:26,190
A horse won't eat it, it's just not good

593
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,030
A complete acrobatic troupe of food waste

594
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:35,070
In summary
The difficulty of eating was very well conveyed

595
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,300
As expected

596
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,320
Very impressive

597
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,600
What do you think, Sho?

598
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,800
The bulldog

599
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,150
Had the feeling of wanting to protect the public's impression

600
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,470
I think it's interesting

601
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,950
Our old CD covers were similar

602
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,370
We had bats with spikes on them

603
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,620
We made them

604
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,700
Everyone felt depressed

605
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,300
Using such a thing to hit was someone would be just despicable

606
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,000
You'd have to have brain issues to use it

607
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,870
The type that, instead of beating people up

608
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,970
Wouldn't dare to actually stand up to other people

609
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,250
What have you learned?

610
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,000
Next are the theories chosen by Morita

611
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,950
So, I'll be finishing things

612
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,970
Okay, got it.
-Go for it!

613
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,210
The last of The Three Musketeers

614
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,380
No need for this name

615
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,940
As the last of the Three Musketeers of the Order and-

616
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,000
It's the "Three Musketeers of Order and Comedy"

617
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,640
Enough already!

618
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
There's business issues related to this

619
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,390
What business, you're an indivdiual!

620
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,320
Individuals can also be members of the Three Musketeers!

621
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,990
It's "The Individual Three Musketeers"

622
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,040
The Three Musketeers, my, Takei Juso and TrumpMan

623
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,630
That's it. The theory I chose for everyone are as follows

624
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,330
Does throwing a tantrum work for adults?

625
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,430
Eh?
-Eh?

626
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,970
Children do it to their parents

627
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:01,580
Will it work if parents do it to their children?

628
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:06,470
Does throwing a tantrum work for adults?

629
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,360
It's like this

630
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,120
What kind of content is it?
-Yeah

631
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:14,740
The verification is Nakagawa Paradise's father-son pair

632
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:24,180
Currently, the thing the son wants the most is Nintendo's LABO

633
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,140
Upon entering the store

634
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:32,850
The father will begin to pout "I really don't want to buy it after all,"

635
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,170
Welcome

636
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,890
Ah, is this it?

637
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,990
Is this it?
-Yeah

638
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,560
How much is it?

639
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,470
How does it work?

640
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,200
This is too expensive

641
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,530
I thought it would be cheaper

642
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,940
Daddy doesn't want to buy it

643
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,270
Won't buy, won't buy, hate it hate it hate it

644
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,290
Won't but it! I absolutely won't buy it!

645
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:58,890
He's throwing a tantrum!

646
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,780
No! I won't buy it!

647
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,380
I'll never buy it!

648
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,290
Ok, get up

649
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:13,290
I don't want to get up, I don't want to get up

650
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,430
Don't want to buy, don't want to get up!

651
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,680
A calm response to his father's strange actions

652
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,840
Rintaro acts like an adult

653
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,610
I hate it, I hate it, Rintaro, I hate it, I hate it!

654
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,630
You'll think Dad has become strange, right?

655
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,010
Forget it

656
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,600
He gives up so easily

657
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,450
Okay?
-Yeah

658
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,480
Forget it
-Thank you

659
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,490
You're great

660
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:47,190
Don't you want it?
-I want it

661
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,490
Is it okay if we don't buy it?
-Fine by me

662
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,660
You are really cute

663
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,600
Such a good boy, really

664
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,760
For the very good boy Rintaro

665
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:04,230
The program team gave him the Nintendo LABO as a gift after revealing the project

666
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,710
I see

667
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,620
Children are afraid of such an outcome

668
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,420
Standing there the whole time, suddenly

669
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,580
He had that "forget it" expression

670
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,950
Literally that "enough" face

671
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,640
It was literally like that

672
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,840
A dead face

673
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,330
To buy that thing in the end

674
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,160
It's really not in line with this show, I hate it

675
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,440
Isn't it nice?

676
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,200
Not needed

677
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,720
Absolutely not needed, its annoying

678
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,370
We must do away with hope, do away with it!

679
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,760
It won't be edited out, even if you say so

680
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,020
Don't throw a tantrum at the producer!

681
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,050
Even a tantrum won't lead to editing it out!

682
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,350
That part will be used!

683
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,030
The next theory chosen by Morita is

684
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,930
Its impossible to avoid drawing wrinkles on portraits of Matsuo Bannai

685
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,030
Speaking of Matsuo Bannai

686
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,060
The deep, deep lines are his characteristic

687
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,220
Is it possible for this feature to be overlooked?

688
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,120
First, we investigate a portrait store

689
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,470
It's painted

690
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:17,030
Sure enough, he drew very obvious lines

691
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,020
Very similar

692
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,780
What is the key point?

693
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,150
The wrinkles

694
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,420
There is an impression of wrinkles

695
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,750
Then, in other portrait stores, too

696
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,460
A lot of wrinkles

697
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,750
Okay, this is it

698
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:42,350
Of course, portraits emphasize the lines

699
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,380
So, the investigation hits the street

700
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,750
Where are the key points?

701
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,720
Lines

702
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:59,300
A simpler depiction of the mouth, ears, and wrinkles

703
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,430
However, it is quite similar

704
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,400
Indeed

705
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,050
And after that too

706
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,130
The wrinkles

707
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,800
Wrinkles

708
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,870
Ah, that, that, wrinkles, wrinkles

709
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,810
Wrinkles

710
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:22,950
Indeed, whenever drawing Matsuo, wrinkles will be included

711
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,780
Lines here

712
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,030
Wrinkles?
-Wrinkles

713
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:31,390
Among them, a man with an artist's style

714
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,130
Seems talented at drawing

715
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,580
No wrinkles

716
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,360
And many parts aren't drawn

717
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:40,860
Pretty creepy

718
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,190
This isn't a good example

719
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,840
Many other people's drawings had more lines than yours

720
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,910
That... mine...

721
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,310
I don't want to focus on other people's weaknesses

722
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,710
Wouldn't that be in bad taste?

723
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,240
Weird guy

724
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,510
The next theory selected by Morita is

725
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,230
A good quote

726
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,720
Don't judge someone by their weaknesses

727
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,950
The example sentences for "kill" in the kanji exercise book used by elementary school students are all "kill/hold your breath"

728
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,630
Because it's a bad word

729
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,290
Indeed

730
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,620
"Hold your breath"

731
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:16,980
There you go

732
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,550
"Hold your breath like that"

733
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,500
"Hold your breath without moving"

734
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,620
Next, in the poop practice series

735
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,430
Why this?

736
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,770
"Hold your breath at night and poop"

737
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,420
What? That's...

738
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,130
Next, this kanji character exercise

739
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,770
"Kill the bugs"

740
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,430
Also

741
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,320
Bit scary

742
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,410
"Kill pests"

743
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,130
So the results of the survey are

744
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,330
There are 10 books that used it in terms of breath and 6 for killing bugs

745
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:17,050
The next theory selected by Morita is

746
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:42,120
People with the name "Hotei" (a folkloric deity monk called Cloth Sack) all have related nicknames

747
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,380
The investigation begins

748
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,460
Hello?

749
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,530
I'm sorry, is this the home of Hotei?

750
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,100
Yes, I'm Hotei

751
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,800
We explained this was for a TV interview and got permission

752
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,710
Although rather sudden

753
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,080
Have you ever had a nickname?

754
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,880
Nickname?

755
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,810
Yes

756
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:15,550
Can you tell me what your nickname is?

757
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,820
Potato

758
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,120
Potatoï¼Ÿ

759
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,890
Yes Potato

760
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:26,640
The next theory selected by Morita is

761
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,600
Ask why!

762
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:33,370
A "strong" word for people in their 20s is "Zero" and "Kobayashi" for people over 60 years old

763
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,580
So, first of all, we surveyed people in their 20s

764
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,140
What comes to mind when you think of "strong"?

765
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,310
Strong Zero
-Wine

766
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,250
What comes to mind when you think of "strong"?

767
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,780
Strong Zero
-Zero

768
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,520
What comes to mind when you think of "strong"?

769
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,620
Zero
-Certainly Strong Zero

770
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,360
What comes to mind when you think of "strong"?

771
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,790
Strong

772
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,460
Strong Zero
-Strong Zero

773
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,650
It's good value for money, high alcohol content

774
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:05,230
The penetration rate for the 20-something age group is quite impressive

775
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:10,760
93% of the 68 people responded as expected

776
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,720
In other words, 63 people replied "Zero"

777
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,660
Zero answers for Kobayashi

778
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,840
You don't have to use zero here

779
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,600
Do you know Strong Kobayashi?

780
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,290
No, who is that?

781
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,040
Then the next survey of people over 60 years old

782
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,890
Strong
-Eh?

783
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,430
The word "strong"...

784
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,330
Strong
-Strong?

785
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,570
Is there anything you can think of from this word?

786
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,140
Strong Kobayashi, right?

787
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,010
Strongï¼Ÿ

788
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,150
Ah, I don't know, I can't think of anything

789
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,720
Strong
-Eh?

790
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,820
What's that?

791
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,930
Although there were people that answered Kobayashi

792
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:02,860
A large section of this group does not respond to foreign words like "strong"

793
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:08,660
"Strong ",  do you know what that means?
-No

794
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,330
Do you know the meaning of Strong?
-No.

795
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,900
Have you heard of "Strong Kobayashi"?
-Yeah

796
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:14,660
He knows!

797
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,490
The next theory selected by Morita is

798
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:27,550
If you sneak some change into the hood of someone's hoodie, they won't know it's there until it's 10,000 yen or so

799
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,260
10,000 coins must be pretty heavy

800
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:36,430
This verification actually took place at the same time during last week's episode

801
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,520
It was carried out in secret

802
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,680
It was done?

803
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,860
The target was...

804
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,640
The last to come in, Panther's Ogata

805
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:57,750
Who quickly took off his hoodie

806
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,680
It's cold. Absolutely

807
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,020
It's not cold at all...
-I think it's better not to take it off

808
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:09,400
First, the main project to make him laugh was focused on

809
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,860
Stop!

810
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:14,450
Stop it!

811
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,370
What?

812
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:20,310
Then, after achieving success

813
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,140
Is it hot?

814
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,840
Fujimoto forces him to put on a hooded sweater

815
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:32,640
And the coin verification begins

816
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,050
So handsome
-So handsome!

817
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:43,030
Put a lot in!

818
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,500
What is this?

819
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,120
Due to having drunk a lot

820
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:01,840
The setters boldly put coins in

821
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,900
Beer. One more

822
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,360
Beer, please, a lot more

823
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,730
Despite touching his hood, Ogata fails to notice

824
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,450
I'm drunk! I'm drunk!

825
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:19,150
So, we will reveal the main plan first

826
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,930
When drinking something, like, "poof"

827
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,740
Oh

828
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,300
It was unexpectedly difficult to confirm

829
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,540
Spat it out!
-Eh?

830
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,440
Did that

831
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,380
Did you all do it together?
-We all did it together

832
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,190
So many

833
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,760
What a mess!

834
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,460
Such a mess

835
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,500
What is this?

836
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,570
I'm a little confused

837
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:06,430
Horita, what do you think?

838
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:10,290
I think drunken Hollywood Zakoshi is super cute

839
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:11,970
Such a smiley face

840
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,200
He's not very good at drinking

841
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:16,560
And that Hotei, why is he called "Potato"?

842
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,520
I still really want to know why "Potato"

843
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,270
It seems a further investigation is needed

844
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,430
An unexpectedly interesting answer

845
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,070
He seemed to think its more normal than it is

846
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:28,840
It wasn't "What's your nickname? I was called potato"

847
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:30,880
But "I'm Potato"

848
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,060
So? Why?

849
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:36,110
Even if they say it in such a way, you should still ask why

850
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,450
If they answer this plainly I guess you'd be afraid to ask why

851
00:46:39,180 --> 00:47:09,910
