00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,860
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,030
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,260
It's Chidori!

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,690
Hello everyone, thank you for having us

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,810
This time we bring you a very interesting theory

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,080
Does anyone here smoke?

7
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,920
I have already quit

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,130
Matsumoto, did you quit?
-Yes

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,260
How long did it take? Was it long?

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,600
It was tough as at one point I used to smoke 5 packs a day

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,560
5 packs a day?

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,790
100 cigarettes

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,080
Hamada smokes electronic cigarettes, right?

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,650
Yes, yes, not the real kind

15
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,900
A lot of comedians don't smoke anymore, I also quit

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,190
Daigo is a very heavy smoker
-Yes

17
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,260
He gives that impression I guess

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,940
Except for this sort of situation, he's always smoking

19
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,150
In private he's just a cloud of smoke

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,390
It's really one after another
- It's true, I can't see all that well most of the time

21
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,620
It gets worse when there is a competition

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,590
At the time of M-1 I was on two cartons

23
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,120
20 packs?

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,240
So, this time is a theory about smoking enthusiasts, please take a look

25
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,860
People who love to smoke will go for it even if the road to the smoking area is full of challenges

26
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,880
I see...

27
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,380
I'll go wherever the hell I need to

28
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,710
Will you fight for your life?
-Of course I will

29
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,120
If I tell you that the smoking area is there

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,240
My head will still be there later

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,440
Daigo will definitely be there

32
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,040
To get to that point?

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,790
Sometimes on a location shoot, even if there's only a 10 minute break he'll go to smoke

34
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,180
That goes without saying

35
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,770
He would really go to smoke and make the staff and guests wait for him

36
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,040
Even if he is reminded not to smoke while shooting on location

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,170
He said, "If I don't smoke, I can't go on."

38
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,990
I go to smoke to take care of the staff who are also addicted to smoking

39
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,400
Let everyone also have a 10-minute break, that's what I think

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,950
No, no, no, you are forcing the issue

41
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,890
Next, smokers will carry out a variety of fancy challenges to be allowed to smoke

42
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,260
I'll definitely climb up

43
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:30,890
And

44
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,730
A partner who shows signs of being brainwashed by a diviner

45
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,900
If they propose a change of name, the other party will never agree to it

46
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,940
I am the director, my name is Taguchi

47
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,420
And, do celebrities remember the names of the attendees they're having a meeting with?

48
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,850
An on-site spot check

49
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,590
What is the name of this gentleman?

50
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:12,580
People who love to smoke will go for it even if the road to the smoking area is full of challenges

51
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:21,750
Those chosen as targets are the biggest smokers in the entertainment industry who smoke more than two packs a day

52
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,820
The five people were assembled for a fake program

53
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,230
And lured to an abandoned school in Atami

54
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,480
Dragging people to Atami

55
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,640
There is some free time prior to the official start of shooting

56
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,100
No matter what difficulties they encounter, will they really fight for their lives for a cigarette?

57
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,510
The first smoker comedian is...

58
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,330
Who could it be?

59
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,400
Thank you

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,770
Unagi

61
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,930
This man can smoke

62
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,890
These artists took a two-hour non-smoking bus ride from Tokyo to arrive

63
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,750
Smoking's not allowed on the bus anymore

64
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:04,770
Thus, when arriving at the scene, they were all dying for a cigarette

65
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,410
So, what will happen

66
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,640
Can I smoke?
-Yes

67
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,250
Unable to contain his excitement anymore

68
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,810
As soon as he leaves the building, he rushes to the smoking area, cigarette in mouth

69
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,800
But there...

70
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,940
Definitely not seeing anything good, right?

71
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,380
Eh?

72
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,490
What the hell is that?

73
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,840
Difficulty Level 1 - Smoke in the smoking area

74
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,590
Is this on fire?

75
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,030
Eh?

76
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,840
Will Unagi really smoke in this setting?

77
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,310
Looks like a fire

78
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,340
Who would dare to go in there?

79
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,320
Excuse me?

80
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,320
The place is completely on fire

81
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,640
Strong fumes!

82
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,860
The smoke stinks!

83
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,690
After confirming it wasn't really on fire

84
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,000
Must be going in

85
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,910
Can't see anything

86
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,660
He really went in

87
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,970
Cigarettes may have such a magical power

88
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,510
You have to be inside to smoke it, right?

89
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:46,160
Although the door was open, he enters the smoking area before lighting a cigarette

90
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,850
Really can't see anything at all

91
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,200
Can't even see if he's smoking

92
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,530
Even so, he's gotta smoke

93
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:17,140
After smoking, the plan is disclosed

94
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,520
Are we shooting already?

95
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,630
How do you feel?

96
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,060
Huh? No?

97
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:32,240
What is this...what is this whole thing?

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,550
Smoking... smoking area?

99
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,620
After communicating the project to Unagi

100
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,750
Is it that funny?

101
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,380
I did smoke

102
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:47,350
Even if it's difficult, you'll still go for it

103
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,450
Even if it is skirting the edge of the law

104
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,460
You'll also walk the red line out of desperation

105
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,730
It's definitely a fight to the death

106
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,740
After gaining a better understanding of this smoker's psychology

107
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,480
The next smoker is...

108
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,370
Morita

109
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,880
Again, soon after the meeting...

110
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,710
Where can I smoke here?

111
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,720
You have to go outside the campus to smoke it. It doesn't matter, right?
-It's okay

112
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,550
Told by staff that the smoking area is outside

113
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,920
Morita follows the signs

114
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:36,530
This time the smoking area is set up in...

115
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:45,420
A circular 1.5km route

116
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:53,530
Will people who love to smoke really not avoid traveling long distances to smoke a cigarette?

117
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:53,530
Difficulty Level 2 - 1500 metres to find the smoking area

118
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,350
All are quite disciplined

119
00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:01,380
500 meters after the start, he has walked one-third of the course

120
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,160
What has appeared?

121
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:12,840
Difficulty Level 3- Vicious dog blocking the road

122
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Eh? Eh?

123
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
A wild dog!

124
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,770
Nicotine vs. wild dog

125
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,740
So scary so scary

126
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,870
So scary!

127
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,920
Keeping an eye on him

128
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
It's a skinny Doberman

129
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,100
After that, he climbed all the way up the trail

130
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,000
Too far, too far, too far, too far

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,300
It's too far

132
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,050
Then it's downhill

133
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,810
Too far away

134
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,870
Really complaining a lot

135
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,750
There it is!

136
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,460
15 minutes after he left, he finally arrives at the smoking area of the school

137
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,980
15 minutes?

138
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,900
Must be tough

139
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,590
I've already done a big circle, right?

140
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,290
Getting annoyed

141
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,800
So hot, so hot!

142
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:28,350
Difficulty Level 4 - 90 degree C sauna smoking area

143
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,330
He's still going for it

144
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,510
So hot!

145
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,860
Really smoking

146
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,440
Scary

147
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,350
Are you serious?

148
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,180
You'd definitely still want to smoke

149
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,930
Cigarettes are impressive!

150
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:39,870
Even so, Morita didn't leave the smoking area until he finished his cigarette

151
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,870
It did feel farther than you'd think it'd be

152
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,740
But I always feel that the smoking area is too far away

153
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,380
After seeing a Doberman

154
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,550
I thought it might be a trap

155
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,620
As long as you want to smoke

156
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,720
You will never go back until you've smoked, right?

157
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:17,720
Once the addiction takes hold, no matter what obstacles are in the way, there's no turning back

158
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,700
That's the sad thing about smokers

159
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,560
The next smoker comedian is...

160
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,100
Kaminari's Manabu

161
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,040
Doesn't give the impression of a smoker

162
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,370
The time is 8pm

163
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,790
Can you even see your hands at this time?

164
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,140
It feels a bit scary

165
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,520
It is dark inside the abandoned school without electricity

166
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,200
Scary

167
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,040
In such a condition

168
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,890
Is there a smoking area?
-Smoking area is...

169
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,100
Take the lantern

170
00:10:50,840 --> 00:11:03,880
Difficulty Level 5 - Fear of Darkness

171
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:56,880
Like filming a paranormal location shoot, one must go through an abandoned school at night to the smoking area

172
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,740
Whoa, scared the hell out of me

173
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,100
Despite being scared to death, he doesn't look back

174
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,550
Following the signs he makes his way outside

175
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:17,100
Lurking in this deep darkness is...

176
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:25,820
Whoa!

177
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,780
SASUKE kindly lent us one of their obstacles

178
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,150
This program loves SASUKE, right?

179
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,140
The ashtray stands at the top of the incline

180
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,990
Special Production Smoking Area Tower

181
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,310
Is this not a smoking area?

182
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,050
There is only one option

183
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,000
How does it work?

184
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,790
You want to smoke so badly?

185
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,890
That's how much he wants to smoke

186
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,700
So difficult

187
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,440
You need good shoes for it

188
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,290
Definitely can't climb up, right

189
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,250
Try your best

190
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,920
One more time!

191
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,760
What?

192
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,370
So difficult

193
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,210
Wrong side

194
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,100
It feels as if this is the end

195
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,410
This is the end

196
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,890
So funny

197
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,630
Its hopeless

198
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,120
Wants to smoke so badly

199
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:39,870
Beaten down by incredible difficulty, he falls into despair

200
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,480
And so the project is disclosed

201
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,880
In fact, this has long been exposed

202
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,520
If he still acts surprised then he's lying

203
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,050
There's no way around it

204
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,680
Absolutely no way

205
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,320
There's no solution to this

206
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,020
Only those who are willing to gamble everything can achieve success

207
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,860
So I can't succeed here

208
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,960
How are you feeling now?

209
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,160
Still want to smoke, want to smoke even more actually

210
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,000
And so, the day after the start of this verification

211
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:16,430
Three difficulty levels are set up on the way to the smoking area

212
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,670
It has thus become even more of a round of SASUKE

213
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,920
The first challenger of Cigarette SASUKE is...

214
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,470
Sumo wrestler and smoker comedian artist Akatsu

215
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,500
Looking forward to this

216
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,350
Akatsu suits this program

217
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,810
No smoking here, right?

218
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,870
I love SASUKE and Akatsu!

219
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:55,810
Can he overcome all the barriers on the way to the smoking area or not?

220
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,490
The first hurdle is...

221
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:20,340
1 - Gate of Weight

222
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,190
What is this?

223
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,900
Despite taking some time, he finally overcomes the barrier with a cigarette in his mouth

224
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,350
Where the hell is it?

225
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,160
Next is the second hurdle

226
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,520
Here?

227
00:14:45,360 --> 00:15:26,870
2 - Ladder of knots

228
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,930
No, no, no. How is this possible?

229
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,560
The mouth says no, but the body...

230
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,930
It's a real climb!

231
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,150
So much effort just to smoke a cigarette

232
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,220
This ladder is ok, right?

233
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,190
For a mere cigarette

234
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,010
I can't believe he's doing this

235
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:34,070
All just for a cigarette, the rope ladder is also successfully passed

236
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,780
Cigarettes are terrible!

237
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,830
This fully illustrates the horror of cigarettes

238
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,330
Back in the building

239
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,890
Where?

240
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,970
Here is the third hurlde

241
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,560
What the hell do you want?

242
00:15:53,930 --> 00:16:05,240
3 -  A protective moat

243
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,970
I still have my phone with me

244
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,640
A moat

245
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,570
This thing can be called a moat?

246
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,410
This sucks

247
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,390
Snow white snow white sneakers

248
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,640
And so, Akatsu...

249
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,850
Oh, using his head

250
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:16,930
Using a nearby wheelbarrow

251
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,320
He passes the moat area with a little foul play

252
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,850
The last thing standing in his way is...

253
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,280
Can just smoking a cigarette be so difficult?

254
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,940
Seriously, just let me have a good smoke, okay?

255
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,120
No. You must go to the smoking area.

256
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,920
What is this theory?

257
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:55,030
Akatsu has basically recognized the situation in the face of the towering smoking area

258
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,800
He put the cigarettes on the floor...
-Yeah

259
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,350
What is the result?

260
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,810
It hurts!

261
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,150
Your body is not suited to this

262
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,150
I have not done this kind of thing before

263
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,820
Come on...

264
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,120
No chance, no chance

265
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,390
So hot, so hot, so hot

266
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,860
He just wants to smoke a cigarette!

267
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,300
This height, to be honest I think it can be done

268
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,900
But...

269
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,580
Barefoot?

270
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,660
Is barefoot better?

271
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,700
Akatsu is impossible, the recoil is scary

272
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,470
Hot hot hot

273
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:49,120
Reaching a tower smoking area is no easy feat

274
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,750
The recoil is too intense

275
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,120
It hurts so much!

276
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,490
It doesn't take long to become physically and mentally exhausted

277
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,330
And so

278
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,920
Akatsu leaves as if he has remembered something

279
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,620
Gonna smoke on the side?
-What's wrong?

280
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,160
After all, he hasn't smoked yet

281
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Yeah, hasn't had a puff yet

282
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:18,000
With one hand, he holds a rake he found somewhere

283
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,520
And so...

284
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,950
He's gonna hook and climb up it?

285
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,860
His posture looks like he's playing for real

286
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,190
What kind of athletic event is this?

287
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,990
Is this guy nuts?

288
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,240
Good, good, good, keep up the good work!

289
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,230
Dangerous!

290
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,110
So slippery

291
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,650
You can do it!

292
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,650
It hurts!

293
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,220
Surrender

294
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,960
What an great effort!

295
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,840
What's the point in disclosing now?

296
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,010
It's not like it was a prank

297
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,630
It's nothing, really

298
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,070
What a pity!

299
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,530
This is basically cheating

300
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,640
There are no rules here

301
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,230
I just want to smoke

302
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,210
Indeed

303
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,440
And so, the final challenger is...

304
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,060
Panther's Ogata

305
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,140
Ogata can really smoke

306
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,930
I'll go have a cigarette.
-Okay

307
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:41,900
1 - Gate of Weight

308
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,600
The first barrier of the gate of weight

309
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,720
Easily passed

310
00:19:45,630 --> 00:20:06,000
2 - Ladder of knots

311
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,990
Next, the rope ladder

312
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,570
Everyone just really wants to smoke

313
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,600
Climbing to the top without any doubt

314
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,150
No questions so far?

315
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,410
He's already there

316
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:22,050
3 -  A protective moat

317
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,620
What the hell is this...

318
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,950
In order not to dirty his beloved AIR MAX

319
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,140
He likes sneakers a lot

320
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,550
Oh its AIR MAX

321
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,500
He crosses the border barefoot

322
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,800
And so

323
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,760
Only despair remains

324
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,500
That's a great expression

325
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:37,550
Upon being able to see the smoking area, Ogata now understands

326
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,220
Not dry enough

327
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,610
He climbs to the beginning of the final level

328
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,400
What're you gonna do, Ogata?

329
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,580
What the hell...

330
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,190
Maybe he can do it?

331
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,550
Because he has good motor skills

332
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:55,860
What a pity

333
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,660
So close

334
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,390
Its promising

335
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,760
This time, I feel like there's a chance

336
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,620
Low-waisted pants

337
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,260
Don't worry about the low-waisted pants

338
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,750
Go for it!

339
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,080
Go, go, go!

340
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,440
So close

341
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,220
Next time you can climb up, right?

342
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,460
I'm cheering him on

343
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:15,910
Damn it!

344
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,060
Played soccer at Sendai Yuying High School

345
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,590
Number 10, Ogata

346
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:25,100
His sports level is still alive and well

347
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:30,100
And he slightly touches the top of the smoking area

348
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,040
I'm already here, so i'm definitely going to get up

349
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,440
It's already obvious, it's that show again

350
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,170
It's revealed!

351
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,140
What a pity!

352
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,620
Damn it!

353
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,560
Definitely climbing up

354
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,950
Obviously just wants to smoke a cigarette

355
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,880
Awesome

356
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,580
Can he go up this time?

357
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,960
I feel like he'll be able to go up this time

358
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,370
Hold on, hold on

359
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,900
So awesome

360
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,360
You can go to SASUKE now!

361
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,650
Success! Success!

362
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,760
Cigarettes

363
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,140
Oh here we go here we go

364
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,950
Smoking in such a place...

365
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,400
It must be very sweet

366
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,790
Simply cool, right?

367
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:48,780
In summary
As long as its to smoke a cigarette, climbing a towering wall is a child's play

368
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,020
Too impressive

369
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,830
Really wanted to smoke

370
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,390
They want to smoke, its something I can understand

371
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,970
Especially recently the number of places where you can smoke is decreasing

372
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,190
So the desire has grown stronger instead

373
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:08,900
It seems that after a lot of effort, smoking is better, but I still don't really understand it

374
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,190
That seems to make sense

375
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,090
Also, it's great to smoke in a very clean place

376
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,940
Like a very clean country station or something like that

377
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,030
Places where the air is particularly clean

378
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,610
But Hamada does not care about the rules when it comes to smoking

379
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,060
Hamada often smokes wherever he wants to

380
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,710
That's not good

381
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,860
Hamada smokes even in places where people don't smoke?

382
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,970
He thinks the rules don't apply to him

383
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:37,160
That's why juniors who want to smoke will gather around Hamada

384
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,800
Mobile Smoking Area

385
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,280
Let's welcome the next presenter

386
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,220
Who is it?

387
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
Oh, here we go. Here we go. Great

388
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,920
It's Kazutoyo Koyabu

389
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,780
Thank you for having me

390
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:00,180
Although this is a bit sudden, do you believe in divination?

391
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,180
Do athletes really believe in fortunetelling and such?

392
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,820
If I have to choose, I think I'm the one who believes in it

393
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,460
I believe in it.
-You believe in it?

394
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,300
Although there are real diviners

395
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,340
But there are also tricky suspicious people

396
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,820
There are people who want to cheat even if they are obviously incapable

397
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,760
I think there are good and bad

398
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,100
And so, the theory I bring today is

399
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:26,000
A partner who shows signs of being brainwashed by a diviner, if they propose a change of name, the other party will never agree to it

400
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,640
I see

401
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,700
So, a partner who is suddenly obsessed with suspicious or tricky diviners

402
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,450
Starts wearing suspicious Buddhist beads and holding suspicious crystals

403
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,560
Starts drinking suspicious water

404
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,540
All of this would make it obvious

405
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,680
It's not a serious kind of look

406
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,720
Terrible

407
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,100
Wallowing in an atmosphere of deception

408
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,260
Such a partner suddenly proposes to change the stage name of their group

409
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,700
"No, no, what are you talking about?"

410
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,640
We validate the theory of whether or not the partner will have such a response

411
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,180
I see

412
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,400
If Downtown's Hamada..

413
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,520
Hamada already always wears very suspicious Buddhist beads

414
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,060
They're not suspicious
-Now a little less, I guess

415
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,240
There was a time when you wore them to here

416
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,960
All the way to here

417
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,960
Occasionally you could see an elbow poking out

418
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,650
Only when bending

419
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:14,420
Occasionally the flesh will be caught in it

420
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:24,180
A partner who shows signs of being brainwashed by a diviner, if they propose changing your name, the other party will never agree to it

421
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,060
The first duo to be tested is Kaminari

422
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:37,040
Takumi, pretending to be obsessed with divination, proposes the name change to Manabu

423
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,180
So, one week before the implementation of the prank

424
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,690
What happened to that one?

425
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,060
I was introduced to a teacher in Saitama.

426
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:53,800
He said as long as you wear this it'll bring good luck, so I put it on

427
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,680
What a good actor!

428
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,130
But he said just wearing it doesn't make it that powerful

429
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,180
Suddenly? Suddenly?

430
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:06,740
This crystal, I don't put it at home, it's good to carry with you

431
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,260
It's too strange to carry it around with you

432
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,810
What?

433
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:18,240
For a whole week, Takumi is supposedly awed by the diviner

434
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,480
It will be like that

435
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,480
It'd be a bit worrying

436
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,320
Watch RoboCop

437
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,360
Dumbass!

438
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,530
Wearing this at the performance?

439
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,230
I don't need to take it off during the show

440
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,920
Good morning
-Good morning

441
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,370
How does it feel?
-Sounds like he believes it

442
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,310
Oh, really?
-Definitely

443
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,960
As such, the proposal to change the name goes ahead

444
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,920
But before that

445
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,290
Did you hear from Yamamoto (agent)?

446
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,520
Eh? What?

447
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,160
Although I was the only one who was chosen, that...

448
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:59,400
I'm going to be the host on "King's Brunch" or something

449
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,930
Wow, that's awesome.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah

450
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:05,240
Brunch is very influential, ah this'll help us in the future

451
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,070
Very helpful for the future

452
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,510
Our appearance fees will increase too most likely

453
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,110
Go up a notch, for sure

454
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,350
Because it is KING

455
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,480
From April
-I'm really happy for you

456
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,200
Such a nice guy

457
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,300
In such a way, by giving a false report

458
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,560
The stage is set for the "its thanks to the diviner" statement later

459
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,840
Finally, the changing the name prank begins

460
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,930
Can I talk to you about something?
-Hmm

461
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,640
So, I'm gonna start this thing in April.
-Yeah, yeah

462
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,940
My stage name is Takumi Ishida now, right? I'm using my real name.
-Yeah.

463
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,050
"Takumi" is usually written in hiragana.
-Yes, it is.

464
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:57,620
It's not a good idea to be a comedian and use hiragana.

465
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,790
What's not good? You researched it?

466
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,490
No, the teacher said.
-What teacher?

467
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,060
So, the Saitama

468
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,460
That teacher said it?

469
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,800
Yes, yes, yes, yes, that teacher...

470
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,770
You have to change your name after being told?

471
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,300
Well, I was wondering if I should change my name.

472
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,010
You're out of your mind, aren't you!?
What's wrong?

473
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,180
Oh, no. Oh, no.

474
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,700
Takumi's... eh? What's going on?

475
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,150
And I...
-Hiragana, right?

476
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:30,220
Yes, the teacher said to change the hiragana part

477
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,720
Although the prank has just started, the negotiation is in full swing

478
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,600
What is the name Takumi wants to change to?

479
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:42,940
Ishida?

480
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:50,910
Yes, I'll use the kanji: Ishida Yume (Dream) Mon (Door)

481
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,940
Are you out of your mind? I can't even read it

482
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,810
It's a borrowed word...
-Not a borrowed word

483
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,580
Manabu has become the straightman

484
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,590
If I change the name to something other than Takumi

485
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:05,460
People who have been calling me Takumi won't be able to to do it anymore so it'll be tough for them

486
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:10,530
The number of strokes is better

487
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,860
Yumemon? Takumi?

488
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,770
Dream Gate?

489
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,070
It's not read as Takumi

490
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,870
Yumemon can be read as Takumi...

491
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,040
No, it's Ishida Mumon (Dream Gate). What the hell is that?

492
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:27,040
To be honest, I'm scared too.
-What are you afraid of?

493
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,620
It's only been a week since I got this from my teacher.

494
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,050
Such a big job coming in one week

495
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,220
Do not be mistaken, it is because of your own efforts

496
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,490
But I didn't do anything, it not my effort

497
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,160
No. You've tried hard. You've tried hard.

498
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,590
Just living in general

499
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,000
You're working hard

500
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,230
It is difficult for other comedians to notice the effort

501
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,100
Yes?
-Yes, yes, yes.

502
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,140
Your success isn't down to Buddhist beads

503
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,910
No matter how many times I have to say it, its because of your own efforts

504
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,310
This guy has become like a teacher

505
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,110
Trying to brainwash him, right?

506
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,780
You appeared in the M-1 Grand Prix under the hiragana name Takumi.

507
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,190
Were you a Mumon (Dream Gate) at that time?

508
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:16,860
But perhaps we didn't win because my name wasn't Mumon (Dream Gate) at the time

509
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,040
It's becoming like a diviner's tone

510
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,630
Divination of this type, you don't like it?
-It's like...

511
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,700
You've spent money, right? You've been fooled into buying something.

512
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,600
I haven't been fooled, its my money to spend how I want

513
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,110
You were fooled into buying stuff

514
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,780
You're not that type of person, Takumi.

515
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,980
But our popularity has been stagnant for the past two years

516
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,550
It'll change. It's okay, it's okay.

517
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,320
But the reason nothing has changed in the past two years is...

518
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,120
It' s only been two years, no need to rush
-But

519
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,620
Only two years, no need to rush.

520
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:49,630
I put on the beads and so on with the idea of trying it out.

521
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,300
One week later, the Brunch job came up.

522
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,270
So I think changing my name might be a good idea

523
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,640
But other people can still call me Takumi, it's just that the characters are different.

524
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,880
Our Manzai, the start of all our routines

525
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,250
"What's wrong, Takumi?" "What's wrong, Manabu?"
This is how it starts, right?

526
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:12,320
When you say "that, that, Takumi-kun", the kanji for "Mumon" (Dream Gate) will come to mind

527
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,050
It's gross!

528
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,420
It's not that big of a deal

529
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,120
I'd be thinking, "This guy is Mumon! (Dream Gate)"

530
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,460
It's not Mumon, it's Takumi

531
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,460
I can't believe there are people who are so gullible

532
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,960
Consider the feelings of person who has to be hit on the head by such a guy, okay?

533
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,840
I mean it.
-I'm not being lied to.

534
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,340
I'm not convinced

535
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,010
It's really not convincing

536
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:40,240
Take it off already, it's so hot.

537
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,610
What? Don't you hate this kind of stuff?

538
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,780
Getting really mad

539
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,750
I do not want to associate with such people, I really can't trust people who buy such things

540
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,420
It's not like i'm asking you to buy something

541
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,590
No, wait, wait, wait.

542
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,360
It's my own business.
-No, no, no.

543
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,430
Your life is my life and my life is your life

544
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,830
To work together, hand-in-hand

545
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,180
Wow, so cool.

546
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,280
How moving

547
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:13,440
A guy buying shit like that, wearing it and believing in it, changing his name and so on.

548
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,180
I'd think, "Are you kidding me?"

549
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,460
Your life is my life

550
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:26,520
The childhood friends from the nursery school who later became partners

551
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,340
Life partners who have been working together for a long time

552
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,840
Now being deceived by a suspicious diviner

553
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,500
And wants to become "Dream Gate"

554
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,700
Anguish and resentment fill his partner's heart

555
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,680
I really want to change my name to Dream Gate Takumi from April onward, is that okay?
-No

556
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,150
No?
-No

557
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,650
Absolutely not?
-If that's the case then let's disband.

558
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,380
Disband if I want to change my name?

559
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:59,190
Disband, its unbelievable and unreasonable

560
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,930
That the person who has worked hard with me up until now

561
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:06,300
Was fooled into buying something by a shitty guy and wants to change his name

562
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,730
Can't do it, can't do it, can't do it, can't do it.

563
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,970
If it's gonna go on like this then lets just disband

564
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,240
Give me the guy's contact information.
-Why?

565
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,080
I'll call him.
-No need.

566
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,000
A real man

567
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,310
I'm really gonna call him
-There's no need

568
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,680
I'm going to say, "Are you fucking kidding me?"
-No need for that.

569
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,620
There's definitely loads of victims who need to talk to the police.

570
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,620
I'm not a victim in terms of results, I got the job at Brunch.

571
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,960
No, no, no. This has nothing to do with Brunch.

572
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:40,080
As the group is moving towards disbanding, the truth is quickly disclosed.

573
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:51,340
What!? Ah, seriously, enough!

574
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,510
What is this?

575
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,210
What do you think?

576
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,450
Wednesday Downtown

577
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,350
Correct answer
-I knew it

578
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,090
Seriously...

579
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,690
This is awful, seriously awful

580
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,960
Were you scared?
-Absolutely

581
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,000
Did you notice the water?

582
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,130
I noticed it

583
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,070
Noticed it

584
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,140
Have you noticed that I've been drinking this?
-Yes.

585
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,200
I found it very suspicious.

586
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,010
Ah, don't drink it.
-This costs 5,000 yen. 5,000 yen.

587
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,810
So stupid, isn't it?

588
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,450
Unbelievable!

589
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,220
That's it. The next duo is

590
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,780
Impulse

591
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,100
So realistic

592
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,680
For this, the trap is prepared in advance

593
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:45,300
Fortunetelling and my current situation can be linked pretty well

594
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:45,300
※Atsushi Tsushita was dropped from Yoshimoto due to a dangerous driving accident 17 years ago and only just came back

595
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,500
He'll probably say "Ah, here we go again..."

596
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,730
I don't know

597
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,400
That or "I can't do this anymore"

598
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,570
In the end, what will happen? I'm looking forward to finding out

599
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,170
I am also very nervous

600
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,270
I've never set anyone up before

601
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:08,540
So, for the first time in 21 years of the group's existence, he will prank his partner

602
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:14,420
In the past a fortuneteller told me "you're possessed by eels"

603
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,260
That's not impossible.
-Absolutely impossible?

604
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,730
I'd be slippery like an eel

605
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,830
That's pretty accurate I guess
-Accurate!

606
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:27,460
Impulse's name changing prank begins

607
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,280
First

608
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,540
Have you ever prayed to Buddha to get rid of misfortune?

609
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,310
Can't say I have

610
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:39,580
In my hometown there's a diviner

611
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,420
Like a teacher

612
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:46,260
The thing I'm wearing now was made for me by him

613
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,060
That's a lot of beads

614
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,290
This one is awesome

615
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,860
After I put it on, I had a good time.

616
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,960
Who is this person? He's a fortune-teller?

617
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,200
More of a diviner than a fortuneteller

618
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:01,170
Fortunetelling, and mediumship, he does all sorts

619
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,770
What the hell?

620
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:10,000
Beginning with providing some details of the diviner

621
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,980
The topic moves to name changing

622
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,020
He said "It'd be better if you change your name."

623
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,190
Huh?

624
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,090
Stage name change?
-My name

625
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,790
Comedian name

626
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:28,330
I have 15 strokes in "Seshita", which is not a problem.

627
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:31,130
But in "Tsu"
-Hmm

628
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,770
It doesn't have enough strokes

629
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,580
So i'm thinking to change it to Tsutsumishita Revolution

630
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,710
The number of strokes is good cause it has 20

631
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,480
It's not strokes, it's in katakana.

632
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:46,620
From now on, changes have to be made

633
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,320
So that's why it's "revolution".
-Yes, yes, yes.

634
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
I think it's good

635
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,860
You want to become a "Revolution" yourself.
-Yes

636
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,060
You really want to change it?
-If I can

637
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,730
So is it that you are thinking to change it

638
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,360
I felt good when I saw it

639
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,100
Or is it that you do not want to change, but after being told...

640
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,470
Ah, it's not that I don't want to change

641
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,140
You want to become "Revolution"!

642
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,270
Yes, a person you can trust.

643
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,110
You'll get stuck that way.
-Stuck?

644
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,680
Stuck in a storm of Katakana, Impulse Tsutsumishita Revolution

645
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,050
I'll keep being called Tsutsumishita though

646
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,320
Something like Revolution is impossible

647
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,920
I don't need to say it, right?
-No need to say it

648
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,390
But at least when introducing myself

649
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,820
I will say "I am Tsustumishita Revolution, please take care of me" or something like that.

650
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,360
You'll say it like that?

651
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,460
I am quite annoyed by the name change thing

652
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,500
I'm opposed to it

653
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,630
But in the case of the "Tsutsumishita Revolution"

654
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,070
I think it is possible

655
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,940
Tsutsumishita Revolution

656
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:49,310
Really? So... I can register this stage name...

657
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,180
Eh? Is it that urgent?

658
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,880
Because it is April

659
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,950
It is if you want to change...

660
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,720
From April 1st...

661
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:02,880
Unexpectedly, Itakura does not defuse the change to "Tsutsumishita Revolution".

662
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,060
Is "Revolution" OK then?

663
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,360
You don't have any particular opinion about me becoming a "Revolution"?

664
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,530
Instead of saying, "I agree," I would rather say, "It's none of my business."

665
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,870
What do you mean "none of my business"?

666
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,270
When you are asked "Why did you become Revolution?"

667
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:18,510
If you can answer well, then its fine

668
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,380
If I can answer the question well?

669
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,650
Don't talk about "because of the number of strokes"

670
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,300
That's ok?

671
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:31,750
All kinds of ... well, it's better to not to say

672
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,000
Surprisingly, the name change was approved

673
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,220
And so, the truth is revealed

674
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:50,110
This is probably the first time I've experienced this kind of scene

675
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,640
I really feel uncomfortable right now

676
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,410
I thought, "He finally went to the gods and asked the ghosts".

677
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,580
It just so happens that in his current state it's a real possibility

678
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,420
Well, it's just the status quo, the status quo.
-It's not impossible.

679
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:02,850
You were very gentle

680
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,250
Yes, I was a little scared.

681
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,020
But if I say "you can't do that"

682
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:11,130
And then he'd yell at me like "Are you kidding? This is the truth".

683
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:16,270
In this sort of situation I think its best not to say too much

684
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,140
To people who have been brainwashed like this

685
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:24,040
But ultimately, what I thought was

686
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:29,050
Tsutsumishita Revolution is actually pretty good

687
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,710
Don't you think it'll be a big hit?

688
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:33,920
I think it's got a good ring to it

689
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,220
Next, the final duo is Yasei Bakudan

690
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,880
Of course, Cookie will be the one setting the trap

691
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,740
But he has already changed his name once

692
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,580
So this time, the element of divination is removed

693
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,240
As he will directly propose a name change to his partner

694
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,520
How will it turn out?

695
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,740
I...need to change my name

696
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,040
Change your name?
-Yeah.

697
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,010
Not Cookie anymore.
-Eh?

698
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,310
That's a shock

699
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,920
It says "the number of strokes is not good".

700
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,920
Number of strokes?
Mm-hmm.

701
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,590
Change to what?

702
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,000
Change it to Aihara YOU

703
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,000
※ A female entertainer who was active from the late 80s to the first half of the 90s.

704
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,160
What is it? Is it "Yasei Bakudan's Aihara YOU"?

705
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,300
Aihara is Aihara, YOU is the English YOU

706
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,600
Even when you became "Yasei Bakudan's Cookie"...

707
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,140
You were "Yasei Bakudan's Kawashima" and then "Cookie".

708
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,110
Although at first I thought "huh?"

709
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,580
It turned out pretty well, right?

710
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:38,660
No idea what to say about "Aihara You"?

711
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,350
The number of strokes and so on, some people really care about this sort of thing...

712
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:46,090
It's good energy

713
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,960
Is it to be announced externally in this form?

714
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,790
Announced in today's interview program

715
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,460
Oh really?

716
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,660
Yes, so i'm telling you first.

717
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,770
Well, it's still interesting, right?

718
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:58,840
It's good to try all kinds of things

719
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,080
As expected of the great wonder, Rossy

720
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:08,400
He also easily ignores the name belonging to someone else

721
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,440
He's impressive to ignore this

722
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:16,200
So, a proposal to change the duo's name is also brought up

723
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,820
A two-person thing now

724
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,490
To change our name as a duo

725
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,590
Eh? Change our name?

726
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,800
Yes, I'll need your agreement, of course.

727
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,930
Change to what?

728
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:34,940
I want to change it to "Peter Pan" because I am "Aihara You".

729
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,740
What do you mean? I don't understand

730
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,840
The number of strokes for "Peter Pan" is not good

731
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,640
Peter Pan in katakana and hiragana isn't good either.

732
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,750
So we should change it to "flying human" and pronounce it as "Peter Pan".

733
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,220
Flying...flying human?
-Flying Human

734
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,290
Although it seems to be "flying human", it is pronounced as "Peter Pan"

735
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,760
Like one of those strange names

736
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,220
※キラキラネーム：Parents choose strange Chinese characters and change the pronunciation to name their children in order to make them sound good.

737
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,220
Oh

738
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,800
By the way, in the interview done beforehand

739
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,760
Do you think your duo's name change will be approved?

740
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,300
I think it will be unpleasant

741
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:10,340
A name cultivated over the space of 24 years is important

742
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,110
Inside will he feel unpleasant?

743
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:17,200
I want him to feel bad about it, I hope he thinks the name is important

744
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,750
I see
-Indeed

745
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:24,900
In light of Cookie's comments, what will happen?

746
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,930
Is it possible?
-Yes, I think so.

747
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:33,300
No need to stick to a name, we can use a variety of names

748
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,600
So it's okay, it's perfectly fine.

749
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,940
This is completely fine, the way the duo looks remains the same anyway

750
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,640
In short, from now on, we are "Peter Pan".
-"Peter Pan".

751
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,180
"We are Peter Pan", right?

752
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,680
Agreed without a hitch

753
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,600
So, finally, the move to have Rossy change his name begins

754
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,760
In this case, you also change your name

755
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,860
We change the name of the group, I changed my name too

756
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,700
If you don't change, it might be a bit weird

757
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,230
Change together will be better

758
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:12,200
"It's like this. It's like this." It's perfectly fine.

759
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,570
I guess

760
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,440
It is perfectly fine to change it

761
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,320
This one is also OK'd without hesitation

762
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,680
This look of indifference is almost one of fear

763
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,300
The new name is?

764
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,890
Sisounou (abscess) Ro

765
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,130
Surely he won't go for this one

766
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,030
Since your name now is Ro, and Si

767
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:43,100
It'll be easy to move to this from Rossy

768
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,030
It's the same thing as me as Cookie

769
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,440
It becomes easier to say Coo

770
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,540
So "Sisounou Ro" is okay, right?

771
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,670
"Sisounou Ro"? "Peter Pan"?

772
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,880
Well, "Peter pan"...

773
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,010
Well, if the number of strokes is good, this is fine.

774
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,950
"Hello, I'm Sisounou Ro" like this

775
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,880
"Rossy has changed, I am Sisounou Ro"

776
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:06,060
That's it, then, I think. In today's interview.
-Hmmmm

777
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,160
So it's an interview with a focus on the name change

778
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,700
I'll get the agent to make sure this is focused on

779
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,930
Ok, understood

780
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:17,270
Is that OK? Like this

781
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,970
Yes, it's perfectly fine.

782
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,070
Then I am "Peter Pan's Aihara YOU".

783
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:25,010
Then I am "Sisounou Ro's"
-No.

784
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:29,550
Eh? "I am Peter Pan's Sisounou Ro."
-That's it

785
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:32,480
It's become like this.
-This sort of vibe

786
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,520
Yes
-OK

787
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,690
Yes

788
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:40,520
In summary
Rossy is an unusual beast

789
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,700
Awesome
-Impressive

790
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,680
This is the result. What do you think?

791
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,680
The initial segment was very moving

792
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,080
A duo's love

793
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,360
Yes, it is.
-Very cool.

794
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,520
But the other two, what is happening to Yoshimoto's groups!?

795
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,040
There's not even someone called Sisounou in the Takeshi Gundan, right?

796
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,280
Surprisingly easy to accept

797
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,640
The personality of each group is clear
-Yeah

798
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,740
What the hell, is Rossy trying to go home early?

799
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,240
That was his well-considered position

800
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,380
Feels like even if he's asking him to give him a XXXX he'll go along with it

801
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,840
"You can have it."
-"You can take it all if you want"

802
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:28,900
Next is everybody's theories

803
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,800
Today's presenters are Chocolate Planet

804
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,180
Don da ke!
-Slow walk slow walk

805
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,620
Super popular

806
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,880
The audience in the back is going "Wow!"
-Thank you all very much!

807
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:48,060
It was unresponsive when we came before.
-Yes, there was no reaction before.

808
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,530
I guess its fine to say we're popular, then. Thank you very much.

809
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,840
Pretty popular
-Although he says so himself

810
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,200
I would like to ask you all

811
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,500
Do you remember the names of program staff?

812
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,700
Yes, I remember

813
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,380
It's only right to remember if it's your regular program staff.

814
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,310
This time, the theory related to this is

815
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:18,420
Do celebrities remember the names of the attendees they're having a meeting with?

816
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,460
I see

817
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:26,780
Self-introduction is always over at once, right? I'm director such-and-such

818
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,380
After listening to it, do you really remember it or not?

819
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,540
Honestly, i'm not very good at remembering people

820
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,280
There was an overseas location shoot before

821
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,360
To travel around the world for a week to five countries for recording

822
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,600
I didn't know the name of the director until the second country

823
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,980
Did you know?

824
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,340
I wrote it down, but I don't think it's that important

825
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,800
I won't remember them till I die or anything

826
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,020
But it is definitely better to remember names

827
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,700
Hamada does it best

828
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,380
He just calls everyone "you bastard"

829
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,480
I've never said such a thing

830
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,280
"You bastard", something along those lines
-I've never called you "you bastard" before.

831
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,500
"You bastards are working hard today."

832
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:17,980
Do celebrities remember the names of the attendees they're having a meeting with?

833
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,800
I really can't remember. It's really bad.

834
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,640
So the first target was

835
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,140
This guy is definitely not listening

836
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,880
Viking's Nishimura

837
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,980
Impossible for Nishimura

838
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,300
Hello

839
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,960
He is called under the guise of a fake meeting

840
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,100
I am the director, Kobayashi

841
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,640
Kobayashi is a tough one

842
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,920
After saying the name clearly and unmistakably like this

843
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,320
We rush in instantly

844
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,220
Straight away

845
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,720
※After 30 years in the wrestling business, he will retire on January 4, 2020.

846
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,720
Then

847
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,520
We will now give you a simple test

848
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,650
If the answer is wrong

849
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,860
Liger will punish you

850
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,320
So please answer well

851
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,620
So the question

852
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,580
What is this gentleman's name?

853
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:11,130
Eh? Did you introduce yourself just now?

854
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:13,670
Introduced at the beginning

855
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:15,700
Uwa~

856
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:19,740
As a member of civilized society you should remember other people's names...right?

857
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,910
Yes, otherwise it is not polite.

858
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:26,220
Then please answer

859
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:29,790
Sawada!

860
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:30,880
Incorrect

861
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,420
I don't know, wow, tragic

862
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,290
Unfortunately, as the answer is wrong

863
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,960
I'll leave it to you, Liger.
-Okay

864
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:36,890
And so

865
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,130
Let' go

866
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,730
What is this? It hurts.

867
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,500
It hurts up there, too. It hurts up there.

868
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,340
Nishimura is uncivilized

869
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,120
It hurts. I'm so sorry.

870
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,640
The next target is

871
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,640
Little Vegetable Club's Okani

872
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,590
I'm the director, Taguchi

873
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,800
Very clearly stated

874
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,320
You should know that.

875
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,380
What is this gentleman's name?

876
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:16,100
Wait...wait a minute

877
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,000
Taguchi

878
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,860
Correct

879
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:19,940
Right answer?

880
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,960
Absolutely correct

881
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,980
Next, Diane's Tsuda

882
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,560
What is this gentleman's name?

883
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,980
Matsuda

884
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:33,720
Correct

885
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,250
What is this?

886
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:40,490
Eh, wait, so it's ok?

887
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,180
A name just heard can be remembered in general

888
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,620
Next, we increase the number of staff from one to three

889
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,160
Raising the difficulty

890
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,220
This is so hard

891
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:00,240
The participant of the challenge is an individual who is known to be very attentive and responsive.

892
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,020
Dressing very handsomely

893
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:00,940
So trendy

894
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,460
Yoshimura

895
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:09,180
Such an interesting look

896
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,620
I'm Taguchi, the director

897
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,830
I'm Ishizawa, the writer

898
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:22,560
I'm the assistant director Sano

899
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,200
And so

900
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:34,310
Eh, what is going on?

901
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:36,550
What is this, it's too fast, right?

902
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:37,850
So the question is

903
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,350
What are the names of these gentlemen

904
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:44,620
Please answer the names of these three

905
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,860
Give me a moment

906
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,260
Do you remember any of them?

907
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,570
Probably this one and this one I can answer barely

908
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,100
You're the assistant, right?

909
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,370
I don't remember

910
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,100
Taguchi is in the middle.

911
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,580
Correct

912
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:09,710
Who is the writer...

913
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,220
Ishizaki

914
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,140
Ah what a pity

915
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,340
Incorrect

916
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,400
And so

917
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,790
Grit your teeth and remember the name!

918
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,660
Remember, remember

919
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,430
Let's go

920
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:32,080
The final target is

921
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,700
Looks powerful

922
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,480
Seems like she'll remember

923
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,600
SKE48's Akari Suda

924
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:44,140
She claims to remember the names of all her fans

925
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,160
So we challenge her with six staff members

926
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,100
They look alike!

927
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,380
How will it go?

928
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,820
This is so hard

929
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:58,790
I am the president of the production company Shooting Star

930
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,160
My surname is Honaga

931
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,280
She's writing

932
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:05,640
Suda immediately records the staff information in her notebook

933
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,920
As she usually has the habit of writing down names in a notebook

934
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,620
This time, however, she is given a closed book challenge

935
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:19,900
So the question is

936
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,860
What are the names of these gentlemen

937
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,860
Please answer the names of all people

938
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:33,800
※The names of the people appearing in this project are actually all borrowed from professional wrestlers

939
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,740
Honaga, right?

940
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,660
Correct

941
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,140
Kushida

942
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,080
Correct

943
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,040
The next answers are all correct

944
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,100
Taguchi

945
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,540
Last man left

946
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,710
Eh, the last one...

947
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,070
What was it again...

948
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,950
I'm really sorry...

949
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:51,480
Suda

950
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,260
Unfortunately, the answer is wrong

951
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:54,810
Therefore

952
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:57,350
It hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts

953
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:02,220
Super painful

954
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:07,030
Thank you very much for your hard work.
-Thank you for your hard work.

955
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,240
She's an idol!

956
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:09,230
Ah wait a minute, please come here and wait a minute

957
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,080
But it's awesome!

958
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:10,970
Please wrap up the segment

959
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:13,870
5 seconds, 4 3 2

960
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:15,600
So here's a question

961
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,540
Please come over here

962
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,780
This staff member has been on the location shoot today

963
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,780
He is a director

964
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,320
What is the name of this director

965
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,020
Eh, you're testing me?

966
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,200
Yes, in fact, the morning of this day

967
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:40,400
A staff meeting with Liger took place

968
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,000
I'm the director, Hisano

969
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,770
I'm XXX, thank you

970
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,980
They were certainly introduced

971
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,140
Can't even see his face but he told him his real name

972
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,160
Will he remember it or not?

973
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,850
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

974
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:00,380
Eh, is this real? Seriously?

975
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,350
Who's going to hit me?

976
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:08,340
If the answer is wrong, the director, Kisano will punish him

977
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:12,630
Definitely has an iron fist of rage!

978
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:21,170
If you don't get it right, you'll be slapped by Kuno

979
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,170
Kisano...

980
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,320
He said it!

981
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:29,180
Kisano...

982
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
He screwed up

983
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,580
Thank God!

984
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,020
Grit your teeth and take it like a man!

985
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,150
Prepared?

986
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,620
What the hell, seriously

987
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,280
This is completely screwed up

988
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:45,930
In summary
Remembering and using names should be done carefully

989
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,560
What can you say, the presenter said it first

990
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,260
Beautifully presented and completed beautifully

991
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,500
He said the name so obviously but he clearly didn't remember it

992
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,680
To be fair, I don't remember the male presenter's name at all

993
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:34,980
