But I feel lonely on weekends.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,080
Hey, you have me.

You have rice field?
- Yeah.

00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,120
It's hard work.
By the way, Ryoko-chan.

00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,620
Live UFO(music event), which
starred you was horrible. - Yeah.

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,600
The hell with Komuro
(a musician, her producer). He sucks.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,180
I didn't really mean that.
- It sounded you really mean that.

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,300
Heeelp!

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,120
Stop!

00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,420
Stop!

25
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,800
Cut it!

26
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,840
You aren't synchronized.

27
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,420
What's this crap?

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,500
I have a low back pain.

29
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,420
What the hell is that?

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,160
Tell me.
- Cursed Boobs.

31
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,780
That's not what I'm asking.

32
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,280
You always make me sick!

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,040
I think this is my best work.

34
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,360
You guys are the same.
- The same?

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,700
We are the same
in good way?

36
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,140
You think that's funny?

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,640
It hurt my hip.

38
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,800
I don't give a damn.

39
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,880
1, 2, 3, 4, boob, boob, boob...

40
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,780
We did as we are told...
- I did tell you. But not in this way!

41
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,380
Shut up!

42
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,860
Are you OK, Sushi Boobs?

43
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:52,380
We thought you just didn't like
our boobs. Not boobs in general.

44
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,180
I didn't like it because
you didn't look like heroes.

45
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,400
Why do we need boobs!
Why are you sticking to it!

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,740
We don't need boobs?

47
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,740
Off course not!

48
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,480
What the hell is this!

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,460
Crispy Fried Bo...

50
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,600

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,580
He broke Crispy hip!

52
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,120
You just never get it.

53
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,020
We thought it's good...
- Why boobs!

54
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,060
My boob!

55
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,020
Damn it!

56
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,740
You don't get me fight you.
Never.

57
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,400
I think we're fighting now.

58
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,580
You know this is not
what I mean by "unite"!

59
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,140
You are jealous because
you don't have it, aren't you?

60
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,700
You're supposed to be heroes
for God's sake!

61
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,420
What's wrong with Sushi Boobs?
- You're really pissing me off now.

62
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,400
How many times
do I have to tell you!

63
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,860
Hey!

64
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,340
What are you laughing at?

65
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,460
I... I feel you're going to
hurt me.

66
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,120
How many times!
- We are only trying...

67
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,220
This is what you get
for not listening to what I said!

68
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,720
You are terrifying me!
- You are so violent today.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,960
I'll give you one last chance.

70
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,900
We have to give up boobs?
- Off course, you idiots!

71
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,440
I told them we shouldn't do
boob thing. But they insisted.

72
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,340
Yes, he insisted. He said
he came up with great idea for it.

73
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,300
Who "he"?
- Matsumoto.

74
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,380
No. He's lying.

75
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,280
So it's you, huh?
- No. It's not me.

76
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,120
I take this off.

77
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,880
You double-faced skunk!

78
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,300
You pathetic liar!

79
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,720
You designed whole thing!

80
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,680
You decided who play what.

81
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,620
You're the one who
come up with this.

82
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,980
But when I saw the slap...

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,460
You have to appeal to kids.

84
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,580
I was doing this for foreigners.

85
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,940
I can see.

86
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,160
You though I'll but this crap?

87
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,100
Please.

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,420
You are pathetic.

89
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,620
You are disgusting.

90
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,280
You make me sick.
- What?

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,360
Don't you have any pride ?

92
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,720
Please. Take this.

93
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,800
I'll excuse myself. I won't let you
down next time. - You shouldn't.

94
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,480
You better do it right
next time. - OK.

95
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,200
I'll punch you in the face
if you don't.

96
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,000
He's really terrifying me.

97
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,640
I'm sorry about this.
- Ouch! - Ouch!

98
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,640
What are you doing!

99
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,180
You skunk!

100
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,560
I couldn't help it.

101
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,480
I adore you.

102
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,180
We'll think hard.
- Goodbye.

103
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,300
If you do this crap one
more time. - I won't.

104
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,440
I'm really sorry.

105
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,760
You take this.

106
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,900
That's an absolute humiliation.

107
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,660
I gave you my underwear
and you throw it in my face.

108
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,080
Just go.

109
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,080
Think it over!

110
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,160
