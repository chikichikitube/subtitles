1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Dressing room before rehearsal

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:01,900
Anything else?

3
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,000
We have some

4
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,420
Downtown

5
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,420
Hamada Masatoshi

6
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,420
Matsumoto Hitoshi

7
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,560
Around 30
- I see

8
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,200
They're all different courses

9
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,000
I'd say 3

10
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,620
Cocorico

11
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,620
Endo Shozo

12
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,620
Tanaka Naoki

13
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,620
Yamazaki Hosei

14
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,520
They're all for Suga

15
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,520
Say that before

16
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,200
Well, yeah

17
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:30,000
[indistinct chatter]

18
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,240
Oh, is that what you meant?

19
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,160
But last year it was different, right Suga-chan?

20
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,960
Mhh?

21
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,640
He can't do that, right?

22
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,460
Itao!

23
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,460
Good morning

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,060
Itao entered the dressing room without permission

25
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,560
What's up?

26
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,300
Well, Shichihenge

27
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,980
Well... Shichihenge...

28
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,200
Eh? Today?

29
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,860
Yes

30
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,080
We didn't hear...

31
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,800
No, well, if you haven't heard it, well...

32
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
...Shichihenge

33
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,620
Guerilla-style

34
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,620
No no no no, well, that's-

35
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,780
You're laughing!

36
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,780
...you're laughing...

37
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,400
We're not laughing...

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,900
When we're about to film a Shichihenge episode we usually...

39
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,160
Have our guest here and we pretend to do stuff, you know...

40
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,060
There's no need for you to pretend to do anything

41
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,540
Starting from this year

42
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,600
But that's how we always do it

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,620
We're not even ready for it

44
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,560
Sorry but, that's...

45
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,620
I understand, sure

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,840
But anyway, about that...

47
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,460
But you know, he just laughed

48
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,060
So let's go with 1,000 yen

49
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,940
All of a sudden, Itao demands money

50
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,040
This is messed up, isn't it?

51
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,120
Who laughed...?

52
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,460
Tanaka did

53
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,720
Tanaka, did you laugh?

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,260
I didn't really laugh...

55
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,220
Hey, you laughed

56
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,960
I was... surprised? How should I say it?

57
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,300
Surprised? You laughed!

58
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,560
Hey, he laughed didn't he?

59
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,700
Who is he...

60
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,060
Who laughed?

61
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,180
This guy, this guy. Everyone!!

62
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,060
This guy, this guy. Everyone!!

63
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,060
She says everyone laughed

64
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,160
Me? I didn't laugh though

65
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,700
You're kidding!

66
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,700
Anyway, gimme 1,000 yen each, please

67
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,300
We didn't lau-

68
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,260
Everyone...

69
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,220
Everyone laughed didn't they?

70
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,700
Everyone laughed

71
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,480
That's ridiculous, I didn't laugh

72
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,340
Where was she before?

73
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,800
She just appeared...

74
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,200
If that's the case...

75
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,060
Even if we pretend we all laughed, we should...

76
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,060
Ah yeah, then 1,000 yen will be donated to charity

77
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,820
Are we gonna give money to charity?

78
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,320
Well, this time though

79
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,140
I'm doing this for myself

80
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,140
So let's just not do the charity thing

81
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,780
Let's be clear about this, so if we happen to laugh...

82
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,060
Then what do we do?

83
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,980
Just give me 1,000 yen for now

84
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,640
You heard him, Tanaka

85
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,740
Itao keeps on requesting money against everyone's will

86
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,960
You laughed right?...

87
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,380
He clearly laughed

88
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,480
Alright then, I admit it

89
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,060
You laughed, man

90
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,480
We're having a meeting here, so...

91
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,480
Oh, sure, sorry about this

92
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,080
Thank you for dropping by

93
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,600
What was that for?

94
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,480
No clue...

95
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,740
That's not shichihenge

96
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,840
He just got in and forced us to do it

97
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,840
That's right

98
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,560
Did you laugh?

99
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
I don't think I laughed, to be honest

100
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,300
To be honest, the only one who laughed was Heipo

101
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,460
Yeah, Saito laughed

102
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,520
Director Saito Toshihide

103
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,980
He laughed to his heart's content

104
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,420
Yeah, he did

105
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,420
It felt like he saw a fairy or something

106
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,740
He really got him

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There's something that's clearly pissing me off about that...

112
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,860
His "wife" isn't the woman
I saw at his wedding ceremony

113
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,860
That's a different person, isn't she?

114
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,860
That was surprising

115
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,380
Itao enters the rehearsal room again

116
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,840
Hey, Itao

117
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,700
What are you doing?

118
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,780
The second round of shichihenge

119
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,240
Are you actually doing this?

120
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,380
I know you said I can't and stuff

121
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,220
But I came here to do this shichihenge

122
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,360
Yeah, but you've decided this on your own

123
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,500
Please say something

124
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,220
So... the money...

125
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,320
Eh? Who laughed-

126
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,320
Well, everyone laughed just now

127
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,540
Someone went "ha ha ha ha"

128
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,220
Who laughed?

129
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,520
This guy, this guy. Everyone!!

130
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,300
Right? Everyone laughed didn't they

131
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,080
Alright then, let's pay up

132
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,840
We don't have a choice

133
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,700
Are you for real?

134
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,260
He's so persistent

135
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,760
I never agreed to this, but whatever

136
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,100
But that's not ok, Itao

137
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,860
You know the rules

138
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,720
This is extortion

139
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,540
No but, 1,000 yen is the rule, right?

140
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,680
We're still in the middle of our planning meeting

141
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,680
So please, can you stop coming so suddenly?

142
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,680
I bet our audience is puzzled too

143
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Sure

144
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,860
Ok, miss wife?

145
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,780
For sure!

146
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,140
That wasn't a conversation!

147
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,980
I understand, alright

148
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,060
We're talking here

149
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,120
You're talking, alright

150
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,520
Alright then!

151
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,720
What's the point of this if his "wife" says we all laughed?

152
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,840
That was around 10,000 yen

153
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,660
I've paid before too

154
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,580
It's 8000 yen

155
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,860
A total of 8000 yen

156
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,380
That's so out of character for him right?

157
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,080
Producer Suga Kenji

158
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,960
But he's still doing it

159
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,740
His wife is so annoying

160
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,880
I laughed because of her before

161
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,880
It's a cheap trick

162
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,700
His wife is really something

163
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,340
Say, Itao...

164
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,400
Yes?

165
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,060
What are ya doing?

166
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,300
This is the third one

167
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,860
Itao continues to do shichihenge without permission

168
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,940
Really... go home?

169
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,380
But I can't just stop halfway through it can I?

170
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,640
Halfway through what..?---

171
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,160
I thought this was shichi-henge, seven changes

172
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,740
Well, I've actually prepared like 9 or 10 changes

173
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,980
The people who created Shichihenge are not accepting Shichihenge...

174
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,140
What's all that about?

175
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,380
I've never seen anybody

176
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,700
Refuse a shichihenge so damn hard before

177
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,820
What the hell?

178
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,600
I don't know but--

179
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,140
Please accept this new form...

180
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,460
But you see, that's how it is...

181
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,460
In shichihenge we

182
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,500
We are trusting each other, you know?

183
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,440
And then we get suddenly attacked by someone, out of nowhere

184
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,380
Take the surprise away from it and we wouldn't laugh

185
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,220
But everyone laughed!

186
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,880
No we didn't all laugh...

187
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,620
You all laughed!

188
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
No, none of us did

189
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,060
Look at him, he's laughing

190
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,240
Yeah but he's...

191
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,580
He's a *********, so...

192
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,540
Hey, who laughed?

193
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,380
This guy, this guy... !!

194
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,340
This guy, this guy... !!

195
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,860
Everyone, right?

196
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,380
Everyone, everyone

197
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,380
That's not true

198
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,780
For sure

199
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,820
What the fuck?

200
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,260
Alright, 1,000 yen please!

201
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,320
Everyone laughed

202
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,540
I didn't laugh

203
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,040
I'm not paying up, I'm sorry

204
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,320
No way, you have to pay up

205
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,720
This is messed up, Itao

206
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,120
It's messed up, right?

207
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,020
Alright then, let's have Heipo pay for us

208
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,300
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

209
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,860
It's 7,000 yen

210
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,660
Seriously, let this be your last one

211
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,660
Alright, see ya

212
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,660
Later

213
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,600
Fujiwara!

214
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,080
Send him home!

215
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,440
Yes, yes, sorry

216
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
What is this? Send him home!

217
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,390
Manager Fujiwara Hiroshi

218
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,400
Yes, sure

219
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Tell him to go away

220
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,080
Why are you eyes red all around?

221
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,860
I got hay fever, sorry...

222
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,940
Really?

223
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,940
There's a lot going on here

224
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,220
Hay fever? What the heck

225
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,540
It's Heipo's fault too

226
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,320
You clearly laughed, man

227
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,920
He got after us 'cause you were laughing

228
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,640
Gotta stay alert

229
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,400
I really didn't expect that

230
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,240
I'm not good with that

231
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,600
That's no good

232
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,460
The Itao family prepares a shichihenge

233
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,320
That's not shichihenge

234
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,700
Oi you...

235
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,460
Everyone laughed didn't they

236
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,460
Well, not really, but...

237
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,460
Yeah, I won't deny it

238
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,460
I think that was kinda funny

239
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,460
I know, right?

240
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,020
But this... just doesn't work as a shichihenge

241
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,620
Alright but... you laughed, so pay me up

242
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,460
5,000 yen

243
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,620
5,000 yen each

244
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,860
5,000 yen for each one of us?

245
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,380
Look, that is worth 5,000 yen each

246
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,960
"That"...?

247
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,100
I spent some serious money on this

248
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
But you're doing this all by yourself

249
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,860
My kid worked hard on this

250
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,780
And you're not gonna give her any recognition...?

251
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,900
Alright, here's 1,000 yen

252
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,140
No, it's 5,000 yen each

253
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,300
It's the right price for such a big skit

254
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,600
Really!?

255
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,000
Didn't seem that big to me...

256
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,300
You just painted some cardboard boxes

257
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,580
And you said you spent money for this? I doubt it

258
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,060
Of course it costs money

259
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,040
Didn't cost money, right?

260
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,300
For sure!

261
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,620
It cost money, right?

262
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,860
For sure!

263
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,680
Which is it?! Seriously which is it?!

264
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,780
One person didn't pay up

265
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,540
Ah okay, it's 10,000 yen

266
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,980
We all paid up

267
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,380
Man...

268
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,140
Miss wife, please don't ever show up again, won't you?

269
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,460
She ignored me!

Just leave us

277
