1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,730
Let's bring on our next presenter.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,290
Original subs: royaltree1204
Additional subs: oolong
Updates and QC: GakiDave

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,290
Who's coming?

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,650
Who is it?

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,090
It's Daikichi Hakata!

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,040
It's Mr. Daikichi, the teacher who looks good in a V-neck sweater.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,670
I wanted to dress up like a person on a supermarket ad.

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,420
Has anyone heard of the term, "homing instinct"?

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,090
Ooya-san, what do you think?

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,950
It's people who can get home even though they're drunk, right?

11
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,070
Like, they somehow are able to get home.

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,130
Yes, that's essentially what it means.

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,990
I never thought that Ooya-san would give the correct answer.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,770
There are many animals who have it, but...

15
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,830
...if you say, "homing instinct," then pigeons may be the most famous for it.

16
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,450
Yes, yes.

17
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,490
The most famous would be the messenger pigeon.

18
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,150
It is said that even if they're 1,000km away, they're able to figure out their way home.

19
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,150
T/N: 1,000km = 621.3 miles

20
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,170
1,000km is approximately the distance from Tokyo to Hokkaido.

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,930
It seems that distance is pretty easy for them to find their way.

22
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,370
Once you hear this, you think, "pigeons are amazing".

23
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,990
Mad respect for pigeons

24
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,730
This time, I have brought this kind of theory.

25
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,430
The theory that humans have a better homing instinct than pigeons.

26
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,930
Even if it's amazing for a pigeon to return home to Tokyo from Hokkaido.

27
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,890
For example, if you were abandoned in Hokkaido, what would you do?

28
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,890
T/N: Hokkaido is the northernmost island in Japan and known for the harsh cold temperatures.

29
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,920
Well, I'd get back home one way or another.

30
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,240
Futo-san, how about you, if you were abandoned in Okinawa?

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,240
T/N: Okinawa is the southernmost island in Japan and known for the warm tropical weather.

32
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,110
I'd relax and take my time.

33
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,040
We're talking about going home!

34
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,670
Though it depends on the season.

35
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,690
We verify if humans have a better homing instinct than pigeons.

36
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,750
Tonight we enlist the help of a pigeon coop in Saitama prefecture.

37
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,570
Roughly 500km from Tohoku's mountainous region...

38
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:17,210
...we hold an exhibition race.
Who will get home faster: human or pigeon?

39
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,200
My first thought is that the pigeons will come out on top.

40
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:27,070
(Question: Can pigeons win against humans?)

41
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,190
Really?

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,070
I'm confident.

43
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,890
And so the person they choose to go against the pigeons is...

44
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,770
Why from here?!

45
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,270
Excuse me.

46
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,970
Yasuda Dai Circus
Kuro-chan

47
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,110
Wait...

48
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,440
Eh?

49
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,230
It's the awful staff again!

50
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,510
Where are we going?

51
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,210
Staff:  You'll know when you get there.

52
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,500
T/N: Inoki Kanji (aka Antonio Inoki) had a famous saying about how even if you wonder about what will happen if you go down a certain path, you'll know when you get there.

53
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,500
That's something Inoki Kanji would say

54
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,710
With that said, we put on the eyemask...

55
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:05,110
...and begin our journey to the starting line.

56
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,880
I can't predict anything.

57
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,080
Staff: Were you able to predict things before?

58
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,330
Oh, definitely not!

59
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,690
With this, the car travels down the freeway...

60
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:25,830
...roughly eight hours to the starting point.

61
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,170
7:00 the next morning.

62
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,930
We arrive at a mountain in the Tohoku region.

63
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,110
Staff:  Good morning.

64
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,980
Staff: We've arrived.

65
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,220
Wasn't that kind of long?

66
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,030
This time we start from...

67
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,770
...Iwate Prefecture, Shimoheigun, Iwaizumi town.

68
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,510
No station, and practically no roads nearby.

69
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,910
An area with nothing in sight.

70
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,830
Incidentally, the temperature today is -3C.

71
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,940
It's cold!  So cold!

72
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,210
It's really cold, isn't it?

73
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,630
In shorts and short-sleeves...

74
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,630
...Kuro-chan is perhaps underdressed for Iwate.

75
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,520
This is absolutely in the minuses.

76
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,110
Both participants take their starting positions.

77
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:36,410
To make things fair we confiscate his phone and wallet.

78
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,450
As the pigeons aren't privy to knowing where they are, we start without either one knowing.

79
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,240
As a result, will the human win?

80
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,230
Or will the pigeons?

81
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,970
Scary...he doesn't know.

82
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,570
(Rule: The pigeon that returns earliest out of the ten pigeons will be their time.)

83
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,210
What was that?

84
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,240
What's going on?

85
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,970
It's started!

86
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,880
What was that flying?

87
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,880
You're not going to
tell him it started?!

88
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,920
I don't get the meaning of this.

89
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,750
What is going on?  Really?

90
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,660
It's freezing!

91
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,020
Kuro-chan doesn't realize the race has started.

92
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,990
So tell him!

93
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,650
This time there are others besides Kuro-chan...

94
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,440
I just followed my friends...

95
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,210
...so I don't know.

96
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,130
I even had them buy my ticket.

97
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:57,920
An old man who has never ridden on the train by himself.

98
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,490
Are you confident?

99
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,270
Can you do this?

100
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,170
Even an 8-year old is going on their first errand alone.

101
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,170
All start roughly at the same time.

102
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,800
Ten minutes after the pigeons took flight...

103
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,390
...Kuro-chan shows no signs of starting.

104
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,880
How long do I stand here?

105
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:31,150
It seems the frequent blindfolding has
trained him not to remove the eyemask.

106
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,890
He doesn't remove the eyemask until he's instructed to do so.

107
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:40,820
He is very disciplined in that sense.

108
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,050
Seriously, one hour later...

109
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,050
But then...

110
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,070
Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.

111
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,820
I think I'm going to leak!

112
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,010
Staff-san?

113
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,290
We did start from
the bathroom.

114
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,110
Hey...

115
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,190
Seriously, I don't understand.  What is this?

116
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,190
Did it start?

117
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,710
Can I take off my eyemask?

118
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,950
Hello?

119
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,550
HELLO?!

120
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,520
Anyone?

121
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,290
Can I take it off?

122
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,030
Can I take off the eyemask?

123
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,620
It's ok, right?

124
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,010
Where am I?!

125
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,840
Where am I!?

126
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,290
Even if he asks this
one question, they
can't answer it.

127
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,850
This is amazing.

128
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,610
"Take the camera and go to the next location."

129
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,920
Where is this?!

130
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,200
What is this?!

131
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,920
"Page 1?"

132
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,070
"Saitama Prefecture, Koshigaya"

133
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,470
I don't know where this is?

134
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,150
Am I supposed to go here?

135
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,590
This is different than usual!

136
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,020
I don't really understand, but...

137
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,310
...really, what is this?!

138
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,690
As a result, who will reach the goal first?

139
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,610
One hour since the start of the race.

140
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,550
The current situation is...

141
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:54,290
I'm currently heading towards Route 45.

142
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,990
To get the help of local people...

143
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,990
...the old man heads to the station.

144
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:09,840
His mother told him, "if you're in trouble, ask someone for help."

145
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,850
Ringo-kun, for the time being, looks for a house.

146
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,930
Maybe this way.

147
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:24,460
And Kuro-chan, who started an hour later than the others...

148
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,060
Just a minute, what is this?

149
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,090
Seriously, what is this?

150
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,390
With no knowledge of what is going on...

151
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,220
...he walks into the mountains.

152
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,170
At any rate I have to go this way, right?

153
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,630
And then...

154
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,830
Oh, there's a car!

155
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,190
An Iwate Prefecture car?

156
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,550
He looked at the plate.

157
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,820
Eh? Is this Iwate prefecture?

158
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,030
Kuro-chan managed to get a significant hint...

159
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,970
...from the plates of the passing car.

160
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,060
I should have talked to that car just now.

161
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:16,140
After walking another ten minutes...

162
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,190
What's this?

163
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,610
This looks like a workshop.

164
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,210
Ah, there's someone there.

165
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,020
Excuse me...

166
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,290
Eh? Are you Kuro-chan?

167
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,050
Amazing!

168
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,050
Do you have a second to talk?

169
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,100
Sorry, can I get you in the shot?

170
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,600
Can you tell me where I am?

171
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,480
This is... Iwaizumi town in Iwate prefecture.

172
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,480
Iwate prefecture?!

173
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,680
Tohoku's Iwate prefecture?

174
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,680
Yes, Tohoku.

175
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,580
By the way, from here I have to go to Koshigaya in Saitama.

176
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,490
I have to get to Saitama.

177
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,490
Saitama?

178
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,920
There really isn't much in the way of public transportation here.

179
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,020
No?

180
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,020
Not really.

181
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,430
Eh... what should I do?

182
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,970
He is able to find his current location, but there are no stations around.

183
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,130
There aren't any freeways around either.

184
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,210
Quite a hopeless situation.

185
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,970
There's a car here.

186
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,920
Would it be possible for you to take me somewhere by car?

187
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,390
If it's to the station.

188
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,730
It's ok?

189
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,950
For now, with the generosity of a local...

190
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:34,150
...he is able to get to the nearest station.

191
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,990
He got lucky.

192
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,290
You really are in a tough place.

193
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,960
This is too much.

194
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,330
Other shows aren't like this.

195
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,930
They're messed in the head!

196
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:51,740
Meanwhile, Ringo-kun was looking for a house.

197
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,170
Not able to find anyone and tired from walking, he sits down.

198
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,310
As for the old man...

199
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,220
Excuse me, good morning!

200
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,090
Would you mind giving me a ride to the station on the way?

201
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,020
Is Komoto station ok?

202
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,020
Yes.

203
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,590
Hitchhiking for the first time in his life...

204
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,590
...he is the first to arrive at a station.

205
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,590
And as for the pigeons?

206
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:38,120
(※ - Stock footage)

207
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:38,120
They are likely making good progress.

208
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,120
Right, filming them
was impossible.

209
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,880
Two hours since the start of the race.

210
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,110
As the old man waits outside by the bus stop...

211
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,890
...Kuro-chan also arrives.

212
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,040
So from here I go...

213
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,690
From here, go to Miyako.

214
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,890
That's the fastest?

215
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,890
Yes, fastest.

216
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,890
Then from Miyako go to Morioka.

217
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:14,410
Then from Morioka...you can get there by bullet train or whatever.

218
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,830
Based on the suggestion we would aim for Morioka, but...

219
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,160
...Kuro-chan currently has no money.

220
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,710
Furthermore...

221
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,510
Right now you are at this place called Omoto.

222
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,880
That's way too late.

223
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,110
This might be the fastest way.

224
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,780
There is a two-hour wait for the next train.

225
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,890
But with no money, there is also no train.

226
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,890
While this is going on...

227
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,720
Kuro-chan!

228
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,160
Thank you for your hard work!

229
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,730
Locals who recognize Kuro-chan come to talk.

230
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,510
Seems you don't have enough for the train fare?

231
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,510
I have nothing.

232
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,710
They left him with an eyemask.

233
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,710
Ah...

234
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,040
Not "ah...", this isn't normal!

235
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,540
Look how I'm dressed.  Isn't this strange?

236
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:14,650
By the way, how long would it take by car?

237
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:16,210
From here to Miyako, probably about an hour.

238
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,210
About an hour?

239
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,410
Do you have any plans after this?

240
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,820
If it were to Miyako, the three of us could ride together.

241
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,490
It's ok?

242
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,490
We can take you as far as Miyako.

243
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,360
We are heading to the Miyako site anyway.

244
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,670
He gets a ride to Miyako station.

245
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,500
Thank goodness, really.

246
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,140
I don't know what's going on.

247
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:45,250
Meanwhile, Ringo-kun discovers a house.

248
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,750
Hello...

249
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,750
Who are you?

250
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:55,510
I'm kinda on this errand by myself...

251
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,510
Ah...

252
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,290
(Shows the paper) Here.

253
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,290
That's Saitama prefecture.

254
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,990
Ringo-kun gets a ride to the station from a kind stranger.

255
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,190
So many nice people!

256
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,290
Three hours since the start.

257
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,470
Itadakimasu!

258
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,650
He accepts a bento from a local shopping street.

259
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,090
His first meal of the day.

260
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,820
Sorry about that, thank you.

261
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,990
It's hard filming, isn't it.

262
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:36,990
With zero funds, Kuro-chan gets this suggestion.

263
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,460
I wonder if you get get home with 5,000 yen.

264
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,930
I wonder if I can.

265
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,140
Offer to have your picture taken at my job site.

266
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,870
Say, 1,000 yen per shot with five people is 5,000 yen.

267
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,410
Could you kind of give me a ride there?

268
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,180
A dangerous schemer appears.

269
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,680
He's Kuroda Kanbei.

270
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,680
T/N: Kuroda Kanbei was a feudal lord known for his quick wit.

271
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:04,930
With that said, they stop at their job site...

272
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:11,170
...annd raise funds with pictures.

273
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,300
Pose, please!

274
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,400
It's Kuro-chan!

275
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,470
Thank you so much!

276
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,140
Sorry for accepting this.

277
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,150
I will use this money wisely.

278
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,490
He gets 6,000 yen total.

279
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,470
With everyone's strength I'm able to return home!

280
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,810
Since you're getting on the bus at Miyako station...

281
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,810
...to Morioka will be 2,030 yen.

282
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,810
2,030 yen...

283
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:48,130
From Morioka, take the bullet train for 8,230 yen.

284
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,130
8,230 yen?

285
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,770
Their research indicated that to get to Saitama...

286
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,770
...it would require 10,260 yen.

287
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,770
Currently short by 4,260 yen.

288
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:06,350
And so...

289
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,030
This is the always-happy Kuro-chan!  Wah-wah-wah!

290
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:16,690
Seiji-san, thank you so much for the 2,260 yen.

291
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:23,090
Recording individual messages to the local townsfolk.

292
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,490
With this, the goal of 10,260 yen has been reached.

293
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,010
Amazing!

294
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,720
This is incredible!

295
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,640
Looks like you'll get home.

296
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,360
Yeah, looks like it!

297
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,690
But when I get back, I'm not sure if it's finished or not.

298
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,130
I'm really not sure what I'm actually participating in.

299
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,890
That's right, Kuro-chan has no knowledge of what's going on.

300
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,830
Tonight's challenge is Humans vs Homing Pigeons.

301
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,830
Surely the pigeons are having a nice flight.

302
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,870
Currently among them, the old man is in last place.

303
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,610
After failing to get on the bus, he now aims to get to Morioka by hitchhiking.

304
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,390
And then...

305
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,420
Pardon me, which way are you heading?

306
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,030
Umm...Morioka...

307
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,550
He gets a car heading to Morioka...

308
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,850
...suddenly coming up from behind.

309
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:34,790
Meanwhile, Ringo-kun arrived at Miyako Station before Kuro-chan.

310
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:40,390
Just as he was directed: onto the bus to Morioka station.

311
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,650
However, perhaps exhausted from his first trip alone...

312
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,390
...he falls fast asleep.

313
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,960
And Kuro-chan, who got a ride to Miyako...

314
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,200
Is it alright?

315
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,930
Is this ok with everyone?

316
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,630
...got a ride with a family going to Morioka.

317
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,530
Why didn't you laugh there?

318
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:15,650
With this, all three are aiming for Morioka at roughly the same time.

319
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,390
And the first to arrive at Morioka station is...

320
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,430
I'm sorry, everyone.

321
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,430
Kuro-chan.

322
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,660
What?! It's Kuro-chan!

323
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,970
All that's left is to get the money collected earlier...

324
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,270
...and get on a bullet train.

325
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,910
The goal is close at hand.

326
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:42,870
But, as one would expect, a situation arises!

327
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,340
Kuro-chan is the first to arrive at Morioka station.

328
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,210
But a situation has arisen!

329
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,170
Excuse me...

330
00:19:54,170 --> 00:20:03,130
...I'd like to go to Koshigaya in Saitama prefecture.

331
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:03,130
To Koshigaya would be a total of...

332
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:09,700
...a total of 13,170 yen.

333
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,460
13,000 yen?

334
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,700
13,000 yen, eh?

335
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,700
This is the cheapest price?

336
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,700
Yes, it is.

337
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:18,330
It looks like the researched price was wrong.

338
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,950
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no...

339
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,090
We made a mistake.

340
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,220
The calculations were completely off.

341
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,410
With that said...

342
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,020
Ready, and...

343
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,730
Congratulations on your marriage Manabe! Wah wah wah!

344
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,800
He sells wedding congratulation messages.

345
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:45,920
And in just five minutes, he's raised 6,000 yen.

346
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,930
You can make it with this!

347
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,290
With this, he acquires a bullet train ticket and taxi fare.

348
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,850
What a crazy journey!

349
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,430
From the funds, a bullet train ride and a regular train ride...

350
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:07,930
...for two and a half hours ends in Saitama's Kasukabe station.

351
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:14,360
Made it to Kasukabe.

352
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,890
After that, get to the goal destination in a taxi.

353
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,290
Thank goodness, I really made it!

354
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,810
I finally made it!

355
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,210
And then...

356
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,280
Ah, this is it!  This is it!

357
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,150
Mister, thank you so much!

358
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,710
Eleven hours and twenty seven minutes since the start...

359
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,890
...Kuro-chan reaches the goal.

360
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,350
Is here ok?

361
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,630
Staff: Well done.

362
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,130
Staff: You reached an admirable goal.

363
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,920
Oh, I don't do something here?

364
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,820
Staff: This is the goal.

365
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,710
I made it!

366
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,490
This is the end? It's over?

367
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,640
Staff: But Kuro-chan...you lost.

368
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,210
Staff: But Kuro-chan...you lost.

369
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,890
Eh? What? What do you mean?

370
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,350
I lost?

371
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:12,070
That's right.  Five hours earlier...

372
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,850
Ah, they're here!

373
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,530
The pigeons came in first place.

374
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,250
Faster than in a car!

375
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,420
Incredible!

376
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,990
Also, 30 minutes before Kuro-chan arrived...

377
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,090
...the old man arrives.

378
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,790
Good job everyone!

379
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,790
Also, Ringo-kun, who arrived 15 minutes before Kuro-chan.

380
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:53,260
I lost?

381
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,260
Staff: You lost.

382
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,360
What's "yes"?

383
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,830
Lost to who? I didn't lose to anyone.

384
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,350
I wasn't up against anybody!

385
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,790
Staff: Pigeons.

386
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,080
Pigeons?

387
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,740
What are you talking about?

388
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,270
Kuro-chan's face looks like he's been shot by a peashooter.

389
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,740
Here at last we explain the project.

390
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,370
Staff: By the way, this time...

391
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,420
Staff: We released ten pigeons...and two came back home.

392
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,860
Staff: We released ten pigeons...and two came back home.

393
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,830
And the other eight?

394
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,810
Isn't that the bigger question?

395
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:32,890
With that said, pigeons will return faster from Tohoku than humans.

396
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:38,150
However, most never came back.

397
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,150
I see, I see.

398
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,610
Well, unfortunately, humans lost, but...

399
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,350
...wasn't that clever of Kuro-chan to get back the way he did?

400
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:51,570
Clever or maybe devilish.

401
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,370
His method seemed very simple.

402
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,290
And there's also...

403
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:59,650
...they didn't show even one heartwarming moment by Ringo-kun.

404
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,030
I think there were a lot.

405
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,770
Would you just gloss that over?

406
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,110
An 8-year-old who does his very best.

407
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,890
They didn't show the kid's uneasiness.

408
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,780
I think we should change that background music. I feel sorry for the other show.

409
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,780
T/N: The background music they used for Ringo-kun comes from the show, "My First Errand", a show about young kids running their first errand all alone.

410
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,980
Like the mother's tears and everything.

411
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,110
Kuro-chan can make that much money...

412
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,110
...how much could Matsumoto-san make?!

413
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,490
I personally can't use Kuro-chan's sort of simple methods.

414
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,690
But really, his worth...

415
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,750
If Matsumoto-san were doing photos on the spot like that, he could probably get 10,000 yen per!

416
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,750
T/N: 10,000yen was approximately worth $82.61USD at the time this episode aired.

417
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,750
Yeah, that's right!

418
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,750
Definitely!

419
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,950
Let's see how much we can earn!

420
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,800
Please go try to see how much you can earn.

421
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,940
And then please come back by helicopter or something.
