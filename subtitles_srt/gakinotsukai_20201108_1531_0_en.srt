1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,660
The First Annual Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende, Chiki Chiki

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,400
I am the one who understands him the best!

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,430
At any rate, this item suits you right? Championship!
Choshu Riki version~!!

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,330
Matsumoto-san, it's this theme again

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,470
It has been a while though

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:26,910
The regular theme with Gaki members buying items that they think will suit the guest

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,280
This is the theme where Tanaka shines

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,860
Or more like making himself shine

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,550
Tanaka ranked last for 9 items over the past 12 rounds

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,550
No, that's not true

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,770
Well, I bet he's doing it on purpose though

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,860
No I'm not, not at all

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,590
It's fine, you can do it on purpose

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,520
But don't go too far, so that the audience notices it

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,790
They must have noticed it

16
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,560
No they didn't notice it...
I mean I'm not doing it on purpose

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:55,360
Subbed by Appieopie, more episodes at
www.laughseejapan.com/user/18797

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,060
For today's guest...

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,180
-He's a big guy
-Yes, he is

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,720
It was difficult to find things for his size

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,450
And he has long hair right?

22
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,720
There's not much people with long hair and large in size

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,580
It was difficult

24
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,660
Let's welcome today's guest

25
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,300
Welcome Choshu Riki-san

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,310
Nice to meet you

27
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,150
The legend of Japan's professional wrestling, Choshu Riki

28
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,270
Gaki members will buy tops and items that suit him,

29
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,490
The former strongest wrestler that the mere mention of his name was enough to silence a naughty child

30
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,370
Do you usually wear like this?

31
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,790
No, I don't

32
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,130
-You don't?
-Not at all

33
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,800
They forced me to wear this

34
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,840
-It's a T-shirt of Choshu Riki right?
-Yeah it is

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,140
This is embarrassing

36
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,240
Is there any meaning for this T-shirt?

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,700
I have no idea too

38
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,560
Seriously?

39
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,450
That illustration was obvious

40
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:17,050
The members went to buy items that suit Choshu Riki beforehand

41
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,190
What is your impression of Choshu-san, Hamada-san?

42
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,780
Well, he must be a wild person right?

43
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,760
He is tall and stout even at his age

44
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,680
So I'll choose something that suits a strong old man

45
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,430
-This seems to be strong right?
-Which one?

46
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,330
No, no way

47
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,980
This is not about being strong dude

48
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,740
This is a weapon

49
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,310
It's really heavy

50
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:52,420
I have no idea whether this is for aunt or uncle

51
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,760
These leather jackets seem to suit him too

52
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,460
Just let him wear something like this around his neck

53
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,170
At the same time, for Endo

54
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,720
Chono-san right...

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,510
It's Choshu-san

56
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,210
Not Chono-san, I mean Choshu-san

57
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,650
This one is perfect for hat lovers

58
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,260
This is so cute

59
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:29,190
This looks like President Trump's cap though

60
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,640
I think Pokemon could work too

61
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,840
Pokemon should work

62
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,640
-So we're at the shop for plus-size clothings?
-Yes, we are

63
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,830
Because I thought normal-size clothings won't fit Choshu-san

64
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:52,290
So I decided to go straight to this shop with various fashionable plus-size clothes

65
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,930
What is your impression of Choshu-san, Tanaka-san?

66
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,490
Maybe this sound a bit impolite

67
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,390
But I think that he is a very charming person

68
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:10,330
So I want to choose something that can show the charming part of him

69
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,880
Maybe something like this?

70
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,230
With pigs?

71
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,820
Nope, he may feel like being looked down upon

72
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,170
-Is this a T-shirt?
-Yes it is a T-shirt

73
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,050
Are you joking?

74
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,850
This is a T-shirt?

75
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,690
Well, although I have no idea at all

76
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,720
I'll go for something with Japanese style

77
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,160
This one is common, but it must look cool on him

78
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,130
He can wear this at dressing rooms

79
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,140
This looks good too

80
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:49,510
Housei got hyped up with his favorite Japanese style clothes, and continues to try them on

81
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,210
This is cool

82
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,610
He can just tighten the Kimono belt, and shout "Let's go guys"

83
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,740
What kind of illustrations do you think suits Choshu-san?

84
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,690
Well, Choshu-san never crossed my mind, so...

85
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,700
To find something that suits Choshu-san,
Matsumoto is heading towards...

86
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,560
Could there be anything that suits Choshu-san here?

87
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,270
Well, I don't know too

88
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,300
But this seems to be good right?

89
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,480
This suits him right?

90
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,010
-I think this may suit him surprisingly well
-Well, yeah

91
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,820
Because his head is big

92
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,630
I just want to confirm this with you

93
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,320
According to the shop owner

94
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:43,150
This shop is targeting high school girls

95
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,820
Are you fine with that? Not mistaken?

96
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,260
Well...

97
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,570
Choshu-san is also their target isn't it?

98
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,390
The guest will take the item that ranks first

99
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,910
The item on last place will be paid by the member who chose it

100
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,450
Each of us will be presenting our item

101
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:08,410
-Please don't say anything like "this one is good"
-Yes, I understand

102
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,210
Tell us after everyone presents

103
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,330
Choshu-san should be angry with what he said just now

104
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,190
-He's looking down upon you
-No, no, no I didn't

105
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,920
Choshu-san teach him a lesson

106
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,400
Endo will be the first to present a top that suits Choshu-san

107
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,500
The item that I've bought is over there

108
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,780
Choshu-san please open it

109
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,070
Can I open it?

110
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,070
Yes, please open it

111
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,020
The act of opening a bag doesn't suits him though

112
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,590
-Looks like he is rummaging around the bag
-Yes, exactly

113
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,980
Can I take it out?

114
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,590
-It's a leopard print parka
-So it's a parka

115
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,880
Choshu-san would you mind trying it on?

116
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,980
You can open it with the front zipper

117
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,090
There's a zipper right?

118
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,870
Yes, there's a front zipper

119
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,740
It just hit him in the face right?

120
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,610
The hood just hit him in the face like "bang"

121
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,180
It fits him like a glove

122
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,620
This looks really cool

123
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,820
And suits him very well

124
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,020
Please look at yourself in the monitor, and rank it in your mind

125
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,660
You'll need to choose one at the end

126
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,090
Is it comfortable to wear?

127
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,450
It's made of nylon fabrics...

128
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,260
Choshu-san is not speaking at all

129
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,870
I can't speak about it right?

130
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,610
You can tell us things like "is it comfortable to wear"

131
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,370
Leopard print’s popularity has never gone away

132
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,240
It's the classic style type

133
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,640
So it's good to keep one in your closet

134
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,850
-So you can always wear it
-Yes

135
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,640
Do you like leopards?

136
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,170
Leopards?

137
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,990
Well, I don't dislike it

138
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:53,990
It's now Hamada's turn to present a top that suits Choshu-san

139
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,210
-This is a riding jacket
-I see

140
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,000
Is that an "oh" of happiness?

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,770
I wonder what it means

142
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,260
Well, I don't know whether Chono-san have this type of jacket as well

143
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,490
He is really not speaking at all

144
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,900
I was talking all the time, and yet Choshu-san never speaks

145
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,410
But I can't speak about it right?

146
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,800
It's because Hamada you've warned him too much

147
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,690
I have to warn him because he is an idiot

148
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,440
He can't wear it on his own

149
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,260
The size is too small isn't it?

150
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,450
It should be out if he can't even wear it himself right?

151
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,930
-It's fine
-It should be out already

152
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,040
But he looks like a cool old man now

153
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:45,060
*Tospo is the post box used to receive letters from the audience in Downtown DX

154
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:45,060
-He looks more like Tospo now
-Yes, he looks like Tospo*

155
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,080
The personification of Tospo

156
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,530
The next presenter is Housei

157
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,550
What is the Japanese style top that he chose?

158
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:00,150
I think Japanese style suits Choshu-san better

159
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,310
Instead of Western style

160
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,730
Please open it

161
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,160
What is this?

162
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,530
It's not even coming out from the bag

163
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,570
That's just because the bag is small

164
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,870
What is that?

165
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,690
You screwed it up

166
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,720
No, no, no way

167
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,310
Where are you supposed to wear this?

168
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,010
You seriously screwed up

169
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,950
-No way dude
-It fits perfectly

170
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,240
-Where are you supposed to wear this?
-Exactly

171
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,760
When are you supposed to wear this?

172
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
You can wear this anytime, anywhere, right?

173
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,090
-Where?
-Eh?

174
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,910
-Where can I go with this?
-Where can you wear this dude?

175
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,920
-You can even go to convenient stores with this
-No, no, no way

176
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,380
If he happens to wear that, others might think that he's here to warn people for holding a cigarette in the mouth*

177
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,630
*Choshu-san is wearing the cloth of "Megumi", a famous firefighter brigade during Edo period

178
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,630
That's so true

179
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,330
The next presenter is Matsumoto

180
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,770
Did he find any top that suits Choshu-san?

181
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,290
You guys are focusing too much on the wild part of Choshu-san

182
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,460
But he is indeed wild

183
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,530
Wild people tend to like things that are completely opposite

184
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,890
I'm confident about this

185
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,110
-Can I take this out?
-This sounds horrible

186
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,500
This is perfect for him

187
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,600
Oh my god, oh my god

188
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,830
What the heck is this?

189
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,250
I'm sure that this suits him

190
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,120
It's Tanaka-ish

191
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,000
Look at this

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,590
Oh my god, this is awful

193
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,700
This suits him perfectly right?

194
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,430
This must be...cute

195
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,590
Just having it is already cute

196
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,240
No way

197
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,980
His grandchild will treat him like an idiot

198
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,650
He'll get kicked by his grandchild

199
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,970
His grandchild will say "no way!" and kick him

200
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,020
-Saying like "I hate grandpa!"
-You're right

201
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,010
Choshu-san don't know how to unzip the zipper

202
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,080
How do I unzip this?

203
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,930
Just unzip it normally

204
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,070
This has two versions Choshu-san

205
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,420
Let's try this side first

206
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,590
-So cute
-No way

207
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,730
-That's super cute right?
-No, no way

208
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,460
The size doesn't fits

209
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,380
This is awful

210
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,620
-Super cute!!
-This is terrible

211
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,980
-This is super cute right?
-I told you this is terrible

212
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
This doesn't suits Choshu-san at all

213
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,720
That's super cute

214
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,920
The cloth is the only thing that is cute

215
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:16,390
Tanaka is the last presenter, what will happen?

216
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,830
-Is it fine for you to be the last presenter?
-Yes, no problem

217
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,800
I was thinking "that's wrong, that's wrong"
while watching everyone's item

218
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,900
Choshu-san gives me a charming and cute impression as well

219
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,070
This is absolutely terrible right?

220
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,260
What is this?

221
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,950
-It's a long knit
-Huh?

222
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,450
-The one that moms wear
-No it's not

223
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,040
It's not the one that moms wear

224
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,660
The one that moms wear after cooking curry in a hurry and head towards the theatre

225
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,360
Not the one that moms wear when in a hurry

226
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,420
-Is this men's clothes?
-Yes, men can wear this too

227
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,330
You can pull it to the bottom, because it's a long knit

228
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,580
What the heck is going on?

229
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,380
-You must be kidding right? That's awful!
-No, no, I'm not

230
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,190
There's this new trend of being "aggressively cute" right?

231
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,300
Help him fix it dude

232
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,180
-Is this the front
-Yes it is

233
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,180
I really want to show the cute part of Choshu-san

234
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,720
He looks like an aunt now dude!!

235
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,990
No, no, no he doesn't

236
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,040
Let's try to roll up the sleeves a bit

237
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,430
Tanaka that's not gonna help

238
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,990
What's wrong with you dude?

239
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,520
This kind of long knit is really popular among men

240
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,440
The trend is now to be "aggressively cute"

241
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,690
No way dude, I never saw any man wear this

242
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,090
What a look!

243
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,610
That's the mom at class observation day

244
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,960
Other students would say "your mom looks so powerful"

245
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,480
How long should the bottom part be?

246
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,370
You can wear it as an one-piece dress without pants

247
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,980
-One-piece dress?
-This is so wrong

248
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,540
I want him to look charming

249
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,060
He's a mom now dude

250
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,490
All that's left is to wear lipstick

251
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,340
Before Choshu-san tell us the ranking

252
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,660
He wants to confirm this desperately

253
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:14,280
Choshu-san please tell us the 2nd best top that you like

254
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,730
Is this really men's clothes?

255
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,980
-He finally speaks out
-That's so true

256
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,890
That being said, which one is the 2nd best top?

257
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,440
Thank god!

258
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,620
I knew it! It's cute right?

259
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,870
-The size is a bit small though
-Yes it is a bit small

260
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,580
But it feels good to wear it right?

261
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,710
Yes it feels good

262
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,620
I told you guys

263
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,850
It's shocking to know that's the 2nd place

264
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,570
The 3rd place is...

265
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
I see

266
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,280
Choshu is weird

267
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,350
It's really hard to tell

268
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,530
I thought mine is better that

269
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,830
Hamada's riding jacket is the 4th place

270
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,890
So Matsumoto-san, only Cocorico is left

271
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,030
Yeah, and again

272
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,470
Yes only we are left, but I don't think he will stand a chance to win

273
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,200
-I'm just being honest
-Come on, it looks really good

274
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,840
Tell us what is good about it

275
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,280
You never saw him like that right?

276
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,620
You never saw Choshu-san like that right?

277
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,410
-That's exactly the reason why it's awful
-He keeps on talking about this

278
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,420
Which one is the top that Choshu Riki likes the most?

279
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,410
It looks absolutely cute on you

280
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,550
-Let's see which one is the best
-It was super cute...

281
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,710
You're annoying dude

282
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,830
I feel sorry for him

283
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:50,810
Choshu-san even pretends to choose the another one for us!!

284
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,810
Although that couldn't be true

285
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,410
But Choshu-san tried hard and moved 2 steps forward for us!!

286
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,080
I feel really sorry for letting him do this for us

287
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,020
-He's acting out for us
-Yes, he did it for us

288
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,370
Choshu-san, can you tell us why is this the worst one please?

289
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,740
Well, I don't dislike the color of this

290
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:15,420
But is this men's clothes?

291
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,730
We all want to ask this question

292
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,440
He asked this for several times

293
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,340
Tanaka is paying 15,246 yen for the item bought

294
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,940
The turbulent bonus item section!!

295
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,950
At any rate, this item suits you right? Championship!

296
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,340
A bonus item that suits Choshu-san

297
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,120
The first presenter is Hamada

298
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,960
Choshu-san just started using SNS recently

299
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,280
Yes, he just started using Twitter recently

300
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,460
But I heard that there's a lot of typos in his post

301
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,940
So you can use this...

302
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,820
Eh, what's this?

303
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,970
-Put this here...
-Oh, I see

304
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:01,420
The text will look bigger so there should be less typos

305
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,650
Can you see it clearly?

306
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:07,000
I can see it very clearly

307
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,950
*Shinjuku no Haha, or Kurihara Sumiko, is a famed fortune teller in Shinjuku, for over half a century

308
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,950
He sounds like Shinjuku no Haha*

309
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,100
Saying like "I can see it clearly now"

310
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,520
I can really see it clearly

311
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,460
The next presenter is Endo, who won first place in the tops section

312
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,670
That's huge

313
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,860
-It's not about being big though
-Yes, agreed

314
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,740
It's from CA4LA the hat shop

315
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,670
Eh, again?

316
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,840
I need to open it again

317
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,140
Well, these things happen, Choshu-san

318
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,390
Here it comes

319
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,150
What did you buy?

320
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,240
Well it's from CA4LA, so it's a hat

321
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
-But for this hat...
-What is that?

322
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:48,560
It's a bucket shaped hat, which is trendy right now,
plus a cap on top of it

323
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,780
What does that even mean?

324
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,510
This is very trendy right now

325
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,200
He looks confused again

326
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,330
Just look at Choshu-san's face

327
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,500
Choshu-san is pitiful

328
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,090
He looks like he's about to cry

329
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,140
Please try the hat on

330
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,760
What is that?

331
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,990
This is awful

332
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,480
Endo, this is awful

333
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,900
Try to wear it backwards

334
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,280
-Backwards?
-Yes, backwards

335
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,060
He looks like a dumb kid now

336
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,610
-It's a bucket-shaped hat
-Don't say bucket again

337
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:26,760
It's the same color as his face

338
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:32,670
The next presenter is Matsumoto, who presented a cute top in the previous section

339
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,940
-Please, Matsumoto-san
-Okay

340
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,210
I've tried to bring out the cute part of Choshu-san previously

341
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,180
But we should not forget his wildness as well

342
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,380
In addition, they are perfect in these days

343
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,960
He's laughing

344
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,510
And I've prepared two items

345
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,380
It's good right?

346
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,620
*Strong style is an approach of wrestling as a combat sport

347
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,620
-A mask?
-So he can always be in a "strong style"*

348
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,610
Can you please try it on?

349
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,140
It's for Bōsōzoku

350
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,820
Bōsōzoku?

351
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,780
*Yoroshiku written in Kanji is a greeting used by Bōsōzoku

352
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,780
So it says Yoroshiku

353
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,080
This is not necessary at all right, Choshu-san?

354
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,940
No, no, please try the another "Come fight me" too

355
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,750
This is absolutely unnecessary

356
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,860
But think about it...

357
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:22,220
Wearing a Micky jacket, and a "Come fight me" mask, that's a masterpiece

358
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,040
Like "what is that guy thinking about?"

359
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,890
It's no good to be a masterpiece

360
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,260
Can Tanaka save his face?

361
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,590
-He was confused all this time
-I bet he will laugh hard this time

362
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,550
-You have to save your face here
-Yes, otherwise I'll be losing 2 times in a row

363
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,190
-Eh?
-He's saying "Eh?" already

364
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,210
What is it dude? He's saying "Eh?" already

365
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,130
What is that?

366
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,220
Mine is also a hat

367
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,100
What?

368
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,530
Look at it

369
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,660
-No, no way
-That's awful

370
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,440
-Are you serious dude!!
-Why? That looks good

371
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,220
Is he a surgeon?

372
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,570
What the heck is that?

373
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,360
This is terrible right? Look at it

374
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,580
-No it's not
-What are you thinking about?

375
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,500
You can hang out without setting your long hair every time

376
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,800
Well no, you can't go out with this thing

377
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,400
He told us the answer already

378
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,250
No way, that's not true

379
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,620
He is speaking smoothly for the first time in a while

380
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,520
The last presenter is Hosei, who chose Japanese style items

381
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,840
Please, Yama-chan

382
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,130
-Are you confident about this?
-Yes, of course

383
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,330
But Choshu-san made a weird face though

384
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,250
And he don't even want to take it out

385
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,250
What happened Choshu-san?

386
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,580
Hey dude, it's not a shit right?

387
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,740
Where can you even buy a shit

388
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,400
What is that?

389
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,790
Please take it out Choshu-san

390
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,510
-That looks scary
-What is it?

391
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,980
Choshu-san?

392
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,730
That's terrifying

393
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,280
How come? What happened to you?

394
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,420
What happened to you, seriously?

395
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,330
This is terrible

396
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,920
This is just terrible!!

397
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,010
Please try it on

398
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:14,850
Yes, just like that

399
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,680
This is absolutely terrible

400
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,530
No way

401
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,030
Wow, it suits you perfectly

402
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,710
Your grandchild will be so happy to see this!!

403
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,850
How can you use this?

404
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:29,820
Well, I hope Choshu-san can wear this and play with kids

405
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,430
I'm sure that kids will be happy with that

406
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,370
You have a grandchild right?

407
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:39,730
Yes, I do

408
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,820
The ranking for bonus items will be announced!!

409
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:49,100
At any rate, this item suits you right? Championship!
Which bonus item do Choshu-san like the most?

410
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,220
He can use mine immediately

411
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,930
Thank you very much

412
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,440
Of course, of course

413
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
This comes in handy

414
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,660
This is really useful to me

415
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,250
This is definitely useful

416
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,830
So now Choshu-san, which item gets 2nd place?

417
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,950
Please tell us which item gets 2nd place

418
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,960
Well, so the key point is to be practical right?

419
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,700
He should choose mine

420
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,660
I knew it!

421
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,400
I told you! Right?

422
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,080
No way, wait a second, we should leave now dude

423
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,980
Choshu-san, why is this 2nd place?

424
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,110
This is because...

425
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,330
I'll take it, and give it to my grandchild

426
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,470
So that's indeed the reason

427
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,110
To make them happy

428
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:45,320
Matsumoto's masks got 3rd place

429
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,180
Why 3rd place?

430
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,350
This is the gauze mask that I used since childhood

431
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,860
-It makes you feel at ease right?
-Yes

432
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,590
Choshu-san are you fine with those words on it?

433
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,730
Well, so probably just for a walk around the neighborhood

434
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,250
So not for going on an outing

435
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,770
Well, yeah that's true

436
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:12,080
Which one is the worst bonus item for Choshu?

437
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,720
-Like "are you treating me as fool?"
-Yeah

438
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,590
I wonder which one he'll choose

439
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,340
Both are hats

440
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,430
That was fast

441
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,470
He told us the answer already

442
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,970
Seriously? You don't like it?

443
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,020
If you have to make a choice between these two,
then of course it's this one

444
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,090
This is totally unnecessary

445
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,400
No way, it really suits you well, and it was super cute

446
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,820
It's pointless

447
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,630
Can I borrow this Choshu-san

448
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,870
Tanaka when are you supposed to use this?

449
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,340
What is it called?

450
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:49,250
It's a Turban, and this looks perfect

451
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,570
No way, that's so weird

452
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,300
This is really good, and it's warm

453
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,760
Who will look good with this?

454
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:04,030
In addition to the top, Tanaka is paying for the turban as well

455
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,330
How do you feel Choshu-san, with all these tops and bonus items?

456
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,460
We thought over this and bought it ourselves

457
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,880
I'm really grateful for this

458
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,830
I really feel sorry today

459
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:20,090
But if the size is a bit larger, maybe the ranking could have changed

460
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:24,090
Okay, I see, but even so...

461
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,430
He was wearing it backwards just now, this is the front

462
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,900
Eh?

463
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,550
This is the front

464
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,490
Well, but even so...

465
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,680
It was backwards

466
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,220
You look horrible

467
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,320
*Tanaka is hosting the tv show "ZIP!" every Thursday

468
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,320
Wear that on ZIP!

469
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,960
Wear that and go to ZIP!

470
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,790
That's a Batsu game
