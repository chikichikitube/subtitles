00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,960
A celebration! Hamada Masatoshi's birthday celebration.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,790
High Tension: The best 10!

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,990
Well, hello~. Good evening~.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,600
Matsumoto-san, over here please.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,600
Good evening.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,660
Hello, good evening.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,640
Hello, hello. It's been quite a while, hasn't it?

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,800
It's been a while. Um, excuse me.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,650
The title is...

11
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,040
Ah, today is a special compilation.

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,640
For Hamada Masatoshi's birthday,

13
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,640
Okay.

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,490
to celebrate, they're going to do previous High Tensions for you today.

15
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,280
Is that right?

16
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,280
Yes.

17
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,850
There may be some reluctant people here as well...

18
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,350
Well, let's get started at once.

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,350
Okay!

20
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,460
This week's 10th place is!

21
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,400
At 71 points, "Let's celebrate. Around the Loop 7 Road."

22
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,030
by Cocorico's Tanaka Naoki.

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Congratulations!

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,500
The title is rather interesting.

25
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,420
10th place?

26
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,740
10th place, but before that

27
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,100
congratulations.

28
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,100
No, no. Thank you.

29
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,910
No, enough of that. Thank you.

30
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,180
We sincerely thank you for taking the time.

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,380
We often ask the first person, but

32
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,940
what's the feeling backstage?

33
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,860
Well, basically no one is talking.

34
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,420
There is something I heard,

35
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,590
from the staff.

36
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,800
The oldest among today's performers is

37
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,390
a 62-year-old person.

38
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,320
The staff is unbelievable too.

39
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,000
They're rehearsing them over and over I heard.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,310
In addition, there are some that aren't familiar with High Tension.

41
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,740
Simply put, they're not used to television.

42
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,140
There's at least one person.

43
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,060
There's a person like that?

44
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,870
Well, Tanaka-san.

45
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,840
If you would.

46
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,840
Please go on standby.

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,850
Alright.

48
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,840
This week's 10th place. Cocorico's Tanaka Naoki with

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,320
"Let's celebrate. Around the Loop 7 Road."

50
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,100
Loop 7, oi!

51
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,540
Is this High Tension?

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,700
Ah, here we go.

53
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,850
This is a bit more like it.

54
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,730
What is this? What is this?

55
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,600
Is it the Loop 7? Is it the Loop 8? Is it the Loop 6?

56
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Let's meet at all those places!

57
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,770
Hamada-san, bugya!

58
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,310
Alright, thank you very much.

59
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,240
Okay.

60
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:47,510
Back there, the people that are going to come out made "ugh" sort of groans.

61
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,960
Those leaked out a bit.

62
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,670
Let's continue.

63
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,230
This week's 9th place is!

64
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,230
At 87 points,

65
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,230
"Ka-burlesque" by KABA-chan.

66
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,530
Congratulations.

67
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,090
Your first appearance.

68
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,270
Thanks for having me.

69
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,480
Happy birthday.

70
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,660
Thank you very much.

71
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,490
Hamada-san loves sexy, doesn't he?

72
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,440
He loves sexy.

73
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,010
Therefore, I want my sexiness to be on full display.

74
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,840
Today is that sort of day, isn't it.

75
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,840
Yes.

76
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,030
Well, please go on standby.

77
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,080
I'll do my best. Thanks for having me.

78
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,720
The one after Tanaka-san is KABA-chan.

79
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,720
That's right.

80
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,620
This time, all the people coming out will

81
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,960
have some relation to Hamada-san.

82
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Ah! So that's the case. Got it.

83
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,400
This week's 9th place, KABA-chan with "Ka-burlesque".

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,510
What is this?

85
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,290
Well, she's good at dancing.

86
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,290
She's good.

87
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,900
Yeah.

88
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,090
She's a dance choreographer after all.

89
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,560
Huh, what's she doing?

90
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
What's this?

91
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,400
Huh, that's unexpected.

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,060
That's truly unexpected.

93
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,870
Since we've enjoyed the dancing enough,

94
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,980
So this comes after.

95
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,300
this is the finisher...

96
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,940
Hamada-san! Happy 56th birthday!

97
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,500
Thank you for being born!

98
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,680
Thank you!

99
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,030
So, is it over?

100
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,880
Are you okay? Be careful.

101
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,040
Watch out. Watch out.

102
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,040
Watch out. Watch out.

103
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,920
Well, we can take in the sexiness here as well.

104
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,350
Ah, that's right, isn't it.

105
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,130
Watch out. Watch out...

106
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,100
She's doing it anyway.

107
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,490
What is this?

108
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:47,970
It's hot.

109
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,970
Hot, hot, hot!

110
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,770
Alright, thank you very much!

111
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,820
She did quite a few things there.

112
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,310
This week's 8th place is!

113
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,360
At 152 points,

114
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,550
"Calligraphy" by Harada Ryuuji.

115
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,680
"Congratulations!" we'd like to say, but

116
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,110
Eh?

117
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,830
It seems this person's schedule didn't fit, so

118
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,830
So, that's the case.

119
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,600
we have a video that we'll be watching.

120
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,600
Is that so?

121
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,240
Ah, thank you.

122
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,240
To the contrary, no matter what, they really wanted to appear.

123
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,110
That's right.

124
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,110
Indeed.

125
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,450
Let's go. This week's 8th place.

126
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,610
Harada Ryuuji's "Calligraphy".

127
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,660
Masatoshi-san!

128
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,510
For your 56th birthday! Sincerely!

129
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,440
Happy birthday!

130
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,150
I'll use this hair stick!

131
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,570
For your 56th birthday.

132
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,930
I want to celebrate!

133
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,930
Hair stick?

134
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,510
A garage?

135
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,630
Hair stick?

136
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,880
He's in a garage.

137
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,320
I'll be using India ink!

138
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,900
He's really letting his voice out.

139
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,900
It's amazing.

140
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,120
Here we go!

141
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,140
He's an idiot.

142
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,890
He's a moron, isn't he. A moron.

143
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,190
He's an idiot.

144
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,760
Woah, woah, woah.

145
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,620
No, no, no...

146
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,680
It fell!

147
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,470
This is a celebration!

148
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,310
Celebrate! Celebrate! Celebrate!

149
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,560
Celebrate! Celebrate!

150
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,790
Celebrate! Celebrate~!

151
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
No, enough now...

152
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
Masatoshi-san!

153
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,800
You can really see his d*ck.

154
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,390
For your 56th birthday! Sincerely!

155
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,070
Happy birthday!

156
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,110
Thank you very much.

157
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,110
Thank you very much.

158
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,660
You saw 10th, 9th, and 8th place. What do you think?

159
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,380
You guys are next with 7th place.

160
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,780
Can I share my honest thoughts?

161
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,780
Yes.

162
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,380
I'm trembling.

163
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,450
7th place. "Instrumental 2019" by License

164
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,670
It's here. It's finally here.

165
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,480
What?

166
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,130
They're celebrating.

167
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,110
What is it though?

168
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,710
In regards to the current comedy world,

169
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,530
I feel like I know License's exact position.

170
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,310
I feel like I get it.

171
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,830
Where License is in the current comedy world.

172
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,950
It felt like it embodied us.

173
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,560
This week's 6th place is!

174
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,280
At 343 points,

175
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,790
"Pretty Pretty" by YOU

176
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,120
"Congratulations!"

177
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,860
Huh?

178
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,470
we'd like to say, but

179
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,470
Again?

180
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,360
Just like before with Harada, she'll appear by video.

181
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,370
Eh?

182
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,180
She's appearing by video because she has a high fever

183
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,380
or something like that.

184
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,720
Hamada-san, happy birthday.

185
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,320
I'm Ishino Mako.

187
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,000
It seems that when you were young,

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,530
you used me to "sate your appetite".

189
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,770

266
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,180

It's said you're the king of the fruits.

277

Now then, let's do battle.

287
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,710
Shove it up his nose?

288
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,710
Yes.

289
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,660
Here goes.

290
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,820

Let's continue...

314
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,070
It seems something in this direction stinks.

315
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,940

Why did you do that so grandly?

321
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,350
Your usual... your usual skit...

322
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,350
Like that?

323
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,560
As for this High Tension,

324
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,590
I already have high expectations for Endo-san.

325
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,590
Thank you very much.

326
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,110
He's a veteran. A veteran.

327
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,350
You're going to show us a perfect act.

328
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,440
I'm a little sorry for all the previous performers.

329
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,450
It seem this High Tension...

330

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,490
I'm speaking right now.

332
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,490
Ok, sorry.

333
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,890
I'm telling you to stop.

334
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,670
Like when you're driving, there's the Loop 7 Road.

335
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,210
That's right. After all, um...

336
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,020
I've liked cars from the start.

337
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,830
Ah, is that so?

338
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,300
Stop that!!

339
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,400
It's okay to touch, but

340
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,070
you have to stop pinching!!

341
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,910
Still, let's continue.

342
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,040
Well, let's go to standby.

343
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,040
Alright, please go on standby.

344
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:37,190
That's also something we always do.

345
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,190

What's this you bastard! Hey!

349
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,010
I just happen to be walking around the Loop 7 Road near Kaminuma.

350
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,020
Why is there a shark here!?

351
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,080
Why do I have to get bitten by a shark?

352
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,190
Eh?

353
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,710
Give me a break. Seriously.

354
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,400
Where did you come from?

355
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,750
Did you come from Nikotama over there?

356
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,520
That means, this way is Shibuya. Is that right?

357
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,160
Is that so? Alright.

358
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,920
Well then, you and me,

359
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,170
let's go buy Hamada-san's present.

360
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,230
Alright, let's go!

361
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,600
I like that.

362
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,240
We're passing Mishuku now.

363
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,210
Mishuku.

364
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,720
Alright, let's go back for a second.

365
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,760
He's going back?

366
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,310
He's got good stamina.

367
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,310
Yeah.

368
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,710
From here, we can go straight and it's on the left.

369
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,150
The restaurant where Hamada-san sometimes takes me to dinner.

370
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,690
So it has that sort of message too.

371
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,480
Huh?

372
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,860
Cut it out!

373
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,620
Why is he hitting it?

374
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,620
What's happened?

375
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,930
Is he having a breakdown?

376
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,930
Why is he hitting it?

377
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,370
I want to go to Shibuya right now!

378
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,990
Be quiet for me, okay?

379
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,700
Alright, let's enter 246.

380
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,280
We have to be quick...

381
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,980
Alright.

382
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,240
Why are they together?

383
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,050
What is he doing?

384
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,050
This street is getting crowded.

385
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,020
This street has gotten crowded.

386
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,990
Alright, I have no choice.

387
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,960
I'm going to fight you.

388
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,290
I don't care!

389
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,360
Even if the streets are crowded, I don't care!

390
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,840
Alright, just a second.

391
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,330
This is stupid.

392
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,430
Do it properly.

393
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,340
This guy is an idiot.

394
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,610
He's an idiot.

395
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,010
What the heck?

396
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,610
I don't know how this is going to end anymore.

397
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,150
Hmm, what's happening?

398
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,150
Alright. Alright, now.

399
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,120
I'm taking you back.

400
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,120
Eh?

401
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,510
Alright, Nakameguro's...

402
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,790
Those cherry blossoms are pretty by this river.

403
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,220
Float away.

404
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,260
Don't come back again.

405
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,260

Yes.

And yet, you did that?

414
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,910
It's strange. That you were calm doing that.

Thanks for having me.

422

It's been a while, hasn't it?

423
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,910
That's right, it has.

That's right.

426

To get 2nd place on my debut here,

427
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,680
I'm really sorry about that.

428
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,440
But still,

429
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,750
we heard you had a very thorough meeting.

430
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,930
Well, well. More or less.

431
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,490
More or less.

432
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,620
I spoke with the High Tension's directors and producers.

433
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,620
There is that sort of thing.

434
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,200
Well, I'm a little sick, but

435
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,800
I'm not sure if I can do High Tension, so I'm worried...

436
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,300
Ah, we understand.

437
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,070
But, you saw everyone, they all have that feeling.

438
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,160
But everyone's been very good.

439
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,160
Excuse me.

440
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,980
Yes, what is it?

441
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,540
Please laugh a little more when you talk.

442
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,240
Please laugh more.

443
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,200
How much are you getting paid?

444
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,350
The amount? It's amazing, isn't it?

445
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,780
What the heck are you doing?!!

446
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,320
My nail came off.

447
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,390
What's funny about that?!!

448
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,250
Please go on standby.

449
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,360
Ok, got it.

450
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,390
What's funny about a nail coming off?

451
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,390
They're his senior.

452
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,790
It's because they're his senior.

453
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,790
They're senior.

There's more?

529
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,890
Yes, there's still more.

530
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,140
Ah, he's found something.

531
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,450
You're not Hamada-san.

532
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,930
It's continuing. This is continuing.

533
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,590
He's an imposter.

534
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,220
He's an imposter.

535
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,760
Who are you?

536
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:31,260
You... ah, you're ***'s kid!

537
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:37,200
Alright, he's dead.

538
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,240
He's dead. He's dead.

Happy birthday.

543
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,480
This isn't High Tension at all.

544
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,330
It's normal. It's normal.

545
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,660
This isn't High Tension.

546
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,520
What a face.

547
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,930
I don't understand this emotion.

548
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,130
It's the belly part.

549
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,130
It's the belly part.

550
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,900

Is it alright if I eat more?

554
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,070
Not at all!

555
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,740
He's mad.

556
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,110
That hurt him.

557
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,280
I'm shocked.

558
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,850
We're sisters after all.

559
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,150
You're my little sister.

560
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,660
This is nonsense.

561
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,920
Nonsense.

562
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,670
Happy birthday!

563
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,870
Is that good, Hamada-san?

564
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,900
No good.

565
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,000
You're kidding?

566
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,270
Alright, thank you very much.

567
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,270
Alright, thank you very much.

568
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,820
Let's take a commemorative photograph.

569
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,550
Okay, pose!

570
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,690
Alright, thank you very much.

571
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,820
Thank you very much.

572
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,600
I've eaten this before.

573
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,590
I have before. I have.

574
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,070
I'm still shallow, huh.

575
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,830
As expect! So cool!
