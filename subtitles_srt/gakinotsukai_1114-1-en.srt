00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,560
Yeah it is

10
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,090
Our Fifth one huh

11
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah its the fifth

12
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,000
An explosion in the middle of the town

13
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:28,230
It looks like i no longer have a place to return to

14
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,570
These are some of the other songs that were written by the genius music producer Yamazaki Hosei

15
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,840
for when you cant reach our hand

16
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,010
Please try and feel this flower of love

17
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,580
we'll change the earth

18
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,190
In the 8 years since this series has started he has produced 13 songs

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,160
its been a while but the Genius actor Yamazaki is now going for his 5th attempt

20
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,000
his attempt at raiding the music industry!!

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,740
this time all the members were given different songs to sing

22
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,000
we've been looking forward to this havn't we?

23
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,300
i guess...

24
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,950
which song did you think was the best to produce?

25
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,900
if i'm being honest the first song sung by endo because he nailed it on the first attempt

26
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,930
seriously?

27
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,690
I nailed it because he thought my rehearsal and rock were both pretty good

28
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,830
you must have done a pretty good job

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,300
I wanted him to do it fairly quick so that his voice didn't get ruined

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,000
he met the image that i had perfectly

31
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,000
Yours?

32
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,000
Mine

33
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,840
I think we should watch Endo's first

34
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,710
I dont mind whos we start with

35
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,710
yeah we should

36
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,610
we should watch Endo's first shouldn't we?

37
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,050
I wanted to slap you so hard right then

38
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,350
a really hard slap at that

39
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,590
Heres the lyrics of the song that you have to sing

40
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,590
The members get to read the song lyrics beforehand

41
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,660
Okay, erm

42
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,530
Shouldnt this be "sung by a woman"? so do i...

43
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,760
you wont sing it like that

44
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,130
i dont sing it like that?

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
shouldn't i sing it in a womans voice so i can express the feelings

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,040
you wont sing it like that

47
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,340
seriously, you wont sing it like that

48
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,340
so i dont sing in a womans voice?

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,000
No

50
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,170
you'll start off like this

51
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,990
If you love me with all of your heart then i'll love you to my hearts content

52
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,260
Stop!

53
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,270
which bit was wrong?

54
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,570
its already perfect!

55
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,620
Its perfect?

56
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,250
Yes

57
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,270
But i havn't even finished singing the song yet

58
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,240
Its will be fine

59
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,740
now go and get changed

60
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,680
Eh?

61
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,180
go and get changed

62
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,780
but i havn't even finished rehearsing all of the song yet

63
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,120
Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

64
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,790
Music producer Yamasaki's raid on the music industry!

65
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,960
Heres the Rock tune written by Yamasaki and is being performed by Endo

66
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,710
Eh?

67
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,210
Its me

68
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,210
Thats you?

69
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,740
Discipline 2012

70
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,710
Why the hell are you wearing that?

71
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,780
The producer chose it not me

72
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:33,890
I had the bad habit of starting to run but not being able to stop

73
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:40,180
when i seen you on your bike all night again

74
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:46,370
Your sweat, Your positive vibrations and Your lips

75
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,910
all make my hips, my breath and my heart go numb

76
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,910
Please love me with all your heart just this once

77
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,780
i'll do whatever you like if you do love me

78
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,400
From when i was a child i dreamed that i'd become somebody's plaything

79
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,500
What the hell are you saying?

80
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,300
This isn't a song about me

81
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,800
Whats with these weird lyrics?

82
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,400
This is how the girl feels

83
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,140
Please love me with all of your heart Tetla Pot

84
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,320
You and me will Dance all night without any limits

85
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:44,000
From when i was a child i dreamed that i'd become somebody's plaything

86
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,730
What the hell are you saying?

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,050
It was their dream from when they were a kid

88
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,940
from when they were a kid

89
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,240
To be loved by Tetla Pot

90
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,040
sure was a long dance for the end

91
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,000
your face looks a bit rough there

92
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,110
So thats how it is

93
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,810
Thank you very much!

94
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,680
that was done on the first attempt

95
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780
just one attempt

96
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
thats impressive!

97
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,690
theres some weird lyrics did you have a clue what it was about?

98
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,000
not really, i just knew it was basically a girls song

99
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,420
Thats right, heres the lyrics

100
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,890
"from when i was child i only wanted to be somebody's plaything"

101
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,130
it might be considered normal for a man to say something like this

102
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,400
but a bit strange if it came from a woman

103
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,710
if you take a look at the title that i chose, it is Discipline 2012

104
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,580
My image of Endo singing this song was that he was being disciplined

105
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,040
so Endo was being disciplined by singing this song?

106
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,270
So the singing was me being disciplined?

107
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,420
it was, Endo was being disciplined by singing a woman's song

108
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
wait a second

109
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,560
So was Endo supposed to be a man or a woman?

110
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,990
he was a man

111
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,000
wait a sec, seriously?

112
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,760
yes

113
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
I understand it now

114
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,000
i had no idea because you never told me,  i was trying to sing it with a more womanly feel

115
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,840
You were being disciplined by being made to sing dressed as a girl

116
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,080
so being dressed as a girl was the discipline?

117
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
what did the bit about tetla pot mean?

118
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,000
well when i first wrote the lyrics here they were different.

119
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,960
this bit actually read " when i first seen you, you rode all night"

120
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,190
the bike was actually me

121
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,560
so you changed the original?

122
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,730
why did you change it?

123
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,770
i thought the lyrics would of been too adult rated

124
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,210
surely whilst you were writing the lyrics

125
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,570
thats one of many things you should of thought about

126
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,510
Endo did a great job on his song

127
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,720
thank you very much

128
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,120
i think theres a lot of places in which you'll think of that song

129
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,550
no need to say it more then once

130
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,950
then lets move on to the next song

131
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,290
eh?

132
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,520
Endo did a good job

133
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,290
Thank you very much

134
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,560
Moving onto our 2nd song is Hamada and Tanachi

135
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,060
so thats how you decided to do it?

136
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,230
thats right

137
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,330
yes its Hamada and me, the two of us

138
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,440
Hamada and tanaka is a combination i'd of never imagined

139
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,940
thats true, they are like water and oil

140
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,810
so this time the 2 us are going to be singing together aren't we?

141
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,380
You're wrong

142
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,900
Are you listening?

143
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,220
Tanaka is obviously best suited to be the guitarist

144
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,560
obviously

145
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,690
So i'm obviously the guitarist?

146
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,690
Yes

147
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,730
And the vocals go to Hamada

148
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,600
Eh?

149
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,130
So we aren't both singing?

150
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,970
No. only you

151
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
I dont want to...

152
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,240
You stop playing around!

153
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,700
its the producers decision

154
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,240
stop with the violence

155
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,240
This will be your guitar

156
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,880
I dont believe this

157
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,310
I dont believe this...

158
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
I seriously thought tanaka would have to sing half of the song

159
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,020
besides the viewers wont want to listen to lyrics like this anyway

160
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,360
i think you're right about that

161
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,760
"wont want to listen to this"

162
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,830
Everybody will be saying it, everybody will

163
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,760
all be saying that they dont want to listen to it

164
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,830
please stop saying that

165
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,530
that comes from the deaths of hell

166
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,540
i'll break through

167
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,280
from here you get ready

168
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,650
this is your big scene

169
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,350
my big scene?

170
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,000
you start playing

171
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,290
a guitar solo?

172
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I knew you two could do it

173
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
I'm not sure if i got some of the timing right

174
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,300
No, no, no it was fine

175
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,500
so it was alright?

176
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,240
Now go and get changed

177
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,000
eh?

178
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,740
eh?

179
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,810
go and get changed

180
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,410
hes got to be kidding

181
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,480
that was quick

182
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:01,110
Hamada doing the singing and Tanaka on the guitar its time to watch Producer Yamasaki's Greatest Rock Unit

183
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:27,570
The red sun that is burning my skin

184
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:35,910
the black ground that looks like it comes from the depths of hell

185
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,860
i'll break through

186
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:52,630
i''ll make you tremble like a puppy caught in the midst of a storm

187
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,630
i'll put you wounded on a cross with only my blade made of glass

188
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:02,650
i'll Aim for his heart and Lock in down

189
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,950
i seriously wouldnt want to listen to this

190
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:25,530
in your dreams i'll make you laugh at my stories whilst i fight against my wicked opponents

191
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,000
i'll put you wounded on a cross with only my blade made of glass

192
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,780
i'll Aim for his heart and Lock in down Hi!!!!

193
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,750
who are you supposed to be?

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
i didn't understand a single bit of that song

195
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,200
yeah it was a little strange

196
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
tanaka did a little singing aswell didnt he?

197
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,550
thats right

198
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,460
a little

199
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,930
I thought they should both sing during the guitar solo

200
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,940
but we thought we'd be singing half the song each

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,210
thats what we thought initially

202
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,670
i never wanted you two to sing half each

203
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,710
i didn't have a clue what i was hearing

204
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,120
it just sounded like he was singing a bunch of katakana

205
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,280
what did you just say Endo?

206
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,180
a lot of katakana

207
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,690
his ears are useless

208
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,000
heres that bunch of katakana

209
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,730
but there isn't that much is there?

210
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,610
well theres this DaDa DiDi Da-Da

211
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,760
but that isnt Katakana

212
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,760
its English

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
its written in English

214
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,050
its written in English but

215
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,030
most people can convert it into katakana

216
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,470
well most people but Endo

217
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,000
Thanks...

218
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,780
After the thickness of Hamada's vocals

219
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,380
when he was singing you could feel his Strong aura

220
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,750
in front of other men

221
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,550
You're overdoing it

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,770
yeah

223
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,000
so thats what vocal thickess is

224
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,790
well i dont think anybody at home had seen something quite like that before

225
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,830
me niether

226
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
we should move onto the 3rd song

227
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
which is sung by Matsumoto

228
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,130
we've heard both of your songs now but i think mine could have most likely

229
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,400
surpassed both of them

230
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,450
oh really?

231
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:12,770
you feel that way?

232
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,010
i think so

233
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,150
i think his singings matured a lot from last time

234
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,090
lets watch it

235
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,440
Okay

236
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,550
Now lets enjoy listening to Matsumoto's song

237
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,850
Erm... how do you feel?

238
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,120
I'll do it this as many times as it takes

239
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,190
ah thank you!

240
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,730
but if i cant put my heart into this

241
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,730
or if i fail to remember any of the lyrics

242
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,460
no, you'll be fine

243
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,530
or something like that...

244
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,830
you and me have been working closely for 25 years

245
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,300
you should try and sum it all up...

246
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,510
you mean my feelings towards you?

247
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,120
yes

248
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,280
it think it would cause a big problem if those feelings came out

249
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,240
no, no

250
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,550
but thats why...

251
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,000
everybody watching would be shocked at what came out

252
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,250
it wont be like that

253
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:01,000
and thats when i turned around and saw you

254
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,890
and then from here your main part starts

255
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,860
to start you should let out whatever emotions you are feeling

256
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,330
just let out whatever comes to mind

257
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,370
just like that!

258
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,510
yes, yes, yes. not so cold, not that cold

259
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,110
thats pretty good

260
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,550
that was seriously cold

261
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,750
it wasnt cold, it was alright

262
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,660
didn't you say i could do whatever i felt after the bit with the wo, wo, yeah, yeah?

263
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,560
i did

264
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,830
then dont go saying things like "its alright, its alright, not that cold"

265
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,730
it makes me think that you dont like it

266
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,200
it makes me think " oh hes calling it bad"

267
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,270
not at alll

268
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,670
Thank you

269
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,780
1,2,3,4 and then Thank you

270
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:54,990
Thank you

271
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,140
just like that!

272
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,510
as you say it you should be looking directly at the cameraman

273
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,820
and who am i saying this to exactly?

274
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
that would be your wife

275
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,090
this just seems unnecessary, this makes it too embarrassing you fool

276
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,030
Matsumoto singing a ballad for the one that he loves

277
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,300
this has the same feel to it as last time

278
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,200
same smoke affect as before

279
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,840
i didn't expect the set to be so similar to last times

280
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,440
this looks so embarassing

281
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,390
this was so awward

282
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,480
i bet it was

283
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:46,220
as i wandered around the middle of the town, i was walking, walking alone

284
00:14:48,630 --> 00:15:02,230
as i walked in the darkness only wanting some light, i was walking, walking alone

285
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:10,950
and then, just as i  could no longer withstand this constant sense of loneliness

286
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:19,160
i turned around and saw you

287
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:58,990
Thank You for telling me just how you felt

288
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:05,940
but just seeing your smile was enough for me

289
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,380
Thank you

290
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,250
Thank you

291
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,330
I'm glad i chose that song for him

292
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,160
was the final thank you on the lyrics sheet?

293
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,260
no that was Ad Lib wasn't it?

294
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,700
dont be so stupid

295
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,100
i seriously didnt want to do that bit

296
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
i remember thinking "I'm going to retire from the show"

297
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,710
retiring from the show?

298
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,610
it doesn't look like that long a song

299
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,650
whats the purpose of this bit?

300
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,390
these are just the words that i sang

301
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,990
it makes the song more fun

302
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,250
i just told him to sing "whatever he feels like"

303
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,290
you liar

304
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,230
for that part?

305
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,700
i told him to do whatever he feels like and then suddenly "ieieie" came out

306
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,800
that must of been the big problem he was talking about

307
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,440
lets move on, this is too embarassing

308
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
this was a song that not many people have seen before i'm sure

309
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,410
next up is our final song which has all of us singing together

310
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,290
everybody singing together, are you sure it will be alright?

311
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,030
i'm sure that this time we'll make a song that nobody will want to listen to

312
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,830
so far all the songs with all of us singing

313
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
no matter how many times i hear it i dont want to listen to it

314
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,270
Anyway, please get ready to start

315
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,210
we'll start with your standing positions

316
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,840
on this mic will be Matsumoto and Hamada

317
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,140
on this one will be me and Tanaka

318
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,780
Endo, you'll be on the drums

319
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:52,750
I'll be on the drums?

320
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,380
can you even play the drums?

321
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,280
not at all

322
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,250
yes you can

323
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,150
i can?

324
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,220
i'll be playing the drums?

325
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,120
yes

326
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,390
it will be impressive if he can drum and sing at the same time

327
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,190
we'll sing together until after Verse A

328
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,230
which part is that? i dont get it

329
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
sing until  "connected to our chewing gum"

330
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,540
and then Matsumoto

331
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,740
you sing it by yourself!?

332
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
yes

333
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,740
why does he sing his own name?

334
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,270
well it makes sense that in our song we say our own names

335
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,270
but they might think i am singing about Matsumoto Iyo-Chan

336
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,180
it just seems pointless

337
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,890
dont call it pointless!

338
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,160
this here is important

339
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:39,790
Tanaka, you'll be chewing on this throughout the song

340
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,330
you'll be chewing on this

341
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,940
and then after the shout at the end you'll blow a bubble

342
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,140
after the shout?

343
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,000
yes, you'll blow a bubble

344
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,040
another amusing part for Tanaka, you should just go and form a solo band

345
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,910
i'd like to see that

346
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,550
we are all connected to our chewing gum

347
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,260
he messed up again

348
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,490
it'll be impossible for us to finish at this rate

349
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,090
what the hell are you doing?

350
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,630
everytime you've messed up a little bit

351
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,930
what the hell?

352
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,740
it wasn't really that funny

353
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,010
i didn't think it was

354
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,170
it wasn't really that funny

355
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:31,210
Orange Cocorico Lemon Yamasa...

356
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,520
you messed up again

357
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,000
can you explain this bit to me?

358
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,620
we cant tell who should sing which part

359
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,890
who is supposed to sing this part?

360
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,550
who should sing this column?

361
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Downtown should sing "Downtown Orange"

362
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,970
and then Cocorico sings until Lemon

363
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,830
and then i sing the next part

364
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,870
Downtown Orange

365

369
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,750
i don't understand any of it

370
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,680
we are all connected to our chewing gum

371
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,090

373
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,100

389
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,080
as we all take off laughing loudly

390
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,590
trying to see how large the bubbles can go

391
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,170
that was a good shout wasn't it?

392
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,180
harder then it looks isnt it?

393
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,480
it didn't look that bad

394
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,180
you reallly enjoyed that didn't you?

395
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,420
thats a long reaction

396
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,860

00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,390

398
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,100
my stomach hurts!

399
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,440
you enjoyed watching that back

400
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,140
yes i did

401
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,610
that was pretty good wasn't it?

402
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,410
you decided to call it Gaki no Tskuai ya Arahende?

403
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,240
thats right

404
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:54,850
before this we had an amazing song that went "ah Matsumoto-san"

405
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
it was this one wasn't it?

406
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,120
i remember it

407
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,460
that was 6 years ago

408
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,960
that song was actually called Gaki no Tsukai but in English

409
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,330
so thats what it means

410
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,000
and this time i decided to do the same thing but keep it in Japanese

411
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
you put a lot of thought into it didn't you?

412
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,670
yes

413
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,740
you just dropped the history of our songs

414
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,170
and now you cant pick it up

415
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,850
its not as if you need to use it anymore

416
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,000
thats true

417
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,450
so far i have produced 17 songs

418
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,090
so everybody please support them

419
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,160
but its not like our vocals were that good...

420
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:40,130
so please support us by searching this and watching all the songs

421
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,110
is there anything else we have to do?

422
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,520
no, we can go

423
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
everybody worked hard
