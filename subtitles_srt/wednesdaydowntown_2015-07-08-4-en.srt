TYPESET & TRANSLATION BY SHION (@FGRNDNOISES)

3
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,280
For our next theory I wanna talk about conspiracy theories

4
00:00:01,980 --> 00:09:55,270
SHIONNOTSUKAI.WORDPRESS.COM

5
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:12,260
They're all over the internet, but they're mostly groundless

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,960
And that's how their rumors often end

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,260
But among them...

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,900
There's a theory which isn't a distortion, it's a terrible truth

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,630
And I'm here tonight...

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,630
- Really?

11
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,640
To present it to you

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,770
What? Is this ok?

13
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,040
The theory I've brought with me

14
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,870
Is this:

15
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,210
Theory: Matsumoto Hitoshi is a Russian spy

16
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,380
I'm already calling bullshit on it

17
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,580
I'm already calling bullshit on it

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,320
And the audience is already like "ehhh?!"

19
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,990
Is that Toshi from X Japan?

20
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,220
They're like "you are whaaaat?"

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,990
Didn't know we had Toshi here

22
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,630
Who cares about that

23
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,730
I've misjudged you... you filthy traitor!

24
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,860
I've misjudged you... you filthy traitor!

25
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,870
You're a spy from Russia, aren't you?!

26
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,870
"Filthy traitor"...?

27
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:54,870
Of course you are

28
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,400
What the--?

29
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,140
Doing whatever you want in the showbiz

30
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,470
Tricking us all

31
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,270
What are you trying to bring to Mother Russia?

32
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,040
I'm not Russian

33
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,810
Stop playing dumb

34
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,650
I've brought with me lots of evidence

35
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,150
Really?

36
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,850
Let's verify them together

37
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,880
Scary...

38
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,750
Let's start with this song, please listen

39
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:21,530
Coming up...

40
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:21,530
The real meaning hidden inside the song "Chicken Rice"

41
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,220
Coming next

42
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,690
The real meaning behind "Chicken Rice" will become clear

43
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,690
Man, this is freakin' scary!

44
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,400
Let's start with this song, please listen

45
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:37,640
"Chicken Rice", written by Matsumoto Hitoshi

46
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:37,640
Screw the Akasaka Prince Hotel...

47
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,170
What about it?

48
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,640
As I thought, I'm still alright with just chicken rice

49
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,110
So, you know this is a Christmas song written by Matsumoto

50
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:39,740
- What about it?

51
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,850
- Yeah, what?

52
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,110
- It's such a good song

53
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:42,550
Yes...

54
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,850
Such a good song, that's what I used to think

55
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,180
Such a good song, that's what I used to think

56
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,820
But there's actually a hidden message in this song's lyrics

57
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,420
Added by Matsumoto himself

58
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,320
Really?

59
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,260
Let's start with this song's title, "Chicken Rice"...

60
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,260
"Chicken" can also mean "Coward"

61
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:21,350
ChickenwwwwwRice

62
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:21,350
Coward

63
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,860
While "rice" is "kome" in japanese

64
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,800
Kanji for "rice"

65
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,130
And the kanji for "kome" appears in "beikoku"

66
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,140
In other words, "U.S.A."

67
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:21,350
Beikoku (U.S.A.)

68
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,770
I see...

69
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,770
It's about U.S.A., not rice, folks

70
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,880
This song you've listened for all these years...

71
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,040
Is actually

72
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,210
A diss track in which he claims the U.S.A. are cowards

73
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,850
That's the truth

74
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,850
Now you know it

75
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,650
Open your eyes, army of Japan

76
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,620
No way, no way

77
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,520
Not only that

78
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
He also wrote "screw Akasaka"

79
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:39,470
Screw Akasaka

80
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,820
Yeah, what about it?

81
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,830
And do you know what's in Akasaka?

82
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,760
The U.S. Embassy

83
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:39,470
U.S. Embassy
Minato ward, Akasaka district 1

84
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,870
In other words, he's implying we should destroy the U.S.A.

85
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,470
"Let's gain control over the U.S.A.!"

86
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,930
Scary!

87
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,470
This is incredible

88
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,640
Do you see it now?

89
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,470
Amazing!

90
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,370
But that's not all

91
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,640
You know December the 25th is Christmas

92
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:51,650
Chicken Rice is a Christmas song (December the 25th)

93
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:51,650
December the 25th

94
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,140
But in Russia that's not it

95
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,440
Really?

96
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,310
On 25/12/1991 the Soviet Union collapsed

97
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,650
Foundation day of the Russian Federation

98
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,210
And the Russian Federation was founded

99
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,080
This song is praising that

100
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,580
Everything matches, it can't be just a coincidence

101
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,590
Everything matches, it can't be just a coincidence

102
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,390
He's making all these coincidences match!

103
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,390
I'm not buying that

104
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,360
That's sly

105
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,830
But this is not the only song by Matsumoto with hidden meanings

106
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:03,830
- Eh?!

107
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,730
Please, listen

108
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,570
Oh my

109
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:16,610
Ugly

110
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,470
This is the rap part, huh?

111
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,310
Yes

112
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,680
This is Hamada's big hit song

113
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,980
"WOW WAR TONIGHT"

114
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,350
It's also the only song featuring Matsumoto, and has this mysterious code

115
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,620
But it's not a code

116
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,360
At a glance, it may seem it spells "ugly Hamada"

117
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,560
Ugly

118
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,990
But if you change the order...

119
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,620
Huh?

120
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,660
It's getting creepy

121
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,030
Big explosion

122
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,300
It reads "U.S.A., big explosion, M"

123
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:56,350
(Matsumoto)

124
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:56,350
Big explosion

125
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,200
The "M" stands for "Matsumoto"

126
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,770
You can't do this to me

127
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,840
Man, this is freakin' scary!

128
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,170
It's a secret code

129
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,710
It's freaking me out

130
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,040
You're part of a terrorist group, aren't you?

131
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,310
You suck!

132
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,350
Gimme a break, I'm getting scared here

133
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,880
Scary scary scary

134
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,850
Shocking
- Now...

135
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,350
These are not the only things which connect Matsumoto to Russia

136
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,490
Take a look at the following pictures

137
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,490
The picture on the left side is the protagonist

138
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,630
Of Matsumoto's first movie, "Big Man Japan"

139
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:20,270
"Big Man Japan" - Daisato Masaru

140
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,030
On the right side, it's a statue in Russia

141
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,830
Called "The Motherland Calls"

142
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,270
Russia's "The Motherland Calls"

143
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,040
Two peas in a pod!

144
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,270
This statue is very important to Russian people

145
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,170
Who knew that?!

146
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:24,280
And look at them: they're identical!

147
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:30,480
"Big Man Japan"

148
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:30,480
"The Motherland Calls"

149
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:30,480
Daisato Masaru

150
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:30,480
Russia's

151
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,280
That's nonsense

152
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,410
You can definitely tell he used it as a model for his character

153
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,480
Really?

154
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,820
They're really the same

155
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,850
Have you really deceived us all?

156
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,090
This is bad, really

157
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,320
This is gonna get me in trouble

158
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,320
- You're the bad guy here

159
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,960
His love for Russia appears in other works too, not only music or movies

160
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,060
Even in his skits!

161
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,760
The fuck is wrong with you? Geez

162
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,700
The fuck is wrong with you? Geez

163
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,700
Watch you language?!

164
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,900
I don't care you're my senpai, you spy!

165
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,870
I don't care you're my senpai, you spy!

166
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,070
Spy! Spy! Spy!

167
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,910
He's a spy...

168
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,370
My "love for Russia"?

169
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,880
Please, take a look at this

170
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,710
What now?

171
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,980
Kathy Tsukamoto

172
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,410
This is a famous skit from Gottsu Ee Kanji, "Kathy Tsukamoto"

173
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,950
I love this one

174
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,320
Yeah, we all laughed at this

175
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,110
Me too!

176
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,220
How is this--?

177
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,090
In this series, Kathy always ends up making a mess while cooking

178
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,090
That's right

179
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,520
What about Russia?

180
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,920
There's an episode in which you can witness his loyalty to Russia

181
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,490
We have a video proof for that, take a look:

182
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,460
Today we're making boršč

183
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,560
Oh, boršč... like the russian one, right?

184
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,430
That's correct

185
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,970
But you know, there are lots of types of boršč

186
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,240
So much that I have no idea which one I should do

187
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,470
I thought about it and yeah, let's not make boršč today

188
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,470
- Sure

189
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,840
So... you won't do it?

190
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Correct

191
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,080
Consider this:

192
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,780
This skit is made of a total of 16 episodes

193
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,050
The only time where he never touched anything was during the boršč episode

194
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,280
The only time where he never touched anything was during the boršč episode

195
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,390
The only time where he never touched anything was during the boršč episode

196
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,420
I see!

197
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,390
In every other episode, he made a mess

198
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,220
Yeah, he threw stuff around
- He always made a mess

199
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,990
He didn't touch anything only when it was about boršč

200
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,160
He didn't touch anything only when it was about boršč

201
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,500
That's a sign of respect for Russia

202
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,500
- Makes sense

203
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,630
Scary stuff

204
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,430
This proves he can't make comedy out of his beloved Russia's traditional cuisine

205
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,870
This proves he can't make comedy out of his beloved Russia's traditional cuisine

206
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,640
There is evidence in some of his books too, take a look:

207
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,340
This is Matsumoto's "Visualbum"

208
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,250
They're compilations of original skits by him

209
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,250
As you can see, each jacket

210
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,990
Features a different fruit

211
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,860
In order: apple, banana and grape

212
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:33,810
Apple

213
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:33,810
Banana

214
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:33,810
Grape

215
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,160
Yes

216
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,490
What comes after red and yellow, usually?

217
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,360
Just who would pick purple?!

218
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,630
What about that?

219
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,760
It's apple, banana and grape

220
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,730
Matsumoto, why did you choose them?

221
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,300
Just tell us

222
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,470
I--- I just took some fruit

223
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,810
And lined 'em up there

224
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,870
Such a stone-cold lie

225
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,140
Even colder than a Russian winter

226
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,910
Even colder than a Russian winter

227
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,680
Take a look at this:

228
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,020
Apple

229
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,020
Banana

230
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,020
Grape

231
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,020
Russia's most imported fruit in quantity:

232
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,020
These are Russia's most imported fruit

233
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:54,990
Apple

234
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:54,990
Banana

235
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:54,990
Grape

236
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:54,990
Russia's top 3 imported fruit in quantity:

237
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,220
It's apples, bananas and grapes

238
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,750
Incredible!

239
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,950
He's a spy!

240
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,460
Unbelievable

241
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,860
He's definitely a spy

242
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,560
Just admit it already

243
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,260
No doubts

244
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,500
We're not even talking about exports here, it's about imports

245
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,270
Did anyone know that? Only he knew that!

246
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,540
No, that's my first time hearing that

247
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,540
Did anyone know that? Only he knew that!

248
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,540
- Imports? Incredible

249
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,440
He knows because that's what he used to eat in Russia

250
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,170
That's the hidden message

251
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,240
Man, that's scary
- I'm shocked

252
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,310
What do you think, Ogi?

253
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,310
Well, usually in tv dramas

254
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,550
When they say "you're a spy!" to someone, this person laughs

255
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,150
Or sometimes they drink poison or such

256
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,690
It just feels like this right now

257
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:24,590
Hey

258
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,660
Did you just try to drink poison?

259
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,160
He's a spy...

260
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,030
However...

261
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,130
Matsumoto is actually being controlled by the real mastermind

262
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,770
Matsumoto is actually being controlled by the real mastermind

263
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,330
Matsumoto is actually being controlled by the real mastermind

264
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:40,410
Who's the mastermind behind Matsumoto the spy?

265
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,200
You mean someone is pulling his strings?

266
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,410
In other words I've been hired?

267
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,410
- Yes

268
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,010
However...

269
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,780
Matsumoto is actually being controlled by the real mastermind

270
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,480
Matsumoto is actually being controlled by the real mastermind

271
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,750
Matsumoto is actually being controlled by the real mastermind

272
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,750
You mean someone is pulling his strings?

273
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,680
In other words I've been hired?

274
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:51,680
- Yes

275
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,880
And that person...

276
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,350
Is YOU!!

277
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,320
That caught me off guard

278
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,960
It's you!!

279
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,120
Wasn't expecting this

280
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,760
Me?

281
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,090
This is the scariest part

282
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,800
What are you talking about?

283
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,500
I've been laughing the entire time

284
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,530
I have a strong suspicion you might be a Russian spy too

285
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,270
Take a look at this picture:

286
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:15,840
Osaka's Expo'70, USSR Pavilion

287
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,840
This is a picture from the USSR Pavilion for Osaka's 1970 Expo

288
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,510
There it is!

289
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,840
Mh? What's that?

290
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,270
I knew it

291
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,310
And what was your father's job during this year, Hamada?

292
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,180
Well

293
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,610
He was a building painter

294
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,610
Correct

295
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,650
We also know for sure

296
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,480
That your father painted the USSR Pavilion

297
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,890
That your father painted the USSR Pavilion

298
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,760
That proves Hamada's family has always been connected to the USSR

299
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,760
What the hell?!

300
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,830
This one makes more sense to me

301
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,530
They're definitely connected

302
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,900
That would grant him special access, right?

303
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,830
He painted it 'cause it was his job

304
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,970
Think about it:

305
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,600
Matsumoto has been downgraded to a Russian spy

306
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,800
Matsumoto has been downgraded to a Russian spy

307
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,800
Downgraded, now?!

308
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,410
There's no way a guy born in Amagasaki could become a Russian spy

309
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,610
He needed some kind of connection

310
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,940
And that connection was Hamada and his dad

311
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,780
Who were already connected with the USSR

312
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,380
In other words, Downtown...

313
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,380
- This is crazy...

314
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,050
Is a Russian spies comedy duo

315
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,820
Russian Spies Comedy Duo

316

319
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,590
Scary!

320
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,820
Chilling!

321
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,860
Do you feel relieved now?

322
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,720
Makes sense...

323
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,860
Feeling relieved?!

324
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,790
I mean, you've always been on TV bearing this feeling of guilt

325
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,430
You should thank me

326
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,600
You should at least say Спасибо to me

327
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,600
thanks

328
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,600
Wait a sec

329
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,640
How could I even do all those things to begin with?!

330
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,100
Yeah, right

331
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,210
With that being said...

332
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,910
All of this was just a farce

333
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,710
But just like this...

334
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,350
It's pretty easy to get lured by rumors or urban legends

335
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,350
It's pretty easy to get lured by rumors or urban legends

336
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,810
It's pretty easy to get lured by rumors or urban legends

337
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,650
It's pretty easy to get lured by rumors or urban legends

338
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,620
So you should always be careful while surfing the web

339
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,690
Today I'm ending it with my own awareness program​

340
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,190
Today I'm ending it with my own awareness program​

341
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,190
What the hell is this finale?!

342
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,120
I just thought about it

- Of course

00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,260
What the hell is this ending? I hate it

351
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,730
Don't worry, I don't think you two are spies

352
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,730
Rest assured

353
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,500
So unpleasant...
