Protect the earth? We can't even protect our own arses

97
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,560
Protect the earth? We can't even protect our own arses

98
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,120
That's true.

99
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Yours, right?

100
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,120
Yes, that's right.

101
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,890
You were defeated.

102
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,730
We were supposed to be a force.

103
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,730
We couldn't protect anything.

104
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,590
Your ass just finished, didn't it?

105
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,860
Your ass just finished, didn't it?

106
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,200
I literally heard my arse just 'end'.

107
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,860
I literally heard my arse just 'end'.

108
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,670
Yeah, really.

109
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,470
It just went "PE~NNNNNN"!!

110
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,500
It said "pe~n"

111
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,670
It said "pe~n"

112
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,540
My ass just 'ended'

113
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,410
At 50 years old my ass has just given up

114
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,670
I don't understand.

115
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,210
We are going to begin now, Matsumoto-san.

116
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,480

122
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,730
When the sunrise colors the sky ...

123
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,530
the trees are awakening...

124
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,140
beginning

125
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,770
they symbolize a beginning.

126
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,200
Will there be a filming site?

127
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,610
I've heard that there will be rockets.

128
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,470
"Wait right here" is what it says.

129
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,980
Those signs pisses me off

130
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,480
Oh, this?

131
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,310
It could say "please wait" or "could you wait here".

132
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,820
Wait here!!

133
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,820
This is more of a demand

134
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,580
At this point, I've already lost interest in doing this shoot

135
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,690
At this point, I've already lost interest in doing this shoot

136
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,990
My interest flew away.

137
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,320
You've started it by just moaning!

138
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,160
We all know that person will show up anyway.

139
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,230
Yes, that's right.

140
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,330
That person will come, won't he?

141
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,990
It seems like it.

142
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,100
HEE~Y!!

143
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,930
Ugh ... Something is coming.

144
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,860
It's coming.

145
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,400
It's coming.

146
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,230
It's coming.

147
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,300
Look at him, look at his speed.

148
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,900
Yes, I see.

149
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,370
He's not a celebrity.

150
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,610
Did he lose a little weight?

151
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,910
Yes, he looks a bit thinner.

152
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,870
Yes.

153
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,340
His face hasn't changed though

154
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,810
*we filmed with special permission

155
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,810
You stopped awfully far away from us

156
00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:01,250
Downtown previous manager

157
00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:01,250
Fujiwara Hiroshi

158
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,050
He can come closer

159
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:57,980
Yes, that would've been good.

160
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,950
Good morning everyone!

161
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,960
In the neighboring city's supermarket

162
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,030
In the neighboring city's supermarket

163
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,030
there was an early morning time sale

164
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,060
I went to the sale by speeding on a mom's-bicycle

165
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,870
Hey Tanaka-!!

166
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,740
How many people do you think this food can feed?

167
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,340
We can't hear .. helicopter ..

168
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,610
Helicopter is flying very close by.

169
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,540
Mid-air distance

170
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,450
Can you please come forward?

171
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,650
Oh, you mean us?

172
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,480
The helicopter is right above us.

173
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,580
It's amazing, it's so difficult to hear.

174
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,120
Has this ever happened?

175
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,890
Hey Tanaka-!!

176
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,090
Yes.

177
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,060
How many people do you think this food can feed?

178
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,590
There's quite a bit ...

179
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,800
About 10 people ...

180
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,100
This is all for me

181
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,670
This is all for me

182
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,440
This food all of it is for me by myself

183
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,340
This food all of it is for me by myself

184
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,370
This food all of it is for me by myself

185
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,740
Why do you say that twice?

186
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,810
That makes me laugh!!

187
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,780
What the hell are you saying?

188
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,350
We're gonna do it this year, too!

189
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,250
What the hell ...

190
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,020
Hamada

191
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,580
Yes.

192
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,650
I came by mom-bicyle so

193
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,650
you may slightly feel something

194
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,620
What do you think this year's theme is?

195
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,660
You can't really tell..

196
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,400
Is it grocery store?

197
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,400
Hell no!!

198
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,560
This year's theme is Earth Defense Force!

199
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,370
This year's theme is Earth Defense Force!

200
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,600
Then don't ask!

201
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,370
That has nothing to do with the bicycle.

202
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,640
Challenge for 24 hours of duty!!

203
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,640
Newly Recruited members of the Defense Force

204
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,740
The five men are newly recruited Defense Force members

205
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,480
they endure 24 hours of brutal duty.

206
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,620
one person has a troublesome issue ...

207
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,110
But, there is one person who has a troublesome issue ..

208
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,150
But, there is one person who has a troublesome issue ..

209
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,220
Yamasaki  you went through a name-change

210
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,080
Yes.

211
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,490
Yamasaki you went through a name-change

212
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,850
Ah yes, thank you very much.

213
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,820
What was the name again?

214
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,760
It is  Tsukitei Housei

215
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,660
What the hell is that? No one knows that.

216
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,230
What the hell is that? No one knows that.

217
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,900
It hasn't become popular yet.

218
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,200
Yes.

219
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,140
Uhm ... That

220
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,140
....That

221
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
At an important time.

222
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,940
Seriously?

223
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,040
It's quick.

224
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,010
Should we try once more from the top?  (The script.)

225
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,080
His new name's unpopularity with the public

226
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,680
It makes me laugh a lot!!

227
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:19,720
even though recognition is extremely low, he will participate as "tsukitei housei"

228
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:19,720
the problem with Yamasaki's name change

229
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,050
I really don't understand.

230
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,790
Well we can't do anything about it

231
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,390
He makes me mad

232
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,060
The recognition really is low.

233
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,090
so you're gonna go as Housei!

234
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,860
Yes.

235
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,230
By the way, you guys ..

236
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,160
I told you that you're part of the Earth Defense Force

237
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,160
but why are you dressed like that!?

238
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,600
Isn't it weird?

239
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,230
What

240
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,400
I have your change of clothes

241
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,530
in those boxes over there

242
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,040
so I'm gonna have you change right now.

243
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,300
Ahh, we're changing clothes again.

244
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,240
Before Earth Defense Duties

245
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,240
Change into appropriate outfits

246
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,100
With that reasoning

247
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,440
they will change into the appropriate outfits.

248
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,450
Okay everyone, when you're ready

249
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,250
I'm going to have you come out one by one

250
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,750
Yes!

251
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,590
So cool.

252
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:53,730
Macho-Papa Soldier

253
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,460
Thank you.

254
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,720
It looks nice.

255
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,260
The titles are unnecessary.

256
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,060
Yes, that's right.

257
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:54,990
Housei!

258
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,560
Yes.

259
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,730
What is the point of it?

260
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,270
Selfishly changed his name-member

261
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,100
It's pretty cute.

262
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,670
Your legs are also showing.

263
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,370
Thank you.

264
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,800
Hopefully you'll be

265
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,000
a tasteful member.

266
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,200
Yes.

267
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:06,970
Yes!

268
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,480
You're definitely handsome and cool.

269
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:15,280
Handsome Baseball-freak member

270
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,010
Thank you.

271
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,210
You'll be well-liked by women.

272
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,150
Hopefully you'll be a very well-liked member.

273
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,420
Thank you.

274
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:18,850
Yes!

275
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:28,630
Lanky Pointy-Chin   member

276
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,220
You're so lanky.

277
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,820
You need to gain weight.

278
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,320
The pointy-chin was unneeded.

279
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,830
Hopefully you will be a strong-willed member.

280
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,360
Alright     Hamada

281
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:41,910
The only woman on the team   member

282
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,570
It looks good!

283
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,570
Why are you a girl?

284
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,210
It's nice!

285
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,070
Why are you a girl?

286
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,870
I'm jealous!

287
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,380
Is that your own wig?

288
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,610
It probably has Hamada's name on it.

289
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,150
It looks so good.

290
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,250
That's definitely your own wig.

291
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,750
I'm going to explain the rules so

292
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,750
form a line up front

293
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,990
You have such nice legs.

294
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,860
You can work it.

295
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,220
You've always had

296
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,590
very nice legs   Hamada-san.

297
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,360
Hamada-san's legs really are pretty.

298
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,330
One! You are members of the Earth Defense Force.

299
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:12,040
You are newly recruited EDF members
going through 24 hours of training

300
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,870
For a whole day, you will do various tasks.

301
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,040
Cough!

302
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,210
Second!

303
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,240
While you are working as EDF members, no matter what happens - absolutely no laughing.

304
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,350
While working, absolutely no laughing

305
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,880
tirth

306
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,710
In the event that you laugh,

307
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,220
you will receive severe punishment on the spot.

308
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,280
that's it.

309
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,360
If you laugh, you will receive severe punishment

310
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,720
Got it?

311
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,860
I understand, but he hasn't been listening at all.

312
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,860
Hamada hasn't.

313
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,990
I'm so cold.

314
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,860
Are you cold?

315
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,330
Because, look-

316
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:43,470
wearing a garter belt ❤

317
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,260
You're wearing a garter ...

318
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,400
You've really done it.

319
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,540
It's very sexy.

320
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,770
You didn't protect at all

321
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:47,710
Yourself.

322
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,570
Yourself.

323
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,810
Yourself.

324
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,780
To get to the EDF headquarters

325
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,780
we will go by bus

326
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,450
Again, a bus ...

327
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,650
A bus.

328
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,150
And it begins when we get on the bus, right?

329
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,150
Ughhh ... I really don't want to.

330
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,360
Healthy Family

331
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,360
Nissei Advance

332
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,360
Sponsors

333
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,350
Is it really a bus?

334
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,760
Are we really going to do this?

335
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,290
We're gonna wait for the bus right here.

336
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:14,300
Tension    Rises

337
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,760
Finally the beginning

338
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,430
whether they like it or not, the tension is rising.

339
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,830
It's here.

340
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,740
It's here.

341
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,770
Hey, it's here.

342
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,510
There's always Kurobikari.

343
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,910
Yes, that's true.

344
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,010
Of course, Kurobikari.

345
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,440
It's here!

346
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,850
Gaasuu Kurobikari Earth Defense Force.

347
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,450
This is the name of the place where you will be working.

348
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,620
Earth Defense Force

349
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,620
Gaasuu  Kurobikari

350
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,450
Isn't it cool?

351
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:39,860
Gaasuu Kurobikari Earth Defense Force

352
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,150
Gaasuu Kurobikari Earth Defense Force

353
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,760
Gaasuu Kurobikari Defense Force of Earth

354
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,090
With importance put on the color red,

355
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,860
in this freshly-designed commuter bus

356
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,930
ölklöklöklöklöklök

357
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,470
Aim for the EDF Headquarters

358
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,370
they will aim for the Earth Defense Force Headquarters

359
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,800
Are we getting on?

360
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,270
We're gonna board

361
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,540
As soon as we board, we can't laugh, right?

362
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,140
the moment you get is when it starts

363
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,910
Oh well, can't do anything about it.

364
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,810
But it begins as soon as we board ...

365
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,880
So if we get on ...

366
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,310
I'm getting on!

367
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,010
It's starting, huh...

368
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,850
Wait... Why are you walking like that?

369
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,750
I was really cold.

370
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,850
Right, I'm getting on!

371
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,680
Lead the way!

372
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,320
Man, so cold...

373
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,020
Here we go!

374
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,360
Do Not Laugh

375
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,360
Do Not Laugh

376
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,360
Do Not Laugh

377
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,360

Wow, it's warm in here

389
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,430
Okay...

390
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,030
Right, let's go!

391
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,700
Okay let's go!

392
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,660
Here we go!

393
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,700
Okay, come on..

394
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,170
Some customers are already on

395
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,270
Man, it's so cold!

396
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,840
Yeah, it really is..

397
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,740
Your helmet will get in the way, so I am just going to take them from you

398
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,810
The helmet will "get in the way"?..

399
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,110
Hahahahahaha

400
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,880
So what is the point in giving them to us?

401
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:38,350
Judge didn't see... Therefore SAFE

402
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,250
Finally, the bus has

403
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,330
Off to the Earth Defence HQ - but what lies ahead....

404
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,920
departed for the Earth Defence Headquarters

405
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,490
but what lies ahead?

406
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:56,100
The bus is on its way to HQ

407
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:56,100
Laughter will NOT be tolerated from here!!

408
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,260
The 5 make their way for HQ

409
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,500
but their laughter will not be tolerated anymore!

410
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,640
Defence Force look like...

411
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,640
Does the actual Earth

412
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,710
well, like this?

413
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,480
Like the fact we're travelling with ordinary people is like...

414
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,570
Yeah...

415
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,810
You're right

416
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,380
Something's definitely not right...

417
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,450
Oh come on, it's not that cold...

418
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,480
He was moaning the whole time!

419
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,620
You guys

420
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,620
get to wear trousers..

421
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,190
You must be warmed up by now in here..

422
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,920
No no no, look at this

423
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:26,800
The woman gets a garter belt as part of their uniform

424
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,300
This was awful...

425
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,900
That is amazing...

426
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,670
That businessman over there just laughed...

427
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,670
That's way too much...

428
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,570
Fujiwara is laughing so much...

429
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,340
He's laughing like "What a Masterpiece"!

430
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,040
Literally his face is like that...

431
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,280
Haha...

432
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,550
You were never getting away with that

433
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,150
You guys were all laughing before me too...

434
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,590
Like 'he-he-he'

435
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,350
No no, I was completely cool...

436
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,090
I was safe

437
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:56,360
4th Rule

438
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:56,360
Black army will

439
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:56,360
smack you on your arse if you laugh

440
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,090
Oh... This again?

441
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,560
Shit, shit, shit...

442
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:53,960
Get him good...

443
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,230
BAM!

444
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,360
BAM!

445
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,160
Get him good...

446
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:57,360
BAM!

447
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,500
BAM!

448
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,370
He got me  right in my face   just now...

449
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,470
HAHAHAHAHA

450
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,840
This can't be allowed...

451
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,480
This was properly...

452
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,140
Bloody hell..

453
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,010
And Endo is going to get another smack!

454
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,380
This was totally ridiculous...

455
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,620
I haven't done anything wrong!

456
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,090
This isn't right!

457
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,150
No, you're right Endo, it's not right...

458
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,260
You agree with me, right?

459
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,320
Ye, that was unfair...

460
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,620
That wasn't fair...

461
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,860
You got hit for no reason...

462
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,260
Yeah

463
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,830
Someone else gets punished and then that hits you in the face... I mean

464
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,100
Someone else gets punished and then that hits you in the face... I mean

465
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:44,310
After this  more traps will make them laugh

466
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:44,310
Laughter from bad luck  is part of this show

467
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,000
An unlucky start...

468
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,440
But that happens in this show

469
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,770
Man, it really has started...

470
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,470
And now the traps to make them laugh

471
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,310
will show themselves...

472
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:49,480
BUS STOP

473
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,980
The door has opened...

474
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,060
Cool guy

475
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,060
Takaoka Saki

476
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,060

Wakabayashi Masayasu

478
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,160
Hey Saki

479
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,460
Yeah?

480
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,590
Have you decided which guy you want to be with?

481
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,490
Oh, he's a "cool guy"?

482
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,960
Those guys , they just don't

483
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,960
appeal that much to me

484
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,430
Hey Saki,

485
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:17,440
2 men are supposedly after Saki

486
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,470
You do realize that you are the brother of Rockabilly

487
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,530
You do realize that you are the brother of Rockabilly

488
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,300
The supposedly "coolest guy's" little sister

489
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,640
The supposedly "coolest guy's" little sister

490
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,770
So don't go out with some loser

491
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,110
I get it, big bro.

492
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,040
But you know...

493
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,110
Those two guys...

494
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,980
They just don't appeal  to me enough

495
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:30,350
Shark Crew

496
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:30,350
Ito Ichiro (from ELT)

497
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,160
Yeah, it's just...

498
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,530
They've planned this well...

499
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,230
I was laughing at the length of his face...

500
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,500
They really put everything into it...

501
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,300
Yeah, they really had...

502
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,570
A really cheesy chat up line

503
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,570
His appeal to Saki

504
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,170
Hey Saki.

505
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,740
Today is the day I'm going to get

506
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,710
Today is the day I'm going to get

507
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,710
a good reaction from you

508
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,380
The only guy

509
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,950
God you can barely hear his voice...

510
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,380
capable of taming a woman like you

511
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,450
is me, you know?

512
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,950
is me, you know?

513
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,590
The volume is...

514
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,790
If you could speak a bit louder...

515
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,290
This is tough, really tough

516
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,490
Oh shit...

517
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,660
It' a little hard to hear...

518
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,700
Well I guess he's not the singer of his band...

519
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,010
Please raise the volume a little bit...

520
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,470
Is it not hard for you

521
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,470
to hear at all?

522
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,010
The only guy who can tame a woman like you...

523
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,810
is me...

524
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,080
Don't be so stupid

525
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,050
I have no intention of going out

526
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,050
with an useless idiot like you at all

527
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,660
Even that guy  would be a better choice than you...

528
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,930
Jet Crew

529
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,930
Tenryu Genichirou

530
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,500
On we go...

531
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,800
Obviously we'll laugh...

532
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,110
He barely managed to get on the bus!

533
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,440
His knee is really dodgy nowadays...

534
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,410
Oh wow...

535
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,820
His appeal to Saki

536
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,820
A really cheesy chat up line

537
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,020
For real...

538
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,750
Hey Saki...

539
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,250
My nickname is

540
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,990
löälöälöälöälöälöälöälöälöälöä

541
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,330
And we're doing a dance off there.

542
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,730
How can we understand that...

543
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,900
What the hell is he saying?

544
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,540
and his voice is quite small too...

545
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,580
Saki prefers this guy?

546
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,310
Hey Tenryu boy, Saki's heart

547
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,580
Hey Tenryu boy, Saki's heart

548
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,580
ain't been strung along by you in the slightest, don't you have anything else?

549
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,680
On top of that,

550
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,120
about this cottage...

551
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,120
even Japan's famous people come there

552
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,590
like Takegawa Crystal...

553
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,590
and Takeshi-Gundan's "Downtown's"...

554
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,430
Umm Takeshi-Gundan's...

555
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,530
Downtown isn't part of Takeshi-Gundan...

556
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,830
Umm... Takegawa...

557
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:58,370
Oh

558
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:58,370
Oh.  Guadalcanal Taka as well

559
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,410
They just took over Downtown...

560
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,550
Okay both of you...

561
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,520
Next is... Whilst dancing

562
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,420
Next is... Whilst dancing

563
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,190
Give Saki your best chat up line

564
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,290
and win her heart over

565
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:27,400
Dance and chat her up with their best line

566
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:27,400
Their appeal to Saki

567
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,290
You have both prepared well for this, I hope?

568
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,430
Obviously...

569
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,360
How about you, Tenryu?

570
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,430
öä#öä##öäöääö

571
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,000
Ok Mister Ito, you're up first

572
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,870
Ok Mister Ito, you're up first

573
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:38,980
Jailhouse Rock

574
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:38,980
Elvis Presley

575
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,060
He had a little glance at us there...

576
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,790
Like a kind of "are you okay" look...

577
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,330
'You're not pissed at me for doing this?' kind of look

578
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,070
Hey Saki

579
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,370
Um...

580
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,210
Um...

581
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,510
Um...

582
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,410
(sigh)...

583
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,380
(sigh)...

584
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,280
Next time.. I will *&#(#*$#(*

585
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,630
He couldn't even say it properly at all.

586
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,130
And Saki's just laughing the whole time...

587
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,400
Saki was laughing so much.

588
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,070
She was laughing the whole time

589
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,040
Saki's been laughing the whole time...

590
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,670
Yeah she was

591
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,040
She was

592
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,940
Okay Mister Ito

593
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,110
Tenryu boy, it's your go now.

594
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,780
Tenryu boy, it's your go now.

595
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,110
Ok, *(*#$&(#$&

596
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:54,720
Tooty Fruity

597
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:54,720
Little Richard

598
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,120
.Oh Tenryu boy..

599
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,900
Hm?

600
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,970
What was that dance?

601
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,410
Where's your chat up line?

602
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,380
Oh yeah...

603
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,010
Saki  Part 2

604
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,850
Saki, would you like to go have

605
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,850
a cream soda with me?

606
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,590
It just wouldn't go in at all.

607
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,690
Would you like to go have a cream soda with me?

608
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,460
Microphone wouldn't go into his pocket

609
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,660
Do it properly..

610
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,660
It's still not in his pocket properly.

611
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,340
No no no...

612
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,740
I'm not laughing at what he said

613
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,270
I know...

614
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,840
Yeah it's more the...

615
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,410
What about Yamasaki?

616
00:18:50,910 --> 00:19:00,720
Sponsors

617
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,480
Hold on a second

618
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,120
He was the first one of us to laugh

619
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,250
No, I was safe

620
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,720
Okay Saki, did either of them appeal to you much?

621
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,290
Okay Saki, did either of them appeal to you much?

622
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,430
Oh I can't decide

623
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,430
who's better out of these two.

624
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,100
Anyway, I...

625
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,700
found a really good looking guy

626
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,370
Excuse me there, sir

627
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,040
excuse me, sir

628
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:25,210
Saki likes Matsumoto

629
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,310
Excuse me, you sir

630
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,310
I have kind of fallen for you

631
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:32,050
Connie Francis

632
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:32,050
Stupid Cupid

633
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,150
Hey there, mister

634
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,520
These kind of things...

635
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:40,890
Tries to appeal by dancing with love

636
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,550
Watch my dance now

637
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,520
Seriously this situation was...

638
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,120
scary, I bet?

639
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,720
and it would be my pleasure

640
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,230
if we did something nice...

641
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,600
Hang on a second...

642
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,210
You there, the balding pervert!

643
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,610
What the hell, you

644
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:01,280
what do you think

645
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,280
you're looking at with that dirty look on your face!!

646
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,280
dgsdgsdsdg

647
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,650
You were looking at me, weren't you!?

648
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,350
No..part 2

649
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,620
No... I wasn't.

650
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,780
You were, weren't you!

651
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,620
...No, I wasn't...

652
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,550
You make me sick...

653
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:19,900
She spits her gum at him

654
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:19,900
To Housei: The Pervert

655
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,760
I feel sick now...

656
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,260
Let's go home!

657
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,230
Why did she do that?

658
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,610
Something flew, didn't it?

659
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,110
Hold on man...part2

660
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,220
The judges are being way too lenient

661
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,520
Yamasaki wasspared there

662
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,350
Yamasaki was spared there

663
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,960
He should have been hit like 3 extra times.

664
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,230
15 minutes since start

665
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,190
Fifteen minutes since they left the park

666
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:55,230
Already loads of  punishments!!

667
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,100
And the punishments just don't stop for the guys

668
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,600
But...

669
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,800
Obviously, ahead of them

670
00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:01,640
And next

671
00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:01,640
There are even funnier  traps awaiting them

672
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:01,070
are even funnier traps waiting to make them laugh

673
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,810
BUS STOP

674
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,350
Oota-san

675
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,850
If you don't sign the contract with us now..

676
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,820
our company will undoubtedly..be finished!!

677
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,980
our company will undoubtedly be finished!!

678
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:19,560
Salesman

679
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:19,560
Kakei Toshio

680
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,520
So I'm really begging you

681
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,360
You and I...We've been partners for a long time

682
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,590
You and I.. We've been partners for a long time

683
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,700
But this time...I'm really sorry

684
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,400
But this time... I'm really sorry

685
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,770
I have no time left

686
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,130
So I need to go

687
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,640
Let's go for a drink though soon, ok?

688
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,800
Wait... Oota-san!Oota-san!

689
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,670
Wait... Oota-san!Oota-san!

690
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,510
Wait... Oota-san! Oota-san!

691
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,310
Please don't crush my company!Oota-san!

692
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,310
Please don't crush my company! Oota-san!

693
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:45,020
After failing one of his most important customers, the salesmen is in a dilemma...

694
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,690
There's no tomorrow...

695
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:52,460
"Ashita ga arusa"

696
00:21:52,060 --> 00:22:01,900
Shozo I heard, at that age

697
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:01,900
You're resorting to use Viagra

698
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:10,970
Even now, I'm active

699
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,970
All I need is 'Aka Mamushi'

700
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,970
(Aka Mamushi = drink which contains lots of Vitamin C)

701
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:21,290
I like Shozo, I like Shozo

702
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:21,290
Shozo, I love you

703
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:30,790
When Shozo was becoming a teenager

704
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,790
I found your stash of porn magazines

705
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:39,500
The women in these magazines

706
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:39,500
were all the same age as me...

707
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:49,350
We like Shozo, we like Shozo

708
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,350
Shozo, we love you

709
00:22:50,980 --> 00:23:02,290
On my 35th birthday,

710
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:02,290
my older brother got me a present

711
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:11,640
I opened the present, I was shocked

712
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,640
Inside was a radio control car...

713
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:20,840
I like Shozo, I like Shozo

714
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:20,840
Shozo, we all love you

715
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:30,150
At our graduation reunion, 20 years on

716
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,150
he tried to make himself look like Mr. Big Shot

717
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:40,100
He brought his junior, who wasn't even invited

718
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:40,100
What a dirty insecure guy

719
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:50,470
I like Shozo, I like Shozo

720
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:50,470
Shozo, we all love you

721
00:23:51,410 --> 00:24:01,520
Endo-kun, you middle aged man

722
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:01,520
I found your hidden stash of videos

723
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:11,330
Son of honour, I will seduce

724
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:11,330
with a widow's mourning dress

725
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:20,400
I like Shozo, I like Shozo

726
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,400
Shozo, we all love you

727
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:30,810
I was worried about Ikue-san

728
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:30,810
after she watched last year's Gaki no Tsukai

729
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:39,060
This is just a lie but apparently

730
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,060
Endo also likes men?

731
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:49,030
I like Shozo, I like Shozo

732
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:49,030
Shozo, we all love you

733
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:58,580
Shozo, who was born in Toyonaka

734
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,580
He loves baseball, and loves women

735
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:08,320
He loves golf, he loves airplanes

736
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,320
He also likes the Kousou buildings

737
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:18,100
He likes his Benz, he likes kinako as well

738
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:18,100
He also likes pink clothes

739
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:31,980
I like Shozo, I like Shozo

740
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:31,980
Endo, we all love you!

741
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,080
Shozo is a really pathetic son but

742
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,820
All of us at Re:Endo Japan love Endo very very much

743
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,890
All of us at Re:Endo Japan love Endo very very much

744
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,590
Everyone of Japan

745
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,590
Everyone of Japan

746
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,960
Look at Kakei-san's knee...

747
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:58,300
Endo's Dad puts his hand on Kakei's knee

748
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,100
Let's all work hard together

749
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,510
Let's all work hard together

750
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:05,040
Goodbye!

751
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,080
That was amazing...

752
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,220
Why did he put his hand on Kakei-san's knee?

753
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,220
I know, you're right

754
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,220
You're right, why did he?

755
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,220
Poor Kakei-san

756
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,290
Ye, really Kakei-sanpart2

757
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,290
Ye, really Kakei-san, I am so sorry

758
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,530
(My family) they came so early...

759
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,530
Yeah it was really early..

760
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:35,540
Testified against Endo last year

761
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:35,540
Morisaki Yuki

762
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:35,540
and therefore  is part of the family!

763
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,400
Morisaki-san...

764
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,030
She's not really part of my family...

765
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,570
She's teamed up with your ex wife and everything...

766
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,240
and like everyone close to you

767
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,840
I could never have imagined that

768
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,240
This is what happens when you fail to chat up a woman...

769
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,980
yeah... they get with your ex wife and...part2

770
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,980
Jeez, that was ridiculous.

771
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:52,590
Still a while to go on this journey

772
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:52,590
There are still more stops to come

773
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,420
45 minutes since the start,

774
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,350
The long and hard path to the centre still continues

775
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,590
The long and hard path to the centre still continues

776
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,630
Bus Stop

777
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:11,710
My first outing alone

778
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:11,710

Shota-kun, who is 5 and his younger brother, Yuto, who is 4.

781
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,550
Older brother

782
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,550
Shota-kun (5 years)

783
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,550
Younger brother

Yuto-kun (4 years)

785
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,880
The trustworthy older brother andpart2

786
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,890
the little cry-baby brother

787
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,890
They are very close brothers

788
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,260
Big bro...Are you sure we can do this, just us 2?

789
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,930
Big bro... Are you sure we can do this, just us 2?

790
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:35,570
Your big brother is here, so don't worry.

791
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,570
Ah, I get it!

792
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,430
Their Mum has asked them topart2

793
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,640
Go to the cake store and collect the cake they ordered and

794
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,910
go to the flower shop and buy some flowers

795
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,110
Big bro...Please can we get off the bus already?

796
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,340
Big bro... Please can we get off the bus already?

797
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,980
What are you saying?We just got on it, silly.

798
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,010
What are you saying? We just got on it, silly.

799
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,320
We aren't there yet.

800
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:59,660
WAAAAA~~~

801
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,020
Oh, is that so...

802
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,890
Oh deary deary me...part2

803
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,990
Yuto-kun is...

804
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,030
feeling scared and has started crying...

805
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,490
But look...part2

806
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,000
Look at the kind-hearted brother.

807
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,470
He got something from one of the trees before...

808
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,430
He gets the Kuwagata Beetle out...part 2part 3

809
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,440
and he is going to put it on his nosepart 3

810
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,810
in order to make his younger brother Yuto-kun laugh.

811
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:23,950
Everyone must do as the narrator says

812
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:23,950
How this program works

813
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,140
Don't worry little bro, watch this. Here I go...

814
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,510
No, it's no good. I can't do it...

815
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,450
Well of course he can't...

816
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,290
He might be a big brother, but he's only five!part2

817
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,290
Of course it's going to be scary.

818
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,720
When suddenly,part2

819
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,160
a man who happened to sit near the children

820
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,030
Luckily there was a kind old storytellerpart2

821
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:40,000
who asked "Are you okay?" to the children

822
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:46,800
How this program works

823
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:46,800
The storyteller asks them if they're okay

824
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,640
There's only one "storyteller" out of us

825
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,010
Yup, there's only one...

826
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,010
Are you okay?

827
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,080
The old storytellerpart2

828
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,440
will take the place of the older brother and

829
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,250
put the Kuwagata beetle on his own nosepart2

830
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:00,680
and will make Yuto-kun laugh.

831
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,520
Please can you do it for me!

832
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:15,100
How this program works

833
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:15,100
The storyteller will put the beetle on his nose

834
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,470
Wow...

835
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:29,710
How this program works

836
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:29,710
The storyteller will make the little brother laugh

837
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,570
Yuto-kun...

838
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,180
We know how much this shit hurts...part2

839
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,180
Housei-san knew as well...

840
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:42,030
Story didn't go to plan, kids are now crying

841
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,600
It's not coming off at all!

842
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,970
Like not in the slightest!

843
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Wait, why are they crying?

844
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,680
Ow Ow Ow

845
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,620
That must hurt so much!

846
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,780
Ow Ow Ow Ow

847
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,620
They're both crying now...

848
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,790
RIGHT. CUT!!

849
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,460
WHAT?!

850
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:23,000
Chono Masahiro

851
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:23,000
Enters

852
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:23,000
Our first outing

853
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:23,000
The Director

854
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,600
That must hurt so much!

855
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:29,410
Ow Ow Ow Ow

856
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,280
They're both crying now...

857
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,380
RIGHT. CUT!!

858
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,080
WHAT?!

859
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:43,320
Chono Masahiro

860
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:43,320
Director

861
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:43,320
Enters

862
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:43,320
Our first outing

863
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,560
What the hell do you think you're doing? OY!

864
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,660
You've ruined my damn show on purpose!!

865
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,530
I was so shocked here.

866
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:58,370
Chono is angry because the story didn't go to the way it was narrated

867
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,590
Wait, hang on a second...

868
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:54,000
They told me to make them laugh.

869
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,660
What do you think you're doing?!

870
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,560
No-

871
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,470
Pick it up!

872
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,840
What are you going to do about my show?!

873
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,540
You've made the kids cry, I can't go on with this show!

874
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:12,020
This "situation" is just...

875
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,020
What is this situation?!

876
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:20,960
As a director, I am...

877
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,960
Hey guys, you okay?

878
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,860
They are crying so much!

879
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,130
Did that man make you cry?

880
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,060
Okay, come on, let's go home...

881
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,800
Who was the one who made you cry?

882
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,340
OY YOU!!

883
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,400
What the hell are you playing at?

884
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,800
Come here, now.

885
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:41,610
PUNISHED

886
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:41,610
Ruined the show

887
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:41,610
the storyteller gets

888
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,320
He came this year, way too early.

889
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,420
Yeah, so early on in the game!

890
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,720
I was shitting myself for
what was coming next...

891
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,290
I wasn't even ready mentally for it...

892
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,730
Like none of us were ready for that at all!

893
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,060
We just are not ready in the slightest...

894
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,430
Man, look at that...

895
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,230
Oi

896
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:07,200
It's my TV show,

897
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,200
do you get that?

898
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,940
What's the name of your show?

899
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,880
My first outing...

900
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,710
Because there are no kids, there's no show..

901
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,250
Okay...

902
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,150
How are you going to make up for it?!

903
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,520
Please forgive me!

904
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,620
Don't mess with me, you bastard.

905
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,160
Tsukihoshi...

906
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,560
It's Tsukitei...

907
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,230
This is out of order...

908
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,100
Isn't it?

909
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,970
Yama-chan... Do you really need to correct him now?

910
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,570
I know... Just

911
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,970
let him call you whatever.

912
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,910
Do you get me? You've screwed it all up for me...

913
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,350
Do you get me? You've screwed it all up for me...

914
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,250
You get it?

915
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:51,250
Yes...

916
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,620
Then you take responsibility for it.

917
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,620
What do you mean? How?

918
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,490
Okay okay, I get it...

919
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,090
What do you get?

920
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:02,760
I'm getting slapped, aren't I?

921
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,030
For crying out loud, I give up!

922
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,770
Don't just say it!

923
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,370
Don't like just say it so casually!

924
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,810
Jeez...

925
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,080
It is hard not to laugh when he just accepts the slap...

926
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:25,020
Okay, will you tell me your name?

927
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,450
My name is...

928
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:26,920
What is it?!

929
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:28,920
Tsukitei...

930
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,190
Housei!

931
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,370
Man that sucks for you...

932
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,440
For real? This situation...

933
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,310
For real? This situation...

934
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,910
We're still on the bus...

935
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,550
This was really tough...

936
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,650
This was the first time you got slapped on the bus?

937
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,450
Get out of my way!! God damn!

938
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,020
Doing that to my show, God damn!

939
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,760
What kind of face are you doing!?

940
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,700
OW!!!!!

941
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,540
My jaw... it's out of place...

942
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,570
Don't lie, you bastard!

943
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:31,850
Ow ow ow

944
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,620
OW!!!!!

945
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,460
How could you talk if your jaw was out of place!?

946
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,830
Man you got yourself into some shit there.

947
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,300
That was amazing...

948
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:56,240
is just ahead

949
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:56,240
The GDFE Headquarters

950
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:56,240
Time on the Bus coming to the end

951
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,500
The long journey on the bus is coming to an end.

952
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,670
The GDFE is just ahead.

953
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,370
Oh?

954
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,080
Are we here?

955
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,480
Yep, we are there in a second.

956
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,280
The earth... Kurobi...

957
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,220
We will be at the Gaasu Earth Defence Headquarters

958
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:07,220
We will get off there.

959
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,480
You really said it wrong at the beginning there...

960
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,350
Earth Kurobikari...

961
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:15,130
Finally the bus which carries the 5 showed itself to the Earth defense headquarters!

962
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:20,230
However

963
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:20,230
It is NOT

964
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:20,230
the goal

965
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,130
However, this is NOT the goal...

966
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,100
It is a new battlefield...

967
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,600
Man that was a long journey...

968
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,100
It really was!

969
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,440
Guys, we are here.

970
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,040
Guys, apparently we are here.

971
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,240
Finally we're here.

972
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,080
Wow, it's amazing.

973
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:39,250
Gaasu Kurobikari Earth Defence Force Headquaters

974
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,850
Do not laugh series:

975
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:49,590
Where the safety and laughter of the earth is the most important;

976
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:49,590
soon, a battle with the laughter assassins

977
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:49,590
will commence!!

978
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,060
Right guys, we're here.

979
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,270
Finally, yes...

980
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,500
Man that was long.

981
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,400
Shall we get off then?

982
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,240
Man that was hard.

983
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,780
Everyone, this is the Gaasu Earth Kurobikari...

984
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,350
Everyone, this is the Gaasu Earth Kurobikari...

985
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,620
Oh.. Gaasu Kurobikari Earth Defence Force..

986
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,920
The Headquarters.

987
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,750
The building is amazing, isn't it?

988
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:20,660
You're right, it's amazing.

989
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,730
Yes it is, I mean, we are the Earth Defence Force after all.

990
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,930
The prestige is on another level.

991
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:36,010
2nd floor of HQ

992
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,170
Okay, follow me guys.

993
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,010
We are now going to meet the head of this Earth Defence HQ.

994
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:39,110
So please don't insult him in any way, okay?

995
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,180
Okay.

996
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,380
Excuse us!!

997
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,550
Excuse us...

998
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,360
Excuse me.

999
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,830
Chief! I brought the 5 new members of the EDF!!

1000
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,730
Here they are!

1001
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,170
Oh it's you guys.

1002
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:07,540
Big time celebrity

1003
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,070
Hahahaha

1004
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,870
I brought the 5 new members of the EDF!!

1005
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,710
Here they are!

1006
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,180
Oh it's you guys.

1007
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,510
Chief of EDF

1008
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,510
Matsukata Hiroki

1009
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,860
I am FadeGaasu Kurobikari Earth Defense Force's Chief,

1010
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,160
I am Gaasu Kurobikari Earth Defense Force's Chief,

1011
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,760
I am Gaasu Kurobikari Earth Defense Force's Chief,

1012
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,730
Matsukata.

1013
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,070
Do you guys have codenames?

1014
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,270
Do you guys have codenames?

1015
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,040
No.

1016
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,870
None.

1017
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,040
No we do not.

1018
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,110
As members of the Earth Defense Force, you can not reveal your real identity.

1019
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,080
As members of the Earth Defense Force,

1020
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:51,210
you can not reveal your real identity.

1021
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,480
Therefore,

1022
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,150
every member has a codename.

1023
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,720
It seems as though you five do not have codenames,

1024
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,260
It seems as though you five do not have codenames,

1025
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,630
so I will give them to you.

1026
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:05,460
so I will give them to you.

1027
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:08,430
codenames for the newly recruited members

1028
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,570
First is Officer Hamada.

1029
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:17,010
He knows my name, he said it.

1030
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,180
Gross!

1031
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,890
It's gross!

1032
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,070
Alright, I've got one.

00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,970

Just leave it as Gorilla..

1038
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,610
Yes, we know he is male..

1039
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,620
He's crossdressing.

1040
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,250
That one really hurt.

1041
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,720
Ouch

1042
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,620
Okay.

1043
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,030
It's Officer Matsumoto.

1044
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,040

Officer Endo.

1051
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,770
Your codename is...

1052
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:00,810
*note: Hirunandesu is a weekday show where Endo is MC every Monday..

1053
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,010

1054

Thank you.

1060
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,250
You appeared a lot there.

1061
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,250
He really appeared a lot.

1062
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,590
That hurts.

1063
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,160
This is going to chaff real bad later.

1064
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,320
You're right.

1065
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,590
Finally.

1066
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,330

Tanaka's code name

1071

Isn't that the worst one?

1072
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:33,040
That was the worst one.

1073
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,140
That's impossible.

1074
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,010
No, no.

1075
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,810
Can you please change my code name?

1076
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,050

But he's a professional.

1085
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,550
That's mean!

1086
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,520
That's terrible.

1087
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,750
He's a professional.

1088
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,460
With this...

1089
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:29,500
All your code names are decided.

1090
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,800
Your

1091
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,100

00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,470
We brought our finest quality wine.

1093
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:43,650
Celebrate their enlistment with wine toasting

1094
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:50,550
And now

1095
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:56,030
even though it's presumptuous, I want to lead the toast for this.

1096
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,260
To celebrate your enlistment.

1097

What kind of a person is member Matsumoto?

1106
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,640
That man there...

1107
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,770
He's Officer Matsumoto.

1108
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,210
I know!!

00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,780
Oh my God, it's Chuck Wilson!!!

No, you're thinking of Sakamoto-chan from Alkali the 3rd!!

1115
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,890
What are you even saying.

1116
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,700
Renaissance~!!

1117
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,500
He even remembers that.

1118
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,070
That's amazing.

1119
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,840
No more, this hurts so much.

1120
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:22,380
I can't handle more of this.

1121
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,910
I don't feel like wine anymore...

1122
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,520
Please bring that...

1123
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:35,360
Supplying state-of-the-art ray guns

1124
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:31,950
Go ahead.

1125
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,690
I'm supplying each of you.

1126
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,060
Cutting edge...

1127
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,030
Ray guns.

1128
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,000
Please don't use it yet.

1129
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:43,670
Okay...

1130
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,470
Shoot on my signal.

1131
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,870
Okay, prepare yourselves.

1132
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:49,570
Spread your legs more.

1133
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,570
Yes.

1134
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,240
Ready...

1135
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:02,150
Our prank was a success you know~!!

1136
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,460
Renaissance~!!

1137
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,100
Just me?

1138
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,130
Why only me..?

1139
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,930
Isn't it all of us..?

1140
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,840
Seriously, why am I the only one who got hit?

1141
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,610
Really?

1142
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,950
Wasn't that amazing?

1143
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,420
That freakin' hurts.

1144
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,480
They definitely don't sell these in shops...

1145
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,050
Well, that's all from me.

1146
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,550
Please carry out your duties now.

1147
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,190
Dismissed!!

1148
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:40,760
Thank you very much.

1149
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,190
Thank you so much.

1150
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:43,390
Let's go, everyone.

1151
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,330
That surprised me.

1152
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,540
That was amazing.

1153
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,950
This is the newcomer's training room.

1154
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:07,450
Training room.

1155
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:11,290
Staff room for newbies

1156
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:08,480
Get in.

1157
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,090
Okay, well I'm off to the toilet again.

1158
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,690
God he goes to the toilet a lot!

1159
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:13,560
It's because it's cold.

1160
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,560
My ass is already in pain.

1161
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:24,230
1 hour 20 minutes since the start

1162
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,660
It's been 1 hour and 20 minutes since it started.

1163
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,500
They finally have time to relax a little

1164
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,600
I'm just scared of opening anything...

1165
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,470
You're right.

1166
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:27,040
But they can't be too relaxed...

1167
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:33,880
But seriously, electric shocks are really scary.

1168
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,050
Even touching a weird object scares me.

1169
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:46,860
FOR FUCK SAKES

1170
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:48,390
It's that again.

1171
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,660
Of course you would shit yourself...

1172
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,230
Of course that would frighten me!

1173
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,060
As I thought, there are traps...

1174
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:59,600
CO2 emission from the coffee pot

1175
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:58,070
Just as we're talking about it as well...

1176
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,940
It seems like I always get shocked when I'm about to drink water.

1177
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:07,080
OWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

1178
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,650
I just twisted my ankle just now...

1179
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:17,350
are toying around with them

1180
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:17,350
1 hour 30 mins since started

1181
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:17,350
This laughter traps

1182
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:17,050
Since the start, the five are getting toyed around by the traps

1183
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:24,130
OPENING OF THE DRAWERS! DEADLY LONG AWAITED

1184
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:22,560
After this is the long awaited opening of the drawers!

1185
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:29,500
Since the beginning until now, we've finally got to the room.

1186
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,670
Yama-chan, right?

1187
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:32,470
The bus scene was amazing, seriously

1188
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:41,180
Chouno will NOT be the director of the show so rest assured..

1189
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:41,180
13th January 2013 7pm start

1190
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:41,180
Hajimettenootsukai

1191
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:46,320
Chouno Masahiro

1192
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:36,210
I had a feeling it would be me, since Chouno-san was there.

1193
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,110
He's usually at the end.

1194
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,880
I thought he would come at the end. But then he was just suddenly there...

1195
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:46,320
My jaw was dislocated. Seriously

1196
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:45,980
No it didn't...

1197
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,090
For me, Endo's family appeared again.

1198
00:46:48,950 --> 00:47:05,070
Re:Endo Japan

1199
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:55,460
Your dad's hand was on Kakei-san's thigh the whole time...

1200
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:56,360
What was that? Was he nervous?

1201
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,590
It's not like he had anything else to cling on.

1202
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:05,070
I thought Kakei-san was like a hostess.

1203
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:03,830
Maybe it relaxed him or something...

1204
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:04,730
Oh, is it...

1205
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,700
Even Chiaki was there.

1206
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:17,880
Chiaki

1207
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,710
Shozo, I love you~♪

1208
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,110
She sang that.

1209
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:17,880
Why did we divorce then? If she was going to sing that, we should have just stayed together...

1210
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:17,380
If she actually loves me...

1211
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:25,550
9:30 in the morning. The traditional yearly opening of the drawers...

1212
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,090
9:30am- An hour and a half since the start

1213
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,760
Do you want to rest some more or open them now and get it over with?

1214
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:35,730
Eh, you want to pull it out ?

1215
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,800
Well we don't HAVE to open the drawers...

1216
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,670
No, they expect us to pull it after all.

1217
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:45,640
Isn't that good, though? Maybe this year we just won't open them...

1218
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,340
But the staff...

1219
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:47,940
Maybe this year we won't open them

1220
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,080
Maybe we should leave it to the person's choice if they want to open their drawers or not.

1221
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:52,510
It's fine if you don't want to open yours.

1222
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,490
Well I might not open it then...

1223
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:01,320
Housei just ate a super hot rice cracker

1224
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:01,320
Triple the spiciness of wasabi

1225
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:59,420
Your face.

1226
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:05,090
Ughhh

1227
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,500
Why are you laughing?

1228
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,030
Eh?

1229
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,370
What's wrong?

1230
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:22,850
Why are you posing like Mizuki Ichiro.

1231
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,880
It's Mizuki doing his 'Zetto!'

1232
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,150
Jeez, I'm crying. It's so spicy.

1233
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,550
They've even set up traps like that?!

1234
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:35,220
THAT HURTS~

1235
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:40,030
You were like Mizuki Ichiro just now.

1236
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,260
Yeah I saw...

1237
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,600
Was it spicy?

1238
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,700
What was spicy?

1239
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,470
I think it was wasabi.

1240
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:47,940
You got tricked again?

1241
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:47,300
Which one was it?

1242
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:49,670
The stuff that looks like rice crackers.

1243
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,170
So, they're not rice crackers?

1244
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:56,950
My ass is ending pretty early this year, it freakin' hurts. Maybe because it's cold...

1245
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:57,610
Yes.

1246
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:02,480
These clothes aren't even protecting us.

1247
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,020
Why do they even call us the defence force anyway.

1248
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,560
Come on, why don't you open it?

1249
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,900
Should I? No use dragging it any longer, right?

1250
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:20,070
Alright, I guess we should open them..

1251
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:20,200
Please go ahead.

1252
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:28,740
Almost every time, Tanaka's drawer will have a DVD in it.

1253
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:33,880
And Endo's would probably be an object about something bad he's done..

1254
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:34,820
Well, I haven't done anything bad this year...

1255
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:36,290
Should I go first?

1256
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:40,420
First up is Endo

1257
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,150
Last year, you got a photo.

1258
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:40,620
Yes. Anyway, I'm going to open it now...

1259
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,560
Oh? There's something.

1260
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:51,900
A mysterious panel and a magic pen

1261
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:51,900
To Endo

1262
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,460
There's a panel...

1263
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,900
It says "To Endo"...

1264
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,830
There's a magic pen.

1265
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:52,000
Magic pen? What is this?

1266
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,970
Okay here we go...

1267
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,510
Hahahahahahahahha

1268
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:01,180
It says, "Do this question in one minute..."

1269
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,750
I have one minute...

1270
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,710
He was laughing.

1271
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,710
I heard it too.

1272
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,710
You laughed just now, didn't you?

1273
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:32,940
1 Minute Challenge

1274
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:32,940
Endo's Draw

1275
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:09,820
1 Minute Challenge

1276
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,520
I only have a minute.

1277
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:14,420
Solve the math problem in
1 minute

1278
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:32,940
Problem:

1279
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:18,330
Failure will result in
a wrestler headbutt

1280
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:17,830
Uwaa! Seriously?!

1281
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,760
Uwaa! Seriously?!

1282
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:22,030
Give it your best!

1283
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:23,400
Quickly!

1284
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:27,000
This is easy.

1285
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,500
Hurry up.

1286
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,510
Go, go, go, go.

1287
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:32,940
Done!!

1288
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:32,010
You're done?

1289
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:34,910
I think.

1290
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,280
INCORRECT

1291
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,050
A headbutt from the wrestler will now be administered.

1292
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,250
That's wrong.

1293
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,250
It is??

1294
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:46,920
HEADBUTT EXECUTION

1295
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:43,620
No, no... why?

1296
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,820
This is wrong?

1297
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,560
You don't calculate it
just as it is like that.

1298
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,160
You don't just add it like that.

1299
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,300
Wah! He's here!!

1300
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,160
Please, give me just one more chance!

1301
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,400
This is bad.

1302
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,300
Please, give me just one more chance!

1303
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,300
Ah... I'm sorry!

1304
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,800
Owwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!

1305
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,370
Owwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!

1306
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:07,110
He really went flying!

1307
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,110
Wait a minute.

1308
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,410
That was an incredible headbutt!

1309
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:13,150
That's gotta hurt.

1310
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,650
That can't be.

1311
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:16,350
Your head must seriously hurt.

1312
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,820
Endo...

1313
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,320
It's a bit red.

1314
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,720
It's not cut, is it?

1315
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:24,160
It's not but... it's really red.

1316
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:27,830
Everyone please be careful, ok?

1317
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,500
This is a new thing this time around. The headbutt.

1318
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,070
This is a new thing this time around. The headbutt.

1319
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,200
Owww.

1320
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,910
I'm opening it now.

1321
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,910
Yes, yes, yes.

1322
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:41,040
Really? You're amazing, Hamada-san.

1323
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,780
It might be another question.

1324
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,150
You're right.

1325
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,450
Yeah... but...

1326
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,780
Uwaah... it's a question.

1327
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:47,750
Not good.

1328
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:56,160
Hamada Masatoshi

1329
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:56,160
Hamada Masatoshi

1330
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:56,160
Mysterious Panels x 2

1331
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,020
So it's this kind of pattern now, huh?

1332
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,160
It's different.

1333
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,160
That looks different.

1334
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,090
So it's different.

1335
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:56,090
There's no pen.

1336
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,330
You're right.

1337
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:59,730
What am I supposed to do with these?

1338
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:59,730
Is it okay to flip them over?

1339
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,500
Start with the first one.

1340
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:03,770
I should do it like this, right?

1341
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:05,770
Yeah, that's the best way.

1342
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,570
Here I go

1343
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:10,470
One, two...

1344
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:27,690
Garamon

1345
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:27,690

They're being handled by the Earth Defense Force.

1349
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,250
It looks like you.

1350
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,920
It's not Pigumon but Garamon.

1351
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,690
One, two...

1352
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:52,850

1356
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:39,470
Wow, this totally looks like him.

1357
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,470
This kind of face is...

1358
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:52,850
This is bad.

1359
00:52:52,850 --> 00:54:21,300
Model M1

1360
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:54,280
There are times where his face looks like this

1361
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,390
There are times where his face looks like this

1362
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,290
When he's in a bad mood

1363
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:00,290
Yes, it does.

1364
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,620
When there's a delay,

1365
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:02,620
his mood turns like this

1366
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:10,070
Although it's because he purposely comes in late,

1367
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:10,070
it's totally his fault

1368
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,240
You don't have to tell people that.

1369
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,170
His face looks like this when they say, "Hamada-san is entering!"

1370
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:22,010
"Hamada-san is entering~!" and your face looks like that

1371
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:25,050
"Hamada-san is entering~!" and your face looks like that

1372
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,490
Seriously, why must you tell this story?

1373
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:32,890
It's unintentional.

1374
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:41,360
That is...

1375
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,600
People don't care about that.

1376
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,340
So something like that happen too.

1377
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,170
It's the first time I've seen something like this.

1378
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,770
It's your first time, right?

1379
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:51,810
Me too.

1380
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:55,410
He looks like this in the morning too.

1381
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:54,540
Yeah, he does.

1382
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:10,330
It's bad if you expand your power of imagination.

1383
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:10,030
This is Hamada-san who just woke up in the morning.

1384
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,530
You're right.

1385
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:12,830
At today's hotel too.

1386
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:15,500
When we went down the elevator

1387
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:15,500
with his hands in his pockets...

1388
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,370
He's like this during winter too

1389
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:21,200
Wearing his handmade wooly jumper

1390
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,110
That is scary. I'm so sorry.

1391
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:28,110
Ah, that's scary. But woolen jumper...

1392
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:30,250
I'm going to open the drawer

1393
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:37,320
Hamada Family's Nameplate

1394
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:34,350
A nameplate?

1395
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,320
They really put a nameplate there.

1396
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,460
It's hot!!

1397
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:42,660
It's hot!!

1398
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:45,960
The Nameplate is Hot

1399
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,730
It was sudden.

1400
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,460
That was really mean.

1401
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,800
Even I'm a victim.

1402
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,730
You bastards should really stop doing things  that inflict pain to our bodies!!

1403
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,740
You bastards should really stop doing things that inflict pain to our bodies!!

1404
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,840
So this thing is hot.

1405
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:00,610
That was really mean.

1406
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:02,610
It's really hot.

1407
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:04,210
If we had open it earlier it probably will be even hotter

1408
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,080
If we had open it earlier it probably will be even hotter

1409
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,320
Hot!

1410
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:10,090
I don't understand why would you make it hot.

1411
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,150
I don't know why too.

1412
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:13,160
What are their intentions?

1413
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,390
What the hell is this?

1414
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,220
This thing is filled with evil intentions

1415
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,960
Nothing.

1416
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,800
I'm freaking out, jeez.

1417
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,430
I'm so tired already.

1418
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,000
But everyone, please do your best.

1419
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,700
For today...

1420
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,700
There's a lot of  physical punishment.

1421
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:29,170
Seriously.

1422
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:29,810
Quite a lot.

1423
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:31,910
Can you flip back Model M1 upside down

1424
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:35,080
Can you flip back Model M1 upside down

1425
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,080
Why are giving it to me?

1426
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,450
That is really terrible.

1427
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:40,720
It's bad.

1428
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,950
Model M1.

1429
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:45,190
This photo is not even photoshopped, right?

1430
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,420
Are you sure?

1431
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:55,530
The actual appearance of a monster in [Ultra Q]

1432
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:48,920
He really does look like that?

1433
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,190
It's not photoshopped.

1434
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:52,190
He really does look like that.

1435
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:54,530
The Gigumon.. I mean, Garamon is not photoshopped too.

1436
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:58,500
No way, I didn't do anything.

1437
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,440
You were grinning.

1438
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,440
Grinning is not allowed.

1439
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,740
You should know this by now.

1440
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:07,210
Hamada and Model M1 are almost the same

1441
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:08,880
Hamada and Model M1 are almost the same

1442
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:10,510
What do you mean?

1443
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:23,290
[Ultra Q] episode 10 appearance
Boast a superhuman strength of 20 bulldozers
and intelligence of a 3 year old

1444
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:12,750
The description for the both of you.

1445
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,750
Yeah, Hamada-san, maybe if you're reborn...

1446
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,750
Boast a superhuman strength of 20 bulldozers.

1447
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,760
Intelligence of a 3 year old...

1448
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,260
That's really amazing.

1449
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:29,330
Let's stop all the talk about Model M1

1450
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:30,430
Let's stop all the talk about Model M1

1451
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:34,970
Talking about Model M1 is bad.

1452
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:37,910
The destructive power is too amazing

1453
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,540
Should we continue?

1454
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:40,040
Here I go.

1455
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:43,010
Nothing.

1456
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,280
Nothing.

1457
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:47,580
Huh?

1458
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:51,590
Some gag items.

1459
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:52,790
Coke-bottle glasses

1460
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,190
Uwaaah, a wig.

1461
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:59,060
Toupee

1462
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:58,530
Is there more?

1463
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,060
Can it be just this?

1464
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:03,570
There must be a reason they put this in Yamachan's drawer.

1465
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,560
That's amazing.

1466
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,440
It's a Katochan set.

1467
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,700
It does seem like it.

1468
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,240
Mysterious Tiny Box

1469
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:13,240
I'm opening it, ok?

1470
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:19,050
Short mustache

1471
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:20,050
Like I told you, it's a set.

1472
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:25,250
Katochan set

1473
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:22,050
It all makes sense now.

1474
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:24,790
Well, then. Should I wear it?

1475
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:26,050
I guess you have too.

1476
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,130
How about putting on the glasses first?

1477
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,130
Yeah, I'll wear the glasses first.

1478
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,200
Ah, it's stuck.

1479
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:45,740
The double-sided tape won't come off

1480
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,240
Why?

1481
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,010
You can't do that.

1482
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,740
That was bad.

1483
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:51,650
Why am I getting beaten for this!?!

1484
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:54,380
Why am I getting beaten for this!?!

1485
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,520
That hair.

1486
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:05,760
Something  smells bad.

1487
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,260
It stinks.Seriously.

1488
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,030
It stinks. Seriously.

1489
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:11,300
Stinks!!

1490
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,000
You can't wear that.

1491
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,600
Maybe it's that.

1492
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:14,070
Stinks!! What is this?

1493
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:16,810
Stinks!! What is this?

1494
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:19,610
What did they put here?

1495
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,080
It's smells really bad.

1496
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,080
It's not the moustache.

1497
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:31,590
Intensely smelly 3-piece set

1498
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:27,420
It stinks!

1499
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:27,420
What is that?

1500
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,220
What is this smell?

1501
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:35,790
I think it's your head.

1502
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,790
Is it my head?

1503
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,790
It stinks! It stinks!

1504
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,760
Try taking off the wig.

1505
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,630
But I just wore it.

1506
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:40,630
It's not the wig.

1507
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,630
Is it the wig?

1508
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:43,730
It stinks.

1509
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:45,700
It stinks! It was the wig!

1510
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,970
Tanaka, try and smell him.

1511
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,070
Wah, you stink!

1512
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,340
That smells real bad!

1513
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:56,080
You're really trying to laugh now.

1514
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,480
But I'm not laughing.

1515
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:57,980
Eh?

1516
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,780
Just feeling really childlike.

1517
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,850
I just feel really childlike.

1518
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:04,250
I would hate that.

1519
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:04,950
Man... what is this..?

1520
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:08,390
Man... what is this..?

1521
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,390
That was really evil.

1522
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:09,390
Really.

1523
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:10,760
Now, Tanaka.

1524
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:10,390
Okay.

1525
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,760
I'm scared too.

1526
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,500
Look. I knew it.

1527
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:21,070
Mysterious DVD x 2

1528
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,170
Yes, yes.

1529
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:21,170
Every single time.

1530
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,610
This is really...

1531
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,370
Heh heh heh

1532
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:26,140
What are you laughing at?

1533
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:30,010
I'm not laughing at all

1534
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:31,610
You guys have to look more properly!

1535
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,110
No way... just now you did too!

1536
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:36,350
You guys have to properly notice, the staff too...

1537
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:36,690
You laughed just a minute ago too!
Like "HAHA!"

1538
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:39,350
You laughed just a minute ago too!
It was terrible. You went "HAHA!" just now.

1539
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:40,290
Just now I was just trying to be childlike

1540
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:43,730
Just now I was just trying to be childlike

1541
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:46,930
Just trying to be childlike.

1542
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,230
Stinks!!

1543
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:53,840
It really stinks.

1544
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,840
Seriously, it's bad.

1545
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,940
But Matsumoto-san laughed too!

1546
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:02,410
Come on, watch him properly!

1547
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,280
You shouldn't try and frame others..

1548
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,050
Man this stinks so bad..

1549
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:11,050
How about the rest?

1550
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,050
Maybe the box smells as well?..

1551
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:15,060
There isn't anything..

1552
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,060
Nothing?

1553
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:15,260
Yes

1554
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,930
So just a DVD?

1555
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:17,660
there's nothingjust the DVD

1556
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,560
there's nothing just the DVD

1557
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,530
Matsumoto-san

1558
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:23,430
Only Matsumoto left

1559
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:24,470
Ye me too..

1560
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,470
I'm really scared..

1561
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:24,870
He's right.

1562
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:27,770
Maybe we can just leave it...

1563
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:29,770
No no, you have to open it.

1564
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,210
Shit..

1565
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:41,380
Mysterious letter

1566
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,180
What is it

1567
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,180
Just a small envelope..

1568
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,350
I can't believe anything at all now

1569
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,350
I can't believe anything at all now

1570
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,120
Eh?!

1571
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,060
What?

1572
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:54,060

01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,360
So that's what it was..

1576
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,830
It says 'Open Drawer number 18'

1577
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:58,200
drawer no. 18

1578
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:59,800
Man there are so many more drawers than usual...

1579
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:09,840
In the room, there are drawers labelled from 1 to 20

1580
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:01,900
There is definitely something up here..

1581
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,140
Please go ahead..

1582
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:05,140
There's like loads more drawers now than there has ever been..

1583

You're right..

1584

Shit that's scary.

1585
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:09,840
This is really freaky isn't it?

1586
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:11,880
It's very scary.

1587
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:13,850
It's very scary¡

1588
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:13,850
It's very scary¡

1589
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:13,850
It was very scary to.....

1590
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:19,420
Is there something inside?

1591
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,420
There might be another order..

1592
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,420
A second letter

1593
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,020

It's this one.

1601
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:30,730
That was so scary over there..

1602
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:33,700
They are just playing us like puppets.

1603
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:34,300
Ye, there was loads of space in that draw..

1604
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,080

The bottom over there..

1617
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:57,560
Man, they are just toying with me..

1618
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:05,300
Trap in....

1619
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:05,300
seconds

1620
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,000
Oh hold on, this one is the smallest..

1621
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Ye, you're right..

1622
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,170
AHHHHHH!

1623
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:10,770
AHHHHHH!

1624
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:11,740
My back..clicked out of place..

1625
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:15,310
My back, clicked out of place..

1626
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:18,910
What are you doing?

1627
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,420
For crying out loud..

1628
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,150

And again...

1631
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:30,960
Because from all the way down there..

1632
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,030
The drawer came out really easily

1633
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,400
Oh something happened?

1634
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:37,900
So the trap must have failed

1635
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:46,070

01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:46,070

It's this one..

1639
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:46,710
What is this?

1640
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:48,340
It just goes on and on..

1641
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:50,110
It's really annoying..

1642
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:55,620
Oh.. again..

1643
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:57,320
Again?

1644
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:57,320
That's really weird..

1645
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,720

1646
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:02,690
wooaaaaaa!

1647
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,960
They delayed it on purpose..

1648
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,100
Totally delayed it on purpose

1649
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:18,040
God he was so shocked..

1650
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:20,040
ahhh tanaka as well..

1651
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,010
Tanaka reacted so much as well..

1652
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:22,610
Did you hit your elbow somewhere?

1653
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:30,890
10:00 AM

1654
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:30,890
2 hours since the start

1655
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,890
Still not finished

1656
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:35,860
I understand the troubles,

1657
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:38,260
if we are dealing with everything that they set up

1658
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:40,560
The DVD also comes under it...

1659
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:46,840
DVDx2  haven't been watched

1660
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:41,160
I'm scared of this really...

1661
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,970
It's only Tanaka who hasn't sorted his thing out..

1662
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:46,230
He's unable to handle it

1663
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,870
I just can't go and just put it in...

1664
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:50,270
There are 2, right?

1665
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:52,470
Honestly, I don't think it will be just you Tanaka.

1666
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:53,980
Do you think this year, finally, it could be different?

1667
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,440
Do you think this year, finally, it could be different?

1668
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,850
Like you know...

1669
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:06,890
Airport

1670
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:06,890

Thai Kick 4 years straight from the DVDs

1674
01:03:57,050 --> 01:04:01,880
Yeah, if we push him to do it too much, and then it ends up being us..?

1675
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,520
Oh, that's true.

1676
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:05,020
That could happen...

1677
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,790
I hope not obviously...

1678
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:08,920
Go!!

1679
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:11,960
Seriously, um, please don't be me...

1680
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,460
You know, when did this whole, like, "Tanaka Thai Kick" thing start?

1681
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:16,830
It's been about 3 years

1682
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,600
Seems like it will be drama

1683
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:21,440
Was there one with a Drama?

1684
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,140
There have also been songs...

1685
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,440

Feelings of gratitude VIA Letter

1688
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:38,090
Feelings of gratitude VIA Letter

1689
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:48,260
This time, the appreciative feelings that want to be expressed

1690
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:52,670
Living in Osaka prefecture, 11 and 12 year old sisters

1691
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:55,270
Eh~~~~~!?

1692
01:04:55,470 --> 01:05:00,640
Even though he is always busy with work they say he always plays with them,  To their beloved father

1693
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,280
Papa portrait sketched by the sisters

1694
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:03,310
They will send their first letter ever to him

1695
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,620
What kind of person is your Dad?

1696
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:11,220
He appears on Television, that is his job

1697
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,250
He is an interesting and serious person.

1698
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,520
Eh~~~~~!?

1699
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:18,060
How is your Dad a serious person?

1700
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:20,800
He teaches us various things

1701
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,530
He tells us how to act when we're older and when we have to get a job

1702
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:31,270
Her dream is to be an actress. From the first daughter to Papa.

1703
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,110
... Oh, so her dream is to be an actress too?

1704
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,480
Yama-chan's face, hahaha

1705
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:39,910
Thank you for always doing your best at work.

1706
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:43,350
Thanks to Papa working very hard for us,

1707
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:47,790
the family can eat food and be very happy.

1708
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:50,660
I am truly grateful

1709
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:55,400
But there was that time when Papa said, "We're going to Osaka."

1710
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,500
I was very worried at that time if I could make friends

1711
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:08,940
But because Papa chose a really safe place to live and a great school for us, I was able to make really good friends.

1712
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:14,120
and that's thanks to Mum as well of course, but thanks to you Papa

1713
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:18,950
and recently, when you took me to Aoi Shima... I was extremely happy you know

1714
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:25,160
I hate it when you're drunk and all weird but when you play with us, it makes us happy.

1715
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:33,670
You can't do this. It's totally ruining the mood...

1716
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:33,670
received from his daughters

1717
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:40,910
The times when Papa is tired from work, and Momo wants to talk to you..

1718
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:44,380
when I have a fight with my friends, you teach me a lot of things

1719
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:51,590
and Papa, you have taught me how valuable family and friends are....

1720
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:56,820
from here on, even when you think you're tired from work, please continue to tell me things.

1721
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:01,600
And let's hang out as a family and have fun.

1722
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:06,400
Do your best, Love you Papa, Year 5, Class A- Yamasaki Momo

1723
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:15,810
Her dream is to be a manicurist, from the second daughter to Papa

1724
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:21,820
To Papa, for always doing your best at your work for the sake of your family, thank you.

1725
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:28,790
Even though you're always tired due to work, on your days off you play with me and it makes me happy

1726
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:36,860
Papa, I'm happy you're a storyteller now. I am really happy I have a Papa like that too.

1727
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:40,970
Thank you for teaching and developing us so well.

1728
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:43,640
I get to be fed by you,

1729
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:52,010
and you buy me the things I need in life, and you try your best in your job, you make us really happy Papa, so thank you.

1730
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:58,090
And also you protect our family as much as possible, thank you

1731
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:03,590
I have so much gratitude that I just cannot express with words.

1732
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:12,100
The things we do, admirable things, cheerleading, like Papa at work we will try twice as hard.

1733
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:17,610
From now on, with cheerleading, studying also, I will try even harder.

1734
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:24,280
Like Papa, even if it's a little bit, I want to make everyone a bit happier and treat my family well.

1735
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:26,810
and my friends as well...

1736
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:28,720
You can't do this. It's totally ruining the mood...

1737
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:30,620
From here on... please do your best at work.

1738
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,050
This was bad... It nearly set me off...

1739
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:35,860
Papa, thank you so much, I love you. Yamasaki Ara

1740

Yamasaki Momo

1745
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:57,310
You held out well, didn't you?

1746
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,520
Absolutely the wrong concept

1747
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,660
Absolutely the wrong concept

1748
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:16,860
What's this!?

1749
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:19,300
I properly wept at that..

1750
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:23,570
Yeah, I was close..

1751
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:26,810
The second disc is just too scary now...

1752
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:27,180
Ah, that might be

1753
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,240
Yeah, we all have kids...

1754
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,440
We all  have kids

1755
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,980
We all have kids

1756
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:34,980
That would be extremely weird

1757
01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:40,660
Has he gone for it?

1758
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:41,660
I put it in.

1759
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,660
It will be fine.

1760
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,660
It could be something totally different, I guess...

1761
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:45,630
Yeah that's true; we don't know that.

1762
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:49,800
People have feelings that they wish to tell...

1763
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:53,130
Feelings of gratitude via Letter

1764
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:55,970
Feelings of gratitude via Letter

1765
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,480
This time, the appreciative feelings that want to be expressed

1766
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:09,920
Living in Tokyo Prefecture, A 9 year old Boy

1767
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,620
9 year old Boy

1768
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:17,460
Even though he is always busy with work he says he always plays with him,  To his beloved father

1769
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:17,290
Papa portrait sketched by the son

1770
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:20,490
He will send his first letter

1771
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,900
What type of person is your Papa?

1772
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:29,600
He does comedy and performances I think...

1773
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,110
A Papa who plays with me.

1774
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:41,320
His dream is to be a cartoon writer. From son to Papa

1775
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:49,160
To Papa: On times off from work, you play with me

1776
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:51,090
Papa I love you

1777
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:55,160
But nowadays, you're so tired that even when you're at home,

1778
01:10:55,260 --> 01:11:02,600
you're sleeping a lot of the time. I'm sorry for throwing a football at your head when you're sleeping.

1779
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:01,100
Wife Kohinata Shie

1780
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:09,710
The time we went together to the park to play football was the best

1781
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:15,720
You said that if I put strings around the ball and did normal kick ups like that

1782
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,550
then I would get better at kick ups.

1783
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:27,300
So when I was able to do the drill better than before, I was really happy.

1784
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:35,740
Despite being tired you also came to my football match, that made me really happy.

1785
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:39,240
And recently, when you came to see my match,

1786
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:41,580
you told me I defended well.

1787
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:45,180
And you complimented me and it made me want to try harder.

1788
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:52,190
I heard from Mama, that Papa doesn't know a lot about soccer and you've never played it

1789
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:57,730
but you asked your friends about the rules of football, right?

1790
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:03,760
Thank you for studying about football for my sake

1791
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:09,970
When you go abroad to work, you take the lucky charm I made you

1792
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:14,680
Papa's protected treasures from his son

1793
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:15,280
And you always put it in your draw which contains the most important stuff

1794
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:19,350
On television, you always do weird things

1795
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:20,310
the next day

1796
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:26,890
My friends say a lot of nasty things and laugh at me a lot

1797
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:31,290
but to me, when I watch Papa on TV, I think you are cool;

1798
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:38,170
that's why the next time you watch my football match,

1799
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:44,410
in order to look good in front of you, I will try my best.

1800
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:48,540
Papa, thank you very much for everything.

1801
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,140
I love you

1802
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:54,850
From 3rd year red class Tanaka   Thai kick

1803
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:57,020
From 3rd year red class Tanaka Thai Kick

1804
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:10,400
His beloved son orders a Thai Kick

1805
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:16,740
What the hell is this?!

1806
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:18,210
Seriously, what the hell!?

1807
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:24,450
Papa Tanaka, do your best!!

1808
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:26,450
Man...

1809
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:29,380
You have no choice but to just try your best.

1810
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:32,120
Cry it all out

1811
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,300
Must be having various feelings

1812
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:47,970
Wow, so this is how humans react huh?

1813
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,640
It can't be helped

1814
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:55,440
They become like this I guess...

1815
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,750
You must have been glad

1816
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:04,690
Wait, you guys got nothing

1817
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:09,520
You must have been glad

1818
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,330
the ending wasn't good

1819
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:12,530
The ending was horrible

1820
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,830
Endo also looked like he was crying

1821
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,630
I was thinking about various things

1822
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,770
Maybe it's because it was about your comedy partner.

1823
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:21,500
The guy who kicked you might have a kid as well.

1824
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:27,140
The guy who kicked you might have a kid as well.

1825
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:37,420
Quite unexpected happening

1826
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:43,460
2:30 time since...

01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:15,260
No no, don't 'what's wrong' me

2194
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:26,300
Ye he's right to be honest..

2195
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:33,540
I felt so sorry for Hamada-san there.

2196
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:57,530
Song: Sing to Sachan's melody

2197

01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:57,530
Sachiko

2201
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:57,530
But because she is small

2202
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:57,530
she calls herself sachan

2203
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:57,530
How strange, Sachan

2204
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:58,100
Hosei-san let's go. Music start!

01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:22,720
meat and soup put together

2210
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:11,580
it works my tongue a lot

2211
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:22,720
it works my tongue a lot

2212
01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:14,780

And why 'coro'

2218
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:37,300
The only thing I can think of is Jinsei Kourou

2219
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:39,540
(Note: Jinsei Kourou = famous comedian duo back in 1950's)

2220

has chocolate in it and i love it

2233
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:19,350
but it's expensive

2234
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:19,350
so I can't open my wallet for it too often

2235
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:19,350
you're so expensive

2236
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:19,350

He is taking the piss!!

2241
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:34,760
He's really taking the piss

2242
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,100

2244
01:32:41,070 --> 01:32:43,340

2247
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:48,780

Hey!!

2252
01:32:54,910 --> 01:32:56,620
'You're expensive'and Can't open my wallet'are all negatives

2253
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:58,250
'You're expensive' and 'Can't open my wallet'are all negatives

2254
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:01,050
'You're expensive' and 'Can't open my wallet' are all negatives

2255
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,290
He's right

2256
01:33:00,290 --> 01:33:01,050
That's true

2257
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:05,260
I should have said 'you are wonderful'..

2258
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,260
Ye, that would have been better

2259
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:09,160

Shanghai Fried Noodles!

2266
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:15,230
It specifically says Shanghai, so ...

2267
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:14,730
There it is!

2268
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:35,320
It has a lot

2269
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:35,320
of vegetables and it's soft

2270
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:35,320
but some people like it

2271
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:35,320
and some people dislike it ha~

2272
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:35,320
there is division

2273
01:33:27,410 --> 01:33:35,320

01:33:31,550 --> 01:33:34,150
He's just talking about the place!!

2276
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:35,860
Is it a song about China?

2277
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:37,220
Are you talking about the name of the city?

2278
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:42,060
In the end, all he did was go to the city!!

2279
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:45,630
It's not related to fried noodles

2280
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:47,000
You should have said "noodles" instead

2281
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,030
You should have said "noodles" instead

2282
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:48,900
"I like it noodles"

2283
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,700
"I like it noodles"

2284
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:50,370
That would have been better

2285
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:50,770
Ah yeah!

2286
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:54,170
"There are people who dislike it" was included as well

2287
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:55,340
"There are people who dislike it"~

2288
01:33:57,710 --> 01:34:00,110
You could have stopped at "there are people who like it"

2289
01:33:58,710 --> 01:34:00,710
He ended it with the city

2290
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:02,780
It became a song about where you're going for New Year's.

2291
01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:03,180
Yes.

2292

Who will be with which android?

2969
01:48:52,770 --> 01:48:55,640
There are only two to choose from?

2970
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:56,640
What shall we do Hamada-san?

2971
01:48:56,170 --> 01:48:56,880
Are you participating?

2972
01:48:56,980 --> 01:48:57,780
How about your preferred?

2973
01:48:59,110 --> 01:49:01,650
Isn't the hag good for you?

2974
01:49:02,180 --> 01:49:05,320
The 'cougar' is right there she can hear you

2975
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,050
It's your choice

2976
01:49:07,890 --> 01:49:10,420
'He chose Barbie !!' is sort of what your face is saying

2977
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:11,660
Anyone would say they prefer Barbie(in this situation)

2978
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:14,290
Anyone would say they prefer Barbie(in this situation)

2979
01:49:14,730 --> 01:49:21,270
Monmari

2980
01:49:14,830 --> 01:49:21,270

Talent who write their name in Katakana

2990
01:49:21,370 --> 01:49:33,150
Katakana is a system of letters used to denote foreign influence or origin

2991
01:49:25,870 --> 01:49:27,310
Let's begin with this one

2992
01:49:26,000 --> 01:50:08,650
Talents' names which entered as Katakana

2993
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:30,680

Yuusuke Santamaria-san

2997
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:44,860
Completely in Katakana

2998
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:45,060
That is how it's written

2999
01:49:48,630 --> 01:49:50,260
He doesn't have many names in his head...

3000
01:49:53,730 --> 01:49:57,900
Ai George

3001
01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:00,510
You can just tell he doesn't have that many names left can't you!?

3002
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:03,180
They're already running out of names...

3003
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:06,710
Izumi Pinko-san

3004
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:06,950
That's a good one...

3005
01:50:08,550 --> 01:50:09,620
Stops doing that "um~~~" (thinking aloud)

3006
01:50:08,550 --> 01:50:42,050
Celebrities with Katakana's in their name

3007
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:11,920
Like he's blown a fuse...

3008
01:50:13,150 --> 01:50:16,920
Oh, Maggie.

3009
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:16,660
Oh, Maggie.

3010
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:20,290
Terakado Jimon-san

3011
01:50:20,230 --> 01:50:21,330
That was quick

3012
01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:22,460
He's giving names with ease.

3013
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,660
Our one is struggling already...

3014
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:25,730
He's cracking...

3015
01:50:26,330 --> 01:50:27,430
The cracks...

3016
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:31,000
There are loads, you know?

3017
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,610
Calm down, calm down...

3018
01:50:33,610 --> 01:50:35,110
You have to be kidding me...

3019
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:36,640
He's gone...

3020
01:50:37,580 --> 01:50:38,840
Rola, Rola, Rola...

3021
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:41,650
Time up!

3022
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:44,680
Unfortunately, you ran out of time...

3023
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:51,420
Celebrities with Katakana in their names

3024
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:51,420
Wada Akiko, Korokke, Shibasaki Kou

3025
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:51,420
Odagirishou, Utada Hikaru, Tamori, Piko

3026
01:50:45,750 --> 01:50:48,650
And because you ran out of time...

3027
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:51,920
Hamada-san's android... Come on...

3028
01:50:51,860 --> 01:50:53,930
Monmari Start!

3029
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:58,760
How close is she going to get?

3030
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:00,530
She's hungry, really hungry!

3031
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:04,440
She's coming really close...

3032
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:05,340
Oh man, she's getting closer...

3033
01:51:08,310 --> 01:51:09,370
This is bad...

3034
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:12,410
This is just...

3035
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:13,950
Right now... She has come quite close already...

3036
01:51:14,510 --> 01:51:15,350
Are you okay?

3037
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:31,300
Tokyo Metropolitan Areas

3038
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:18,080
Shinjuku

3039
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:17,920
good...

3040
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:20,590
Edogawa

3041
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:20,950
In the next round, both did very well...

3042
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:23,860
Shinagawa

3043
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:23,020
and gave a lot of answers, but...

3044
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:25,360
Oh, he's struggling...

3045
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:26,190
He's definitely struggling...

3046
01:51:26,090 --> 01:51:31,300
Shinagawaku!

3047
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:34,830
The distance between them and disaster evened out...

3048
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:37,200
The two guys were at a tie

3049
01:51:35,530 --> 01:51:37,140
Right, let's carry on...

3050
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:39,300
National Holidays

3051
01:51:39,570 --> 01:52:27,150
National Holidays

3052
01:51:41,370 --> 01:51:45,280
First up, Hayame

3053
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,950
Kiss Monmari, Start.

3054
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:51,120
Sports Day (holiday)

3055
01:51:54,890 --> 01:51:55,820
Oh you have gotta be kidding me...

3056
01:51:55,390 --> 01:52:00,290
Labor Thanksgiving day

3057
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:58,660
Oh, good.

3058
01:51:58,660 --> 01:51:59,790
They're starting to struggle...

3059
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:03,800
Marine day

3060
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:12,600
Hes taking way too long...

3061
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:13,610
Wait, wait, just wait a second...

3062
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:17,840
What do you mean "wait, wait"? Can he do that?

3063
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:19,640
What kind of time do you need?

3064
01:52:19,810 --> 01:52:26,990
(morning of) New Year's Day

3065
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:29,450
That, unfortunately, is not technically a "national holiday"

3066
01:52:27,790 --> 01:52:33,790
National holidays

3067
01:52:27,790 --> 01:52:33,790
What Hamada said is only the morning, therefore not a national holiday.

3068
01:52:27,790 --> 01:52:33,790
coming of age day, National Foundation day, Vernal Equinox Day, Day of culture

3069
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:31,060
And that means...

3070
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:33,690
And that means, Hamada-san's android, go!

3071
01:52:34,030 --> 01:52:36,390
Monmari start

3072
01:52:40,570 --> 01:52:42,070
What's wrong?

3073
01:52:42,070 --> 01:52:43,740
Oh this is dangerous

3074
01:52:46,770 --> 01:52:48,170
You're in serious danger now!

3075
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:50,840
not able to hear anything

3076
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:51,440
The next one is going to...

3077
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,910
Right, next, we have...

3078
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:56,620
Groups which are part of the Janeez (pretty boy groups)

3079
01:52:56,920 --> 01:53:24,780
groups which are part of Janeez

3080
01:52:57,220 --> 01:52:58,780
You should know a lot of them...

3081
01:52:59,180 --> 01:53:00,550
Right first, Hamada starts...

3082
01:53:00,950 --> 01:53:04,360
Right, Let's... go!

3083
01:53:07,390 --> 01:53:08,690
that's obvious...

3084
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:15,030
Arashi

3085
01:53:13,930 --> 01:53:15,170
Okay good, keep going...

3086
01:53:16,330 --> 01:53:17,840
He's keeping up...

3087
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:26,410
Oh dear...

3088
01:53:27,150 --> 01:53:33,990
Shounenbu, Kinki Kids, Takki and Tsubasa, NEWS

3089
01:53:27,150 --> 01:53:33,990
Groups part of the Janeez

3090
01:53:27,150 --> 01:53:33,990
Kan Janee 8, KAT-KUN, Kis-My-Ft2

3091
01:53:27,210 --> 01:53:30,520
Deary deary deary me...

3092
01:53:27,850 --> 01:53:30,420
I didn't hear it... Did he say Tokio?

3093
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:31,820
he did say it...

3094
01:53:30,820 --> 01:53:31,780
Yes, I did say Tokio.

3095
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:32,780
He said "Tokio-san"

3096
01:53:33,590 --> 01:53:36,350
And that means, Hamada-san's android...

3097
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:38,160
Come on!!

3098
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:42,460
Monmari Start

3099
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:42,490
Grab him hard...

3100
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:51,700
I can't watch...

3101
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,340
Go on, keep going...

3102
01:53:54,510 --> 01:53:57,340
This is so much worse than an "android"...

3103
01:54:08,050 --> 01:54:12,120
After the training, they want to rest now but...

3104
01:54:15,690 --> 01:54:16,490
That was harsh...

3105
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:23,300
The next trap has already started...

3106
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:21,770
The next trap has already started now...

3107
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:23,240
Is it really safe?

3108
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:24,100
For crying out loud...

3109
01:54:27,870 --> 01:54:29,040
It's on Hamada-san's desk

3110
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:31,180
It's on Hamada-san's desk

3111
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:30,740
yep, that's right...

3112
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:32,310
It has nothing to do with us...

3113
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:35,250
Mysterious button

3114
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:32,910
Yup...

3115
01:54:33,140 --> 01:54:35,110
There is definitely something going on...

3116
01:54:39,550 --> 01:54:41,690
Because I'm wearing thick socks...

3117
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:45,790
I'm really hot...

3118
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:47,230
The trousers as well...

3119
01:54:50,460 --> 01:54:51,300
Yamasaki-san was just casually laughing

3120
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:52,730
Yamasaki-san was just casually laughing...

3121
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:57,840
I know...

3122
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:58,340
Yup...

3123
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:00,610
Is it like a Barbie

3124
01:55:00,970 --> 01:55:01,770
personalized flavour?

3125
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:02,540
Yeah...

3126
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:06,110
I don't really need to push that button...

3127
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:07,810
But it was on Hamada-san's desk...

3128
01:55:07,650 --> 01:55:08,550
It was there from the start.

3129
01:55:08,610 --> 01:55:09,880
We haven't moved it or anything.

3130
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:11,820
It says, "Whatever happens, do not push."

3131
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:12,480
Yeah yeah, we swear.

3132
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:18,220
Man, it was so cold...

3133
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:33,470
Hamada

3134
01:55:18,560 --> 01:56:00,570
responsibility of pushing the button

3135
01:55:19,930 --> 01:55:46,380
Endo

3136
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:25,530
It says, "Whatever happens, do not push."

3137
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,160
Exactly...

3138
01:55:26,830 --> 01:55:28,930
So I don't think we have to push it...

3139
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:34,070
It's just a button, we don't have to...

3140
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:35,210
Don't bring it here... come on...

3141
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:46,380
Hamada

3142
01:55:33,810 --> 01:56:00,570
Housei

3143
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:42,280
Well usually the person who pushes the button... has to be... Tanaka

3144
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:43,080
Eh?

3145
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:46,950
If you say button, it has got to be you...

3146
01:55:46,380 --> 01:56:00,570
Endo

3147
01:55:46,380 --> 01:56:00,570
Hamada

3148
01:55:46,750 --> 01:56:00,570
Tanaka

3149
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:50,620
I honestly haven't had buttons in my drawers... like ever...

3150
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:53,330
I don't think it will be like "because you pushed it, you get punished"...

3151
01:55:53,390 --> 01:55:55,630
Yeah, it was orginally on Hamada-san's desk...

3152
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:59,160
I don't think it will be a punishment to the person who pushed the button...

3153
01:56:00,570 --> 01:56:03,030
Come on, push it...

3154
01:56:06,570 --> 01:56:21,750
Emmanuel (Webster)

3155
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:18,380
Natually they look at the monitor

3156
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:18,850
Wait, what is this?

3157
01:56:22,090 --> 01:56:25,620
After the break

3158
01:56:22,090 --> 01:56:25,620
She's back!! Matsuko deluxe

3159
01:56:28,090 --> 01:57:14,670
Emmanuel (Webster)

3160
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:39,870
Natually, they look at the monitor

3161
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:40,370
Wait, what is this?

3162
01:56:48,010 --> 01:56:49,980
How many times are you going to come out?

3163
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:52,650
Emmanuel (Webster)

3164
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:52,650
Matsuko Deluxe

3165
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:51,080
You've come out too much on here, surely?

3166
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:52,750
How many times are you going to come out?

3167
01:56:52,750 --> 01:56:53,850
He's working too hard...

3168
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:55,590
Look at that...

3169
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:59,790
The screw moving him falls off

3170
01:56:55,590 --> 01:56:56,650
The screw came off...

3171
01:56:56,860 --> 01:56:59,090
What are you doing?

3172
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:58,720
The screw came right off...

3173
01:57:00,530 --> 01:57:02,030
How long are you going to do that?

3174
01:57:02,190 --> 01:57:03,600
What kind of face is that?

3175
01:57:02,190 --> 01:57:04,560
Surely you need the screw to move...

3176
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:05,400
I get it Matsuko... Please forgive me

3177
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:08,230
I get it Matsuko... Please forgive me

3178
01:57:08,230 --> 01:57:13,970
Giving a lovely smile

3179
01:57:12,670 --> 01:57:14,370
Look, we were totally in the wrong...

3180
01:57:15,270 --> 01:57:16,980
Like seriously...

3181
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:18,810
She's amazing...

3182
01:57:21,710 --> 01:57:25,120
She's here the whole time!!

3183
01:57:23,110 --> 01:57:24,780
Like the whole time!

3184
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:24,720
come on guys...

3185
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:27,550
So she wasn't done yet...

3186
01:57:33,430 --> 01:57:38,930
Emmanuel comes out

3187
01:57:33,430 --> 01:57:38,930
Push button

3188
01:57:34,330 --> 01:57:36,590
So there's no point pushing it...

3189
01:57:35,890 --> 01:57:36,660
No, no point at all...

3190
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:38,560
Just annoying...

3191
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:39,230
There's no point, no point...

3192
01:57:40,330 --> 01:57:44,200
If we press it again, will she come out again?

3193
01:57:41,670 --> 01:57:43,330
Oh just leave it...

3194
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:46,500
I'm not sure, she might not...

3195
01:57:46,970 --> 01:58:24,940
Emmanuel

3196
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:03,520
Emmanuel returns again

3197
01:58:00,690 --> 01:58:01,590
She's back...

3198
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:04,620
As we thought...

3199
01:58:05,690 --> 01:58:06,930
It fell again...

3200
01:58:06,390 --> 01:58:10,960
Screw moving her falls off

3201
01:58:07,490 --> 01:58:08,390
It fell off again

3202
01:58:07,890 --> 01:58:09,760
Seriously, leave it out!

3203
01:58:09,490 --> 01:58:10,960
We've already seen this...

3204
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:14,430
Why does that screw always fall off?

3205
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:13,830
I know, and she still moves...

3206
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:15,930
Your screw came off...

3207
01:58:16,330 --> 01:58:18,040
Here she comes...

3208
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:24,840
Giving another lovely smile

3209
01:58:20,910 --> 01:58:22,570
She's massive

3210
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:24,880
Why did they cast her to do it?

3211
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:26,710
The original kid was no where near that big...

3212
01:58:26,710 --> 01:58:29,280
He was so cute...

3213
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:31,120
And that screw thing sticking out of her back creeps me out...

3214
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:33,280
It's just like...

3215
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:37,920
Well obviously...

3216
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:38,960
Again...

3217
01:58:38,990 --> 01:58:41,730
So if we press it, she comes out...

3218
01:58:52,270 --> 01:58:52,870
Okay...

3219
01:58:53,670 --> 01:58:54,970
My butt is likenearing its end

3220
01:58:54,970 --> 01:58:56,340
My butt is like nearing its end

3221
01:58:56,540 --> 01:58:58,810
Yeah, my butt is as well...

3222
01:58:57,840 --> 01:58:58,940
Same here...

3223
01:58:58,810 --> 01:59:01,510
If we press it one more time, I wonder if she comes out?

3224
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:48,860
Emmanuel

3225
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:07,190
For crying out loud...

3226
01:59:07,290 --> 01:59:08,290
Will she actually come?

3227
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:10,620
This will be the 3rd time

3228
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:10,920
Surely not...

3229
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:11,120
No way...

3230
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:13,690
No way...

3231
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:23,200
Press the button and she WILL come

3232
01:59:19,530 --> 01:59:20,270
She has come!

3233
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:24,100
She's coming!!

3234
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:31,180
The screw falls off again

3235
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:27,810
So however many times...

3236
01:59:27,770 --> 01:59:29,340
Cannot hear

3237
01:59:29,770 --> 01:59:31,140
It's the face she makes as she comes out...

3238
01:59:31,140 --> 01:59:31,640
Seriously, enough...

3239
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:32,740
She is kind of cute...

3240
01:59:33,110 --> 01:59:34,010
Let's go our separate ways...

3241
01:59:35,780 --> 01:59:37,220
yeah, let's move on...

3242
01:59:39,950 --> 01:59:44,820
Emmanuel confiscates the button

3243
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:43,960
She's telling us to give her a break

3244
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:45,620
Okay we get it...

3245
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:48,390
You want to rest, right?

3246
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:55,770
We are sorry...

3247
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:57,340
That was fun...

3248
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:58,640
Seriously...

3249
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:00,610
My butt is like...

3250
02:00:05,180 --> 02:00:06,340
Seriously...

3251
02:00:05,910 --> 02:00:08,910
Seriously, my butt is quite...

3252
02:00:07,910 --> 02:00:10,920
My butt is in trouble...

3253
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:14,150
Those foundation materials aren't really...

3254
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:13,890
Yeah they are a bit...

3255
02:00:14,650 --> 02:00:16,550
Isn't this a little bit hard?

3256
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:18,720
I'm worn out

3257
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:21,090
I want to take a shower

3258
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:25,100
Guys,  you've started to look more like an Earth Defense Force, don't you think?

3259
02:00:25,100 --> 02:00:25,600
Guys, you've started to look more likean Earth Defense Force, don't you think?

3260
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,530
Guys, you've started to look more like







an Earth Defense Force, don't you think?

3261
02:00:27,570 --> 02:00:30,900
Not at all!!

3262
02:00:28,770 --> 02:00:30,440
We still have a long way to go...

3263
02:00:30,700 --> 02:00:32,800
Where were you looking?

3264
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:32,800
Starting from now,

3265
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:39,840
we will move to the Earth Defense Force's training center, of course, in order to undergo a special training. Shall we go?

3266
02:00:35,670 --> 02:00:39,840
we will move to the Earth Defense Force's training center, of course, in order to undergo a special training. Shall we go?

3267
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:39,840
we will move to the Earth Defense Force's training center, of course, in order to undergo a special training. Shall we go?

3268
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:48,250
In order to further skill up the members,


they'll go to the Earth Defense Force's training facility

3269
02:00:40,710 --> 02:00:42,110
Let's do this

3270
02:00:42,110 --> 02:00:45,220
Where are we going? Outside?

3271
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:47,590
Obviously we're going to reach it by going outside

3272
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:48,390
You gotta be lying...

3273
02:00:48,390 --> 02:00:49,750
Seriously?

3274
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:50,760
By bus!?

3275
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:52,920
It's freezing!

3276
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:54,030
They enter the bus a second time

3277
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:58,160
They enter the bus a second time

3278
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:55,990
It means that, naturally,

3279
02:00:54,490 --> 02:00:58,160
It will be a severe journey

3280
02:00:55,990 --> 02:00:58,160
it will be a severe journey

3281
02:01:03,030 --> 02:01:11,340
On those who waited before...

A new battle curtain is rising!

3282
02:01:12,610 --> 02:01:15,210
1:30 PM

3283
02:01:13,910 --> 02:01:18,680
5 hours and half since the Earth Defense Force's training began

3284
02:01:15,410 --> 02:01:18,680
The 5 are having an eye on the bus which is taking them to the training facility

3285
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:21,350
There is no need to say that the journey won't be easy

3286
02:01:21,350 --> 02:01:23,520
There is no need to say that the journey won't be easy

3287
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:24,560
Yeah we got this, let's move forward

3288
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:29,290
Isn't that the same bus as before?

3289
02:01:28,590 --> 02:01:29,290
Really?

3290
02:01:29,290 --> 02:01:34,230
Arrived at the stop

3291
02:01:29,290 --> 02:01:34,230
Arrived at the stop

3292
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:34,130
It stopped again...

3293
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:33,630
You've got to be kidding me...

3294
02:01:33,630 --> 02:01:35,530
This one stops too?

3295
02:01:41,710 --> 02:01:43,740
Crap...

3296
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:49,410
Catwoman: Anna Tsuchiya

3297
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:49,410
Catwoman: Anna Tsuchiya

3298
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:49,410
Joker: Yuuki Himura

3299
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:49,410
Joker: Yuuki Himura

3300
02:01:43,780 --> 02:01:46,540
Whoa, that was...

3301
02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:48,980
That's totally impossible

3302
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:53,150
What the hell do you mean by
"Totally Impossible"!?

3303
02:01:52,020 --> 02:01:53,150
What the hell do you mean by
"Totally Impossible"!?

3304
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:55,050
"Totally impossible"

3305
02:01:54,090 --> 02:01:55,420
I wonder what

3306
02:01:55,290 --> 02:01:56,520
Move

3307
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:59,290
It's impossible to take a position

3308
02:01:58,320 --> 02:01:59,290
Really impossible

3309
02:01:59,290 --> 02:02:00,730
Yeah, it's bad

3310
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:05,830
Awesome, huh?

3311
02:02:07,130 --> 02:02:09,000
Crap, that's regrettable

3312
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:09,000
Regrettable!

3313
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,040
Yeah, we did

3314
02:02:09,730 --> 02:02:11,040
But we tried with everything we had, right?

3315
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:12,470
Yeah, we did

3316
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:15,210
Because we can wear these suits and still casually

3317
02:02:14,270 --> 02:02:15,210
Uh...

3318
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:17,140
make the audience laugh

3319
02:02:16,170 --> 02:02:17,140
Yeah you're right...

3320
02:02:16,170 --> 02:02:24,120
The two are sluggish comedians

3321
02:02:17,380 --> 02:02:18,680
We usually can

3322
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:20,040
What I think is that

3323
02:02:20,140 --> 02:02:22,980
The outfit can't be wrong, right?

3324
02:02:21,010 --> 02:02:22,980
What the?

3325
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:25,080
He's so fat!

3326
02:02:26,350 --> 02:02:30,620
Should we show those people  our jokes?

3327
02:02:27,390 --> 02:02:27,990
uh..?

3328
02:02:27,990 --> 02:02:30,620
Should we show those people our jokes?

3329
02:02:29,220 --> 02:02:30,920
Should we?

3330
02:02:32,220 --> 02:02:33,490
Um, excuse us

3331
02:02:32,990 --> 02:02:33,490
Hm

3332
02:02:33,490 --> 02:02:35,590
Being comedians

3333
02:02:34,930 --> 02:02:35,590
Right

3334
02:02:35,590 --> 02:02:38,960
We would like to perform our skits, would you like to see our jokes?

3335
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:40,770
Yes of course, please

3336
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:41,670
Very well

3337
02:02:40,930 --> 02:02:42,430

Sorry, we need your help

I'm here

3349

Are you serious?

3350
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:59,850
I'm on duty... and so are you!

3351
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:00,950
Ah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

3352

I literally did all the work by myself...

3353

I'm sorry

3354
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:06,720
Tell me, is there any remaining work to do?

3355
02:03:08,230 --> 02:03:10,160
I must move this desk to the science room

3356
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:11,160
Ah, I got it

3357
02:03:10,290 --> 02:03:12,360
It doesn't matter, I'll do it by myself

Oy oy, wait, what are you doin'?

3360

Because you're a woman

3361
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:19,500
You must leave this kind of

Right

3378
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:52,500

Could we stop this at once?

3393
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:22,730
This is getting our butts slapped, you know...

3394
02:04:21,630 --> 02:04:24,700
Why am I getting slapped for this?!

3395
02:04:22,730 --> 02:04:24,500

One thing after another


The bus journey will get worse and worse...

3498
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:25,520
Again...

3499
02:07:24,380 --> 02:07:27,350
Arrived at the stop

3500
02:07:24,380 --> 02:07:27,350
Arrived at the stop

3501
02:07:29,250 --> 02:07:31,160
Enough with those...

3502
02:07:29,250 --> 02:07:31,720
That's enough, seriously...

3503
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:34,590
What should we feel once the bus stops?

3504
02:07:48,270 --> 02:07:50,880
What should we feel once the bus stops?

3505
02:07:51,380 --> 02:07:54,410
Earth Defense Force executive staff:
Itao Itsuji

3506
02:07:51,380 --> 02:07:54,410
Earth Defense Force executive staff:
: Itao Itsuji

3507
02:07:58,020 --> 02:08:01,890
Deep fat executive staff: Itao's wife

3508
02:07:58,020 --> 02:08:01,890
Deep fat executive staff: Itao's wife

3509
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:03,150
She looks strange!

3510
02:08:03,150 --> 02:08:05,120
These two again?

3511
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:08,330
Her form changed way too much, ain't I right?

3512
02:08:06,620 --> 02:08:08,090
You think so?

3513
02:08:08,090 --> 02:08:09,960
She looks the same to me

3514
02:08:09,890 --> 02:08:19,700
His wife has not appeared for a while due to maternity leave.
She gained weight after her pregnancy.

3515
02:08:09,890 --> 02:08:19,700
Wife long time ago

3516
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:12,630
Of course not!

3517
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:13,530
You sure?

3518
02:08:14,370 --> 02:08:15,900
Deep-fat

3519
02:08:15,330 --> 02:08:16,900
Must have been after the maternity leave

3520
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:19,400
I heard about that

3521
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:20,710
That's right...

3522
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:20,710
Right?

3523
02:08:20,710 --> 02:08:21,870
Those people are, you know, the Earth Defense Force's big shots, a married couple

3524
02:08:21,870 --> 02:08:24,340
Those people are, you know, the Earth Defense







Force's big shots, a married couple

3525
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:26,510
They also gave birth to a baby recently. They are in the midst of happiness.

3526
02:08:26,510 --> 02:08:29,010
They also gave birth to a baby recently.







They are in the midst of happiness.

3527
02:08:29,210 --> 02:08:30,980
What the hell?

3528
02:08:31,780 --> 02:08:34,090
What was that speech?

3529
02:08:34,890 --> 02:08:36,720
It was nothing!

3530
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:54,870
What kind of situation is this?

3531
02:08:55,870 --> 02:08:59,740
Well, they love each other

3532
02:08:57,140 --> 02:08:59,110
Well, yeah

3533
02:08:58,080 --> 02:08:59,110
That's strange, though

3534
02:08:59,110 --> 02:09:00,210
Very passionate indeed

3535
02:09:00,210 --> 02:09:02,310
They're loving each other

3536
02:09:02,410 --> 02:09:05,320
I don't get what she's doing though...

3537
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:08,790
I wonder if that's different from our culture...

3538
02:09:13,590 --> 02:09:17,600
Their mutual love is unstoppable

3539
02:09:20,430 --> 02:09:23,630
Don't do this, don't

3540
02:09:23,700 --> 02:09:24,900
Stop with that!

3541
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:28,110
They're holding so firmly!

3542
02:09:28,110 --> 02:09:29,470
What is the point of that?

3543
02:09:28,770 --> 02:09:30,140
What the hell, man

3544
02:09:30,140 --> 02:09:33,040
It's a little weird to do that here, come on...

3545
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:34,610
Wait a second!!

3546
02:09:34,610 --> 02:09:45,260
He spotted something outside the window

3547
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:41,050
Not fair...

3548
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:41,950
What's that? Over there

3549
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:51,960
Dating agency with Suga from 25 years ago when he was a model

3550
02:09:48,990 --> 02:09:51,400
Wait, that's a dirty trick.

3551
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:52,660
What the hell?!

3552
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:53,230
What the hell is that?

3553
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:54,570
I can see it

3554
02:09:53,230 --> 02:09:54,130
Eeeeh?

3555
02:09:54,130 --> 02:09:54,570
Huh?

3556
02:09:54,570 --> 02:09:56,230
Jeez!

3557
02:09:55,400 --> 02:09:56,400
What does this mean?

3558
02:09:56,400 --> 02:09:57,800
Suga...

3559
02:09:57,030 --> 02:09:59,100
We don't need this right now!

3560
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,910
What does that mean?

3561
02:10:00,910 --> 02:10:03,170
Was that being there just a coincidence?

3562
02:10:03,170 --> 02:10:05,240
It's called "Sugakuru"

3563
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:09,110
What's that ad for? That's a young Suga-san

3564
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:09,110
What's that ad for? That's a young Suga-san

3565
02:10:09,110 --> 02:10:11,380
Something for dating and such...

3566
02:10:09,710 --> 02:10:10,880
Oh, I think you're right

3567
02:10:11,380 --> 02:10:14,550
Because Love is even written on it.

3568
02:10:16,450 --> 02:10:22,790
The advertising car is chasing them

3569
02:10:16,450 --> 02:10:22,790
m 4 0 l 371 0 b 375 0 375 1 375 8 l 375 8 b 375 24 375 25 371 25 l 3 25 b 0 25 0 24 0 8 b 0 1 0 0 4 0

3570
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:21,090
Good Morning, Everyone!

3571
02:10:21,090 --> 02:10:22,790

3573

Providing you with the best we can! Enjoy our service!

3578
02:10:37,270 --> 02:10:40,610
The advertising car also stopped

3579
02:10:37,270 --> 02:10:40,610
m 4 0 l 371 0 b 375 0 375 1 375 8 l 375 8 b 375 24 375 25 371 25 l 3 25 b 0 25 0 24 0 8 b 0 1 0 0 4 0

3580
02:10:43,110 --> 02:10:50,720
The typical song of Itao's wife's dance

3581
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:56,660
You're going to do it?!!

3582
02:10:57,160 --> 02:11:03,030
Strange Itao dance

3583
02:10:57,160 --> 02:11:03,030
m 4 0 l 371 0 b 375 0 375 1 375 8 l 375 8 b 375 24 375 25 371 25 l 3 25 b 0 25 0 24 0 8 b 0 1 0 0 4 0

3584
02:10:58,600 --> 02:11:00,360
I thought his wife would...

3585
02:10:59,460 --> 02:11:01,530
Don't do this!

3586
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:02,730
He's not dancing at all

3587
02:11:02,730 --> 02:11:04,400
That's not even a dance

3588
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,800
That character of his...

3589
02:11:07,470 --> 02:11:09,040
Looks like he's mimicking something!

3590
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:09,970
He's nimble

3591
02:11:09,970 --> 02:11:11,840
He's nimble!

3592
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:14,410
These moves...

3593
02:11:14,410 --> 02:11:17,880
Looks like a mime though, that's so intense!

3594
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:17,880
Looks like a mime though, that's so intense!

3595
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:19,550
He has the moves

3596
02:11:19,550 --> 02:11:22,350
He's not following the rhythm at all.

3597
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:22,350
True

3598
02:11:22,450 --> 02:11:23,720
Uh, yeah

3599
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:28,790
His wife is...

3600
02:11:27,730 --> 02:11:28,790
His wife, uh?

3601
02:11:28,790 --> 02:11:31,400
Is it the wife's go now?

3602
02:11:30,660 --> 02:11:34,270
Well obviously his wife had to do this.

3603
02:11:34,230 --> 02:11:38,900
Fat but sharp: Distinguished

3604
02:11:34,230 --> 02:11:38,900
m 4 0 l 371 0 b 375 0 375 1 375 8 l 375 8 b 375 24 375 25 371 25 l 3 25 b 0 25 0 24 0 8 b 0 1 0 0 4 0

3605
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:37,430
Please, not this!

3606
02:11:37,130 --> 02:11:38,540
That's bad

3607
02:11:43,170 --> 02:11:43,340
Watch out!!

3608
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:43,470
Watch out!!

3609
02:11:43,470 --> 02:11:43,670
Watch out!!

3610
02:11:43,670 --> 02:11:46,440
Watch out!!

3611
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:45,240
That's...

3612
02:11:45,240 --> 02:11:46,940
That's dangerous!

3613
02:11:49,480 --> 02:11:52,120
Well, I must say it was amazing

3614
02:11:52,350 --> 02:11:54,080
Really, this

3615
02:11:54,080 --> 02:11:55,720
She's teasing us

3616
02:11:56,550 --> 02:11:59,720
It appeared, uh? Her former step

3617
02:11:57,520 --> 02:11:59,720
It appeared, uh? Her former step

3618
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:03,690
Well actually her moves haven't really changed at all, right?

3619
02:12:01,190 --> 02:12:03,690
Well actually her moves haven't really changed at all, right?

3620
02:12:01,830 --> 02:12:03,690
They haven't!

3621
02:12:12,500 --> 02:12:14,470
Careful!

3622
02:12:13,870 --> 02:12:14,970
Whoa!

3623
02:12:14,470 --> 02:12:15,770
Landed

3624
02:12:15,770 --> 02:12:17,440
That person completely changed, don't you think?

3625
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:20,910
Well, kinda, she got fatter

3626
02:12:20,910 --> 02:12:21,650
She's still doing it

3627
02:12:21,650 --> 02:12:24,320
She's still doing it

3628
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:26,280
No, wait...

3629
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:26,280
They are still doing it

3630
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:28,790
They have such a good relationship!

3631
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:30,750
Still doing it...

3632
02:12:30,750 --> 02:12:32,420
Looks like it

3633
02:12:33,820 --> 02:12:36,960
They're so resolute

3634
02:12:35,330 --> 02:12:36,960
I understand...

3635
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:46,100
It hurts...

3636
02:12:47,670 --> 02:12:48,970
Ah, what a relief

3637
02:12:52,810 --> 02:12:55,210
Ah~ They're still doing it.

3638
02:12:54,310 --> 02:12:55,210
Ah~ They're still doing it.

3639
02:12:58,580 --> 02:12:59,580
They're running!

3640
02:12:59,580 --> 02:13:02,250
They're reaching us by running!

3641
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:03,550
Wait~

3642
02:13:03,550 --> 02:13:06,820
That's not even his character...

3643
02:13:04,050 --> 02:13:06,820
That's not even his character...

3644
02:13:12,390 --> 02:13:18,930
After their time of migration with the bus has ended,

3645
02:13:12,390 --> 02:13:18,930
the training center draws nearer, right before their eyes!!

3646
02:13:19,530 --> 02:13:22,040
Guys, you'll soon start your next training

3647
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:26,070
You should now be able to see the Earth Defense Force training center

3648
02:13:23,670 --> 02:13:26,070
You should now be able to see the Earth Defense Force training center

3649
02:13:34,680 --> 02:13:38,590
The setting of this "Absolutely do not laugh" that rises under Mount Fuji:

3650
02:13:38,590 --> 02:13:42,260
Gasu Kurobikari Defense Force of Earth Training center

3651
02:13:43,420 --> 02:13:46,290
And inside the facility's field

3652
02:13:46,290 --> 02:13:48,760
There's even a circuit track

3653
02:13:49,160 --> 02:13:52,730
In this huge training facility for this elite group,

3654
02:13:49,160 --> 02:13:56,800
A new battle against the assassins is going to begin!

3655
02:13:49,160 --> 02:13:56,800
Members will undergo  training

3656
02:13:59,870 --> 02:14:02,640
This is so freaking huge...

3657
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:02,640
Yeah

3658
02:14:02,650 --> 02:14:04,450
We arrived, guys. Let's get off, okay?

3659
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:08,690
That's the place where we're going to train?

3660
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:06,680
It is

3661
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:08,320
Training...

3662
02:14:09,090 --> 02:14:12,260
Shall we go?

3663
02:14:09,950 --> 02:14:10,650
Are we getting off?

3664
02:14:10,650 --> 02:14:12,060
Before me, please

3665
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:13,520
Go, please

3666
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:13,520
Getting off?

3667
02:14:15,530 --> 02:14:20,500
Inside the facility, the sound of the brake echoes

3668
02:14:15,530 --> 02:14:20,500
m 4 0 l 371 0 b 375 0 375 1 375 8 l 375 8 b 375 24 375 25 371 25 l 3 25 b 0 25 0 24 0 8 b 0 1 0 0 4 0

3669
02:14:16,430 --> 02:14:19,300
Come on, we arrived

3670
02:14:18,500 --> 02:14:20,300
I could hear a "kikikiki"

3671
02:14:28,040 --> 02:14:29,510
That was~

3672
02:14:28,870 --> 02:14:32,140
That freaking sound!

3673
02:14:31,580 --> 02:14:33,480
Its timing was lethal

3674
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:35,650
That's, without a doubt, not good!

3675
02:14:35,650 --> 02:14:38,750
That's DEFINITELY going to be something bad for us

3676
02:14:36,910 --> 02:14:38,750
That's DEFINITELY going to be something bad for us

3677
02:14:37,010 --> 02:14:37,950
You're right!

3678
02:14:37,950 --> 02:14:39,520
Why that sound?

3679
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:41,190
We were even able to hear it to that extent

3680
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:42,690
Of course we know already, we're not stupid...

3681
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:50,230
What's with that sound?

3682
02:14:48,730 --> 02:14:52,300
I got it now, I got it...

3683
02:14:51,030 --> 02:14:52,300
I had already enough...

3684
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:55,870
The smell of trouble is strong...

3685
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:54,500
Right?

3686
02:14:55,870 --> 02:14:57,470
That's the training facility.An amazing place, right?

3687
02:14:57,470 --> 02:15:00,540
That's the training facility.An amazing place, right?

3688
02:14:57,840 --> 02:14:59,240
That "kikiki" keeps going

3689
02:14:59,240 --> 02:15:00,540
Oh, this way

3690
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:06,380
That's the center where, as occasion calls, the trainees undergo training

3691
02:15:00,940 --> 02:15:07,740
Earth Defense Force: Training Center

3692
02:15:08,750 --> 02:15:09,950
So

3693
02:15:10,910 --> 02:15:12,720
Awesome!

3694
02:15:11,350 --> 02:15:12,720
Wow

3695
02:15:12,720 --> 02:15:15,020
Unusual

3696
02:15:13,620 --> 02:15:15,020
Interesting

3697
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:16,250
Amazing, though

3698
02:15:15,690 --> 02:15:16,790
Yeah

3699
02:15:16,250 --> 02:15:17,550
I wonder how it is inside...

3700
02:15:18,590 --> 02:15:23,030
I think that  I probably won't be good at this...

3701
02:15:20,620 --> 02:15:23,030
I think that I probably  won't be good at this...

3702
02:15:23,790 --> 02:15:26,300
What's with this hugeness?

3703
02:15:23,830 --> 02:15:29,930
Training Center - Second Floor

3704
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:28,370
It's ridiculously enormous!

3705
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:28,370
Uh huh

3706
02:15:28,830 --> 02:15:30,270
This way

3707
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:35,040
Wow, it's amazing...

3708
02:15:36,010 --> 02:15:37,980
I wonder how this time will...

3709
02:15:37,010 --> 02:15:38,210
Whoa!!

3710
02:15:38,110 --> 02:15:40,740
Guys, that's the training facility's

3711
02:15:38,680 --> 02:15:44,050
Rookie's training room

3712
02:15:40,740 --> 02:15:42,150
Rookie's training room

3713
02:15:42,250 --> 02:15:44,050
Rest here for a while until we come and get you...

3714
02:15:44,620 --> 02:15:47,780
We have to go through this again?

3715
02:15:51,660 --> 02:15:57,130
There are even drawers again and some of them have numbers on them

3716
02:15:53,620 --> 02:15:57,130
There are even drawers again and some of them have numbers on them

3717
02:15:54,860 --> 02:15:55,830
Whoa! You're right!

3718
02:15:55,830 --> 02:15:58,400
There's already everything, everything, everything

3719
02:15:58,530 --> 02:15:59,900
Everything is present

3720
02:15:59,900 --> 02:16:02,470
You know, I can't trust anything anymore...

3721
02:16:02,470 --> 02:16:05,840
You know, I can't trust anything anymore...

3722
02:16:10,670 --> 02:16:12,080
It hurts, it hurts

3723
02:16:12,380 --> 02:16:13,980
Looks like the usual room

3724
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:15,550
I have a cramp on one of my ass cheeks, it strikes me more occasionally, recently

3725
02:16:15,550 --> 02:16:17,710
I have a cramp on one of my ass cheeks,



it strikes me more occasionally, recently

3726
02:16:17,850 --> 02:16:20,280
when this side cramps up, it's bad...

3727
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:22,990
I'm going to the toilet for a sec

3728
02:16:21,490 --> 02:16:21,920
That's bad

3729
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:22,990
It is

3730
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:37,070
Men's Toilet

3731
02:16:45,680 --> 02:16:50,110
A previous visitor is using the toilet

3732
02:16:45,680 --> 02:16:50,110
m 4 0 l 371 0 b 375 0 375 1 375 8 l 375 8 b 375 24 375 25 371 25 l 3 25 b 0 25 0 24 0 8 b 0 1 0 0 4 0

3733
02:17:00,060 --> 02:17:06,200
The user was LiLiCo

3734
02:17:00,060 --> 02:17:06,200
m 4 0 l 371 0 b 375 0 375 1 375 8 l 375 8 b 375 24 375 25 371 25 l 3 25 b 0 25 0 24 0 8 b 0 1 0 0 4 0

3735
02:17:14,940 --> 02:17:17,270
Housei is not here

3736
02:17:15,610 --> 02:17:17,270
What happened?

3737
02:17:17,210 --> 02:17:20,580
Something must have happened over there, right?

3738
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:20,580
Something must have happened over there, right?

3739
02:17:18,110 --> 02:17:19,510
He went to the toilet

3740
02:17:19,510 --> 02:17:20,910
For sure

3741
02:17:20,910 --> 02:17:22,680
I'm afraid...

3742
02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:25,550
It surprised me!

3743
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:37,260
What the hell?

3744
02:17:36,730 --> 02:17:37,730
What's he doing?

3745
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:38,430
What kind of movement was that?

3746
02:17:38,630 --> 02:17:44,670
Once Yama-chan is back we should probably start opening the drawers

3747
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:44,670
Once Yama-chan is back we should probably start opening the drawers

3748
02:17:41,530 --> 02:17:44,670
Once Yama-chan is back we should probably start opening the drawers

3749
02:17:41,700 --> 02:17:44,500
You're probably right

3750
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:44,500
Those with the numbers...

3751
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:45,940
Something must be in those

3752
02:17:45,940 --> 02:17:47,570
I was surprised!

3753
02:17:45,970 --> 02:17:49,640
What just happened? It said "Housei Out" once you went to the toilet

3754
02:17:49,640 --> 02:17:51,410
Yeah

3755
02:17:50,310 --> 02:17:51,410
What?

3756
02:17:51,410 --> 02:17:55,680
I went to the toilet and on the other side there was someone

3757
02:17:52,610 --> 02:17:55,680
I went to the toilet and on the other side there was someone

3758
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:59,220
emitting this absurd "bububu" sound

3759
02:17:59,220 --> 02:18:01,850
And the person who came out was...

3760
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:04,220
That person...

3761
02:18:04,220 --> 02:18:06,990
That woman...

3762
02:18:12,630 --> 02:18:16,300
I think I forgot her name

3763
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:21,840
Don't say it, if you can't remember the most important part!

3764
02:18:22,640 --> 02:18:29,480
What the hell, man?! You have to say that part quickly!

3765
02:18:23,410 --> 02:18:26,780
Don't talk if you don't know the main topic

3766
02:18:25,580 --> 02:18:28,310
Why? You just met her before!

3767
02:18:33,320 --> 02:18:35,920
I really forgot it

3768
02:18:34,850 --> 02:18:36,220
You forgot it?

3769
02:18:36,220 --> 02:18:37,820
Well how did you...

3770
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:37,820
It was that person of mixed race...

3771
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:39,290
Mixed?

3772
02:18:38,420 --> 02:18:39,760
Well, there are a lot

3773
02:18:39,290 --> 02:18:40,460
There are several of them

3774
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:46,360
A woman of mixed race from recently, a rough person, a bit of a granny character. Some time ago she kinda~

3775
02:18:46,530 --> 02:18:48,530
LiLiCo-san

3776
02:18:47,260 --> 02:18:48,530
Yeah, right, LiLiCo-san!

3777
02:18:50,230 --> 02:18:53,670
LiLiCo was taking a sh*t?

3778
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:53,670
She was taking a sh*t

3779
02:18:55,740 --> 02:18:57,240
I swear, she was!

3780
02:18:57,240 --> 02:18:58,940
And emitting sounds

3781
02:19:00,610 --> 02:19:02,710
That's kinda a bad thing to say

3782
02:19:01,810 --> 02:19:02,710
right

3783
02:19:02,710 --> 02:19:05,180
Well, if this was real I would be laughing

3784
02:19:04,780 --> 02:19:06,350
You're laughing, though

3785
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:06,550
Are you being honest?

3786
02:19:06,550 --> 02:19:08,090
Yeah I am!

3787
02:19:07,380 --> 02:19:08,090
Ouch

3788
02:19:09,420 --> 02:19:11,420
Ow!!

3789
02:19:11,860 --> 02:19:15,060
I was really surprised the moment she came out

3790
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:15,060
I was really surprised the moment she came out

3791
02:19:16,330 --> 02:19:21,970
I would like it if they stop setting traps in the toilet

3792
02:19:17,990 --> 02:19:21,970
I would like it if they stop setting traps in the toilet

3793
02:19:18,900 --> 02:19:21,970
I would like it if they stop setting traps in the toilet

3794
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:24,740
Enough with those, really, stop

3795
02:19:26,340 --> 02:19:28,570
2:30 PM

3796
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:31,410
6 hours and half since the Defense Force training began

3797
02:19:28,570 --> 02:19:31,410
Once again, they face off with the contents of the drawers

3798
02:19:32,180 --> 02:19:33,340
Ow ow ow

3799
02:19:35,550 --> 02:19:37,450
Shall we start opening with Tanaka?

3800
02:19:37,850 --> 02:19:41,020
Yeah, I guess we have to, huh?

3801
02:19:39,220 --> 02:19:42,290
There must be something inside, look

3802
02:19:41,520 --> 02:19:45,360
Look, there's  a DVD player

3803
02:19:42,390 --> 02:19:45,360
For real... damn

3804
02:19:45,490 --> 02:19:48,130
It doesn't matter if we look at them sooner or later

3805
02:19:47,020 --> 02:19:48,130
Right...

3806
02:19:48,130 --> 02:19:51,330
If something happens, then it might be a different pattern...

3807
02:19:49,430 --> 02:19:52,600
If something happens, then it might be a different pattern...

3808
02:19:51,330 --> 02:19:53,160
There's no doubt

3809
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:56,070
If it contains something, it's troublesome

3810
02:19:55,100 --> 02:19:56,070
I agree

3811
02:19:56,070 --> 02:19:59,640
Tanaka is the top batter

Please, be anything but the gas spray

3814
02:20:02,570 --> 02:20:03,810
Look

3815
02:20:03,510 --> 02:20:08,450
Mysterious DVD

3817
02:20:04,810 --> 02:20:06,740
a DVD

3818
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:09,350
One DVD

3819
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:10,850
Only one, huh?

3820
02:20:14,180 --> 02:20:19,260
The other is surely where you are

3821
02:20:15,220 --> 02:20:19,260
The other is surely where you are

3822
02:20:16,650 --> 02:20:18,460
I want to think there aren't any

3823
02:20:18,460 --> 02:20:20,260
Right?

3824
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:20,760
But...

3825
02:20:22,630 --> 02:20:24,130
What are you doin'?

3826
02:20:24,130 --> 02:20:25,560
Sorry

3827
02:20:24,900 --> 02:20:26,900
Nothing, just a DVD from him

3828
02:20:26,900 --> 02:20:29,470
I'm going next, if you don't mind

3829
02:20:29,830 --> 02:20:30,730
Uh!?

3830
02:20:30,730 --> 02:20:36,110

What does this...

3833
02:20:32,940 --> 02:20:34,140
Ahh, there it is

3834
02:20:34,140 --> 02:20:36,110
It's going to be the same...

3835
02:20:36,110 --> 02:20:37,110
Ah! That's Matsumoto-san's...

3836
02:20:37,110 --> 02:20:38,840
Matsumoto-san's pattern, right?

3837
02:20:38,210 --> 02:20:38,840
there it is

3838
02:20:38,840 --> 02:20:40,380
Wait, there's more on this desk

3839
02:20:41,180 --> 02:20:42,750
Uh!?

3840
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:43,050
Oh, there's something inside

3841
02:20:43,050 --> 02:20:45,050
What's that!?

3842
02:20:46,180 --> 02:20:47,420
Eh? That's a bit scary.

3843
02:20:47,420 --> 02:20:50,990
Mysterious Box

3844
02:20:47,420 --> 02:20:50,990

3845
02:20:48,990 --> 02:20:50,990
Wait, let me check the rest

3846
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:53,560
Nothing!!

3847
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:53,560
Nothing

3848
02:20:54,520 --> 02:20:55,930
There was a single one

3849
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:55,930
ugh...

3850
02:20:55,930 --> 02:20:58,900
Which one should we look at first?

3851
02:20:57,190 --> 02:20:57,830
Yeah...

3852
02:20:58,900 --> 02:21:01,900
It's an envelope, right?

3853
02:21:02,170 --> 02:21:03,270
Let's read this at least

3854
02:21:02,970 --> 02:21:06,340
We can make some link from that, probably

3855
02:21:04,070 --> 02:21:06,340
A link, probably

3856
02:21:06,640 --> 02:21:07,740
Right?

3857
02:21:07,940 --> 02:21:08,810
Yes

3864
02:21:10,310 --> 02:21:18,720

3867
02:21:16,250 --> 02:21:17,750
Pokan?

3868
02:21:16,950 --> 02:21:17,750
pokan...

3869
02:21:17,750 --> 02:21:19,420
I'm opening number 7

3870
02:21:19,420 --> 02:21:21,220
Uh?! Wait a sec.

3871
02:21:20,480 --> 02:21:21,220
Um?

3872
02:21:21,220 --> 02:21:23,350
There's something~

3873
02:21:21,790 --> 02:21:23,350
Uh? Is it stiff?

3874
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:25,960
It's stiff

3875
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:28,260
It opened normally...

3876
02:21:28,190 --> 02:21:30,760
It was stiff, I was working hard

3877
02:21:28,190 --> 02:21:32,130
A second letter

3879
02:21:31,430 --> 02:21:32,830
That's because you were scared, right?

3880
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:33,530
I was

3881
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:34,200
He totally was

3882
02:21:34,330 --> 02:21:35,500
Number one

Ah! There!

3888
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:38,470
Is it this?

3889
02:21:39,670 --> 02:21:40,970
Scary, scary...

3890
02:21:40,270 --> 02:21:41,940
Indeed scary

3891
02:21:41,440 --> 02:21:43,210
This pattern is no good...

3892
02:21:43,210 --> 02:21:44,540
Terrifying

3893
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:45,140
Wait a sec, wait wait wait!

3894
02:21:46,110 --> 02:21:47,210
I'm opening it!

3895
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:47,580
Got it

3896
02:21:48,910 --> 02:21:50,380
There's something inside

3897
02:21:50,380 --> 02:21:51,780
It's obvious it was there

3898
02:21:50,780 --> 02:21:52,220
Again, it has something

3899
02:21:52,220 --> 02:21:53,820
Jeez...

3900
02:21:53,820 --> 02:21:56,120
It will continue for a while...

3901
02:21:55,020 --> 02:21:56,120
Enough...

3902
02:22:03,330 --> 02:22:05,430
It was obvious!

3903
02:22:09,270 --> 02:22:11,100
They truly don't give up on this prank!

3904
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:13,670
From where did it came out?

3905
02:22:13,670 --> 02:22:14,540
From the inside

3906
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:16,940
That gas spray from before was bad

3907
02:22:18,510 --> 02:22:20,180
Ouch!

3908
02:22:20,180 --> 02:22:23,350
He slapped my stomach!!

3909
02:22:22,380 --> 02:22:23,350
That must hurt

3910
02:22:23,550 --> 02:22:27,420
It's such a... tender spot!

3911
02:22:25,250 --> 02:22:27,420
It's such a... tender spot!

3912
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:32,690
What's wrong with you?

3913
02:22:33,390 --> 02:22:35,590
Cut it out!

3914
02:22:39,030 --> 02:22:40,700
Me?

3915
02:22:40,700 --> 02:22:42,030
Uh?

3916
02:22:42,030 --> 02:22:43,570
Uhuhuh

3917
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:48,840
Endo was slapped by mistake

Enough!

3921
02:22:51,340 --> 02:22:52,710
Okak it's a Batsu, but...

3922
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:52,710
Careful!

3923
02:22:53,110 --> 02:22:55,280
I didn't even move from before

3924
02:22:54,080 --> 02:22:56,180
You stood still

3925
02:22:57,250 --> 02:22:58,350
OK

3926
02:22:59,650 --> 02:23:02,920

please!

3952
02:23:56,310 --> 02:24:02,950

Go Yamazaki

3956
02:23:58,710 --> 02:24:00,180
No, he wants Matsumoto!

3957
02:23:59,780 --> 02:24:01,780
That was incredibly creepy!

3958
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:02,150
Creepy indeed!

3959
02:24:03,110 --> 02:24:04,850
pleeease

3960
02:24:06,120 --> 02:24:07,820
please!

3961
02:24:08,590 --> 02:24:09,990
This?

3962
02:24:09,990 --> 02:24:12,560
This?

3963
02:24:12,660 --> 02:24:14,860
I'm hungry...

3964
02:24:16,330 --> 02:24:18,700
Huh?

3965
02:24:24,270 --> 02:24:25,740
Why am I the only one who is OUT?

3966
02:24:25,740 --> 02:24:27,040
I just smiled...

3967
02:24:26,440 --> 02:24:28,140
Just a little smile...

3968
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:29,970
I just smiled

3969
02:24:29,410 --> 02:24:30,870
Ow!!!

3970
02:24:30,870 --> 02:24:33,140
As expected you couldn't have a dignity, right?

3971
02:24:31,570 --> 02:24:33,940
H-he-He said "Hungry"?

3972
02:24:33,140 --> 02:24:34,480
He said "hungry"?

3973
02:24:34,040 --> 02:24:35,850
Give him some sweets!

3974
02:24:35,480 --> 02:24:36,510
Hungry?

3975
02:24:35,850 --> 02:24:37,810
He's hungry I guess...

3976
02:24:36,380 --> 02:24:39,480
Hungry

3977
02:24:36,380 --> 02:24:39,480
Hungry

3978
02:24:37,710 --> 02:24:39,680
Oh he said hungry...

3979
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:40,480
If that's the case

3980
02:24:40,480 --> 02:24:43,150
I wonder if a Baumkuchen would be okay...

3981
02:24:45,720 --> 02:24:49,190
Why am I doing this?

3982
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:49,190
Why am I doing this?

3983
02:24:53,360 --> 02:24:55,730
Stop with painful things and such, please

3984
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:59,300
Please, stop with painful things and such

3985
02:25:01,300 --> 02:25:06,540
Matsumoto was attacked by the alien

3986

HOLY SHIT!

3988
02:25:03,770 --> 02:25:05,910
WHY?!

3989
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:07,140
Holy shit!

3990
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:11,380
Violence isn't allowed!

3991
02:25:11,720 --> 02:25:12,980
Ow ow ow!

3992
02:25:12,980 --> 02:25:16,950
What the hell? Since I came here only bad things happened!

3993
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:16,950
What the hell? Since I came here only bad things happened!

3994
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:20,520
Violence?

3995
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:20,520
Violence?

3996
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:23,790
I am hungry

3997
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:23,790
I am hungry

3998
02:25:22,090 --> 02:25:23,790
Enough with this stuff...

3999
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:24,260
Shh, look

4000
02:25:24,890 --> 02:25:26,260
Crap, he's coming coming coming here...

4001
02:25:25,560 --> 02:25:27,160
Careful!

4002
02:25:27,460 --> 02:25:29,400
He's hungry, remember...

4003
02:25:27,960 --> 02:25:29,700
Take this Yama-chan! He's hungry!

4004
02:25:29,400 --> 02:25:30,400
He's famished!

4005
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:33,300
No, he's saying to feed him something else...

4006
02:25:32,300 --> 02:25:33,300
Is it no good?

4007
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:36,370
He has become attached to Housei-san!

4008
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:36,940
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

4009
02:25:36,940 --> 02:25:38,940
He seems to like him

4010
02:25:37,870 --> 02:25:39,810
It's definitely an alien...

4011
02:25:39,140 --> 02:25:40,240
Yeah...

4012
02:25:40,140 --> 02:25:43,010
It's definitely an alien

4013
02:25:41,610 --> 02:25:43,510
I'm sure this will go fine

4014
02:25:44,210 --> 02:25:46,680
Thank you~

4015
02:25:44,210 --> 02:25:46,680
Thank you~

4016
02:25:46,750 --> 02:25:48,280
Aaah, it went nice, thankfully

4017
02:25:46,750 --> 02:25:49,150
What is your name?

4018
02:25:46,750 --> 02:25:49,150
What is your name?

4019
02:25:49,150 --> 02:25:51,120
Housei

4020
02:25:51,150 --> 02:25:56,390
Housei     my friend

4021
02:25:51,150 --> 02:25:56,390
Housei     my friend

4022
02:25:53,520 --> 02:25:55,390
That's hilarious

4023
02:25:58,860 --> 02:26:03,330
Proof of the friendship between Hosei and the alien.

4024
02:25:58,860 --> 02:26:03,330
m 4 0 l 371 0 b 375 0 375 1 375 8 l 375 8 b 375 24 375 25 371 25 l 3 25 b 0 25 0 24 0 8 b 0 1 0 0 4 0

4025
02:26:04,700 --> 02:26:06,200
That's good, that's good

4026
02:26:06,200 --> 02:26:07,200
Everything went fine

4027
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:08,300
You're good Yama-chan

4028
02:26:08,300 --> 02:26:08,870
Amazing

4029
02:26:08,870 --> 02:26:12,340
He was angry because Matsumoto gave him something?

4030
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:12,640
Looks like it

4031
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:14,140
He wanted Yama-chan to feed him...

4032
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:15,810
That's a little...

4033
02:26:14,840 --> 02:26:22,450
A situation where the alien wanted to be friends with Housei

4034
02:26:14,840 --> 02:26:22,450
m 4 0 l 371 0 b 375 0 375 1 375 8 l 375 8 b 375 24 375 25 371 25 l 3 25 b 0 25 0 24 0 8 b 0 1 0 0 4 0

4035
02:26:15,380 --> 02:26:16,810
That situation was...

4036
02:26:16,410 --> 02:26:18,750
That was great

4037
02:26:17,110 --> 02:26:18,280
I'm sorry

4038
02:26:18,280 --> 02:26:20,680
You think so?

4039
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:20,680
It was really hilarious, I'd say

4040
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:22,450
When he did this

4041
02:26:22,450 --> 02:26:25,160
I didn't know aliens were so primitive

4042
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:28,090
He hit me

4043
02:26:28,090 --> 02:26:32,560
End of the day...

4044
02:26:30,190 --> 02:26:32,560
other planets act the same way huh...

4045
02:26:32,830 --> 02:26:35,170
Violence is everywhere...

4046
02:26:35,170 --> 02:26:37,330
Are we finished with Yama-chan's drawers?

4047
02:26:36,330 --> 02:26:38,330
We have this

4048
02:26:37,430 --> 02:26:38,900
This box

4049
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:49,110
It's a rice cake

4050
02:26:49,110 --> 02:26:54,180
A graceful salted rice cake for the exhausted body

4051
02:26:49,110 --> 02:26:54,180
m 4 0 l 371 0 b 375 0 375 1 375 8 l 375 8 b 375 24 375 25 371 25 l 3 25 b 0 25 0 24 0 8 b 0 1 0 0 4 0

4052
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:03,090
It's a rice cake stuffed with jam

4053
02:27:05,260 --> 02:27:06,830
Don't say it!

4054
02:27:07,560 --> 02:27:09,730
You shouldn't have talked!

4055
02:27:09,730 --> 02:27:11,030
We figured out by ourselves!

4056
02:27:11,430 --> 02:27:13,000
Just by looking at it, we got it

4057
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:18,470
Ouch

4058
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:20,340
Oww

4059
02:27:19,440 --> 02:27:22,710
My back hurts...

4060
02:27:23,880 --> 02:27:25,380
Is it possible that

4061
02:27:25,380 --> 02:27:31,620
this rice cake was placed in order to give it to the alien from before?

4062
02:27:27,780 --> 02:27:31,620
this rice cake was placed in order to give it to the alien from before?

4063
02:27:28,950 --> 02:27:31,620
Ah, you should have opened the box

4064
02:27:31,820 --> 02:27:33,820
And then give it to the alien

4065
02:27:33,820 --> 02:27:38,860
That's possible from you, though I gave him a Baumkuchen

4066
02:27:38,860 --> 02:27:42,730
And I was almost beaten up by him

4067
02:27:43,330 --> 02:27:45,500
It's your turn, Matsumoto-san

4068
02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:48,100
Ah, right. I wonder what's inside mine...

4069
02:27:48,370 --> 02:27:51,340
It could even come an empty pattern

4070
02:27:49,770 --> 02:27:51,340
Well, that's right

4071
02:27:54,540 --> 02:27:56,280
Just stop with gas sprays

4072
02:27:54,910 --> 02:27:56,280
I'm ready

4073
02:27:56,280 --> 02:27:58,480
He's eating so much...

4074
02:27:58,980 --> 02:28:00,380
Nothing here

4075
02:27:59,480 --> 02:28:00,380
Empty

4076
02:27:59,780 --> 02:28:02,350
I seriously don't want the spray!

4077
02:28:00,950 --> 02:28:01,890
Enough with that

4078
02:28:02,350 --> 02:28:04,320
Seriously, the spray should be banned

4079
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:08,660
Uh?

4080
02:28:07,820 --> 02:28:09,490
Looks like a cellular phone...

4081
02:28:09,490 --> 02:28:10,490
It's a mobile phone!

4082
02:28:09,860 --> 02:28:11,790
What, that's kinda...

4083
02:28:10,090 --> 02:28:14,260
Mysterious cellphone

4084
02:28:10,090 --> 02:28:14,260
m 4 0 l 371 0 b 375 0 375 1 375 8 l 375 8 b 375 24 375 25 371 25 l 3 25 b 0 25 0 24 0 8 b 0 1 0 0 4 0

4085
02:28:11,790 --> 02:28:13,730
Scary, uh?

4086
02:28:12,530 --> 02:28:13,730
Scary, scary

4087
02:28:14,430 --> 02:28:17,200
That's one heck of a strange item

4088
02:28:15,930 --> 02:28:17,200
I agree

4089
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:20,400
Whoa!!

4090
02:28:19,400 --> 02:28:21,400
There's something inside

4091
02:28:20,500 --> 02:28:21,400
Hmm?

4092
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:23,340
There is something inside

4093
02:28:22,470 --> 02:28:23,470
What's that?

4094
02:28:23,470 --> 02:28:30,780
Magic Balloon Kit

4095
02:28:23,470 --> 02:28:30,780
m 4 0 l 371 0 b 375 0 375 1 375 8 l 375 8 b 375 24 375 25 371 25 l 3 25 b 0 25 0 24 0 8 b 0 1 0 0 4 0

4096
02:28:23,540 --> 02:28:24,440
What's that?

4097
02:28:23,970 --> 02:28:25,040
Err

4098
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:26,340
A balloon

4099
02:28:26,340 --> 02:28:29,310
It's one of those long balloons with which you can create dolls

4100
02:28:28,980 --> 02:28:31,210
Aaah, one of those?

4101
02:28:30,110 --> 02:28:31,210
uh-uh

4102
02:28:33,580 --> 02:28:35,950
Hmm?

4103
02:28:35,950 --> 02:28:37,020
Do you know those?

4104
02:28:36,750 --> 02:28:37,120
Uh?

4105
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:41,020
Did it bring back some memories?

4106
02:28:41,020 --> 02:28:42,060
Uh? What do you mean?

4107
02:28:42,060 --> 02:28:43,190
What's that?

4108
02:28:45,830 --> 02:28:47,860
Well...

4109
02:28:49,930 --> 02:28:52,270
I have no idea...

4110
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:56,170
Well, why would it be in your drawer?

4111
02:28:54,700 --> 02:28:57,170
Doesn't this brings up any memory at all?

4112
02:28:57,370 --> 02:28:59,840
Uh...

4113
02:28:58,170 --> 02:29:00,110
None?

4114
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:06,480
Matsumoto is hiding something.

4115
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:06,480
m 4 0 l 371 0 b 375 0 375 1 375 8 l 375 8 b 375 24 375 25 371 25 l 3 25 b 0 25 0 24 0 8 b 0 1 0 0 4 0

4116
02:29:05,010 --> 02:29:06,280
Uh?

4117
02:29:06,280 --> 02:29:08,380
If there's something

4118
02:29:07,980 --> 02:29:10,050
Please tell us...

4119
02:29:11,850 --> 02:29:14,690
Are you practising it?

4120
02:29:13,020 --> 02:29:16,290
Well, this is...

4121
02:29:15,590 --> 02:29:17,260
you are practising it?

4122
02:29:17,960 --> 02:29:21,260
Yeah, this...

4123
02:29:18,860 --> 02:29:21,260
You're practising it?

4124
02:29:27,900 --> 02:29:32,510
Well, that's... wait, what do you mean... I mean, what are you asking me to do?

4125
02:29:32,510 --> 02:29:33,810
Wait~

4126
02:29:35,210 --> 02:29:36,780
We just don't know!

4127
02:29:35,810 --> 02:29:38,280
Please fill us in...

4128
02:29:38,280 --> 02:29:39,650
What is this meant to mean?

4129
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:39,650
That's great...

4130
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:41,250
What do you mean?

4131
02:29:41,380 --> 02:29:43,050
So for your kid...

4132
02:29:42,950 --> 02:29:47,320
You went to a balloon class

4133
02:29:44,450 --> 02:29:47,320
and going through it?

4134
02:29:54,530 --> 02:29:56,330
What the hell

4135
02:29:54,960 --> 02:29:56,330
is a balloon art class?

4136
02:29:56,330 --> 02:29:57,400
Like how many of them are there?

4137
02:29:57,400 --> 02:29:58,400
How much do  the classes cost?

4138
02:29:58,400 --> 02:29:59,670
How much do the classes cost?

4139
02:29:58,430 --> 02:30:00,000
No seriously, it does exist...

4140
02:29:59,400 --> 02:30:00,400
Yeah...

4141
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:06,240
I think it's a really beautiful story

4142
02:30:04,240 --> 02:30:06,210
Yeah it really is...

4143
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:08,910
I think it's a really good thing

4144
02:30:08,910 --> 02:30:11,710
Maybe it's telling you to do the one that you've specifically learnt

4145
02:30:13,380 --> 02:30:15,080
It's in a brand new packet...

4146
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:18,350
Go on, please make it.

4147
02:30:17,320 --> 02:30:18,020
Yeah, can you?

4148
02:30:19,090 --> 02:30:21,960
Make the one that makes

4149
02:30:19,090 --> 02:30:21,960
your kid the happiest...

4150
02:30:22,260 --> 02:30:25,830
It's not really about my kid to be honest

4151
02:30:25,830 --> 02:30:28,230
It's just a coincidental thing...

4152
02:30:27,360 --> 02:30:29,430
If your kid wasn't involved, surely you wouldn't do this...

4153
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,040
Oh so you just do it for yourself?

4154
02:30:33,970 --> 02:30:36,570
I bet there are just mountains of balloons in his house...

4155
02:30:37,870 --> 02:30:40,510
It's not really for myself or anything...

4156
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:45,110
Bloody hell, I can tell you have practised loads

4157
02:30:45,780 --> 02:30:47,080
Yeah he's a pro...

4158
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:49,820
What do you mean?

4159
02:30:49,450 --> 02:30:51,450
What?

4160
02:30:51,450 --> 02:30:53,420
An amateur wouldn't have known to do that first!

4161
02:30:52,520 --> 02:30:54,190
He looked so comfortable handling it...

4162
02:30:54,190 --> 02:30:56,390
I didn't know "first you have to pull the balloon apart... etc."

4163
02:30:55,890 --> 02:30:58,390
Everyone knows that, surely...

4164
02:30:57,390 --> 02:30:58,730
No, you wouldn't know that...

4165
02:30:59,860 --> 02:31:07,500
In order to not burst the balloon, you stretch it out first

4166
02:30:59,860 --> 02:31:07,500
Balloon Art 1

4167
02:31:02,200 --> 02:31:03,330
Looks like you have to...

4168
02:31:02,630 --> 02:31:03,800
I didn't know...

4169
02:31:05,700 --> 02:31:07,000
Oh so you stretch it...

4170
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:09,040
So what are you going to make us?

4171
02:31:10,270 --> 02:31:12,240
Jesus, look at how good he is!

4172
02:31:10,270 --> 02:31:19,480
Inflate balloon with a handpump

Balloon Art 2

4174
02:31:12,140 --> 02:31:14,440
Wow that is amazing...

4175
02:31:14,440 --> 02:31:16,780
I didn't realize you had to pump air into it with that...

4176
02:31:17,910 --> 02:31:19,580
You don't do it with your mouth...

4177
02:31:19,480 --> 02:31:21,780
Please, just shut up

4178
02:31:22,090 --> 02:31:24,450
You don't do it with the mouth, you do it with the pump...

4179
02:31:24,050 --> 02:31:26,820
You don't even need

4180
02:31:24,050 --> 02:31:26,820
to look at the instruction book?

4181
02:31:26,820 --> 02:31:28,990
You do this every day, don't you?

4182
02:31:32,160 --> 02:31:33,730
No seriously, what the hell?

4183
02:31:32,330 --> 02:31:32,860
What?

4184
02:31:34,130 --> 02:31:35,830
He's doing something to the tip...

4185
02:31:34,130 --> 02:31:35,830
What's he doing?

4186
02:31:35,830 --> 02:31:38,670
He's probably doing it on purpose, he knows what he's doing...

4187
02:31:36,230 --> 02:31:46,210
Blow the right amount of air in and then tie up the opening

4188
02:31:36,230 --> 02:31:46,210
Balloon Art 3

4189
02:31:39,100 --> 02:31:39,800
What are you making?

4190
02:31:40,700 --> 02:31:42,740
I swear, anyone can do this...

4191
02:31:44,140 --> 02:31:46,340
No no, we have normal lives...

4192
02:31:46,240 --> 02:31:47,440
I've never...

4193
02:31:47,110 --> 02:31:48,340
None of us can make it...

4194
02:31:49,410 --> 02:31:51,480
No seriously, I don't know...

4195
02:31:51,950 --> 02:31:59,020
Grab the opening of the balloon and twist it into shapes

4196
02:31:51,950 --> 02:31:59,020
Balloon Art 4

4197
02:31:52,680 --> 02:31:55,180
Please make us something then...

4198
02:31:55,180 --> 02:31:57,650
Hang on, do you ACTUALLY do this at home as a hobby?!

4199
02:32:04,590 --> 02:32:05,430
Like this...

4200
02:32:07,930 --> 02:32:10,730
What a dad... He'll do anything to make you smile...

4201
02:32:10,230 --> 02:32:22,010
Bend the balloon to keep its balance and

4202
02:32:10,230 --> 02:32:22,010
twist accordingly, making sure air pressure is equal

4203
02:32:10,230 --> 02:32:22,010
Balloon Art 5

4204
02:32:11,500 --> 02:32:14,300
So when you do it like this...

4205
02:32:24,910 --> 02:32:27,480
well, this is in the end... is basically...

4206
02:32:27,480 --> 02:32:28,620
a rabbit...

4207
02:32:29,250 --> 02:32:35,320
Rabbit has been created!

4208
02:32:30,450 --> 02:32:35,320
Very well done

4209
02:32:35,290 --> 02:32:36,360
That's amazing!!

4210
02:32:36,360 --> 02:32:38,460
Your child would be so happy!

4211
02:32:38,460 --> 02:32:39,760
Amazing!!!

4212
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:40,960
This is  so cool!!

4213
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:42,630
This is so cool!!

4214
02:32:44,830 --> 02:32:46,670
This is really cool

4215
02:32:46,670 --> 02:32:48,970
No seriously, this is like not...

4216
02:32:49,570 --> 02:32:50,270
you know...

4217
02:32:50,670 --> 02:32:51,870
not for my kid or anything like that

4218
02:32:51,870 --> 02:32:53,410
not for my kid or anything like that

4219
02:32:53,410 --> 02:32:54,640
I coincidentally just found it

4220
02:32:54,640 --> 02:32:55,980
I coincidentally just found it...

4221
02:32:57,180 --> 02:32:58,510
and like umm...

4222
02:33:01,180 --> 02:33:02,550
just started doing it...

4223
02:33:03,720 --> 02:33:06,590
Oh yeah, if you put on stickers, it looks better. Oh that's so cute!

4224
02:33:04,250 --> 02:33:10,390
Put stickers on, and it is KAWAII

4225
02:33:07,720 --> 02:33:09,460
Your kid will be so happy

4226
02:33:08,590 --> 02:33:10,360
so happy

4227
02:33:12,200 --> 02:33:13,060
Matsumoto-san does balloon art, huh?

4228
02:33:13,060 --> 02:33:15,400
Matsumoto-san does Balloon art, huh?

4229
02:33:15,400 --> 02:33:18,700
I didn't know...

4230
02:33:16,230 --> 02:33:17,530
I never thought...

4231
02:33:18,100 --> 02:33:19,700
I really didn't know...

4232
02:33:19,670 --> 02:33:21,100
So when he's alone, this is what he does...

4233
02:33:21,100 --> 02:33:22,370
I guess...

4234
02:33:23,170 --> 02:33:24,570
No, everyone does it, right?

4235
02:33:25,310 --> 02:33:26,540
No...

4236
02:33:26,040 --> 02:33:27,910
I've never done it

4237
02:33:27,310 --> 02:33:29,710
Okay, teach me later...

4238
02:33:30,180 --> 02:33:33,580
I'm going to open my drawers now...

4239
02:33:31,380 --> 02:33:31,910
It's so cute...

4240
02:33:33,250 --> 02:33:34,480
Go for it, Hamada-san

4241
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:35,750
Go for it

4242
02:33:34,880 --> 02:33:36,050
Go...

4243
02:33:36,450 --> 02:33:38,320
nothing...

4244
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:39,520
Maybe there isn't anything...

4245
02:33:41,190 --> 02:33:41,620
nothing...

4246
02:33:41,620 --> 02:33:42,690
Oh, there's nothing...

4247
02:33:42,990 --> 02:33:44,690
There's a possibility there won't be anything

4248
02:33:44,590 --> 02:33:45,860
Maybe there's nothing...

4249
02:33:45,190 --> 02:33:46,130
Hang on...

4250
02:33:46,360 --> 02:33:46,630
WOW!!

4251
02:33:46,630 --> 02:33:48,260
WOW!!

4252
02:33:48,260 --> 02:33:49,830
Shit, it's huge!!

4253
02:33:50,330 --> 02:33:51,700
That scared me...

4254
02:33:56,740 --> 02:34:00,140
Man, that is very made well!

4255
02:33:59,440 --> 02:34:05,450
Model M1

4256
02:33:59,610 --> 02:34:01,740
It looks so damn funny...

4257
02:34:02,910 --> 02:34:03,680
The Model M1...

4258
02:34:05,410 --> 02:34:09,120
It's the big version of the M1

4259
02:34:07,150 --> 02:34:09,350
Model M1  let's stop playing with it...

4260
02:34:09,350 --> 02:34:10,850
are there like loads of other goods you can get?

4261
02:34:12,290 --> 02:34:14,620
Does it move?

4262
02:34:13,320 --> 02:34:14,320
No, surely not?

4263
02:34:15,220 --> 02:34:16,290
It's really unbalanced...

4264
02:34:21,900 --> 02:34:24,430
There's something here...

4265
02:34:24,430 --> 02:34:26,500
Maybe there's a switch somewhere...

4266
02:34:26,070 --> 02:34:27,200
Yeah, I think it moves...

4267
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:28,300
It definitely will...

4268
02:34:28,700 --> 02:34:29,370
Oh...

4269
02:34:40,380 --> 02:34:41,950
There might be something  somewhere

4270
02:34:41,950 --> 02:34:44,150
There might be something somewhere...

4271
02:34:44,150 --> 02:34:46,690
There's definitely a catch to this!!

4272
02:34:44,550 --> 02:34:46,220
Oh I see, I see...

4273
02:34:48,420 --> 02:34:51,890
Maybe it's just meant to stand up?

4274
02:34:50,190 --> 02:34:51,460
You're right...

4275
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:53,760
It's amazing

4276
02:34:53,960 --> 02:34:55,160
Oh, it moved!!

4277
02:35:10,610 --> 02:35:11,950
What the hell...

4278
02:35:11,950 --> 02:35:12,780
What's it doing?

4279
02:35:12,780 --> 02:35:13,280
What's going on?

4280
02:35:13,780 --> 02:35:15,480
wow... wow, wow,wow

4281
02:35:16,150 --> 02:35:17,150
hang on...

4282
02:35:20,320 --> 02:35:22,490
It stood up!

4283
02:35:21,290 --> 02:35:22,260
Wow, amazing!

4284
02:35:23,360 --> 02:35:31,030
Stands up on its own and greets them

4285
02:35:28,830 --> 02:35:30,000
amazing...

4286
02:35:29,330 --> 02:35:30,800
What is this?

4287
02:35:30,530 --> 02:35:31,530
I think the switch was...

4288
02:35:32,870 --> 02:35:33,370
like...

4289
02:35:33,500 --> 02:35:34,900
around here...

4290
02:35:34,900 --> 02:35:35,440
probably...

4291
02:35:35,440 --> 02:35:36,270
no?

4292
02:35:36,070 --> 02:35:38,270
Hang on, it's still moving...

4293
02:35:37,740 --> 02:35:39,110
What's going on!

4294
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:42,710
Shit, he's amazing!

4295
02:35:41,210 --> 02:35:48,150
greets with 'Sansannanabyoushi' dance

4296
02:35:42,610 --> 02:35:44,610
Wow, that's amazing!

4297
02:35:45,480 --> 02:35:46,950
It's doing it so fast!

4298
02:35:46,180 --> 02:35:47,480
Wow that's amazing...

4299
02:35:48,750 --> 02:35:51,550
This is so funny!

4300
02:35:53,420 --> 02:35:55,590
How many times am I going to get hit over this!?

4301
02:35:59,160 --> 02:36:00,960
It's still reacting

4302
02:36:00,160 --> 02:36:01,760
Yeah it is...

4303
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:02,730
Oh, it reacts to sound!?

4304
02:36:01,760 --> 02:36:03,800
It could be...

4305
02:36:02,030 --> 02:36:03,730
It's reacting, it's reacting

4306
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:08,300
When I held the hand, it suddenly started moving...

4307
02:36:08,300 --> 02:36:09,870
Oh, was there a switch?

4308
02:36:10,040 --> 02:36:12,010
I don't think I flicked anything though...

4309
02:36:18,280 --> 02:36:25,520
Heavy Rotation

4310
02:36:20,550 --> 02:36:21,750
Are you kidding me?

4311
02:36:22,250 --> 02:36:23,850
For real?

4312
02:36:27,990 --> 02:36:29,590
Jeez...

4313
02:36:30,790 --> 02:36:32,030
Why?

4314
02:36:32,030 --> 02:36:34,030
I don't know if I can laugh at this...

4315
02:36:33,930 --> 02:36:39,900
It can dance to "Heavy Rotation"

4316
02:36:40,270 --> 02:36:42,470
It's amazing, it dances properly.

4317
02:36:46,010 --> 02:36:48,010
Wow, that's amazing.

4318
02:36:47,440 --> 02:36:50,510
It just stood on one leg!!

4319
02:36:53,980 --> 02:36:55,950
This is amazing...

4320
02:36:55,950 --> 02:36:58,120
I don't know if it's like a laughing matter or...

4321
02:36:58,590 --> 02:37:01,220
I am touched

4322
02:37:06,160 --> 02:37:07,530
What kind of world is this?

4323
02:37:07,330 --> 02:37:08,260
This is no good...

4324
02:37:09,430 --> 02:37:10,430
It's going to keep on going...

4325
02:37:16,970 --> 02:37:19,740
Eh?

4326
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:21,740
It's resting...

4327
02:37:21,540 --> 02:37:22,980
yeah...

4328
02:37:21,740 --> 02:37:24,510
It's resting in the weirdest position...

4329
02:37:24,580 --> 02:37:25,410
It's resting...

4330
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:31,650
When the charge runs out, the body stops...

4331
02:37:26,150 --> 02:37:27,350
NOT ABLE TO HEARRRRRRRRRRR

4332
02:37:28,180 --> 02:37:28,750
It fell asleep...

4333
02:37:29,150 --> 02:37:30,220
It is sleeping?

4334
02:37:32,250 --> 02:37:35,560
Shall we like... leave

4335
02:37:32,250 --> 02:37:35,560
it over there?

4336
02:37:33,420 --> 02:37:34,420
Yeah, let's do that

4337
02:37:35,790 --> 02:37:38,760
It is Hamada, after all

4338
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:40,560
No no no, no it's not...

4339
02:37:40,060 --> 02:37:44,430
In a few years' time,

4340
02:37:41,260 --> 02:37:44,430
that's what you're going to look like...

4341
02:37:45,870 --> 02:37:49,770
That's how you look when you're just

4342
02:37:47,500 --> 02:37:49,770
chilling at the office, right?

4343
02:37:53,740 --> 02:37:55,910
Okay, I'm going to open it...

4344
02:37:57,980 --> 02:37:59,580
Well yeah, obviously it was going to be...

4345
02:37:59,580 --> 02:38:01,580
you know...

4346
02:38:02,720 --> 02:38:05,590
Like we're returning to basics...

4347
02:38:03,250 --> 02:38:05,820
They wanted us to open that one first I guess...

4348
02:38:04,020 --> 02:38:06,320
This is where it really starts...

4349
02:38:06,720 --> 02:38:07,890
What's in there?

4350
02:38:09,060 --> 02:38:09,690
oh?

4351
02:38:10,890 --> 02:38:12,290
What is it?

4352
02:38:11,560 --> 02:38:13,230
That's the same thing as Housei-san's...

4353
02:38:11,590 --> 02:38:15,500
Same box as Housei's

4354
02:38:14,130 --> 02:38:14,860
Nothing...

4355
02:38:15,560 --> 02:38:15,900
Nothing...

4356
02:38:16,230 --> 02:38:17,700
Housei-san, what was in yours?

4357
02:38:17,530 --> 02:38:18,970
A rice cake...

4358
02:38:18,130 --> 02:38:18,900
Yeah, a rice cake

4359
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:24,770
It says, "Please eat for your tired body."

4360
02:38:24,770 --> 02:38:25,640
Why does this one have two?

4361
02:38:25,410 --> 02:38:28,140
There are 2 rice cakes...

4362
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:29,310
I guess you're meant to eat it...

4363
02:38:30,480 --> 02:38:31,780
Yeah, Yama-chan ate his...

4364
02:38:32,880 --> 02:38:33,250
It's just rice cake...

4365
02:38:33,480 --> 02:38:41,790
A nice salted rice cake for his tired body

4366
02:38:36,250 --> 02:38:36,850
How about the other rice cake?

4367
02:38:39,020 --> 02:38:40,190
Could it be?

4368
02:38:41,090 --> 02:38:41,620
Just a rice cake...

4369
02:38:44,190 --> 02:38:44,760
They went so easy on you

4370
02:38:44,760 --> 02:38:47,460
They went so easy on you.

4371
02:38:46,430 --> 02:38:47,630
Thank God...

4372
02:38:49,300 --> 02:38:50,700
You laughed Endo...

4373
02:38:50,600 --> 02:38:51,600
No, it got caught in my throat...

4374
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:56,270
Hold on...

4375
02:38:58,170 --> 02:39:01,240
Because the staff

4376
02:38:58,170 --> 02:39:01,240
didn't put effort into the traps in his drawer so he's...

4377
02:38:59,610 --> 02:39:01,340
Yeah to be honest, I'm disappointed.

4378
02:39:01,240 --> 02:39:04,980
They didn't put any effort into it at all...

4379
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:08,780
They're just being too easy on me...

4380
02:39:13,220 --> 02:39:13,920
Wow...

4381
02:39:14,220 --> 02:39:14,990
Wow...

4382
02:39:14,420 --> 02:39:15,990
There was like a hidden message in that hit...

4383
02:39:15,790 --> 02:39:16,590
That was hard...

4384
02:39:20,060 --> 02:39:22,060
For crying out loud...

4385
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:24,300
the bloody Model M1 is...

4386
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:34,040
Model M1 in the fridge

4387
02:39:24,700 --> 02:39:25,900
He's here as well...

4388
02:39:27,200 --> 02:39:28,470
He's being frozen...

4389
02:39:28,670 --> 02:39:29,770
the Model M1...

4390
02:39:29,540 --> 02:39:30,470
M1...

4391
02:39:32,740 --> 02:39:34,440
This Model M1 is amazing...

4392
02:39:36,110 --> 02:39:37,610
Oh, Tanaka... the DVD

4393
02:39:37,610 --> 02:39:39,950
Oh, Tanaka... the DVD

4394
02:39:39,950 --> 02:39:41,750
Oh, Tanaka... the DVD

4395
02:39:40,980 --> 02:39:42,250
I know right...

4396
02:39:41,650 --> 02:39:45,250
DVD hasn't been watched yet

4397
02:39:43,650 --> 02:39:45,390
It's still a mystery...

4398
02:39:44,320 --> 02:39:45,250
It is...

4399
02:39:45,820 --> 02:39:47,420
I personally think this DVD...

4400
02:39:47,990 --> 02:39:49,190
one of you three...

4401
02:39:50,060 --> 02:39:51,290
one of you...

4402
02:39:51,860 --> 02:39:52,760
I think it will be something like that...

4403
02:39:51,860 --> 02:40:02,640
The DVD at HQ

4404
02:39:51,860 --> 02:40:02,640
Housei's and Tanaka's kids sent letters to them

4405
02:39:53,160 --> 02:39:53,860
But...

4406
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:56,030
I don't think so to be honest...

4407
02:39:56,600 --> 02:39:58,030
Like even if it is...

4408
02:39:58,300 --> 02:40:00,170
It wouldn't just be about me...

4409
02:40:00,870 --> 02:40:01,500
you know...

4410
02:40:02,770 --> 02:40:04,940
Let's watch it anyway...

4411
02:40:07,410 --> 02:40:10,310
I'm putting it in...

4412
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:16,720
I think it could be the same as before...

4413
02:40:16,720 --> 02:40:17,920
The whole "feeling touched" thing...

4414
02:40:19,220 --> 02:40:21,120
We, at the Gaasu Kurobikari

4415
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:23,360
Earth Defense Force

4416
02:40:22,990 --> 02:40:25,360
It is definitely different

4417
02:40:23,890 --> 02:40:26,060
because we endure extreme training

4418
02:40:26,060 --> 02:40:28,460
we are much stronger than everyone else...

4419
02:40:28,830 --> 02:40:30,800
We have the 'Elite Member'

4420
02:40:31,130 --> 02:40:34,200
Ebisu Yoshikazu

4421
02:40:31,130 --> 02:40:34,200
Elite Member

4422
02:40:31,430 --> 02:40:33,670
And that man is... Ebisu Yoshikazu.

4423
02:40:34,570 --> 02:40:39,610
This Elite Member's secret mission is...

4424
02:40:34,670 --> 02:40:39,240
And today, let's watch the Elite Member's secret mission...

4425
02:40:39,810 --> 02:40:44,580
Secret mission

4426
02:40:39,810 --> 02:40:44,580
Staying in a sauna for 20 minutes

4427
02:40:40,740 --> 02:40:43,810
Staying in a sauna for 20 minutes...

4428
02:40:44,580 --> 02:40:49,350
Usually the sauna is set to 90 degrees

4429
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:46,680
Usually the sauna is set to 90 degrees

4430
02:40:46,680 --> 02:40:48,950
Usually the sauna is set to 90 degrees

4431
02:40:49,750 --> 02:40:54,020
Rainbow Sauna at Shinkoiwa

4432
02:40:51,150 --> 02:40:52,190
However...

4433
02:40:52,190 --> 02:40:54,020
To get the best out of this mission...

4434
02:40:54,020 --> 02:40:56,890
It's better to raise the temperature up to 110 degrees

4435
02:40:54,620 --> 02:40:59,360
to succeed, he must get great results

4436
02:40:56,890 --> 02:40:58,890
as it will get better results...

4437
02:40:59,460 --> 02:41:04,200
10 minutes in...

4438
02:41:09,870 --> 02:41:14,040
15 minutes in...

4439
02:41:11,670 --> 02:41:12,940
Ebisu is sleeping...

4440
02:41:16,210 --> 02:41:17,180
What?

4441
02:41:18,380 --> 02:41:19,250
I dont' want to see it...

4442
02:41:20,980 --> 02:41:24,250
Why does he push himself so far?

4443
02:41:21,150 --> 02:41:23,850
Why does he push himself so far?

4444
02:41:24,550 --> 02:41:30,490
To produce  Elite DNA

4445
02:41:25,420 --> 02:41:26,420
The reason is...

4446
02:41:26,890 --> 02:41:29,490
to produce Elite DNA.

4447
02:41:30,860 --> 02:41:35,360
A lot of sweat

4448
02:41:32,360 --> 02:41:34,260
Out of Ebisu, comes

4449
02:41:34,260 --> 02:41:35,700
a lot of sweat...

4450
02:41:38,930 --> 02:41:40,070
And we absorb that

4451
02:41:40,070 --> 02:41:42,240
in a high absorption towel

4452
02:41:42,240 --> 02:41:43,670
and we squeeze it into the measure cup

4453
02:41:44,070 --> 02:41:46,140
and collect it all...

4454
02:41:44,340 --> 02:41:51,980
Lots of DNA

4455
02:41:47,240 --> 02:41:49,510
We now have a lot of DNA

4456
02:41:49,510 --> 02:41:51,510
inside the sweat and then...

4457
02:41:52,350 --> 02:41:56,350
We heat it up to purify it

4458
02:41:52,580 --> 02:41:53,550
We heat it on a bunsen burner...

4459
02:41:53,880 --> 02:41:56,050
and to get rid of all the impurities.

4460
02:41:56,650 --> 02:42:02,990
Elite salt is born

4461
02:41:57,450 --> 02:41:58,850
and what is created is

4462
02:41:59,290 --> 02:42:02,360
100% Elite salt

4463
02:42:04,660 --> 02:42:05,930
and with that salt...

4464
02:42:05,930 --> 02:42:07,660
we use it to its fullest...

4465
02:42:08,330 --> 02:42:11,500
and create the ultimate food...

4466
02:42:12,900 --> 02:42:17,670
The Gaasu Rice cake

4467
02:42:13,670 --> 02:42:14,200
That's right...

4468
02:42:14,700 --> 02:42:17,370
The Gaasu Rice cake

4469
02:42:14,870 --> 02:42:19,340
You're kidding me!!!

4470
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:20,340
You've got to be fucking kidding me!!!!!!!!!

4471
02:42:20,340 --> 02:42:22,110
That is disgusting!!

4472
02:42:22,110 --> 02:42:23,710
That is so disgusting!!

4473
02:42:23,710 --> 02:42:26,150
I ate the whole rice cake!!

4474
02:42:28,180 --> 02:42:29,220
You had 2!!

4475
02:42:31,250 --> 02:42:33,220
You're kidding me!!

4476
02:42:33,620 --> 02:42:36,290
For real?!

4477
02:42:35,990 --> 02:42:37,060
Elite salt...

4478
02:42:37,060 --> 02:42:38,490
Elite salt...

4479
02:42:37,560 --> 02:42:40,660
That is disgusting!!

4480
02:42:41,230 --> 02:42:42,600
Are you serious?!

4481
02:42:42,430 --> 02:42:44,600
They weren't going easy on me at all!

4482
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:47,600
I like properly scarfed it!

4483
02:42:46,300 --> 02:42:47,370
You really did...

4484
02:42:46,970 --> 02:42:48,670
I had 2... 2!!!

4485
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:54,010
Both scarfed it down

4486
02:42:48,670 --> 02:42:50,070
That is disgusting

4487
02:42:50,870 --> 02:42:52,640
It's really sick, just sick...

4488
02:42:56,910 --> 02:43:00,150
The staff gambled on that working

4489
02:42:58,880 --> 02:42:59,980
You're right...

4490
02:43:00,150 --> 02:43:04,420
If we watched the DVD first you wouldn't have eaten it

4491
02:43:01,650 --> 02:43:02,620
That's right

4492
02:43:02,550 --> 02:43:03,450
That's so true!

4493
02:43:04,420 --> 02:43:08,590
On top of that I opened mine first

4494
02:43:06,690 --> 02:43:07,390
Amazing...

4495
02:43:07,620 --> 02:43:08,420
That is amazing...

4496
02:43:10,390 --> 02:43:11,560
That is so scary...

4497
02:43:12,560 --> 02:43:14,030
Never...

4498
02:43:14,030 --> 02:43:16,030
They weren't going easy on me at all...

4499
02:43:18,430 --> 02:43:22,470
Elite salt... apparently

4500
02:43:21,200 --> 02:43:22,040
Ebisu's...

4501
02:43:21,570 --> 02:43:22,570
Elite salt...

4502
02:43:22,470 --> 02:43:24,770
You'll never get it out...that elite salt

4503
02:43:24,770 --> 02:43:29,110
You'll never get it out... that elite salt

4504
02:43:29,410 --> 02:43:30,810
I feel sick...

4505
02:43:32,280 --> 02:43:32,950
Did it taste good?

4506
02:43:32,950 --> 02:43:33,980
Yeah it tasted fine

4507
02:43:33,350 --> 02:43:35,620
It was a bit salty...

4508
02:43:36,250 --> 02:43:40,490
It was Elite salt after all...

4509
02:43:41,990 --> 02:43:44,160
They're shocked by the Ebisu situation...

4510
02:43:43,060 --> 02:43:46,860
Earth Defense Force's Training Center    7 hours since starting

4511
02:43:44,760 --> 02:43:45,360
but...

4512
02:43:45,830 --> 02:43:48,360
they can't be shocked about it forever...

4513
02:43:50,430 --> 02:43:54,700
when this gets aired to the public

4514
02:43:52,300 --> 02:43:54,700
that will be really popular I bet

4515
02:43:54,900 --> 02:43:56,770
But do they sell this?

4516
02:43:56,770 --> 02:43:59,640
No way, they definitely don't sell this...

4517
02:43:57,370 --> 02:43:59,640
I don't think so...

4518
02:43:58,640 --> 02:44:01,710
They must have taken ages to plan and make this!

4519
02:44:02,310 --> 02:44:07,180
The fact it's called  M1 is also

4520
02:44:05,580 --> 02:44:07,180
like amazing, isn't it?

4521
02:44:07,280 --> 02:44:08,180
M1...

4522
02:44:08,480 --> 02:44:11,650
MASATOSHI is his name after all...

4523
02:44:12,250 --> 02:44:13,920
Like... Masatoshi 1

4524
02:44:14,390 --> 02:44:15,290
It's just like...

4525
02:44:15,290 --> 02:44:18,190
too much of a match made in heaven...

4526
02:44:18,060 --> 02:44:19,060
it's just coincidence...

4527
02:44:19,460 --> 02:44:21,560
It's got to be...

4528
02:44:21,660 --> 02:44:25,600
It's fate

4529
02:44:22,730 --> 02:44:24,430
Definitely, it's fate

4530
02:44:25,870 --> 02:44:31,370
Your dad and mum just like

4531
02:44:27,370 --> 02:44:28,470
loved it so much they named you after it

4532
02:44:28,470 --> 02:44:31,370
loved it so much, they named you after it.

4533
02:44:35,040 --> 02:44:37,410
They said, "I hope our son becomes like that in the future..."

4534
02:44:37,410 --> 02:44:38,410
That was their wish...

4535
02:44:38,110 --> 02:44:41,080
to become just like M1...

4536
02:44:42,420 --> 02:44:44,320
So they took M1and got Masatoshi from it, tha'ts what you're saying?

4537
02:44:44,320 --> 02:44:46,320
So they took M1 and got Masatoshi from it, that's what you're saying?

4538
02:44:49,190 --> 02:44:51,190
That's the only explanation...

4539
02:44:51,990 --> 02:44:55,430
I wonder if the faces were similar?

4540
02:44:53,460 --> 02:44:55,500
Of course they did, right from the moment he was born.

4541
02:44:55,430 --> 02:44:58,030
It doesn't look like me...

4542
02:44:58,200 --> 02:45:01,800
The fact that your faces are so similar makes me want to laugh...

4543
02:45:02,340 --> 02:45:04,770
However you look at it, out of us five

4544
02:45:06,040 --> 02:45:07,310
That's you

4545
02:45:08,010 --> 02:45:10,080
It sounds ridiculous if you say it

4546
02:45:08,010 --> 02:45:10,080
looks like me, right?

4547
02:45:12,450 --> 02:45:12,880
What? Is it ridiculous?

4548
02:45:12,880 --> 02:45:15,180
What? Is it ridiculous?

4549
02:45:15,650 --> 02:45:17,850
Absolutely.

4550
02:45:21,120 --> 02:45:24,390
They should put Suga-chan in it

4551
02:45:35,770 --> 02:45:41,540
If Matsumoto-san put that forward as an idea

4552
02:45:38,940 --> 02:45:41,540
I reckon they will make it, seriously

4553
02:45:41,540 --> 02:45:44,380
like a little Suga-chan kind of thing...

4554
02:45:45,080 --> 02:45:46,850
No one would ever stop laughing...

4555
02:45:45,850 --> 02:45:48,750
A wig...  that's what I want...

4556
02:45:48,750 --> 02:45:51,250
Like loads of different ideas

4557
02:45:48,750 --> 02:45:52,090
Like a bobbed haircut

4558
02:45:52,050 --> 02:45:53,720
It would be absolutely perfect

4559
02:45:53,720 --> 02:45:54,990
That would be...

4560
02:45:54,990 --> 02:45:56,890
Not... perfect.

4561
02:45:56,890 --> 02:45:58,860
So have Suga-chan wearing that kind of thing...

4562
02:45:59,130 --> 02:46:00,160
and next to it, stick someone like Komuro-san

4563
02:46:00,160 --> 02:46:05,230
and next to it, stick someone like Komuro-san

4564
02:46:08,170 --> 02:46:09,670
Tanaka...

4565
02:46:14,210 --> 02:46:15,240
That was good...

4566
02:46:14,240 --> 02:46:15,680
That was hard...

4567
02:46:15,880 --> 02:46:17,110
This is seriously like H Jungle

4568
02:46:17,110 --> 02:46:20,550
This is seriously like H Jungle

4569
02:46:19,080 --> 02:46:19,680
Right?

4570
02:46:19,580 --> 02:46:20,180
Yeah...

4571
02:46:25,420 --> 02:46:25,920
This is when he was a baby  right?

4572
02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:28,120
This is when he was a baby right?

4573
02:46:27,890 --> 02:46:28,420
a baby?

4574
02:46:29,390 --> 02:46:31,490
He is so stupid to do that...

4575
02:46:32,830 --> 02:46:33,960
M1...

4576
02:46:34,360 --> 02:46:39,070
You can clearly see the whole development

4577
02:46:39,400 --> 02:46:42,040
That one was like when he was a newborn...

4578
02:46:43,370 --> 02:46:46,340
and that one is during shichigosan right?

4579
02:46:43,370 --> 02:46:47,340
Shichigosan: A traditional rite of passage and festival in Japan for three and seven year old girls and three and five year old boys,

4580
02:46:51,910 --> 02:46:54,150
Shichigosan...

4581
02:46:54,150 --> 02:46:55,280
5 years old huh?

4582
02:46:55,080 --> 02:46:56,320
So he's 5 there...

4583
02:46:57,950 --> 02:46:59,120
5 years old...

4584
02:46:59,990 --> 02:47:00,720
That one is when it was 5 years old...

4585
02:47:01,120 --> 02:47:04,360
How about the picture of when it was born?

4586
02:47:02,590 --> 02:47:02,990
Hang on

4587
02:47:05,190 --> 02:47:06,660
You're full of it...

4588
02:47:10,430 --> 02:47:13,600
Isn't that picture the worst out of three?

4589
02:47:18,340 --> 02:47:20,040
The picture...

4590
02:47:19,910 --> 02:47:21,540
It was the worst

4591
02:47:21,110 --> 02:47:21,640
I agree

4592
02:47:21,510 --> 02:47:23,210
The picture...

4593
02:47:21,610 --> 02:47:23,210
You were laughing

4594
02:47:23,210 --> 02:47:24,710
I didn't...

4595
02:47:29,850 --> 02:47:31,720
But seriously, that photo, untouched...

4596
02:47:31,820 --> 02:47:32,990
could be Hamada's driving license,  no?

4597
02:47:32,990 --> 02:47:34,890
could be Hamada's driver license, no?

4598
02:47:40,460 --> 02:47:42,930
Tanaka, you're always getting away with laughing...

4599
02:47:48,840 --> 02:47:49,840
Do you think so?

4600
02:47:49,670 --> 02:47:52,610
I really do, as his driver license

4601
02:47:50,370 --> 02:47:52,440
like if he's with the police?

4602
02:47:51,340 --> 02:47:52,610
When he gets asked "please show me your license"

4603
02:47:52,610 --> 02:47:55,440
If you just casually showed it

4604
02:47:52,610 --> 02:47:55,440
seriously, I think you can get by

4605
02:47:55,440 --> 02:47:59,850
Like obviously

4606
02:47:57,010 --> 02:47:59,850
if it's sunny during the day then it might not be possible

4607
02:47:59,850 --> 02:48:05,250
If it was a bit dark or something and

4608
02:48:01,480 --> 02:48:03,050
the policeman flashes a torchlight on it...

4609
02:48:03,050 --> 02:48:05,250
the policeman flashes a torchlight on it...

4610
02:48:05,250 --> 02:48:08,520
he would just say, "Oh okay, thank you"

4611
02:48:11,860 --> 02:48:14,360
No way in hell would that ever...

4612
02:48:14,330 --> 02:48:16,630
I'm serious, it would happen

4613
02:48:16,430 --> 02:48:18,300
That's going too far...

4614
02:48:17,630 --> 02:48:19,400
No seriously, it would happen...

4615
02:48:18,900 --> 02:48:20,400
If there wasn't light...

4616
02:48:19,400 --> 02:48:20,500
Seriously...

4617
02:48:20,400 --> 02:48:21,370
He wouldn't just casually say thank you

4618
02:48:21,370 --> 02:48:22,670
I'm not joking here...

4619
02:48:25,170 --> 02:48:25,710
He hit me on my tender spot  just now

4620
02:48:25,710 --> 02:48:28,210
He hit me on my tender spot just now

4621
02:48:30,010 --> 02:48:31,210
I'm happy he hit you there...

4622
02:48:31,950 --> 02:48:32,880
like if you  just came out of a tunnel at midnight

4623
02:48:32,880 --> 02:48:36,450
like if you just came out of a tunnel at midnight...

4624
02:48:34,680 --> 02:48:36,550
I think so too...

4625
02:48:37,950 --> 02:48:40,520
The policeman will say, "Sorry, excuse me..."

4626
02:48:40,520 --> 02:48:41,590
Naturally, he will go "Hold on..." when he sees Hamada's face

4627
02:48:41,590 --> 02:48:44,490
Naturally, he will go "Hold on..." when he sees Hamada's face

4628
02:48:44,490 --> 02:48:45,460
anyways,  he would have to check his driving license

4629
02:48:45,460 --> 02:48:48,800
anyways, he would have to check his driving license

4630
02:48:48,800 --> 02:48:49,600
if he just  casually hands it with that picture...

4631
02:48:49,600 --> 02:48:50,930
if he just casually hands it with that picture...

4632
02:48:50,930 --> 02:48:52,170
he would just normally say,  "Oh, okay... thank you"

4633
02:48:52,170 --> 02:48:53,800
he would just normally say "Oh, okay... thank you"

4634
02:48:54,470 --> 02:48:56,940
No no no, that would be ridiculous...

4635
02:48:58,070 --> 02:49:01,210
He definitely wouldn't say like "Oh thank you..."

4636
02:49:01,610 --> 02:49:03,010
It's really  extreme

4637
02:49:03,010 --> 02:49:04,680
It's really  extreme

4638
02:49:03,680 --> 02:49:04,780
You see similarities?

4639
02:49:05,380 --> 02:49:07,050
Holy shit...

4640
02:49:06,280 --> 02:49:07,080
Hang on a second...

4641
02:49:07,050 --> 02:49:08,580
WOW...

4642
02:49:09,150 --> 02:49:12,090
Can we please take a photo?

4643
02:49:10,620 --> 02:49:12,520
It's like brothers next to each other.

4644
02:49:13,890 --> 02:49:16,090
You're so annoying...

4645
02:49:20,460 --> 02:49:22,400
This is amazing...

4646
02:49:21,160 --> 02:49:23,230
I'm really sorry...

4647
02:49:24,400 --> 02:49:25,800
This was a really funny time for us...

4648
02:49:25,800 --> 02:49:27,100
I want a picture...

4649
02:49:28,670 --> 02:49:31,570
I really wish I brought a camera with me...

4650
02:49:32,310 --> 02:49:35,510
please sit next to it?

4651
02:49:32,310 --> 02:49:35,510
would you

4652
02:49:33,610 --> 02:49:35,910
This is going to be priceless...

4653
02:49:36,210 --> 02:49:37,280
That's amazing...

4654
02:49:43,820 --> 02:49:45,520
Don't mess with me!!!

4655
02:49:47,590 --> 02:49:49,090
Like in all seriousness...

4656
02:49:49,090 --> 02:49:50,390
We're really serious

4657
02:49:49,290 --> 02:49:50,690
You can't be serious...

4658
02:49:50,260 --> 02:49:51,560
We are literally like serious in all seriousness

4659
02:49:50,960 --> 02:49:51,890
We are being serious

4660
02:49:55,330 --> 02:49:56,030
Sorry but can you do it once more?

4661
02:49:56,030 --> 02:49:57,400
Yeah, please...

4662
02:49:56,030 --> 02:49:58,200
Sorry but can you do it once more?

4663
02:49:56,930 --> 02:49:58,230
Why the hell??

4664
02:49:58,400 --> 02:50:00,200
It literally looks identical...

4665
02:50:00,200 --> 02:50:02,370
This is seriously amazing...

4666
02:50:02,370 --> 02:50:03,570
It looks like a family portrait

4667
02:50:03,540 --> 02:50:05,310
Oh yeah, you're right.

4668
02:50:05,310 --> 02:50:08,240
Hamada is the mother...

4669
02:50:09,310 --> 02:50:10,380
It's amazing...

4670
02:50:09,910 --> 02:50:10,580
It really is...

4671
02:50:11,110 --> 02:50:15,450
Because the baby is such a newborn

4672
02:50:12,210 --> 02:50:15,450
his tits are still big...

4673
02:50:18,120 --> 02:50:18,990
Come on now...

4674
02:50:18,620 --> 02:50:20,320
You're right...

4675
02:50:20,320 --> 02:50:21,520
Because the kids sucking on them...

4676
02:50:21,190 --> 02:50:23,060
Oh, that's why...

4677
02:50:23,060 --> 02:50:24,060
Because they suck on it...

4678
02:50:23,360 --> 02:50:25,390
the tits are like pressing right against the shirt

4679
02:50:25,460 --> 02:50:27,030
Okay, let's stop...

4680
02:50:29,730 --> 02:50:32,070
Let's stop, seriously...

4681
02:50:31,230 --> 02:50:32,500
Yeay, let's stop...

4682
02:50:32,500 --> 02:50:34,000
Seriously, it would never happen...

4683
02:50:35,470 --> 02:50:37,340
M1 is so scary...

4684
02:50:35,870 --> 02:50:38,440
That is amazing, Hamada-san

4685
02:50:38,440 --> 02:50:41,010
There shouldn't be a

4686
02:50:38,440 --> 02:50:41,010
look-a-like monsters...

4687
02:50:40,510 --> 02:50:41,440
No way...

4688
02:50:41,940 --> 02:50:44,210
If you look for some, there would be

4689
02:50:44,380 --> 02:50:45,680
I honestly don't think we look alike at all...

4690
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:47,480
but I'm sure there is a monster for everyone...

4691
02:50:47,780 --> 02:50:48,850
Was it originally a gorilla

4692
02:50:48,850 --> 02:50:50,750
Was it originally a gorilla?

4693
02:50:50,750 --> 02:50:51,250
It's some sort of  fucked up monster

4694
02:50:51,250 --> 02:50:54,320
It's some sort of fucked up monster

4695
02:50:52,420 --> 02:50:53,920
It doesn't say anything about that...

4696
02:50:54,820 --> 02:50:55,560
But you know...

4697
02:50:55,860 --> 02:50:59,760
Appears in casual clothes

4698
02:50:55,860 --> 02:50:59,760
Gekidan Hitori

4699
02:50:56,190 --> 02:50:57,790
I will say this, but...

4700
02:50:58,390 --> 02:50:59,730
Hi there...

4701
02:50:59,230 --> 02:51:00,130
Hey there...

4702
02:51:01,260 --> 02:51:01,760
Hey guys...

4703
02:51:02,430 --> 02:51:03,100
What's up?

4704
02:51:03,100 --> 02:51:04,200
Have a seat...

4705
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:05,600
Okay, excuse me...

4706
02:51:12,110 --> 02:51:13,740
Today... um...

4707
02:51:15,810 --> 02:51:19,880
I need to apologise about something firstly...

4708
02:51:20,780 --> 02:51:22,650
This year  I was called onto Gaki no Tsukai

4709
02:51:22,650 --> 02:51:24,650
This year I was called onto Gaki no Tsukai

4710
02:51:25,620 --> 02:51:26,890
and I wanted to do something funny

4711
02:51:28,320 --> 02:51:30,290
for them but...

4712
02:51:33,130 --> 02:51:35,730
I couldn't think of anything funny to do...

4713
02:51:36,530 --> 02:51:37,600
I got to...

4714
02:51:37,900 --> 02:51:39,800
I got to attend loads of meetings with the staff...

4715
02:51:43,140 --> 02:51:43,840
But...

4716
02:51:47,840 --> 02:51:49,110
but still...

4717
02:51:50,180 --> 02:51:51,780
I came empty handed...

4718
02:51:52,850 --> 02:51:54,450
you know?

4719
02:51:54,450 --> 02:51:56,750
and I thought about it loads...

4720
02:52:00,220 --> 02:52:04,760
this is my graduation album of middle school

4721
02:52:07,260 --> 02:52:07,930
well about this...

4722
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:11,900
If I rip this to shit, would that make you laugh?

4723
02:52:11,900 --> 02:52:19,240
He'll rip the album to shit just to get them to laugh

4724
02:52:12,400 --> 02:52:13,570
No no...

4725
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:16,170
No, no, you don't need to...

4726
02:52:15,740 --> 02:52:17,570
Don't do that...

4727
02:52:17,570 --> 02:52:19,240
Definitely don't...

4728
02:52:18,940 --> 02:52:20,740
You don't need to do that...

4729
02:52:20,340 --> 02:52:23,110
It would really make us feel awkward as well...

4730
02:52:23,080 --> 02:52:25,450
Yeah, let's not do that...

4731
02:52:25,580 --> 02:52:27,780
Don't do it, don't do it...

4732
02:52:27,780 --> 02:52:28,920
It's fine!

4733
02:52:28,920 --> 02:52:30,550
Come on, stop it...

4734
02:52:31,250 --> 02:52:31,950
It's your memories right?

4735
02:52:31,950 --> 02:52:32,820
It is my memories!

4736
02:52:32,820 --> 02:52:34,320
Then don't do it!

4737
02:52:33,890 --> 02:52:36,660
My whole youth in this book

4738
02:52:37,890 --> 02:52:39,960
Seriously, we won't laugh if you tear it up...

4739
02:52:39,960 --> 02:52:43,900
If I rip this to shit

4740
02:52:40,460 --> 02:52:43,900
all of you will definitely laugh for me

4741
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:43,930
No we won't, we really won't...

4742
02:52:43,930 --> 02:52:44,830
Look...

4743
02:52:44,330 --> 02:52:45,370
Ridiculous...

4744
02:52:45,030 --> 02:52:46,470
Look, please look at this...

4745
02:52:46,900 --> 02:52:47,400
Look...

4746
02:52:47,400 --> 02:52:48,000
There he is... there..

4747
02:52:48,000 --> 02:53:08,020
Hitori (young)

4748
02:52:48,670 --> 02:52:49,170
Look...

4749
02:52:48,940 --> 02:52:50,140
There you are...

4750
02:52:50,070 --> 02:52:50,940
That's great

4751
02:52:50,840 --> 02:52:52,540
I  loved Downtown so much

4752
02:52:52,540 --> 02:52:55,110
I loved Downtown so much

4753
02:52:52,540 --> 02:52:55,110
that I even

4754
02:52:55,110 --> 02:52:57,280
had the same hairstyle as Ma-chan!

4755
02:52:56,710 --> 02:53:07,920
Even had the same haircut

4756
02:52:59,280 --> 02:53:02,080
I wanted to be like him so much...

4757
02:53:03,420 --> 02:53:04,950
But I just can't be like him...

4758
02:53:05,150 --> 02:53:06,290
no no no...

4759
02:53:06,290 --> 02:53:08,490
So I know this is the only thing I can really do...

4760
02:53:08,220 --> 02:53:08,960
Wait, what are you going to do?

4761
02:53:09,290 --> 02:53:10,590
Wait, wait wait!!!

4762
02:53:12,460 --> 02:53:13,760
Please don't stop me!!

4763
02:53:13,760 --> 02:53:15,600
It's something really precious

4764
02:53:15,600 --> 02:53:17,130
Please don't stop me!!!

4765
02:53:17,130 --> 02:53:18,630
It's your memories man...

4766
02:53:18,100 --> 02:53:19,200
It's really precious...

4767
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:21,200
I really want all of you to laugh!

4768
02:53:21,970 --> 02:53:23,570
We won't laugh at that...

4769
02:53:23,570 --> 02:53:24,840
Yeah, we won't, so stop

4770
02:53:24,570 --> 02:53:25,340
We won't laugh...

4771
02:53:25,640 --> 02:53:26,940
Here you go everyone...

4772
02:53:27,240 --> 02:53:29,110
please laugh to your heart's content...

4773
02:53:29,580 --> 02:53:31,910
No no, stop...

4774
02:53:30,610 --> 02:53:32,180
Stop him...

4775
02:53:32,180 --> 02:53:33,880
Don't, don't!

4776
02:53:40,120 --> 02:53:41,820
Please stop it!!

4777
02:53:43,260 --> 02:53:51,600
Ripped his middle school memories to shit

4778
02:53:43,290 --> 02:53:44,760
Stop it you idiot!

4779
02:53:44,960 --> 02:53:46,730
This is the real one...

4780
02:53:47,630 --> 02:53:48,730
It's funny, right?

4781
02:53:51,830 --> 02:53:52,870
This kind of thing is no good

4782
02:53:52,870 --> 02:53:54,270
This kind of thing is no good...

4783
02:53:57,970 --> 02:54:00,340
It's really bad...

4784
02:54:00,210 --> 02:54:01,240
No no, seriously...

4785
02:54:01,880 --> 02:54:02,710
It's not good...

4786
02:54:02,610 --> 02:54:04,410
This is wrong...

4787
02:54:04,610 --> 02:54:05,580
This is so wrong...

4788
02:54:12,220 --> 02:54:14,090
3:30 PM

4789
02:54:13,490 --> 02:54:16,890
Earth Defense Force training     7 hours 30 minutes since the start

4790
02:54:14,090 --> 02:54:16,260
The real Elite training starts here...

4791
02:54:19,460 --> 02:54:23,930
Alarm suddenly goes off

4792
02:54:22,600 --> 02:54:24,000
What the hell is that...

4793
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:35,110
Announcement

4794
02:54:25,030 --> 02:54:29,670
Oh no!!  Right now, in this building

4795
02:54:26,300 --> 02:54:29,670
Right now, in this building

4796
02:54:27,500 --> 02:54:29,670
there is an intruder

4797
02:54:29,670 --> 02:54:35,110
there is an intruder apparently.

4798
02:54:30,070 --> 02:54:35,110
So you guys be careful.

4799
02:54:32,540 --> 02:54:33,640
Oh dear...

4800
02:54:33,640 --> 02:54:35,140
Why do things like this happen...

4801
02:54:35,140 --> 02:54:36,210
But how?

4802
02:54:36,210 --> 02:54:37,810
Surely you shouldn't be able to get into the Earth Defense Force training centre...

4803
02:54:37,810 --> 02:54:40,080
Surely you shouldn't be able to get into the Earth Defense Force training center...

4804
02:54:42,620 --> 02:54:45,050
The intruder enters

4805
02:54:51,560 --> 02:54:52,260
Wait, what, what?!

4806
02:54:52,260 --> 02:54:53,130
What's going on!?

4807
02:54:52,260 --> 02:54:54,030
There are loads of them

4808
02:54:53,830 --> 02:54:54,560
Hang on a second!!

4809
02:54:54,560 --> 02:54:56,330
Hang on a second!!

4810
02:54:56,330 --> 02:54:58,730
Why me!?

4811
02:55:02,340 --> 02:55:04,170
Man... that surprised me...

4812
02:55:04,170 --> 02:55:06,740
Well we can't do anything about it...

4813
02:55:05,270 --> 02:55:06,640
Yeah we really can't...

4814
02:55:06,840 --> 02:55:07,240
Oh well...

4815
02:55:07,610 --> 02:55:11,110
Nothing we can do...

4816
02:55:11,110 --> 02:55:12,350
Weren't those people  familiar?

4817
02:55:12,350 --> 02:55:13,950
Weren't those people familiar?

4818
02:55:13,950 --> 02:55:14,780
Everyone don't worry

4819
02:55:14,780 --> 02:55:16,520
Everyone, don't worry

4820
02:55:16,520 --> 02:55:17,950
The truth is  we're doing a special training{\c\4c\3c now

4821
02:55:17,950 --> 02:55:24,160
The truth is we're doing a special training now

4822
02:55:19,590 --> 02:55:24,160
so I had one person get caught on purpose

4823
02:55:22,990 --> 02:55:25,090
as training...

4824
02:55:24,160 --> 02:55:26,430
Well we are going to start the training,  so can you changed into this?

4825
02:55:24,460 --> 02:55:25,230
Training?

4826
02:55:26,430 --> 02:55:27,830
Well we are going to start the training, so can you change into this?

4827
02:55:28,060 --> 02:55:29,100
To do this "special training" we have to get  changed?

4828
02:55:29,100 --> 02:55:32,100
To do this "special training" we have to get changed?

4829
02:55:30,130 --> 02:55:31,970
When you finish getting changed, I will return...

4830
02:55:34,500 --> 02:55:39,640
the guys get dressed into something appropriate

4831
02:55:34,500 --> 02:55:39,640
Before the training starts

4832
02:55:35,070 --> 02:55:36,370
Before the training starts,

4833
02:55:36,370 --> 02:55:38,940
the 4 get changed into something a little more appropriate

4834
02:55:39,640 --> 02:55:42,510
Okay, shall we?

4835
02:55:41,640 --> 02:55:42,810
I'm actually quite scared...

4836
02:55:42,710 --> 02:55:47,150
What will the special training be exactly?!

4837
02:55:43,110 --> 02:55:44,280
Now...

4838
02:55:44,280 --> 02:55:46,580
What will the special training consist of!?

4839
02:55:47,580 --> 02:55:49,350
Right guys, can you all line up here?

4840
02:55:47,780 --> 02:55:48,620
Shit... I saw it...

4841
02:55:48,620 --> 02:55:51,520
Shit... I saw it...

4842
02:55:49,920 --> 02:55:51,150
What, here?

4843
02:55:51,520 --> 02:55:53,720
Hamada-san, please look behind you...

4844
02:55:53,720 --> 02:55:56,490
Oh shit...

4845
02:55:56,560 --> 02:55:57,990
Are you fucking serious?

4846
02:55:57,960 --> 02:56:00,760
Okay guys

4847
02:55:58,560 --> 02:56:00,760
the training you're about to do is this!!

4848
02:56:01,530 --> 02:56:02,930
There it is...

4849
02:56:03,900 --> 02:56:05,370
Shit, that's the worst!!

4850
02:56:05,370 --> 02:56:07,600
I really hate this thing...

4851
02:56:05,500 --> 02:56:08,370
Oh come on, no more...

4852
02:56:08,570 --> 02:56:10,240
During this training, you can laugh...

4853
02:56:10,240 --> 02:56:15,580
but if you get caught by an ONI  you will be

4854
02:56:11,910 --> 02:56:15,580
severely punished on   the spot!!

4855
02:56:19,480 --> 02:56:25,620
DO NOT GET CAUGHT - SPY

4856
02:56:19,580 --> 02:56:25,620
3 years ago

4857
02:56:19,880 --> 02:56:22,650
The nightmare from 3 years ago - "No Laughing" Spy

4858
02:56:25,420 --> 02:56:27,820
If you get caught by an ONI, you face hell...

4859
02:56:25,720 --> 02:56:32,360
If you get caught

4860
02:56:25,720 --> 02:56:32,360
you get punished according to what it says on their chest!!

4861
02:56:28,320 --> 02:56:31,590
You will be punished severely, according to what is written on their chest.

4862
02:56:32,860 --> 02:56:35,730
When the training starts, there will be 3 ONI.

4863
02:56:32,860 --> 02:56:36,330
When it starts, 3 ONI will appear

4864
02:56:32,860 --> 02:56:40,870
Special Training

4865
02:56:36,330 --> 02:56:40,870
every 20 minutes  more ONI will appear

4866
02:56:36,900 --> 02:56:40,070
every 20 minutes, more ONI will appear

4867
02:56:41,470 --> 02:56:48,740
Caught

4868
02:56:41,470 --> 02:56:48,740
Do Not Get

4869
02:56:41,470 --> 02:56:48,740
Earth Defense Force

4870
02:56:41,700 --> 02:56:44,070
A training which will occur across the whole area

4871
02:56:44,970 --> 02:56:47,810
Do not get caught Earth Defense Force

4872
02:56:48,880 --> 02:56:50,080
You guys are all

4873
02:56:50,080 --> 02:56:51,710
such low life comedians, the whole lot of you

4874
02:56:51,710 --> 02:56:52,780
I've prepared a more upper class comedian

4875
02:56:52,780 --> 02:56:56,650
I've prepared a more upper class comedian

4876
02:56:53,850 --> 02:56:56,650
just for you

4877
02:56:54,750 --> 02:56:56,650
Please come out now.

4878
02:56:58,590 --> 02:56:59,590
For real?

4879
02:56:58,820 --> 02:57:02,160
Mizobata Junpei

4880
02:56:58,820 --> 02:57:02,160
Other person

4881
02:57:02,160 --> 02:57:04,490
What the hell are you doing here?

4882
02:57:04,490 --> 02:57:06,030
I love Gaki no Tsukai

4883
02:57:06,560 --> 02:57:13,800
I've been saying, "I really want to go on it"

4884
02:57:09,030 --> 02:57:13,800
Japanese producer

4885
02:57:09,030 --> 02:57:13,800
I've been begging Suga-san for ages

4886
02:57:09,030 --> 02:57:13,800
Suga Kenji

4887
02:57:11,300 --> 02:57:13,970
This isn't something you want to be part of...

4888
02:57:13,800 --> 02:57:17,270
They will properly fuck you up!!

4889
02:57:15,770 --> 02:57:17,270
This is really like harsh!

4890
02:57:17,570 --> 02:57:25,280
The 5 men are given an important mission!

4891
02:57:17,570 --> 02:57:25,280
The EDF depends on this!

4892
02:57:18,470 --> 02:57:19,640
And so...

4893
02:57:19,640 --> 02:57:23,110
Including Misobata, the mission given to the 5 is...

4894
02:57:24,080 --> 02:57:24,880
THIS!

4895
02:57:25,410 --> 02:57:34,220
Find the treasure chest which contatins a map

4896
02:57:25,410 --> 02:57:34,220
showing where Matsumoto is

4897
02:57:25,410 --> 02:57:40,760
Special Training

4898
02:57:26,380 --> 02:57:30,750
find the treasure chest containing a map which shows where Matsumoto is...

4899
02:57:31,050 --> 02:57:32,620
and rescue him.

4900
02:57:33,420 --> 02:57:35,020
I was so cold there...

4901
02:57:33,490 --> 02:57:34,390
However...

4902
02:57:34,220 --> 02:57:34,420
sfshjkhjkhjkhjkhjkhjkdfsdfsdfsdfsdf

4903
02:57:34,220 --> 02:57:40,760
every 20 minutes Matsumoto will be punished

4904
02:57:34,720 --> 02:57:36,260
Until he is rescued...

4905
02:57:36,260 --> 02:57:38,460
Matsumoto will be punished

4906
02:57:38,460 --> 02:57:40,460
every 20 minutes.

4907
02:57:41,330 --> 02:57:43,130
This is really horrible!!

4908
02:57:43,130 --> 02:57:44,800
Like really horrible!!

4909
02:57:44,800 --> 02:57:47,870
Okay, are you guys ready?

4910
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:47,970
Shit, I'm scared

4911
02:57:48,370 --> 02:57:53,640
Special Training START!

4912
02:57:53,840 --> 02:58:04,920
Slipper

4913
02:57:57,580 --> 02:57:58,550
Shit, he's quick!

4914
02:57:58,380 --> 02:58:01,150
[Hamada]  Oh, shit, shit

4915
02:57:58,410 --> 02:57:58,510
[Hamada] Oh, shit, shit

4916
02:57:58,510 --> 02:58:01,150
[Hamada] Oh, shit, shit

4917
02:57:58,780 --> 02:57:58,850
[Hamada] Oh, shit,  shit,

4918
02:57:58,850 --> 02:58:01,150
[Hamada] Oh, shit  shit

4919
02:58:01,580 --> 02:58:02,720
They were so fast

4920
02:58:06,820 --> 02:58:08,720
This really hurts

4921
02:58:08,560 --> 02:58:10,090
[Hamada] my head's making a "kin~~~" sound

4922
02:58:10,090 --> 02:58:12,960
[Endo] Have you ever seen Hamada-san get hit

4923
02:58:11,490 --> 02:58:12,960
that hard by a slipper?

4924
02:58:13,460 --> 02:58:15,730
2nd ONI COMES OUT

4925
02:58:15,730 --> 02:58:17,730
[Hamada] Another one's come out.

4926
02:58:18,870 --> 02:58:21,470
[Endo] There's two of them...

4927
02:58:19,300 --> 02:58:21,470
[Endo]   There's two of them.

4928
02:58:25,070 --> 02:58:27,410
I could hear the sounds of them hitting you

4929
02:58:27,410 --> 02:58:28,510
Oh I see...

4930
02:58:28,410 --> 02:58:37,050
Massive paper fan

4931
02:58:32,280 --> 02:58:33,250
That is ridiculous...

4932
02:58:32,980 --> 02:58:34,180
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry...

4933
02:58:36,820 --> 02:58:38,850
It hurt so fucking much

4934
02:58:37,650 --> 02:58:38,150
[Hamada] He went over there  right over there

4935
02:58:37,650 --> 02:58:38,890
Of course it would...

4936
02:58:38,150 --> 02:58:40,820
[Hamada] He went over there, right over there

4937
02:58:40,220 --> 02:58:41,690
He got hit like SO hard

4938
02:58:41,290 --> 02:58:43,390
I hear sounds going off in my head when I got hit...

4939
02:58:42,490 --> 02:58:47,260
Housei doesn't look like a comedian anymore...

4940
02:58:44,790 --> 02:58:46,060
Shit, I'm scared...

4941
02:58:47,760 --> 02:58:50,900
3rd ONI COMES OUT

4942
02:58:49,230 --> 02:58:50,830
That's a bad look you got there...

4943
02:58:50,900 --> 02:59:18,090
All fours

4944
02:58:51,970 --> 02:58:52,970
He's got a bad look on his face

4945
02:58:52,400 --> 02:58:53,870
Look at that, he's got a bad look on his face

4946
02:58:53,900 --> 02:58:55,100
This is hard, so hard!!

4947
02:58:56,270 --> 02:58:58,070
They are so fast, you're right

4948
02:58:58,070 --> 02:59:00,040
They were so bloody fast

4949
02:59:11,150 --> 02:59:12,820
That's fine but...

4950
02:59:16,860 --> 02:59:17,960
What the hell was this?

4951
02:59:19,230 --> 02:59:20,830
What is he doing to you?!

4952
02:59:34,040 --> 02:59:35,010
What the hell is this?!

4953
02:59:34,640 --> 02:59:36,110
Say something!!

4954
02:59:36,010 --> 02:59:39,650
The 5 meet up

4955
02:59:36,080 --> 02:59:37,780
You don't want the paper fan, whatever happens

4956
02:59:37,710 --> 02:59:38,780
Leave it out!

4957
02:59:38,780 --> 02:59:39,580
Whatever happens, you don't want the paper fan!

4958
02:59:39,650 --> 02:59:40,680
The five meet up

4959
02:59:40,680 --> 02:59:41,480
What did you get?

4960
02:59:41,480 --> 02:59:43,720
I got slapped four times and then 100 strikes.

4961
02:59:43,720 --> 02:59:46,120
Eh? 100 times?

4962
02:59:46,220 --> 02:59:47,520
Don't lie!

4963
02:59:47,020 --> 02:59:50,860
Let's look for it: the treasure box with the map in it.

4964
02:59:51,490 --> 02:59:52,460
No way.

4965
02:59:52,860 --> 02:59:55,260
That paper fan is dangerous!!

4966
02:59:54,660 --> 03:00:12,650
PAPER FAN

4967
02:59:55,260 --> 02:59:57,730
That paper fan is a no-no!

4968
02:59:57,730 --> 02:59:59,000
That paper fan is really bad.

4969
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
Your head really makes a sound

4970
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:04,170
This one really hurts.

4971
03:00:05,410 --> 03:00:09,180
Stop! Stop! Please stop!

4972
03:00:09,080 --> 03:00:12,650
Tanaka with his disgusting running form.

4973
03:00:13,850 --> 03:00:15,320
The way he ran...

4974
03:00:15,320 --> 03:00:17,850
That running form is seriously...

4975
03:00:18,150 --> 03:00:20,190
Aaaa~n!!!

4976
03:00:20,190 --> 03:00:21,320
Why?

4977
03:00:25,090 --> 03:00:26,260
That was tiring.

4978
03:00:28,830 --> 03:00:30,230
Something is coming!!

4979
03:00:30,230 --> 03:00:34,900
All fours

4980
03:00:30,230 --> 03:00:34,900
Getting closer

4981
03:00:30,530 --> 03:00:31,530
It's all fours.

4982
03:00:42,610 --> 03:00:44,310
What is up with this?

4983
03:00:43,580 --> 03:00:45,280
That hurts!

4984
03:00:46,580 --> 03:00:48,280
This pisses me off.

4985
03:00:48,280 --> 03:00:50,320
It really does, huh?

4986
03:00:50,320 --> 03:00:52,150
They should hit him harder.

4987
03:00:52,320 --> 03:00:54,690
They really don't go easy on you.

4988
03:00:54,690 --> 03:00:57,560
Slipper

4989
03:00:56,790 --> 03:01:02,230
Time quickly passed by, but soon it will be the punishment rush.

4990
03:00:57,890 --> 03:01:02,230
All fours

4991
03:01:02,630 --> 03:01:07,370
Endo's... butt... is getting slapped.

4992
03:01:07,370 --> 03:01:09,940
Poor guy.

4993
03:01:15,040 --> 03:01:44,370
All fours

4994
03:01:20,980 --> 03:01:44,370
Slipper

4995
03:01:23,250 --> 03:01:27,820
Tanaka is being flanked by two ONI!

4996
03:01:23,820 --> 03:01:27,020
You gotta be kidding me.

4997
03:01:29,690 --> 03:01:33,360
That was quick. I was quickly caught!!

4998
03:01:33,360 --> 03:01:37,730
It's a double. It's the worst two punishments, look.

4999
03:01:38,030 --> 03:01:39,770
That hurts!

5000
03:01:42,070 --> 03:01:47,440
It hurts! That hurts...

5001
03:01:49,010 --> 03:01:53,350
That was the worst. Man, I can't deal with that.

5002
03:01:53,350 --> 03:01:55,650
Wait a sec...

5003
03:01:55,750 --> 03:01:57,750
Let's go over there; this place is bad.

5004
03:01:57,750 --> 03:02:00,590
They come out from here. This spot is bad.

5005
03:01:59,120 --> 03:02:00,520
That's right.

5006
03:02:00,590 --> 03:02:04,560
If we stay here, we'll always get punished.

5007
03:02:04,560 --> 03:02:06,460
Let's search for it.

5008
03:02:06,460 --> 03:02:09,000
Let's look for that treasure map.

5009
03:02:13,670 --> 03:02:16,370
This is really hard.

5010
03:02:16,540 --> 03:02:19,810
It's amazing... Variety shows...

5011
03:02:19,810 --> 03:02:21,840
This is not a variety show anymore.

5012
03:02:21,840 --> 03:02:24,110
It's a documentary.

5013
03:02:29,420 --> 03:02:32,090
Tanaka hiding himself

5014
03:02:34,290 --> 03:02:37,060
Oy! OY!!!

5015
03:02:36,890 --> 03:02:51,640
All fours

5016
03:02:37,060 --> 03:02:38,790
There! There! Over there!!

5017
03:02:38,960 --> 03:02:42,100
Housei selling out his friend to the ONI.

5018
03:02:42,630 --> 03:02:44,800
Ahahahaha~!!

5019
03:02:45,030 --> 03:02:46,700
That guy has gotta be kidding me.

5020
03:02:48,400 --> 03:02:51,640
Housei got what he deserved

5021
03:02:51,940 --> 03:02:56,410
If you sell out your friends, of course that's going to happen to you.

5022
03:02:56,410 --> 03:02:59,850
That guy really sold out his friend.

5023
03:02:59,850 --> 03:03:01,680
I was spared so I'm fine but...

5024
03:03:01,680 --> 03:03:03,750
That really shocked me...

5025
03:03:03,750 --> 03:03:08,320
"Over there! Oy oy! He's over there!", he said.

5026
03:03:08,320 --> 03:03:11,590
I thought we were friends.

5027
03:03:09,860 --> 03:03:12,190
Tanaka, believe me.

5028
03:03:13,960 --> 03:03:16,630
Tanaka, believe me. You're mistaken.

5029
03:03:16,630 --> 03:03:19,700
I've always thought we were friends!!

5030
03:03:19,700 --> 03:03:22,200
Please give me another chance!!

5031
03:03:22,200 --> 03:03:25,070
Alright, let's go up.

5032
03:03:24,040 --> 03:03:25,840
Give me another chance.
What is up with that guy?

5033
03:03:25,070 --> 03:03:28,110
The treasure map!!

5034
03:03:25,840 --> 03:03:27,840
What kind of chance did
he want?

5035
03:03:28,640 --> 03:03:31,880
The 20 minute mark has just passed.

5036
03:03:32,080 --> 03:03:35,380
A total of seven ONI is on the site.

5037
03:03:35,750 --> 03:03:39,020
Punishment time

5038
03:03:45,460 --> 03:03:48,230
Stop! Stop!

5039
03:03:48,230 --> 03:03:52,470
Stop! I seriously can't stand this!

5040
03:03:57,140 --> 03:03:59,440
They were really tickling me.

5041
03:03:59,440 --> 03:04:03,010
Are you done yet?

5042
03:04:03,010 --> 03:04:05,880
That was tiring.

5043
03:04:04,710 --> 03:04:06,380
That was really tiring.

5044
03:04:06,380 --> 03:04:08,650
Even my head was spinning.

5045
03:04:07,750 --> 03:04:09,350
I don't think it's here.

5046
03:04:07,750 --> 03:04:11,450
Searching the 2nd floor

5047
03:04:09,350 --> 03:04:11,850
I don't think there's anything here.

5048
03:04:12,190 --> 03:04:14,320
SLIP

5049
03:04:14,320 --> 03:04:16,990
Is there a step there?

5050
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:16,790
He slips even when there's no steps.

5051
03:04:17,060 --> 03:04:19,860
No way. You stumbled here?

5052
03:04:19,860 --> 03:04:22,330
It was slightly raised...

5053
03:04:23,830 --> 03:04:32,040
Getting closer

5054
03:04:23,830 --> 03:04:32,040
Honeymoon

5055
03:04:24,730 --> 03:04:26,970
Why did you run ahead and not tell us, you fuck!?

5056
03:04:27,800 --> 03:04:29,270
What's "Honeymoon"?

5057
03:04:29,270 --> 03:04:31,870
I can't take this already.

5058
03:04:41,050 --> 03:04:42,820
That is too scary.

5059
03:04:42,820 --> 03:04:44,020
I got caught.

5060
03:04:44,420 --> 03:04:47,890
I got caught because of Hamada-san.

5061
03:04:50,190 --> 03:04:53,060
It says "Honeymoon" there.

5062
03:04:53,060 --> 03:04:55,060
It's not "Harisen"? (Paper fan)

5063
03:04:55,600 --> 03:04:57,730
You'll be exposed!

5064
03:04:57,730 --> 03:04:59,870
You're definitely gonna be exposed with all that loud noise.

5065
03:04:59,870 --> 03:05:02,440
Don't come here!!

5066
03:05:04,070 --> 03:05:05,410
Even though you say I'm gonna be exposed...

5067
03:05:05,410 --> 03:05:09,010
This is all fixed, I can't help it.

5068
03:05:09,010 --> 03:05:10,880
Then you just stay here on your own.

5069
03:05:10,980 --> 03:05:14,080
Definitely don't come near us.

5070
03:05:12,210 --> 03:05:14,050
Let's go find it quick!

5071
03:05:14,280 --> 03:05:18,120
The abandoned Housei

5072
03:05:18,120 --> 03:05:22,790
Four of them went back to 1st floor

5073
03:05:19,620 --> 03:05:22,060
This won't end unless we find it.

5074
03:05:23,090 --> 03:05:26,130
Housei-san is just utterly useless to us now...

5075
03:05:26,130 --> 03:05:28,130
Just clattering as he goes by.

5076
03:05:28,460 --> 03:05:30,130
It's because you would know where he will be.

5077
03:05:30,130 --> 03:05:33,670
It's gonna be dangerous for Yamachan; an ONI is coming; slipper.

5078
03:05:33,670 --> 03:05:36,270
Because of his noise.

5079
03:05:33,670 --> 03:05:38,340
Slipper could hear the noise

5080
03:05:36,270 --> 03:05:37,640
He's gonna be exposed easily.

5081
03:05:37,640 --> 03:05:38,840
It's here!

5082
03:05:38,640 --> 03:05:44,680
Slipper

5083
03:05:48,480 --> 03:05:51,920
Hamada is rejoicing in the misfortunes of other people

5084
03:05:52,420 --> 03:05:55,660
It's really funny watching someone else gets hit.

5085
03:05:55,790 --> 03:05:58,160
It can't be helped.

5086
03:05:58,160 --> 03:05:59,930
Can't be helped.

5087
03:05:59,460 --> 03:06:02,830
Housei escapes to to 1st floor

5088
03:06:12,010 --> 03:06:17,410
Housei's tin can gets entangled

5089
03:06:14,710 --> 03:06:16,710
That's hell.

5090
03:06:17,180 --> 03:06:18,980
A hellish time.

5091
03:06:18,980 --> 03:06:21,280
It's a really hellish time.

5092
03:06:23,750 --> 03:06:26,290
It's a really hellish time.

5093
03:06:25,420 --> 03:06:29,590
I got entangled!!

5094
03:06:29,590 --> 03:06:33,260
You're just bait. The ONI is gonna come here!

5095
03:06:33,260 --> 03:06:37,000
Paper fan ONI could hear the noise

5096
03:06:34,160 --> 03:06:36,300
What should I do?

5097
03:06:39,300 --> 03:06:41,470
Wait... Junpei-kun!!

5098
03:06:41,470 --> 03:06:45,270
No no no wait! This is scary! Stop! No!

5099
03:06:41,770 --> 03:06:55,950
Paper fan

5100
03:06:51,410 --> 03:06:52,650
Wait...

5101
03:06:53,280 --> 03:06:55,950
Wait a sec...

5102
03:06:55,950 --> 03:06:58,550
Someone save me!!!

5103
03:06:58,550 --> 03:07:00,690
Someone please save me!!

5104
03:07:04,390 --> 03:07:08,030
Matsumoto's reaction to the screaming

5105
03:07:08,060 --> 03:07:10,600
HAMADA-SAN!!

5106
03:07:10,600 --> 03:07:13,300
ENDO!!

5107
03:07:13,300 --> 03:07:15,640
JUNPEI-KUN SAVE ME!!

5108
03:07:15,770 --> 03:07:16,940
Ahahahaha...

5109
03:07:17,270 --> 03:07:22,510
Handsome actor can't stop laughing

5110
03:07:22,510 --> 03:07:24,210
TANAKA!!

5111
03:07:24,210 --> 03:07:26,880
SOMEONE!!

5112
03:07:26,880 --> 03:07:28,620
SAVE ME!!

5113
03:07:28,620 --> 03:07:34,590
The shameless scream of an abandoned man

5114
03:07:35,490 --> 03:07:37,590
SOMEONE!!

5115
03:07:39,260 --> 03:07:42,300
You could really tell where Housei-san is immediately.

5116
03:07:44,230 --> 03:07:50,470
Getting closer

5117
03:07:44,230 --> 03:07:50,470
Paper fan

5118
03:07:50,970 --> 03:07:53,910
Hamada who is not hidden at all

5119
03:07:53,910 --> 03:07:55,910
That is so easy to figure out!

5120
03:07:56,410 --> 03:07:58,480
Ha ha ha!

5121
03:07:59,780 --> 03:08:02,620
I thought it would run pass me

5122
03:08:02,750 --> 03:08:04,720
But it saw me

5123
03:08:12,630 --> 03:08:14,730
What's with that face?

5124
03:08:14,730 --> 03:08:18,970
Your face pisses me off.

5125
03:08:18,970 --> 03:08:21,600
What is up with that face?

5126
03:08:21,600 --> 03:08:25,540
When the punishment was coming, did it not occur to you to help me?

5127
03:08:25,540 --> 03:08:27,910
I saw it from the beginning til the end.

5128
03:08:27,910 --> 03:08:29,610
You were like this.

5129
03:08:29,610 --> 03:08:34,180
My collapsing senior.

5130
03:08:34,180 --> 03:08:38,120
A new ONI slowly draws closer to the two.

5131
03:08:40,090 --> 03:08:42,790
Only Tanaka notices it.

5132
03:08:43,590 --> 03:08:53,600
Getting closer

5133
03:08:49,130 --> 03:08:50,930
You are really playing dirty!!

5134
03:08:51,100 --> 03:08:53,600
Tanaka abandoned his senior

5135
03:08:53,070 --> 03:08:55,540
Looks like he abandoned you

5136
03:08:55,970 --> 03:08:59,010
Wait a moment! Seriously wait a sec!!

5137
03:09:00,210 --> 03:09:02,780
Tanaka feels sorry and watches his senior...

5138
03:09:02,980 --> 03:09:15,120
Elvis

5139
03:09:05,010 --> 03:09:06,180
That hurts.

5140
03:09:06,780 --> 03:09:09,850
Making the hideous Hamada even uglier by vandalizing his face

5141
03:09:09,850 --> 03:09:12,220
It hurts.

5142
03:09:14,290 --> 03:09:15,690
Elvis?

5143
03:09:18,390 --> 03:09:19,660
What the hell?

5144
03:09:21,230 --> 03:09:23,400
It hurts. My face hurts.

5145
03:09:23,400 --> 03:09:27,400
You look like Elvis Presley. Ah, that's why "Elvis" was written on him.

5146
03:09:27,400 --> 03:09:28,970
Oh is that so?

5147
03:09:28,970 --> 03:09:30,970
I think so. You look really...

5148
03:09:31,270 --> 03:09:34,540
You look like Presley.

5149
03:09:33,140 --> 03:09:35,510
He doesn't look that much like
Presley though...

5150
03:09:36,610 --> 03:09:38,180
But the sideburns...

5151
03:09:39,280 --> 03:09:43,120
I've been hit so fucking hard and they're turning me into Elvis...

5152
03:09:43,120 --> 03:09:44,150
Tanaka!!

5153
03:09:44,150 --> 03:09:47,190
You... seriously...

5154
03:09:47,190 --> 03:09:51,190
The moment you realized the ONI is close, you just ran away and didn't warn me.

5155
03:09:50,990 --> 03:09:52,830
Oy~!!!

5156
03:09:52,460 --> 03:09:54,460
Housei-san is calling.

5157
03:09:54,460 --> 03:09:55,700
I could hear him there.

5158
03:09:54,460 --> 03:09:56,600
What happened to him after the incident?

5159
03:09:56,800 --> 03:09:57,430
Yes!

5160
03:09:57,430 --> 03:09:59,970
Wow, that's amazing.

5161
03:10:00,100 --> 03:10:02,040
He's still stuck?!

5162
03:10:01,470 --> 03:10:02,770
What's wrong?

5163
03:10:02,770 --> 03:10:05,540
I'm stuck.

5164
03:10:05,540 --> 03:10:08,880
What do you mean you're stuck?

5165
03:10:09,210 --> 03:10:38,340
Elvis

5166
03:10:11,480 --> 03:10:14,080
Alright, you just got caught by Elvis.

5167
03:10:17,750 --> 03:10:19,220
That hurts.

5168
03:10:19,220 --> 03:10:27,360
That seriously hurts! That hurts!

5169
03:10:32,100 --> 03:10:33,800
He drew more stuff.

5170
03:10:35,570 --> 03:10:38,340
Is that Elvis?

5171
03:10:38,540 --> 03:10:40,740
Junpei-kun, be careful. Otherwise you'll become like that...

5172
03:10:40,740 --> 03:10:44,010
Tanaka, remove this.

5173
03:10:44,210 --> 03:10:47,080
This is impossible for me, Housei-san.

5174
03:10:47,580 --> 03:10:51,050
There doesn't seem to be anything you can do other than just be quiet.

5175
03:10:51,320 --> 03:10:53,020
This is gonna lure them in.

5176
03:10:53,020 --> 03:10:54,890
Because of the noise...

5177
03:10:54,890 --> 03:10:56,560
Junpei, you guard from outside.

5178
03:10:56,560 --> 03:10:59,530
There are too many and not enough time. We can't save Matsumoto-san like this.

5179
03:10:59,660 --> 03:11:06,400
Housei gets abandoned once again

5180
03:11:11,470 --> 03:11:13,610
What is this?

5181
03:11:17,480 --> 03:11:22,180
Housei attempts to escape

5182
03:11:23,750 --> 03:11:26,190
Why is he sweating from this?

5183
03:11:29,760 --> 03:11:32,160
You managed to escape?

5184
03:11:32,160 --> 03:11:34,360
See, you can do it if you try.

5185
03:11:39,470 --> 03:11:42,170
Can you walk quick... Actually, can you stay away from us?

5186
03:11:42,170 --> 03:11:44,170
Yamachan, you're so noisy.

5187
03:11:44,170 --> 03:11:45,940
You're gonna expose us.

5188
03:11:45,940 --> 03:11:47,440
They will find us.

5189
03:11:47,440 --> 03:11:50,610
That senior is really noisy. Man.

5190
03:11:50,810 --> 03:11:54,750
Let's have 2 people look around the 3rd floor.

5191
03:11:54,950 --> 03:11:59,520
Divide into 2 groups to search for the treasure chest

5192
03:11:55,850 --> 03:11:58,990
We went to the 2nd floor before, so go to the 3rd floor.

5193
03:11:57,820 --> 03:11:59,620
Finally, we got an order from above.

5194
03:11:59,520 --> 03:12:01,520
Maybe we could finally find it.

5195
03:12:03,760 --> 03:12:04,890
Wha!

5196
03:12:05,190 --> 03:12:07,360
Call the other guys!

5197
03:12:06,060 --> 03:12:07,760
We found it!

5198
03:12:07,560 --> 03:12:10,600
Treasure chest discovered

5199
03:12:08,160 --> 03:12:10,600
We found it! The treasure chest!

5200
03:12:10,600 --> 03:12:12,300
No way!

5201
03:12:12,300 --> 03:12:14,470
He is so noisy.

5202
03:12:17,940 --> 03:12:21,710
Man, you're so noisy.

5203
03:12:24,880 --> 03:12:26,450
We found it!

5204
03:12:25,780 --> 03:12:27,380
Oh, they did.

5205
03:12:26,450 --> 03:12:28,080
We immediately found it.

5206
03:12:32,190 --> 03:12:35,120
It's good that we found it.

5207
03:12:34,120 --> 03:12:35,120
We're counting on you.

5208
03:12:35,120 --> 03:12:37,090
The map is in here, right?

5209
03:12:37,090 --> 03:12:38,190
Here I go.

5210
03:12:38,190 --> 03:12:39,330
Get the map.

5211
03:12:49,070 --> 03:12:54,640
Trick mechanism is too much for this 50-year-old's hips

5212
03:12:54,640 --> 03:12:57,580
Don't mind.

5213
03:12:58,650 --> 03:13:01,480
The 40 minute mark has just passed.

5214
03:13:01,550 --> 03:13:04,750
4 more ONI are now added

5215
03:13:04,750 --> 03:13:10,590
Victory

5216
03:13:08,890 --> 03:13:10,590
This is the worst!!

5217
03:13:10,590 --> 03:13:13,260
The number of ONI keeps increasing...

5218
03:13:14,960 --> 03:13:16,600
I'm so wet.

5219
03:13:16,600 --> 03:13:26,510
BICYCLE RIDE

5220
03:13:17,430 --> 03:13:20,800
The severity of the punishments also increase...

5221
03:13:20,770 --> 03:13:22,870
It's the next one Tanaka, the next one.

5222
03:13:26,710 --> 03:13:32,050
Victim of a 130kg giant

5223
03:13:27,140 --> 03:13:31,510
Even a 130kg giant appears.

5224
03:13:32,050 --> 03:13:35,450
It's Model M1!! Model M1!!

5225
03:13:32,050 --> 03:13:36,620
Pole Fishing

5226
03:13:35,450 --> 03:13:36,620
It hurts!

5227
03:13:36,620 --> 03:13:39,590
Chinko machine

5228
03:13:40,220 --> 03:13:44,860
They don't go easy even on newbies.

5229
03:13:42,590 --> 03:13:46,230
The handsome actor got his balls whacked

5230
03:13:46,760 --> 03:13:49,930
Matsumoto continues to wait alone

5231
03:13:47,560 --> 03:13:50,230
And of course this guy too...

5232
03:14:00,240 --> 03:14:02,810
What was the point in this?

5233
03:14:02,810 --> 03:14:05,750
It was really rough in there.

5234
03:14:05,280 --> 03:14:06,480
It hurts! It hurts!

5235
03:14:06,880 --> 03:14:10,020
This is tiring. I'm really worn out.

5236
03:14:11,150 --> 03:14:17,190
Furthermore,

5237
03:14:11,150 --> 03:14:17,190
ONI continues to multiply

5238
03:14:11,150 --> 03:14:17,190
a more powerful ONI

5239
03:14:11,150 --> 03:14:17,190
descends!!

5240
03:14:11,950 --> 03:14:15,560
And a more dreadful terror appears.

5241
03:14:19,860 --> 03:14:23,230
Egashira 2:50 appears

5242
03:14:23,530 --> 03:14:24,500
There he is!

5243
03:14:24,500 --> 03:14:25,970
This is bad.

5244
03:14:26,600 --> 03:14:29,570
This is really bad.

5245
03:14:44,540 --> 03:14:47,710
Egashira 2:50 appears

5246
03:14:49,010 --> 03:14:50,480
This is bad.

5247
03:14:50,990 --> 03:14:53,560
This is really bad.

5248
03:14:55,730 --> 03:14:57,800
Just wait a sec!

5249
03:14:59,800 --> 03:15:01,670
Tanaka!

5250
03:15:04,570 --> 03:15:08,810
Hamada-san! Hamada-san!

5251
03:15:08,310 --> 03:15:10,110
GOT YOU~~~~~!!

5252
03:15:10,210 --> 03:15:12,780
I CAUGHT YOU~~~~~!!

5253
03:15:13,080 --> 03:15:15,650
I can't do this...

5254
03:15:16,050 --> 03:15:17,920
Ega-chan, stop this.

5255
03:15:18,250 --> 03:15:19,720
Please stop this.

5256
03:15:20,120 --> 03:15:21,520
Stop!

5257
03:15:23,790 --> 03:15:25,560
Egashira-san, please stop this.

5258
03:15:25,560 --> 03:15:28,160
Tanaka, stop looking with those eyes.

5259
03:15:29,230 --> 03:15:32,000
He has a really serious look just now. That Ega-chan.

5260
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:34,400
Ega-chan, what are you planning?

5261
03:15:34,670 --> 03:15:36,270
What are you doing, Egashira-san?

5262
03:15:36,470 --> 03:15:38,140
Egashira-san, you're joking, right?

5263
03:15:38,540 --> 03:15:41,210
What is that syringe for?

5264
03:15:42,710 --> 03:15:45,280
How much are you gonna put in?

5265
03:15:45,180 --> 03:15:51,320
Egashira injects powder into himself

5266
03:15:45,880 --> 03:15:47,450
He used quite a lot.

5267
03:15:47,280 --> 03:15:49,950
Egashira-san, this is your fourth one.

5268
03:15:51,320 --> 03:15:53,820
And now it's 5.

5269
03:15:52,720 --> 03:15:53,920
For real?

5270
03:15:53,120 --> 03:15:55,190
Tape change

5271
03:15:55,190 --> 03:15:58,290
You're changing the tape right now?

5272
03:15:58,290 --> 03:16:01,060
Egashira-san, they're changing the tape now.

5273
03:16:01,060 --> 03:16:04,100
Please stay still.

5274
03:16:07,100 --> 03:16:10,740
An unexpected turn of event!
Egashira's tortured expression!

5275
03:16:10,770 --> 03:16:12,840
Poor guy!

5276
03:16:12,840 --> 03:16:14,540
He's gonna continue.

5277
03:16:14,540 --> 03:16:18,010
His 6th one, how many is he going for?

5278
03:16:19,980 --> 03:16:21,380
Egashira-san...

5279
03:16:21,380 --> 03:16:23,250
I think there's quite a lot already.

5280
03:16:23,250 --> 03:16:26,720
This is his 8th one.

5281
03:16:27,220 --> 03:16:28,690
Egashira-san...

5282
03:16:31,060 --> 03:16:32,760
Egashira-san...

5283
03:16:32,760 --> 03:16:36,430
You don't have to force yourself. Are you alright?

5284
03:16:36,430 --> 03:16:39,000
This is frightening.

5285
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:40,970
It really is frightening.

5286
03:16:42,370 --> 03:16:45,040
I sense something dangerous is gonna happen.

5287
03:17:00,690 --> 03:17:04,490
For this Earth Defense Force

5288
03:17:04,490 --> 03:17:07,160
I'm gonna cause a revolution!!

5289
03:17:11,300 --> 03:17:12,900
HERE I GO!!!

5290
03:17:25,080 --> 03:17:28,850
Ah! It's time for my part-time job!!

5291
03:17:33,720 --> 03:17:35,190
Are you alright, Tanaka?

5292
03:17:35,190 --> 03:17:40,460
You must have really hated getting that much on your face.

5293
03:17:39,560 --> 03:17:43,730
Why are you looking at Hamada-san like that?

5294
03:17:43,530 --> 03:17:45,900
He's your senior.

5295
03:17:52,940 --> 03:17:54,310
What is he doing?

5296
03:17:55,410 --> 03:17:57,410
I would never do such a thing...

5297
03:17:57,410 --> 03:18:02,850
You caught me and tried to sacrifice me to him.

5298
03:18:02,850 --> 03:18:07,320
And then when I turned around, all I saw was... "UWEI UWEI!!"

5299
03:18:07,320 --> 03:18:09,290
What is that "UWEI UWEI"?

5300
03:18:10,190 --> 03:18:13,360
The 1 hour mark has just passed.

5301
03:18:13,260 --> 03:18:16,530
3 more ONI are discharged

5302
03:18:17,330 --> 03:18:21,070
Matsumoto continues to wait for more than an hour

5303
03:18:18,430 --> 03:18:20,600
This was seriously...

5304
03:18:20,600 --> 03:18:22,570
Must be tiring to wait

5305
03:18:28,340 --> 03:18:31,980
Enough already.

5306
03:18:33,680 --> 03:18:35,080
Man...

5307
03:18:35,950 --> 03:18:40,520
I'm tired. I'm seriously tired.

5308
03:18:40,520 --> 03:18:42,790
What the hell is this?

5309
03:18:43,490 --> 03:18:45,090
It was really...

5310
03:18:45,260 --> 03:18:46,960
It was seriously...

5311
03:18:46,960 --> 03:18:49,830
Just do it already.

5312
03:18:55,570 --> 03:18:58,740
No more! No more!

5313
03:19:05,880 --> 03:19:11,050
Searching everywhere in the facility

5314
03:19:05,980 --> 03:19:08,150
Have we looked here yet?

5315
03:19:08,150 --> 03:19:10,150
We didn't search here yet.

5316
03:19:10,150 --> 03:19:11,150
Should we go?

5317
03:19:11,050 --> 03:19:12,120
Try looking up there.

5318
03:19:13,920 --> 03:19:14,920
Ah!

5319
03:19:15,290 --> 03:19:17,860
There's something!!

5320
03:19:17,190 --> 03:19:18,490
No way!

5321
03:19:17,860 --> 03:19:19,160
There's something up here!!

5322
03:19:19,360 --> 03:19:23,530
Treasure chest discovered

5323
03:19:19,460 --> 03:19:21,330
Ah, it's true!

5324
03:19:21,330 --> 03:19:22,930
Let's open it.

5325
03:19:23,530 --> 03:19:24,930
The opener should be...

5326
03:19:24,930 --> 03:19:28,670
Junpei-kun. Officer Junpei.

5327
03:19:34,740 --> 03:19:37,010
There's such thing as this?

5328
03:19:37,010 --> 03:19:40,480
We really thought the map would be in there.

5329
03:19:40,480 --> 03:19:43,150
This is kinda amazing... There's absolutely nothing.

5330
03:19:44,450 --> 03:19:45,520
Something is coming!!

5331
03:19:46,420 --> 03:19:48,990
That's scary~

5332
03:19:50,090 --> 03:21:02,930
Drive

5333
03:19:51,590 --> 03:19:53,060
You found me.

5334
03:19:53,830 --> 03:19:56,230
What's "drive"?

5335
03:19:54,330 --> 03:19:56,730
What the hell is "Drive"?

5336
03:19:56,630 --> 03:19:59,200
He has been caught!!

5337
03:19:57,230 --> 03:19:59,400
He got caught!!

5338
03:19:59,200 --> 03:20:02,070
I got caught, I couldn't hide from him...

5339
03:20:02,070 --> 03:20:04,040
It said "Drive"...

5340
03:20:02,770 --> 03:20:09,410
Mizobata is getting taken "somewhere"

5341
03:20:04,270 --> 03:20:08,310
Being captured by a "drive" ONI, the place Mizobatawas taken to was...

5342
03:20:08,310 --> 03:20:09,710
Being captured by a "drive" ONI, the place Mizobata was taken to was...

5343
03:20:10,280 --> 03:20:12,580
Is that person with the umbrella

5344
03:20:10,280 --> 03:20:12,580
a race queen?

5345
03:20:13,380 --> 03:20:16,550
going to be put in a car?

5346
03:20:13,380 --> 03:20:16,550
Hold on, is he

5347
03:20:18,620 --> 03:20:20,120
Wow!

5348
03:20:22,690 --> 03:20:25,260
A black Race Queen...

5349
03:20:25,260 --> 03:20:27,760
Even in their world

5350
03:20:25,960 --> 03:20:27,760
there's a race queen, huh?

5351
03:20:27,860 --> 03:20:29,930
Wow, this is really amazing...

5352
03:20:29,930 --> 03:20:31,130
Stop this...

5353
03:20:31,130 --> 03:20:33,100
Wait, what is this?

5354
03:20:31,900 --> 03:20:34,200
What's going on?

5355
03:20:34,600 --> 03:20:35,770
You got to be kidding me...

5356
03:20:36,570 --> 03:20:37,770
Something's coming

5357
03:20:43,810 --> 03:20:45,480
It's totally black...

5358
03:20:44,780 --> 03:20:47,480
It's a really cool car

5359
03:20:46,080 --> 03:20:48,080
So cool!

5360
03:20:48,650 --> 03:20:50,050
You're kidding me...

5361
03:20:51,920 --> 03:20:54,020
He's going to get put into that?

5362
03:20:53,120 --> 03:20:55,990
What? This is really scary, man...

5363
03:20:55,990 --> 03:21:02,830
3 times winner of the Super GT

5364
03:20:55,990 --> 03:21:02,830
One of the best in Japanese Motor Sports

5365
03:20:55,990 --> 03:21:02,830
The Driver

5366
03:20:55,990 --> 03:21:02,830
Wakisaka Juiichi

5367
03:21:01,060 --> 03:21:03,030
Junpei! Get ready!

5368
03:21:04,900 --> 03:21:06,900
I would definitely hate this

5369
03:21:08,970 --> 03:21:10,670
Shit, this is fast!!

5370
03:21:24,120 --> 03:21:27,520
Ow oww oww

5371
03:21:27,990 --> 03:21:29,490
Are they coming?

5372
03:21:33,460 --> 03:21:35,430
Holy shit, here they come!

5373
03:21:45,940 --> 03:21:46,240
Shit ShitShit

5374
03:21:46,240 --> 03:21:46,540
Shit shitshitshit

5375
03:21:46,540 --> 03:21:46,940
Shit shit shit shit

5376
03:21:46,940 --> 03:21:48,810
Shit shit shit shit

5377
03:21:49,310 --> 03:21:51,410
This is so messed up...

5378
03:21:50,680 --> 03:21:52,680
It's that fast, huh?

5379
03:21:51,880 --> 03:21:53,950
Hold on, they're coming back.

5380
03:21:53,280 --> 03:21:53,980
You're kidding me...

5381
03:21:53,980 --> 03:21:55,950
They're coming this way.

5382
03:21:55,950 --> 03:21:58,020
This is...

5383
03:22:00,220 --> 03:22:02,190
Are you okay?

5384
03:22:00,420 --> 03:22:02,090
Junpei!

5385
03:22:02,090 --> 03:22:04,160
Junpei!?

5386
03:22:02,790 --> 03:22:05,060
I feel so sick...

5387
03:22:05,060 --> 03:22:07,060
I might throw up...

5388
03:22:06,460 --> 03:22:09,130
Who's driving this thing?

5389
03:22:13,100 --> 03:22:14,870
Jesus, it's Wakisaka Juiichi..

5390
03:22:13,900 --> 03:22:15,370
Why did you hit him?

5391
03:22:15,370 --> 03:22:17,370
He is amazing...

5392
03:22:16,570 --> 03:22:18,940
I wonder how much this car costs roughly...

5393
03:22:18,940 --> 03:22:21,610
40,000,000 yen ($383,480; £233,520; €283,400)

5394
03:22:21,610 --> 03:22:23,610
40,000,000 yen...

5395
03:22:23,610 --> 03:22:25,380
You got to ride something amazing...

5396
03:22:25,380 --> 03:22:27,780
You're so lucky...

5397
03:22:27,780 --> 03:22:29,750
And you got driven by a big time racer...

5398
03:22:30,750 --> 03:22:33,520
Another ONI appears!

5399
03:22:35,490 --> 03:22:37,960
Umm, excuse me, what?

5400
03:22:42,930 --> 03:22:46,400
You're kidding me, no come on, are you serious?!

5401
03:22:43,230 --> 03:23:06,420
Driver

5402
03:22:46,800 --> 03:22:47,600
You're kidding me!

5403
03:22:47,600 --> 03:22:50,370
No seriously...

5404
03:22:50,570 --> 03:22:53,040
I don't want to!! I really don't want to!!

5405
03:22:54,910 --> 03:22:57,180
Are you serious?!

5406
03:22:57,180 --> 03:22:58,580
I really don't want to do this...

5407
03:22:58,580 --> 03:23:00,750
Please go find that treasure chest.

5408
03:23:00,750 --> 03:23:03,820
I'm obviously not going to!!

5409
03:23:02,050 --> 03:23:03,820
You never know, search for us.

5410
03:23:04,420 --> 03:23:06,620
Seriously, pay attention

5411
03:23:06,620 --> 03:23:08,590
Okay, have fun!!

5412
03:23:10,590 --> 03:23:12,560
Did you do a "key lock"?

5413
03:23:12,560 --> 03:23:14,560
Do you not want to shut the window?!

5414
03:23:13,760 --> 03:23:15,530
You mean "door lock"...

5415
03:23:17,630 --> 03:23:20,000
Does it really go that fast?

5416
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:21,670
No no, it goes way~~~ faster.

5417
03:23:21,670 --> 03:23:24,740
Can cars accelerate that fast?

5418
03:23:30,710 --> 03:23:35,050
In one moment, Housei's face looks like a ghost...

5419
03:23:33,480 --> 03:23:35,350
I guess it just happens naturally...

5420
03:23:35,350 --> 03:23:37,350
Yeah, you really do...

5421
03:23:37,350 --> 03:23:39,320
Oh, here they come!

5422
03:23:41,890 --> 03:23:43,490
They're coming this way!

5423
03:23:43,490 --> 03:23:45,460
Watch out...

5424
03:23:55,170 --> 03:23:58,240
This is amazing...

5425
03:23:57,070 --> 03:23:57,670
Please stop!!

5426
03:23:57,670 --> 03:23:58,740
Please stop!!

5427
03:23:58,740 --> 03:23:59,940
Drive normally

5428
03:23:59,940 --> 03:24:02,210
Please drive normally

5429
03:24:00,840 --> 03:24:05,280
Iiiiiiiiihihihihihihihihihihi

5430
03:24:05,480 --> 03:24:07,950
Ahhhh No no no !

5431
03:24:08,850 --> 03:24:09,050
ZUUUUU

5432
03:24:09,050 --> 03:24:11,350
ZUUUU

5433
03:24:12,620 --> 03:24:14,320
Here they come

5434
03:24:13,020 --> 03:24:14,390
They're coming...

5435
03:24:14,390 --> 03:24:15,490
Here they come!

5436
03:24:28,370 --> 03:24:30,770
No no no no no no no no no no

5437
03:24:30,770 --> 03:24:31,370
This is not good!!

5438
03:24:31,370 --> 03:24:32,440
There's smoke everywhere!!

5439
03:24:32,440 --> 03:24:34,340
There's smoke everywhere!

5440
03:24:39,980 --> 03:24:42,050
Please stop!! Please stop already!!

5441
03:24:43,250 --> 03:24:44,750
This guy's amazing...

5442
03:24:45,120 --> 03:24:46,720
Amazing!!!

5443
03:24:47,120 --> 03:24:48,690
Is this really happening?

5444
03:24:48,690 --> 03:24:50,760
You got to be kidding me...

5445
03:24:55,330 --> 03:24:57,030
Are you alright?

5446
03:24:59,700 --> 03:25:01,100
It was amazing, huh?

5447
03:25:01,500 --> 03:25:03,570
Isn't your body just really tired?

5448
03:25:04,740 --> 03:25:07,140
Like you have to hold your body, especially at the turns...

5449
03:25:07,540 --> 03:25:09,110
Otherwise, it's really like...

5450
03:25:08,010 --> 03:25:09,710
Yeah, your neck just kind of drags away...

5451
03:25:10,210 --> 03:25:12,680
He didn't drive normally at all...

5452
03:25:12,680 --> 03:25:14,580
What a shitty driver...

5453
03:25:19,920 --> 03:25:23,490
The training now leads them to the building

5454
03:25:20,220 --> 03:25:21,590
As the sun starts to set, they head to the building

5455
03:25:21,590 --> 03:25:23,590
As the sun starts to set, they head to the building

5456
03:25:23,490 --> 03:25:25,460
Shall we look over there somewhere?

5457
03:25:26,660 --> 03:25:28,030
That was amazing...

5458
03:25:27,430 --> 03:25:30,230
Hang on, there it is!!

5459
03:25:31,130 --> 03:25:32,900
The colour is also a bit different from before

5460
03:25:32,200 --> 03:25:33,500
You're right

5461
03:25:33,200 --> 03:25:35,770
They discover a treasure box

5462
03:25:33,400 --> 03:25:35,070
This has got to be the real one

5463
03:25:35,070 --> 03:25:37,070
There can't be any more...

5464
03:25:35,870 --> 03:25:37,070
Jeez...

5465
03:25:38,270 --> 03:25:39,440
I'm opening it then...

5466
03:25:40,240 --> 03:25:41,710
Look, we found it!

5467
03:25:42,110 --> 03:25:43,710
There it is, there it is, the map!

5468
03:25:43,910 --> 03:25:46,080
They found the map

5469
03:25:46,080 --> 03:25:47,680
It's the top floor...

5470
03:25:46,880 --> 03:25:48,850
The 3rd floor, the 3rd floor

5471
03:25:47,880 --> 03:25:48,850
Let's go!

5472
03:25:48,850 --> 03:25:49,850
The top floor.

5473
03:25:49,750 --> 03:25:51,320
I'll take the map

5474
03:25:51,520 --> 03:25:56,990
The map shows Matsumoto's location

5475
03:25:52,020 --> 03:25:54,120
Matsumoto is on the 3rd floor.

5476
03:25:54,420 --> 03:25:56,990
The 5 look at the map and rush to his rescue

5477
03:25:57,190 --> 03:26:05,200
The five arrive at the 3rd floor

5478
03:25:57,960 --> 03:25:59,760
So he was on the top floor...

5479
03:25:59,760 --> 03:26:01,830
Like near the end on the top floor.

5480
03:26:02,330 --> 03:26:04,000
Yeah, looks like it...

5481
03:26:04,300 --> 03:26:06,400
I'm so tired...

5482
03:26:07,170 --> 03:26:08,770
We did well...

5483
03:26:08,770 --> 03:26:10,470
What?! Bazooka!!

5484
03:26:10,740 --> 03:26:33,460
Bazooka

5485
03:26:11,440 --> 03:26:13,640
Why is he here?

5486
03:26:15,110 --> 03:26:17,410
What the hell is "bazooka"?

5487
03:26:17,710 --> 03:26:19,380
Hold on, what is "Bazooka"?

5488
03:26:19,380 --> 03:26:21,380
Wait, what is "Bazooka"?

5489
03:26:20,180 --> 03:26:22,450
Here comes "bazooka"..

5490
03:26:21,450 --> 03:26:22,650
Wait, what what what?!

5491
03:26:22,650 --> 03:26:23,750
What is this?

5492
03:26:23,750 --> 03:26:25,320
It's coming Junpei-kun...

5493
03:26:25,320 --> 03:26:27,320
This is so scary...

5494
03:26:34,660 --> 03:26:37,200
I bet he will never come on this show again...

5495
03:26:35,630 --> 03:26:37,530
That would be horrible

5496
03:26:36,630 --> 03:26:41,770
The pretty boy gets dirtier and dirtier...

5497
03:26:40,200 --> 03:26:42,070
Junpei...

5498
03:26:41,970 --> 03:26:44,270
Even after everything from before...

5499
03:26:44,270 --> 03:26:46,240
I'm regretting coming on this program a bit...

5500
03:26:47,910 --> 03:26:48,810
Jeez...

5501
03:26:48,810 --> 03:26:50,010
To be honest,you're getting the full course.

5502
03:26:50,010 --> 03:26:52,280
To be honest, you're getting the full course.

5503
03:26:53,480 --> 03:26:54,850
You're enjoying this.

5504
03:26:55,150 --> 03:26:56,450
You're standing out the most...

5505
03:26:56,750 --> 03:26:59,520
They head to the room Matsumoto is in

5506
03:26:57,220 --> 03:27:00,220
Finally they get to the room Matsumoto is held hostage

5507
03:27:02,290 --> 03:27:02,690
I'm opening it...

5508
03:27:02,690 --> 03:27:03,590
And...

5509
03:27:03,590 --> 03:27:05,660
The time to rescue him has arrived

5510
03:27:05,760 --> 03:27:07,560
Oh Matsumoto-san!

5511
03:27:06,960 --> 03:27:07,860
Oh, he's here, he's here.

5512
03:27:07,860 --> 03:27:08,830
Thank God, thank God.

5513
03:27:09,330 --> 03:27:10,030
Man, I'm tired.

5514
03:27:10,030 --> 03:27:12,500
What kind of face is that?

5515
03:27:12,500 --> 03:27:14,500
You took bloody ages...

5516
03:27:14,500 --> 03:27:17,840
That was so fucking long...

5517
03:27:15,570 --> 03:27:17,070
I sat here for so long...

5518
03:27:16,570 --> 03:27:18,340
It was, it was, we're really sorry...

5519
03:27:18,340 --> 03:27:20,840
He's locked by a key...

5520
03:27:19,240 --> 03:27:20,410
Yeah, I got locked by a key...

5521
03:27:20,840 --> 03:27:22,810
Wait, so what do we do about the key?

5522
03:27:22,410 --> 03:27:22,910
Um...

5523
03:27:22,810 --> 03:27:25,080
You don't have the key?

5524
03:27:23,810 --> 03:27:24,680
No we don't...

5525
03:27:24,010 --> 03:27:25,080
No, we haven't got a key...

5526
03:27:25,580 --> 03:27:26,680
No, we seriously don't have a key...

5527
03:27:27,780 --> 03:27:29,650
Wow wow wow, what's going on?

5528
03:27:33,520 --> 03:27:34,220
Holy shit!!

5529
03:27:36,190 --> 03:27:37,560
No no no, seriously...

5530
03:27:36,690 --> 03:27:40,860
Everyone gets tickle attacked!!

5531
03:27:39,960 --> 03:27:40,860
What what?!

5532
03:27:44,030 --> 03:27:44,630
Stop!

5533
03:27:49,070 --> 03:27:50,770
Get off me...

5534
03:27:50,270 --> 03:27:51,540
They were so persistent...

5535
03:27:51,540 --> 03:27:53,440
They were so persistent...

5536
03:27:53,440 --> 03:27:54,440
This was so tough

5537
03:27:55,510 --> 03:28:01,550
Training finished

5538
03:27:58,280 --> 03:28:00,180
That hurts...

5539
03:28:04,250 --> 03:28:06,120
What the fuck are you doing!?

5540
03:28:06,320 --> 03:28:11,290
Even Fujiwara is tickling Matsumoto

5541
03:28:11,160 --> 03:28:12,460
What the hell are you doing?

5542
03:28:12,960 --> 03:28:14,460
What does he think he's doing?

5543
03:28:14,160 --> 03:28:15,830
He's treating you like a kid

5544
03:28:15,930 --> 03:28:18,800
What the fuck, you had the key?!

5545
03:28:19,000 --> 03:28:24,940
They rescued Matsumoto

5546
03:28:19,000 --> 03:28:24,940
The training of horror finished!!

5547
03:28:19,000 --> 03:28:24,940
They rescued Matsumoto

5548
03:28:19,600 --> 03:28:21,870
Finally they rescued Matsumoto,

5549
03:28:21,870 --> 03:28:23,740
the training horror finishes...

5550
03:28:24,140 --> 03:28:25,040
However...

5551
03:28:25,140 --> 03:28:29,910
Once again the temptation of laughter is back!!

5552
03:28:25,640 --> 03:28:27,540
Once again, the temptation of laughter is back

5553
03:28:27,540 --> 03:28:29,910
and will attack the 5 guys

5554
03:28:31,110 --> 03:28:32,380
Man that was long...

5555
03:28:32,380 --> 03:28:36,250
From the point where we got into that room

5556
03:28:32,980 --> 03:28:36,250
and opened those drawers...

5557
03:28:34,680 --> 03:28:35,950
You're right...

5558
03:28:36,250 --> 03:28:40,420
I love Gaki no Tsukai so much and

5559
03:28:37,850 --> 03:28:40,420
I want to be on it

5560
03:28:40,420 --> 03:28:41,790
After it finished, he said to me

5561
03:28:40,420 --> 03:28:50,230
Mizobata Junpei

5562
03:28:41,790 --> 03:28:48,230
I'm never coming on again!!

5563
03:28:44,660 --> 03:28:45,660
Honestly, he said that.

5564
03:28:45,660 --> 03:28:47,260
Never again...

5565
03:28:45,760 --> 03:28:46,660
I thought so...

5566
03:28:46,660 --> 03:28:47,860
He did...

5567
03:28:47,860 --> 03:28:49,230
He did say that, I don't blame him

5568
03:28:49,230 --> 03:28:50,530
He got the full course...

5569
03:28:50,530 --> 03:28:52,500
But seriously, Hamada-san's...

5570
03:28:52,500 --> 03:28:53,200
M1...

5571
03:28:52,900 --> 03:28:53,870
Oh yes, of course

5572
03:28:53,200 --> 03:29:15,190
M1

5573
03:28:54,970 --> 03:28:57,970
M1 came out and just...

5574
03:28:55,670 --> 03:28:58,440
Seriously, he doesn't...

5575
03:28:58,440 --> 03:29:01,410
What is with that?

5576
03:28:59,540 --> 03:29:00,040
Seriously...

5577
03:29:01,410 --> 03:29:05,780
Are you and

5578
03:29:02,510 --> 03:29:05,780
(Editor note: Tsuburaya is a special effects studio)

5579
03:29:02,510 --> 03:29:05,780
Tsuburaya in some sort of agreement?

5580
03:29:04,710 --> 03:29:05,580
Yeah...

5581
03:29:05,580 --> 03:29:07,480
There is a connection for sure...

5582
03:29:07,580 --> 03:29:09,350
Like a collaboration...

5583
03:29:08,180 --> 03:29:09,250
Why the hell!!

5584
03:29:10,150 --> 03:29:14,120
You need to speak to the head office if you want

5585
03:29:11,520 --> 03:29:14,120
to do that kind of thing!

5586
03:29:12,220 --> 03:29:13,420
Shut the hell up!

5587
03:29:13,420 --> 03:29:14,520
He's right though...

5588
03:29:14,020 --> 03:29:15,190
I haven't agreed with anyone...

5589
03:29:15,190 --> 03:29:17,390
For me it's got to be...

5590
03:29:16,490 --> 03:29:18,360
The salty rice cakes... that was amazing

5591
03:29:18,260 --> 03:29:19,860
Yeah, the bloody salty rice cakes

5592
03:29:18,360 --> 03:29:22,830
Ebisu Yoshikaze

5593
03:29:19,760 --> 03:29:20,760
That's right!

5594
03:29:20,530 --> 03:29:23,030
That was so sick, wasn't it Endo?

5595
03:29:23,030 --> 03:29:23,930
It's disgusting...

5596
03:29:23,930 --> 03:29:26,300
Like seriously, from the beginning...

5597
03:29:26,700 --> 03:29:28,670
I felt sicker and...

5598
03:29:28,670 --> 03:29:29,470
I felt sicker and...

5599
03:29:31,940 --> 03:29:34,240
When I think back to it now, I feel sick...

5600
03:29:34,540 --> 03:29:36,510
Matsumoto-san the last imitation please

5601
03:29:39,780 --> 03:29:43,450
No one laughs at all...

5602
03:29:45,320 --> 03:29:46,620
7:00PM...

5603
03:29:46,220 --> 03:29:49,790
Earth Defense Force       11 hours from the start

5604
03:29:47,020 --> 03:29:49,390
During your long Earth Defense Force missions...

5605
03:29:49,390 --> 03:29:51,390
troublesome things can happen...

5606
03:29:51,590 --> 03:29:52,990
Everyone there's trouble.

5607
03:29:52,800 --> 03:29:53,940
Everyone, there's trouble.

5608
03:29:54,230 --> 03:29:55,170
2 of Earth Defense Force's maritime divisions are arguing over operation area

5609
03:29:55,170 --> 03:29:57,510
2 of Earth Defense Force's maritime divisions are arguing over operation area

5610
03:29:57,510 --> 03:29:59,940
2 of Earth Defense Force's maritime divisions are arguing over operation area

5611
03:29:59,350 --> 03:30:00,830
Not again...

5612
03:29:59,940 --> 03:30:01,080
Seems like they are having a dispute at a nearby base

5613
03:30:01,080 --> 03:30:04,150
Seems like they are having a dispute at a nearby base

5614
03:30:01,930 --> 03:30:03,830
You got to be kidding me...

5615
03:30:04,470 --> 03:30:07,470
Will you guys go and sort it out?

5616
03:30:04,520 --> 03:30:06,520
Every year, they just fight...

5617
03:30:06,070 --> 03:30:07,550
Really, then I got to like...

5618
03:30:08,390 --> 03:30:15,190
The 5 go to improve the situation!

5619
03:30:08,390 --> 03:30:15,190
Heading to the Marine Members

5620
03:30:09,290 --> 03:30:12,390
A fight has broken out between the two divisions

5621
03:30:12,750 --> 03:30:15,190
The 5 are just going to improve the situation

5622
03:30:15,630 --> 03:30:21,500
Earth Defense Force

5623
03:30:15,630 --> 03:30:21,500
Marine Division

5624
03:30:15,630 --> 03:30:21,500
What is it that awaits the five!?

5625
03:30:16,560 --> 03:30:18,710
But what is it that

5626
03:30:19,070 --> 03:30:20,710
awaits them?

5627
03:30:21,870 --> 03:30:28,770
Marine HQ Entrance

5628
03:30:22,970 --> 03:30:24,650
This is the place.

5629
03:30:24,650 --> 03:30:26,650
Wow this place is huge

5630
03:30:27,990 --> 03:30:29,110
Oh look, they're arguing

5631
03:30:34,030 --> 03:30:39,470
A very dangerous mood

5632
03:30:39,470 --> 03:30:41,470
Excuse us

5633
03:30:41,670 --> 03:30:42,840
Excuse us, is there no way we can just talk and sort this all out?

5634
03:30:42,840 --> 03:30:44,310
Excuse us, is there a way we can just talk and sort this all out?

5635
03:30:44,310 --> 03:30:46,650
Excuse us, is there a way we can just talk and sort this all out?

5636
03:30:47,780 --> 03:30:49,580
What are you going on about, asshole?!

5637
03:30:49,580 --> 03:30:50,580
Get the hell out of the way and just watch and listen!!

5638
03:30:50,580 --> 03:30:52,950
Get the hell out of the way and just watch and listen!!

5639
03:30:56,020 --> 03:30:58,220
Shall we just sit until it concludes?

5640
03:30:59,960 --> 03:31:02,500
After the meeting I will return

5641
03:31:01,460 --> 03:31:03,100
Don't get in the way, assholes

5642
03:31:03,100 --> 03:31:04,630
Bunch of dumbasses

5643
03:31:05,300 --> 03:31:07,400
Don't joke around, you bastard!

5644
03:31:08,600 --> 03:31:10,700
If you truly are that serious let's put our bodies on the line in a match

5645
03:31:10,700 --> 03:31:13,570
If you truly are that serious, let's put our bodies on the line in a match

5646
03:31:13,570 --> 03:31:16,910
Let's do it!!

Breakdown of Negotiations! Conclusion will result in a battle of bodies!!

5648
03:31:23,320 --> 03:31:24,180
In the end, the clothing has no relationship, huh?

5649
03:31:24,180 --> 03:31:25,890
In the end, the clothing has no relationship, huh?

5650
03:31:26,390 --> 03:31:31,890
Changing into combat uniform

5651
03:31:33,590 --> 03:31:35,800

Wait isn't that too close?

5663
03:31:57,180 --> 03:31:58,750
It is close

5664
03:31:57,950 --> 03:31:58,750
close

5665
03:31:58,550 --> 03:31:58,750

5666
03:31:59,190 --> 03:32:00,490
We train our groins more than any  other part of our bodies.

03:32:00,490 --> 03:32:01,990
We train our groins more than any other part of our bodies

5668
03:32:01,990 --> 03:32:04,620
We train our groins more than any other part of our bodies

5669

Are you sure you can do it, you fool?

5676
03:32:16,200 --> 03:32:18,200
Show them what it means to be truly strong willed.

5677
03:32:19,040 --> 03:32:20,170
What is this?

5678
03:32:20,670 --> 03:32:22,680
A rocket will be fired

5679
03:32:20,840 --> 03:32:26,510
Firework rocket will be stopped via crotch

5680
03:32:20,840 --> 03:32:26,510

03:32:32,820 --> 03:32:33,520
Alright

5684
03:32:48,970 --> 03:32:50,970
Wow he's being tough.

5685
03:32:54,470 --> 03:33:00,680
*Out of concern and safety, reformed fireworks are used. Please do not imitate.

5686
03:33:01,310 --> 03:33:03,420
The practice of my village since birth

5687
03:33:03,420 --> 03:33:07,420
Kendo Kobayashi

Urashima Division Staff Officer

5689
03:33:03,580 --> 03:33:04,150
Since birth, the people of my village don't feel any heat in our groin area.

5690
03:33:04,150 --> 03:33:04,620
Since birth, the people of my village  don't feel any heat in our groin area.

5691
03:33:04,620 --> 03:33:07,250
Since birth, the people of my village don't feel any heat in our groin area.

5692
03:33:07,620 --> 03:33:10,120
What the hell is he saying?

5693
03:33:08,590 --> 03:33:10,620
Carry it out

5694
03:33:14,660 --> 03:33:23,100
3 times the fireworks will be stopped by the nether regions

5695
03:33:14,660 --> 03:33:23,100
Urashima Division's Spirit

5696
03:33:16,460 --> 03:33:17,930
There are 3 of them

5697
03:33:17,930 --> 03:33:20,870
So since birth his crotch isn't affected by heat...

5698
03:33:20,970 --> 03:33:23,240
That is quite amazing

5699
03:33:23,240 --> 03:33:25,740
Come on!!

5700
03:33:27,670 --> 03:33:28,640
Is this for real?

5701
03:33:29,380 --> 03:33:31,380
I'm calm and relaxed

5702
03:33:31,980 --> 03:33:32,950
Come on then!!!

5703
03:33:42,050 --> 03:33:47,260
Was so scared he pussied out

5704
03:33:43,120 --> 03:33:45,120
You felt something in your crotch...

5705
03:33:45,190 --> 03:33:47,260
What the hell man?

5706
03:33:48,960 --> 03:33:50,960
He obviously felt the heat

5707
03:33:49,700 --> 03:33:51,700
One shot and he was gone

5708
03:33:52,130 --> 03:33:55,600
He was born in a village where no one feels heat between their legs

5709
03:33:58,900 --> 03:34:01,940
You ran away didn't ya?!

5710
03:34:01,940 --> 03:34:03,380
Well in my division...

5711
03:34:03,380 --> 03:34:04,310
It doesn't matter whether it's his groin or anywhere else.

5712
03:34:04,310 --> 03:34:06,380
It doesn't matter whether it's his groin or anywhere else.

5713
03:34:06,650 --> 03:34:09,680
Bring it out!!

5714
03:34:10,350 --> 03:34:16,320
Degawa Division's Spirit

5715
03:34:10,350 --> 03:34:16,320
Firework will fly diagonally then will be stopped by his nether region

5716
03:34:11,920 --> 03:34:15,090
He will show that he can do anything

5717
03:34:16,320 --> 03:34:17,820

5727
03:34:33,310 --> 03:34:35,310

It was nothing at all!!

5734
03:34:57,260 --> 03:35:02,770
*Out of concern and safety, reformed fireworks are used. Please do not imitate.

5735
03:34:59,770 --> 03:35:01,370
It really was nothing!

5736
03:35:02,640 --> 03:35:04,640
It's not hot, it's not hot.

5737
03:35:04,640 --> 03:35:08,140
Im not scared!!

5738
03:35:09,380 --> 03:35:11,440
Next we will show you something even more amazing

5739
03:35:11,440 --> 03:35:13,510
Our Kuro-chan will now

5740
03:35:13,410 --> 03:35:15,810
He's trained his nipples

Degawa Division Staff Officer

5742
03:35:13,410 --> 03:35:17,950
Kuro-chan

5743
03:35:16,480 --> 03:35:18,780
So we can put a clip on his nipple, get a bat,

5744
03:35:19,620 --> 03:35:21,950
hit it off really hard and he won't feel a thing.

5745
03:35:22,920 --> 03:35:28,890
Degawa Division's spirit

5746
03:35:22,920 --> 03:35:28,890
Swing a baseball bat at a washing clip attached to his nipple

5747
03:35:29,330 --> 03:35:30,000
This guy is like half beast already

5748
03:35:30,000 --> 03:35:33,470
This guy is like half beast already

5749
03:35:30,860 --> 03:35:31,460
Wrong section to hit

5750
03:35:31,460 --> 03:35:33,470
Wrong section to hit

5751
03:35:39,440 --> 03:35:42,140
Is it going to be that sort of feeling?

5752
03:35:44,240 --> 03:35:45,240
It definitely won't hurt

5753
03:35:45,640 --> 03:35:47,250
Definitely won't say anything

5754
03:35:47,850 --> 03:35:49,280

5755
03:35:50,180 --> 03:35:51,420
It huuuuurts!!

5756
03:35:51,850 --> 03:35:54,450
He said it hurts!!

5757
03:36:06,370 --> 03:36:06,870
Why would he have a reason to say it hurts?

5758
03:36:06,870 --> 03:36:09,100
Why would he have a reason to say it hurts?

5759
03:36:09,100 --> 03:36:11,070
Didn't you just say it hurts?

5760
03:36:11,100 --> 03:36:12,940
Home Run

5761
03:36:14,110 --> 03:36:15,710
Whats up with your hand?

5762
03:36:18,980 --> 03:36:20,450
What's wrong?

5763
03:36:20,450 --> 03:36:21,080
Isn't it a breach of regulations to be getting a tattoo?

5764
03:36:21,080 --> 03:36:24,280
Isn't it a breach of regulations to be getting a tattoo?

5765
03:36:22,480 --> 03:36:23,350
No, I don't even had one.

5766
03:36:24,280 --> 03:36:25,280
Bring it on!

5767
03:36:24,580 --> 03:36:29,760
Starting again - Challenge retry

5768
03:36:26,090 --> 03:36:27,120
Make it fly

5769
03:36:27,390 --> 03:36:29,520
Oh really? He has one?

5770
03:36:34,490 --> 03:36:36,430
Ow!!

5771
03:36:41,530 --> 03:36:42,870
It hurt, didn't it?

5772
03:36:43,400 --> 03:36:45,840
You said "Ow" just now

5773
03:36:51,210 --> 03:36:53,450
I swear you just said "Ow"

5774
03:36:55,010 --> 03:36:56,780
There is a cold sweat coming from your head

5775
03:36:56,880 --> 03:36:57,420
Water vapor!!

5776
03:36:57,420 --> 03:36:58,350
Water vapor!!

5777
03:36:58,350 --> 03:36:59,750
Water vapor!!

5778
03:37:00,150 --> 03:37:02,590
Starting now, let's settle this in one go

5779
03:37:02,590 --> 03:37:03,960
We'll show you the standard training we do

5780
03:37:03,960 --> 03:37:06,190
We'll show you the standard training we do

5781
03:37:07,090 --> 03:37:09,260
Oh jeez!!

5782
03:37:09,530 --> 03:37:11,260
This is much harder than anything you do

5783
03:37:11,260 --> 03:37:13,430
I bet you losers wouldn't be able to handle this...

5784
03:37:13,430 --> 03:37:14,770
This is amazing

5785
03:37:15,300 --> 03:37:19,970

where it automatically cuts noodles into the hot water

5791
03:37:20,440 --> 03:37:27,280
A very High Tech Machine

5792
03:37:21,310 --> 03:37:22,910
This machine was created...

5793
03:37:23,110 --> 03:37:26,710
to cut ramen one after another into hot water

5794
03:37:27,580 --> 03:37:29,580
Our Yoshinobu

5795
03:37:29,580 --> 03:37:30,880
can eat straight from this amazing machine

5796
03:37:30,880 --> 03:37:31,820
and he can eat loads of noodles straight from the nabe with his bare hands

5797
03:37:31,820 --> 03:37:34,050
and he can eat loads of noodles straight from the nabe with his bare hands

5798
03:37:34,050 --> 03:37:36,690
and he can eat loads of noodles straight from the nabe with his bare hands

5799
03:37:37,320 --> 03:37:39,430
I doubt he could do that.

03:37:54,410 --> 03:37:55,440
Only take a minute

5810
03:38:05,580 --> 03:38:08,120
That's why I said it

5811
03:38:30,240 --> 03:38:32,210
What the hell is he doing?

5812
03:38:32,910 --> 03:38:34,880
So freaken noisy

5813
03:38:35,080 --> 03:38:37,050
10 seconds left

5814
03:38:39,050 --> 03:38:40,590
What is Yoshinobu doing?

5815
03:38:49,660 --> 03:38:51,030
What are they doing?

5816
03:39:02,070 --> 03:39:03,140
That guy with the glasses didn't eat any!!

5817
03:39:03,140 --> 03:39:06,810
That guy with the glasses didn't eat any!!

5818
03:39:15,990 --> 03:39:18,660
If I'm not mistaken they said it was hot

5819
03:39:19,260 --> 03:39:23,160
Degawa Division won't back away;

5820
03:39:20,890 --> 03:39:23,160
we will show you our training method

5821
03:39:23,160 --> 03:39:24,860
Bring it out

5822
03:39:24,860 --> 03:39:25,960
You... This is...

5823
03:39:25,960 --> 03:39:27,030
Machine's name Wedgie High

5824
03:39:27,030 --> 03:39:28,830
Machine's name Wedgie High

5825
03:39:29,840 --> 03:39:31,800
They will wear briefs uncomfortably high

5826
03:39:29,840 --> 03:39:37,080
Wear some briefs really high up

and get swung around as if on a swing

5827
03:39:29,840 --> 03:39:37,080
Wedgie High

5828
03:39:32,240 --> 03:39:37,010
and whilst being pushed as if they were on the swings, they must kick the balloons.

5829
03:39:36,580 --> 03:39:37,980
What the hell?

5830
03:39:37,610 --> 03:39:44,250
A very good machine to toughen up the crotch

5831
03:39:37,610 --> 03:39:44,250
All the weight will go to the crotch

5832
03:39:37,710 --> 03:39:40,380
As their whole body weight will be on their crotch

5833
03:39:39,850 --> 03:39:42,310
They sure love doing things to their crotches

5834
03:39:40,610 --> 03:39:43,780
this is a fantastic machine to toughen it up.

5835
03:39:45,120 --> 03:39:48,590
With this training, Degawa Division's Iwao will show his spirit

5836
03:39:49,150 --> 03:39:50,690
We'll show ya!!

5837
03:39:50,690 --> 03:39:52,490
I get it, it's a huge swing

5838
03:39:57,160 --> 03:40:04,340
There's a pin at the tip of the shoe to burst the balloon

5839
03:40:12,810 --> 03:40:13,050
It hurts! It hurts!

5840
03:40:13,050 --> 03:40:15,150
It hurts! It hurts!

5841
03:40:16,750 --> 03:40:18,480
Stretch out your legs!

5842
03:40:18,480 --> 03:40:19,820
Are you okay?

5843
03:40:20,150 --> 03:40:25,520
Because it's too hard, he needs a rest

5844
03:40:27,430 --> 03:40:28,160
What the hell...

5845
03:40:35,530 --> 03:40:36,270
This machine could be dangerous if you don't rest in between...

5846
03:40:36,270 --> 03:40:40,010
This machine could be dangerous if you don't rest in between...

5847
03:40:40,010 --> 03:40:41,140
I will burst it.

5848
03:40:41,140 --> 03:40:43,010
I will burst it straight away!!

5849
03:40:47,650 --> 03:40:50,020
You can't do this, can you!?

5850
03:40:58,060 --> 03:41:00,290
Give me a break!!

5851
03:41:03,100 --> 03:41:05,830
That's enough

5852
03:41:06,160 --> 03:41:08,170
What the hell...

5853
03:41:06,800 --> 03:41:08,900
Seriously, enough...

5854
03:41:15,410 --> 03:41:18,810
You're so pathetic...

5855
03:41:22,050 --> 03:41:24,550
Nice fight!!

5856
03:41:26,890 --> 03:41:34,660
Riding it like a swing  he will burst three ballons

5857
03:41:26,890 --> 03:41:34,660
Tanaka's willpower

5858
03:41:26,950 --> 03:41:28,320
Now, Ueshima Division's

5859
03:41:28,820 --> 03:41:31,390
Tanaka will try and burst three balloons

5860
03:41:51,710 --> 03:41:54,280
Widen both legs!!

5861
03:41:58,120 --> 03:42:01,390
Time...

5862
03:42:06,860 --> 03:42:08,230
Okay!!

5863
03:42:09,060 --> 03:42:12,160
AAAAAAGGGGHHHHHH

5864
03:42:17,440 --> 03:42:20,110
Quick! Please give me energy!!

5865
03:42:20,110 --> 03:42:22,070
Quick! Please give me energy!!

5866
03:42:34,990 --> 03:42:37,060
Try and rest without any help!!

5867
03:42:40,760 --> 03:42:44,160
I was able to rest without any help...

5868
03:42:51,440 --> 03:42:53,340
This part is so sadistic...

5869
03:42:58,110 --> 03:42:59,950
I'm just really tall...

5870
03:43:00,780 --> 03:43:03,280
I will put an end to this once and for all

5871
03:43:03,280 --> 03:43:05,950
Bring that in!!

5872
03:43:06,650 --> 03:43:08,690
Uh-oh!

5873
03:43:09,220 --> 03:43:10,020
Don't shit yourselves  you guys!

5874
03:43:10,020 --> 03:43:12,220
Don't shit yourselves, you guys!

5875
03:43:10,120 --> 03:43:11,190
There it is...

5876
03:43:12,220 --> 03:43:14,090
What is this?

5877
03:43:14,090 --> 03:43:15,960
Candle wax...

5878
03:43:16,830 --> 03:43:23,570
Degawa's willpower

5879
03:43:16,830 --> 03:43:23,570
how many times can he be spun around in a tanker full of melted candle wax

5880
03:43:18,930 --> 03:43:21,730
Watch me, you marines!

5881
03:43:29,110 --> 03:43:31,440
Ryu-chan was laughing the whole time!

5882
03:43:30,080 --> 03:43:33,650
Don't be nervous you guys!!

5883
03:43:33,150 --> 03:43:35,080
He just couldn't contain himself.

5884
03:43:33,910 --> 03:43:36,480
Watch and learn what willpower really is!!

5885
03:43:37,320 --> 03:43:39,650
Amazing...

5886
03:43:56,800 --> 03:43:59,810
He looks like Pinocchio...

5887
03:44:01,770 --> 03:44:04,340
This is nothing!!

5888
03:44:04,340 --> 03:44:05,140
This is nothing you fool!

5889
03:44:05,140 --> 03:44:07,010
This is nothing you fool!

5890
03:44:20,060 --> 03:44:20,490
That's enough!

5891
03:44:20,490 --> 03:44:23,200
That's enough!

5892
03:44:30,800 --> 03:44:35,240
*We have taken safety precautions, please do not try this at home.

5893
03:44:35,870 --> 03:44:38,240
He looks like Mask-man...

5894
03:44:38,240 --> 03:44:38,880
There is genuinely a Mask-man that looks like that

5895
03:44:38,880 --> 03:44:40,250
There is genuinely a Mask-man that looks like that

5896
03:44:40,410 --> 03:44:41,210
Let's settle this in the final battle

5897
03:44:41,210 --> 03:44:43,420
Let's settle this in the final battle

5898
03:44:44,450 --> 03:44:46,350
Bring that in!

5899
03:44:47,820 --> 03:44:48,790
Is it "that" thing?

5900
03:44:50,620 --> 03:44:52,560
If you look at it, you should already understand

5901
03:44:50,790 --> 03:44:51,390
There it is...

5902
03:44:52,990 --> 03:44:55,160
We put gas up the guy's arse and they arm wrestle!

5903
03:44:55,160 --> 03:44:57,530
We put gas up the guy's arse and they arm wrestle!

5904
03:44:57,530 --> 03:44:59,330
We put gas up the guy's arse and they arm wrestle!

5905
03:45:00,000 --> 03:45:00,830
Whoever farts first is the loser

5906
03:45:00,830 --> 03:45:02,630
Whoever farts first is the loser

5907
03:45:03,870 --> 03:45:06,510
That's so fuckin stupid...

5908
03:45:04,970 --> 03:45:06,510
What kind of rules are those?!

5909
03:45:16,210 --> 03:45:18,380
Can you just explain the rules once more..?

5910
03:45:18,380 --> 03:45:19,580
So we put gas into our arse till we can take no more and we arm wrestle

5911
03:45:19,580 --> 03:45:20,890
So we put gas into our arse till we can take no more and we arm wrestle

5912
03:45:20,890 --> 03:45:22,520
So we put gas into our arse till we can take no more and we arm wrestle

5913
03:45:23,790 --> 03:45:28,790
and whoever farts first loses...

5914
03:45:33,830 --> 03:45:35,130
You don't need him to explain twice

5915
03:45:35,130 --> 03:45:36,400
You don't need him to explain twice

5916
03:45:40,240 --> 03:45:40,740
It's weird because you're speaking in Osaka dialect in that last part as well...

5917
03:45:40,740 --> 03:45:41,540
It's weird because you're speaking in Osaka dialect in that last part as well...

5918
03:45:41,540 --> 03:45:42,870
It's weird because you're speaking in Osaka dialect in that last part as well...

5919
03:45:43,380 --> 03:45:44,780
This is the final battle

5920
03:45:43,740 --> 03:45:51,480
The final battle

5921
03:45:43,740 --> 03:45:51,480
They put gas up their arses and arm wrestle and whoever farts first loses

5922
03:45:52,950 --> 03:45:54,350
We're getting our strongest member out

5923
03:45:54,350 --> 03:45:56,350
We're getting our Leader to go!

5924
03:45:57,090 --> 03:45:59,620
Your leader is so weak...

5925
03:46:01,790 --> 03:46:05,630
Do not fart arm wrestling competition

5926
03:46:02,390 --> 03:46:05,630
Degawa Team

5927
03:46:02,390 --> 03:46:05,630
Kuro-chan

5928
03:46:02,390 --> 03:46:05,630
Ueshima Ryuhei

5929
03:46:02,390 --> 03:46:05,630
Ueshima Team

5930
03:46:05,960 --> 03:46:08,730
That is Hosshan, isn't it?

5931
03:46:08,730 --> 03:46:12,040
It's okay if it's Hosshan?

5932
03:46:12,370 --> 03:46:13,510
Okay, I'm putting gas in now.

5933
03:46:13,170 --> 03:46:18,980
Both sides put gas in at the same time

5934
03:46:19,210 --> 03:46:21,410
AAAAAGGGHHHHH

5935
03:46:29,120 --> 03:46:30,890
It's in!!

5936
03:46:31,220 --> 03:46:35,160
Kuro-chan has been filled with gas

5937
03:46:38,400 --> 03:46:40,470
Still?

5938
03:46:42,100 --> 03:46:44,240
Wait, not yet? You're taking ages!

5939
03:46:48,610 --> 03:46:50,140
Ueshima, hurry up!

5940
03:46:50,140 --> 03:46:52,480
Ueshima, hurry up!

5941
03:46:55,050 --> 03:46:57,780
Kuro-chan will release everything!!

5942
03:46:57,780 --> 03:47:00,020
Make sure everything is done at the same time!

5943
03:47:00,050 --> 03:47:04,760
They calm down and get ready again

5944
03:47:03,090 --> 03:47:04,760
You're like sumo wrestlers right now...

5945
03:47:05,590 --> 03:47:08,160
The first part is really important

5946
03:47:14,700 --> 03:47:15,470
Oh!! Wait!

5947
03:47:15,270 --> 03:47:16,670
Oh!! Wait!

5948
03:47:15,900 --> 03:47:16,200
Sorry wait!

5949
03:47:16,200 --> 03:47:17,000
Sorry wait!

5950
03:47:28,250 --> 03:47:32,720
Ueshima runs into the back room

5951
03:47:34,450 --> 03:47:36,090
I don't think this is possible, is it?

5952
03:47:38,290 --> 03:47:42,630
Until Ueshima returns, they practice putting air into Kuro-chan

5953
03:47:43,530 --> 03:47:44,160
*clan*

5954
03:47:43,760 --> 03:47:44,160
*clan*

5955
03:47:45,000 --> 03:47:46,360
*clan*

5956
03:47:45,230 --> 03:47:46,360
*clan*

5957
03:47:46,360 --> 03:47:48,500
What happened?

5958
03:47:48,500 --> 03:47:48,830
Something is stuck in me

5959
03:47:48,830 --> 03:47:51,640
Something is stuck in me

5960
03:47:51,640 --> 03:47:56,240
The nozzle is inside Kuro-chan...

5961
03:47:56,910 --> 03:47:58,180
It's just stuck in you...

5962
03:47:58,240 --> 03:47:59,140
It's not good

5963
03:47:59,710 --> 03:48:01,610
The nozzle is gone

5964
03:48:11,920 --> 03:48:16,530
We were able to get the nozzle out

5965
03:48:22,900 --> 03:48:24,370
You put too much air in. Just let it all out

5966
03:48:24,370 --> 03:48:26,340
You put too much air in. Just let it all out

5967
03:48:26,340 --> 03:48:27,770
Get set and...

5968
03:48:28,070 --> 03:48:30,980
Oh

5969
03:48:28,340 --> 03:48:30,980
it's coming

5970
03:48:28,510 --> 03:48:30,980
it's coming

5971
03:48:29,140 --> 03:48:30,980
A real one is coming out...

5972
03:48:32,310 --> 03:48:34,150
and substitution...

5973
03:48:34,150 --> 03:48:34,680
What is over there?

5974
03:48:34,680 --> 03:48:36,650
What is over there?

5975
03:48:39,580 --> 03:48:41,090
What the hell man!?

5976
03:48:43,120 --> 03:48:45,390
There is not going to be a match...

5977
03:48:49,860 --> 03:48:51,300
What are we going to do about this?

5978
03:48:51,300 --> 03:48:54,130
You're amazing Ueshima

5979
03:48:54,530 --> 03:48:57,670
You guys are awesome, aren't you!?

5980
03:48:58,000 --> 03:49:02,370
Ends with them making up

5981
03:49:04,280 --> 03:49:05,340
You got to see the will power of the marines, huh?

5982
03:49:05,340 --> 03:49:07,810
You got to see the will power of the marines, huh?

5983
03:49:05,940 --> 03:49:07,810
They were able to be friends again

5984
03:49:11,850 --> 03:49:14,720
This year was also amazing, huh?

5985
03:49:14,820 --> 03:49:18,320
I'm off to the toilet

5986
03:49:20,760 --> 03:49:24,730
9:00 PM. As soon as they get back to the training centre...

5987
03:49:21,090 --> 03:49:24,730

The experiment was to determine whether monkeys could survive in space like humans

6018
03:50:30,960 --> 03:50:34,870
The experiment was to determine whether monkeys could survive in space like humans

6019
03:50:33,000 --> 03:50:34,870
and in order to test this

6020
03:50:34,870 --> 03:50:35,830
after a year of preparation, he got in a rocket and traveled to space

6021

after a year of preparation, he got in a rocket and traveled to space

6023
03:50:39,040 --> 03:50:41,370
after a year of preparation, he got in a rocket and traveled to space

6024
03:50:41,740 --> 03:50:45,880
and he successfully survive out there.

6025
03:50:47,780 --> 03:50:55,750
Starting to get irritated in this quiet situation

6026
03:50:47,880 --> 03:50:50,220
During his time out in space,

6027
03:50:50,450 --> 03:50:52,150
he was able to find a true partner

6028
03:50:52,550 --> 03:50:54,850
who is this man, the astronaut, Maeda-san

6029
03:50:57,260 --> 03:50:59,360
Let's quickly get to the anticipated questions

6030
03:50:59,360 --> 03:51:01,960
Let's quickly get to the anticipated questions

6031
03:51:02,230 --> 03:51:03,730
Astronaut Maeda    What was Ken-kun like up in space?

6032
03:51:03,730 --> 03:51:06,000
Astronaut Maeda    What was Ken-kun like up in space?

6033
03:51:06,730 --> 03:51:08,170
Umm yeah, let's see

6034
03:51:08,670 --> 03:51:12,900
Inside the rocket Ken was healthy and all

6035
03:51:11,440 --> 03:51:15,370
Ken-kun likes to prank

6036
03:51:18,710 --> 03:51:23,250
when we got up above the skies, he started to get excited...

6037
03:51:25,480 --> 03:51:26,380
He was really loving the zero gravity

6038
03:51:26,380 --> 03:51:28,990
He was really loving the zero gravity

6039
03:51:29,120 --> 03:51:32,820
He was adapting...

6040
03:51:33,290 --> 03:51:36,490
He was adapting much quicker than us, because he's a monkey.

6041
03:51:42,600 --> 03:51:44,800
What the hell is he doing?

6042
03:51:46,070 --> 03:51:48,570
I can't deal with this

6043
03:51:51,680 --> 03:51:54,250
Have affection

6044
03:51:54,910 --> 03:52:00,020
So you're saying you needed to be strict while showing him love...

6045
03:51:55,650 --> 03:52:03,050
Top Leadership become target of pranks

6046
03:52:00,750 --> 03:52:03,720
Same as humans

6047
03:52:04,460 --> 03:52:06,120
That's terrific... next...

6048
03:52:06,390 --> 03:52:12,130
Puting hair mousse on glasses

6049
03:52:06,390 --> 03:52:12,130
Ken-kun's Prank

6050
03:52:23,640 --> 03:52:26,840
What was Ken-kun's diet in space?

6051
03:52:26,840 --> 03:52:29,280
His favourite: bananas.

6052
03:52:29,650 --> 03:52:32,380
Like us, he also got a variety of meat and vegetables

6053
03:52:33,450 --> 03:52:36,290
it's something I realized while we were in space

6054
03:52:34,490 --> 03:52:39,090
Sticking oranges into mouth

6055
03:52:34,490 --> 03:52:39,090
Ken-kun's Prank

6056
03:52:36,150 --> 03:52:39,160
When we started eating the same things out there...

6057
03:52:39,420 --> 03:52:41,290
He got much healthier

6058
03:52:41,590 --> 03:52:43,660
So maybe, the diet had a part to play?

6059
03:52:43,130 --> 03:52:47,170
Ken-kun's Prank

6060
03:52:43,130 --> 03:52:47,170
Pushes orange rind into nose

6061
03:52:57,480 --> 03:53:00,980
Well then, the space station and the headquarter on Earth actually had a video feed between the two.

6062
03:53:01,250 --> 03:53:03,350
We could see what was going on up there.

6063
03:53:03,820 --> 03:53:06,780
They said that Ken-kun was great and he was popular among them

6064
03:53:05,620 --> 03:53:11,020

6066
03:53:07,150 --> 03:53:11,120
What do you think about that?

6067
03:53:11,120 --> 03:53:14,390
I honestly didn't think he would ever be this popular

6068
03:53:15,290 --> 03:53:18,560
Ken-kun doesn't actually think of himself as a monkey.

6069
03:53:18,900 --> 03:53:22,500
He thought of me as a rival, like an enemy

6070
03:53:22,730 --> 03:53:24,270
So if he didn't like something

6071
03:53:24,740 --> 03:53:25,570
He would get angry with me

6072
03:53:25,700 --> 03:53:26,640
Oh, so like a fear almost?

6073
03:53:26,800 --> 03:53:28,470
Perhaps, yes.

Do you have anything you could say to them?

6081
03:53:40,320 --> 03:53:45,890
Well you know, Ken-kun here was able to do it, so

6082
03:53:45,890 --> 03:53:50,460
it is possible for anyone who really wants to do it.

6083
03:53:51,260 --> 03:53:53,460
Okay well this is a little bit of a strange question but...

6084
03:53:53,660 --> 03:53:54,330
Oh yes,

6085
03:53:54,500 --> 03:53:57,200
For someone really active like Ken-kun...

6086
03:53:57,370 --> 03:53:58,440
EEEEK

6087
03:53:58,600 --> 03:54:02,710
Ken-kun escapes

6088
03:54:00,470 --> 03:54:02,710

6137
03:56:12,840 --> 03:56:18,240

Oh yeah, him...

6141
03:56:33,990 --> 03:56:36,860
Is there any one here who recognizes him?

6142
03:56:39,230 --> 03:56:40,430
One thing that concerns me.

6143
03:56:40,430 --> 03:56:42,430
One thing that concerns me.

6144
03:56:42,900 --> 03:56:44,270
He said, in the middle of our investigation,

6145
03:56:44,270 --> 03:56:46,600
He said, in the middle of our investigation,

6146

Someone his heart connects with!!

6149
03:57:02,990 --> 03:57:05,290
Isn't that a remarkable expression?

6150
03:57:09,330 --> 03:57:13,100
So this is how it is

6151
03:57:13,460 --> 03:57:15,170
If the traitor is in here

6152
03:57:15,170 --> 03:57:20,100
If the traitor is in here

6153
03:57:18,070 --> 03:57:20,100
or anyone knows who is the traitor

6154
03:57:20,100 --> 03:57:22,040
Immediately show yourself!!

Immediately show yourself!!

6156
03:57:28,850 --> 03:57:30,050
So that means this alien has been telling us lies

03:57:30,050 --> 03:57:32,480
So that means this alien has been telling us lies

6158
03:57:32,480 --> 03:57:33,880
But!! Let's see if he recognizes anyone

6159
03:57:33,880 --> 03:57:36,920

Find the traitor!!

6167
03:57:56,310 --> 03:58:02,650
If his finger lights up, it proves friendship

6168
03:58:03,380 --> 03:58:04,520
I thought you would be okay...

6169
03:58:04,080 --> 03:58:06,420
What a remarkable expression Yama-chan

6170
03:58:04,920 --> 03:58:07,150
He had already been slapped in the morning...

6171
03:58:08,090 --> 03:58:09,420
Will we be okay?

6172
03:58:08,790 --> 03:58:10,820
It is the second time

6173
03:58:11,290 --> 03:58:13,820
I have faith that everyone

6174
03:58:13,820 --> 03:58:15,330
I trust every single one of you

6175
03:58:15,330 --> 03:58:17,360
I trust every single one of you

6176
03:58:17,360 --> 03:58:19,930
From you

6177
03:58:20,830 --> 03:58:24,240
You mean me?

6178
03:58:22,370 --> 03:58:23,200
Yes you

6179
03:58:23,670 --> 03:58:24,200
Touch his finger

6180
03:58:25,500 --> 03:58:26,240
Be careful

6181
03:58:28,310 --> 03:58:33,640
Heart doesn't connect so no reaction

6182
03:58:34,250 --> 03:58:34,750
Let me see

6183
03:58:37,580 --> 03:58:38,720
We should just fast forward this part...

6184
03:58:38,650 --> 03:58:40,220
Okay

6185
03:58:50,490 --> 03:58:50,960
Thank you, I was mistaken

6186
03:58:50,960 --> 03:58:54,000
Thank you, I was mistaken

6187
03:58:53,130 --> 03:58:53,960
It's fine. It's fine.

6188
03:58:55,630 --> 03:58:58,540
Well surely, not twice in a day.

6189
03:58:56,770 --> 03:58:57,840
Okay it's good thank you

6190
03:58:57,840 --> 03:59:00,140
Okay it's good thank you

6191
03:59:04,840 --> 03:59:06,580
I thought I was in trouble...

6192
03:59:07,210 --> 03:59:08,450
I was fine

6193
03:59:08,010 --> 03:59:08,750
Okay

6194
03:59:13,750 --> 03:59:15,450
Can you do it?

6195
03:59:15,450 --> 03:59:16,390
Hey!!

6196
03:59:16,390 --> 03:59:19,820
What is with your face?

6197
03:59:20,120 --> 03:59:22,430
Don't you think there is a chance you could be saved?

6198
03:59:24,300 --> 03:59:25,360
Okay, it's up to you

6199
03:59:25,360 --> 03:59:25,800
Okay, it's up to you

6200
03:59:30,630 --> 03:59:36,670
Alien's finger instantly lights up

6201
03:59:38,010 --> 03:59:39,280
Well that was to be expected

6202
03:59:47,080 --> 03:59:51,220
Traitor Discovered!!

6203
03:59:53,760 --> 03:59:55,690
Hey!! What's your name?

6204
03:59:55,690 --> 03:59:57,360
Hey!! What's your name?

6205
03:59:57,360 --> 04:00:00,460
It's Tsukitei Hosei

6206
03:59:58,930 --> 04:00:00,460
I don't know you

6207
04:00:03,400 --> 04:00:07,240
You're a traitor!!

6208
04:00:04,600 --> 04:00:07,240
You're wrong!!

6209
04:00:07,240 --> 04:00:10,740
So what this guy is saying is a lie?

6210
04:00:10,740 --> 04:00:11,980
Before me, the person on my left  gave him some goods

6211
04:00:11,980 --> 04:00:13,310
Before me, the person on my left  gave him some goods

6212
04:00:13,310 --> 04:00:15,810
Before me, the person on my left gave him some goods

6213
04:00:22,690 --> 04:00:24,190
Goods...

6214
04:00:23,890 --> 04:00:25,220
Goods, haha.

6215
04:00:24,590 --> 04:00:27,190
He totally sold him out just now...

6216
04:00:26,060 --> 04:00:26,990
What are you saying?

6217
04:00:26,720 --> 04:00:28,490
He really is a bad person

6218
04:00:29,090 --> 04:00:30,490
Totally...

6219
04:00:30,290 --> 04:00:31,160
Really?

6220
04:00:31,160 --> 04:00:33,200
No doubt in the slightest...

6221
04:00:33,500 --> 04:00:35,900
That's not the problem

6222
04:00:35,900 --> 04:00:37,670
Why is that?

6223
04:00:37,670 --> 04:00:39,900
His finger lit up

6224
04:00:39,900 --> 04:00:42,110
Your hearts are connected.

6225
04:00:42,110 --> 04:00:43,570
The information was transferred

6226
04:00:44,240 --> 04:00:45,810
I don't like him; I hate him

6227
04:00:45,810 --> 04:00:47,410
I don't like him; I hate him

6228
04:00:47,410 --> 04:00:48,010
He's not my friend; he's not anything!!

6229
04:00:48,010 --> 04:00:51,420
He's not my friend; he's not anything!!

6230
04:00:52,250 --> 04:00:53,550
Why the hell are you so dramatic?

6231
04:00:55,190 --> 04:00:56,020
Damn...

6232
04:00:56,350 --> 04:00:57,560
Oh well, whatever.

6233
04:00:58,060 --> 04:00:59,420
I don't like how you're speaking

6234
04:00:59,460 --> 04:01:01,790
What character is that?

6235
04:01:04,830 --> 04:01:07,230
He's saying something

6236
04:01:07,600 --> 04:01:10,270
Wait, the alien is saying something

6237
04:01:12,170 --> 04:01:12,940
Hosei my friend

6238
04:01:12,940 --> 04:01:14,570
Hosei my friend

6239
04:01:14,570 --> 04:01:16,570
Hosei my friend

6240
04:01:16,570 --> 04:01:20,180
Hosei my friend

6241
04:01:29,590 --> 04:01:31,060
Would you really say
it at that time?

6242
04:01:34,330 --> 04:01:35,660
Get up now

6243
04:01:35,660 --> 04:01:36,790
Get up, damn it!!

6244
04:01:36,790 --> 04:01:39,800
Hosei-san, stay strong

6245
04:01:40,160 --> 04:01:44,640
For the traitor: a punishment slap!!

6246
04:01:41,870 --> 04:01:44,440
I've already been slapped once today...

6247
04:01:44,870 --> 04:01:46,040
What are you talking about?

6248
04:01:46,040 --> 04:01:48,610
This morning I already received a punishment

6249
04:01:48,610 --> 04:01:50,440
I told you that my jaw was dislocated!!

6250
04:01:50,440 --> 04:01:52,440
I forget that kind of stuff!

6251
04:01:54,850 --> 04:01:56,350
Tsukitei Houtei

6252
04:01:56,350 --> 04:01:57,350
Tsukitei Houtei

6253
04:01:57,350 --> 04:01:59,450
It's Hosei.

6254
04:01:58,180 --> 04:01:59,450
Shut up!!

6255
04:02:05,690 --> 04:02:07,120
He got it wrong in the morning, too.

6256
04:02:07,220 --> 04:02:08,790
In the morning it was your last name

6257
04:02:08,530 --> 04:02:09,460
It was "tsuki".

6258
04:02:08,990 --> 04:02:10,760
It was the "tsuki".

6259
04:02:10,330 --> 04:02:11,460
He just won't remember my name...

6260
04:02:12,360 --> 04:02:14,700
Would you really do it twice?

6261
04:02:15,370 --> 04:02:17,570
You're always like this

6262
04:02:17,570 --> 04:02:18,440
Why do you stab your friends in the back? This is the EDF!!

6263
04:02:18,440 --> 04:02:19,670
Why do you stab your friends in the back? This is the EDF!!

6264
04:02:19,670 --> 04:02:21,370
Why do you stab your friends in the back? This is the EDF!!

6265
04:02:21,370 --> 04:02:23,640
I didn't stab them in the back

6266
04:02:22,470 --> 04:02:23,170
You didn't stab them in the back?

6267
04:02:24,140 --> 04:02:26,110
Then why did you give him information?

6268
04:02:26,110 --> 04:02:26,980
I didn't give him  any information

6269
04:02:26,980 --> 04:02:27,980
I didn't give him any information

6270
04:02:28,610 --> 04:02:31,150
Did I actually give you any information!?

6271
04:02:31,150 --> 04:02:32,650
Then talk!!

6272
04:02:33,780 --> 04:02:34,650
Hey Alien

6273
04:02:34,650 --> 04:02:36,150
Hey Alien

6274
04:02:36,150 --> 04:02:37,960
Did I give you any information!?

6275
04:02:38,160 --> 04:02:40,460
I hate you!!

6276
04:02:40,720 --> 04:02:42,130
You're my enemy!! An enemy!!

6277
04:02:42,130 --> 04:02:44,160
You're my enemy!! An enemy!!

6278
04:02:44,600 --> 04:02:45,160
Hosei my friend

6279
04:02:45,160 --> 04:02:46,500
Hosei my friend

6280
04:02:46,500 --> 04:02:47,830
Hosei my friend

6281
04:02:47,830 --> 04:02:52,100
Hosei my friend

6282
04:02:56,310 --> 04:02:57,340
He's awful

6283
04:02:58,480 --> 04:03:01,050
Hm... That alien is the worst

6284
04:03:02,850 --> 04:03:07,620
I wonder what happened to make him like you so much

6285
04:03:06,450 --> 04:03:07,320
You guys are friends!

6286
04:03:07,620 --> 04:03:08,590
You are not an ally of the Earth Defese Force

6287
04:03:08,590 --> 04:03:10,890
You are not an ally of the Earth Defese Force

6288
04:03:11,420 --> 04:03:14,760
You're a traitor!!

6289
04:03:15,990 --> 04:03:16,730
Wait...

6290
04:03:33,410 --> 04:03:35,850
What the hell are you doing?

6291
04:03:36,410 --> 04:03:37,450
What the hell...

6292
04:03:40,620 --> 04:03:41,490
Wow

6293
04:03:41,990 --> 04:03:43,490
So noisy...

6294
04:03:47,190 --> 04:03:48,960
I wouldn't want that to happen to me

6295
04:03:47,690 --> 04:03:50,060
Alright, stand up!!

6296
04:03:50,060 --> 04:03:51,300
Why?!

6297
04:03:51,300 --> 04:03:53,660
I don't want this! I really don't want this!!

6298
04:03:53,660 --> 04:03:55,170
Get up!!

6299
04:03:55,170 --> 04:03:57,870
Get up!!

6300
04:03:57,870 --> 04:04:00,040
Get up man!

6301
04:04:00,100 --> 04:04:01,140
Get up man...

6302
04:04:08,880 --> 04:04:10,610
I can't do this anymore

6303
04:04:12,180 --> 04:04:13,580
His mannerisms are awful

6304
04:04:15,590 --> 04:04:17,390
He really didn't help us

6305
04:04:16,850 --> 04:04:17,820
This is your last chance; get up!!

6306
04:04:17,820 --> 04:04:21,130
This is your last chance; get up!!

6307
04:04:24,600 --> 04:04:27,600
Hey you, what are these?

6308
04:04:27,970 --> 04:04:29,700
Those are oranges

6309
04:04:29,700 --> 04:04:30,800
The genius monkey brought them

6310
04:04:30,800 --> 04:04:32,200
The genius monkey brought them

6311
04:04:32,200 --> 04:04:34,710
EAT IT!!

6312
04:04:32,900 --> 04:04:34,710
I don't want to!!

6313
04:04:34,710 --> 04:04:37,340
Eat it, damn it!!

6314
04:04:35,570 --> 04:04:37,340
I don't want to!!

6315
04:04:40,740 --> 04:04:42,350
I don't want to do this anymore

6316
04:04:44,310 --> 04:04:45,880
This is tough, so tough.

6317
04:04:48,390 --> 04:04:49,250
I don't want to do this year after year

6318
04:04:49,250 --> 04:04:49,890
I don't want to do this year after year

6319
04:04:49,890 --> 04:04:51,490
I don't want to do this year after year

6320
04:04:52,090 --> 04:04:54,760
Just get it over with

6321
04:05:02,100 --> 04:05:03,770
Do you understand?

6322
04:05:03,770 --> 04:05:05,640
Yes

6323
04:05:07,600 --> 04:05:08,040
Don't step  on the oranges!!

6324
04:05:08,040 --> 04:05:10,340
Don't step on the oranges!!

6325
04:05:10,340 --> 04:05:11,110
Stand on one leg! One leg!!

6326
04:05:11,110 --> 04:05:13,110
Stand on one leg! One leg!!

6327
04:05:21,690 --> 04:05:23,820
It's dangerous

6328
04:05:23,820 --> 04:05:25,820
You will fly

6329
04:05:25,120 --> 04:05:25,820
If you stand on one leg

6330
04:05:29,890 --> 04:05:30,630
Stand up right!

6331
04:05:30,630 --> 04:05:31,860
I can't!

6332
04:05:32,300 --> 04:05:34,870
Close your eyes!!

6333
04:05:33,330 --> 04:05:34,260
Not my eyes!

6334
04:05:34,870 --> 04:05:37,200
Not my eyes!!

6335
04:05:37,600 --> 04:05:38,300
Normally... Normally

6336
04:05:38,370 --> 04:05:39,340
If you escape, you know what will happen hey

6337
04:05:39,040 --> 04:05:41,310
If you escape, you know what will happen hey

6338
04:05:41,000 --> 04:05:42,840
If you escape, you know what will happen hey

6339
04:05:42,910 --> 04:05:45,280
Yes

6340
04:05:46,940 --> 04:05:50,250
That was a bad face just now

6341
04:05:51,620 --> 04:05:52,980
Why is he acting like they're mates?

6342
04:06:00,590 --> 04:06:02,030
Let's go!! Ready?!

6343
04:06:02,030 --> 04:06:04,090
Let's go!! Ready?!

6344
04:06:05,060 --> 04:06:07,200
Tsukitei Hosei

6345
04:06:07,200 --> 04:06:10,430
Tsukitei Hosei

6346
04:06:10,430 --> 04:06:13,070
Let's do it again this year!!

6347
04:06:13,070 --> 04:06:14,000
HEY!! Are you okay?!

6348
04:06:14,000 --> 04:06:15,640
HEY!! Are you okay?!

6349
04:06:16,640 --> 04:06:17,840
ALRIGHT!!

6350
04:06:27,550 --> 04:06:29,690

6372
04:07:39,920 --> 04:07:44,700

with a certain TV program...

6381
04:07:54,440 --> 04:07:55,840
Since he was Yamasaki Hosei, there was a TV program important to him, called "Drive A Go-Go"

So, recently he met with some people who are connected to the show

6385
04:08:04,380 --> 04:08:06,120

Male celebrities and female celebrities drive together and enjoy the travel

6387

Male celebrities and female celebrities drive together and enjoy the travel

6388
04:08:11,490 --> 04:08:13,160
It's scripted, but most of the parts are left to them

6389
04:08:13,160 --> 04:08:15,060
It's scripted, but most of the parts are left to them

6390
04:08:15,060 --> 04:08:16,460
Because the celebrities have an ability to work and report

6391
04:08:16,460 --> 04:08:17,760
Because the celebrities have an ability to work and report

6392

Something happened at exactly the last filming location

6397
04:08:28,870 --> 04:08:32,710
before he was entering the inn, the director said

6398
04:08:32,710 --> 04:08:35,210
"the spa nearby has a lot of steam so can you please touch it?"

6399
04:08:35,210 --> 04:08:39,350
"the spa nearby has a lot of steam so can you please touch it?"

6400
04:08:39,520 --> 04:08:41,790
After Hosei said, "Wow! The spa's steam is amazing!" The cameraman took the shot, right?

6401
04:08:41,790 --> 04:08:43,890
After Hosei said, "Wow! The spa's steam is amazing!" The cameraman took it, right?

6402
04:08:43,890 --> 04:08:45,020
And when the cameraman returned to him, Hosei was already in the inn

6403
04:08:45,020 --> 04:08:47,860
And when the cameraman returned to him, Hosei was already in the inn

6404
04:08:51,190 --> 04:08:52,100
What the hell?

6405
04:08:51,960 --> 04:08:53,230
Why would you do that?

6406
04:08:56,270 --> 04:08:57,600
You wouldn't think he would do that

6407
04:08:58,400 --> 04:09:00,970
He didn't get used to it! (being on TV)

6408

Tsukitei Hosei Secret Information

6409
04:09:01,170 --> 04:09:18,890
with a certain TV program...

6410
04:09:01,740 --> 04:09:02,770
In the program, celebrities enter outdoor spas

6411
04:09:02,770 --> 04:09:04,470
In the program, celebrities enter outdoor spas

6412
04:09:04,470 --> 04:09:07,440
and they report how good the temperature of the water is

6413
04:09:07,710 --> 04:09:09,810
and the most important thing to report is the view from the spa

6414
04:09:09,810 --> 04:09:11,550
and the most important thing to report is the view from the spa

6415
04:09:11,550 --> 04:09:13,880
they have to report the beauty of the scenery

6416
04:09:13,920 --> 04:09:15,590
but as soon as Hosei gets in the spa he closes his eyes

6417
04:09:15,590 --> 04:09:18,890
but as soon as Hosei gets in the spa he closes his eyes

6418
04:09:24,660 --> 04:09:26,100
No no no no, Hosei-san

6419
04:09:25,000 --> 04:09:27,160
That's kind of bad, isn't it?

6420
04:09:29,230 --> 04:09:30,100
Amazing

6421
04:09:29,730 --> 04:09:31,470
That's kind of bad

6422
04:09:30,730 --> 04:09:32,340
That's not good

6423
04:09:31,940 --> 04:09:35,240

Tsukitei Hosei Secret Information

6427
04:09:38,210 --> 04:09:41,210
He's gotten tired of explaining his career's history

6428
04:09:41,310 --> 04:09:42,710
He became a Rakugoka

6429
04:09:41,410 --> 04:09:43,280
Rakugo is a form of art/comedy through story telling

6430
04:09:43,280 --> 04:09:44,850

6436
04:09:50,590 --> 04:10:19,620

6440
04:09:55,430 --> 04:09:58,460
And you know, I thought he might be finding it a bit tough,

6441
04:09:58,930 --> 04:10:02,700
so I went to his show, and when I saw him,

6442
04:10:03,570 --> 04:10:05,100
the presence he was giving off was like a master's.

6443
04:10:05,100 --> 04:10:06,700
the presence he was giving off was like  a master's.

6444
04:10:06,700 --> 04:10:08,470
It was really like powerful and everything.

6445
04:10:09,370 --> 04:10:10,740
And after the show,

6446
04:10:10,870 --> 04:10:12,110
he comes up to me and  and goes like "How are you doing lately, mate?"

6447
04:10:12,110 --> 04:10:16,680
he comes up to me and goes like  "How are you doing lately, mate?"

6448
04:10:18,250 --> 04:10:19,020
Really?

6449
04:10:18,450 --> 04:10:19,680
Yeah, he was so casual...

6450
04:10:20,250 --> 04:10:22,250
Hosei once said thathe gets the "Ding Dong Ditch" prank done to him

6451

6453
04:10:27,290 --> 04:10:29,160

6454
04:10:27,490 --> 04:10:45,410
"Ding Dong Ditch"

and apparently there are kids who ring his bell and  shout "Yamasaki OUT!"

6458
04:10:38,440 --> 04:10:41,140
But I've been past his house once before...

6459
04:10:41,140 --> 04:10:42,610
but you can't Ding Dong Ditch him   because of the location of his house...

6460
04:10:42,610 --> 04:10:45,410
but you can't Ding Dong Ditch him because of the location of his house...

6461
04:10:47,210 --> 04:10:49,610

6462
04:10:54,220 --> 04:10:55,520
You can't do that!

6463
04:10:55,950 --> 04:10:56,950
Don't lie...

6464
04:10:58,560 --> 04:11:00,490
You really shouldn't lie...

6465
04:10:59,760 --> 04:11:03,460
I've got a story which has got to do with his Rakugo...

6466
04:11:03,490 --> 04:11:04,490
Basically...

6467
04:11:04,490 --> 04:11:06,430
Hosei-san's stylist wasn't sure what exactly a Rakugoka was  so he asked him

6468
04:11:04,530 --> 04:11:32,790
Rakugoka is...

Hosei-san's stylist wasn't sure what exactly a Rakugoka was so he asked him

6471
04:11:08,030 --> 04:11:10,400
Hosei-san's stylist wasn't sure what exactly a Rakugoka was so he asked him

6472
04:11:10,670 --> 04:11:13,700
So you know, he explained it to him and his stylist said

6473
04:11:14,670 --> 04:11:16,510
so it's like an adult's version of  a "picture story show"

6474
04:11:16,510 --> 04:11:19,410
And he replied, "Hm, I guess, kind of."

6475
04:11:19,680 --> 04:11:23,710
And the next day, Hosei-san was getting interviewed by some magazine and his stylist was present

6476
04:11:23,980 --> 04:11:26,950
and the interviewer asked Hosei-san what exactly is a Rakugoka and he answered,

6477
04:11:27,150 --> 04:11:28,390
"It's basically an adult version of a picture story show..."   He basically stole exactly what his stylist said   and made it his own words...

6478
04:11:28,390 --> 04:11:30,490
"It's basically an adult version of a picture story show..." He basically stole exactly what his stylist said  and made it his own words...

6479
04:11:30,490 --> 04:11:32,790
"It's basically an adult version of a picture story show..." He basically stole exactly what his stylist said and made it his own words...

6480
04:11:36,730 --> 04:11:38,130
How horrible...

6481
04:11:41,130 --> 04:11:41,730
Shall we go for someone else?

6482
04:11:43,130 --> 04:11:43,970
This isn't important,  but you know  Shouhei's story about  Tsukitei Hosei's episode?

6483
04:11:43,970 --> 04:11:45,870
This isn't important, but you know  Shouhei's story about Tsukitei Hosei's episode?

This isn't important, but you know Shouhei's story about  Tsukitei Hosei's 'episode'?

6486
04:11:49,440 --> 04:11:53,440
That wasn't funny in the slightest!

6487
04:12:04,690 --> 04:12:06,120
But he should report it...

6488
04:12:06,120 --> 04:12:08,460
Well yeah, I guess...

6489
04:12:08,590 --> 04:12:12,100
We are a "reporting society"...

6490
04:12:10,690 --> 04:12:11,930
You want people to know...

6491
04:12:14,360 --> 04:12:17,670
Can we move onto stories about Hamada?

6492
04:12:18,270 --> 04:12:21,040

6493
04:12:21,400 --> 04:12:39,190

6497

He went to a restaurant when he was abroad and he was starving

6498
04:12:26,540 --> 04:12:28,250
He went to a restaurant when he was abroad and he was starving

6499
04:12:28,380 --> 04:12:29,280
and he was saying that

6500
04:12:29,310 --> 04:12:30,650
he wants to eat a lot so   he wanted to take his time, relax and eat

6501
04:12:30,650 --> 04:12:32,850
he wants to eat a lot so he wanted to take his time, relax and eat

6502
04:12:32,850 --> 04:12:34,080
but when the foreign waiter came over and asked, "Are you finished?"

6503
04:12:34,080 --> 04:12:35,990
but when the foreign waiter came over and asked, "Are you finished?"

6504
04:12:35,990 --> 04:12:39,190
he replied immediately, "Yes."

6505
04:12:38,560 --> 04:12:39,720
Man he really can't handle them...

6506
04:12:43,830 --> 04:12:45,400
He's so useless...

6507
04:12:48,470 --> 04:12:50,200
I don't want him to go abroad anymore; how embarrassing...

6508
04:12:51,770 --> 04:12:54,670
I've heard some news about Hamada as well.

6509
04:12:55,040 --> 04:12:58,010
Apparently, the other day, it was about a mask...

6510
04:12:58,580 --> 04:13:22,770

04:13:01,010 --> 04:13:02,910
and he was looking everywhere for his mask  but it was on his chin

6514
04:13:02,910 --> 04:13:05,550
and he was looking everywhere for his mask  but it was on his chin

6515
04:13:05,550 --> 04:13:10,420
and he kept on looking for it, and his juniors didn't want to embarrass him

6516
04:13:10,890 --> 04:13:12,660
so they couldn't bring themselves to just tell him, but eventually

6517
04:13:12,890 --> 04:13:13,720
they said, "Sorry Hamada-san, but it's on your chin." And he replied

6518
04:13:13,720 --> 04:13:16,960
they said, "Sorry Hamada-san, but it's on your chin." And he replied

6519
04:13:17,360 --> 04:13:18,160
"I ain't got any feeling in my chin"  or some rubbish like that

6520
04:13:18,160 --> 04:13:19,830
"I ain't got any feeling in my chin"  or some rubbish like that

6521
04:13:19,830 --> 04:13:22,670
"I ain't got any feeling in my chin"  or some rubbish like that

6522
04:13:31,070 --> 04:13:32,340
What a stupid reason...

6523
04:13:34,640 --> 04:13:36,110
I heard something too, that he's the type of guy

6524
04:13:36,110 --> 04:13:38,520
who worries a lot, even though he looks like that...

6525
04:13:38,650 --> 04:13:40,650
I actually heard this from his wife

6526
04:13:38,680 --> 04:13:46,520
Ogawa Natsumi

6527
04:13:38,680 --> 04:13:46,520
Supplier of information

6528
04:13:38,720 --> 04:14:11,250
About him worrying

6529
04:13:38,720 --> 04:14:11,250
Hamada Masatoshi information

6530
04:13:40,850 --> 04:13:43,720
When he went out with his son,  he called her and said,

6531
04:13:43,720 --> 04:13:46,520
When he went out with his son, he called her and said,

6532
04:13:46,520 --> 04:13:48,430
"He wants to go to the park...  Is that okay?"

6533
04:13:48,430 --> 04:13:50,490
"He wants to go to the park... Is that okay?"

6534
04:13:53,260 --> 04:13:54,530
"He's just gone on  the jungle gym...  is that okay?"

6535
04:13:54,530 --> 04:13:56,230
"He's just gone on the jungle gym...  is that okay?"

6536
04:13:56,230 --> 04:13:59,400
"He's just gone on the jungle gym... is that okay?"

6537
04:13:59,440 --> 04:14:02,210
And when he got home, apparently they have 3 poodles,

6538
04:14:02,310 --> 04:14:06,110
but one of his poodles' ears is droopy, so he said to this one...

6539
04:14:06,110 --> 04:14:07,940
"Only your ear is droopy...  is that okay?"

6540
04:14:07,940 --> 04:14:11,250
"Only your ear is droopy... is that okay?"

6541
04:14:10,180 --> 04:14:11,950
You're taking the piss!

6542
04:14:18,960 --> 04:14:20,460
But that's information from his wife, right?

6543
04:14:19,890 --> 04:14:22,090
That obviously isn't true!!

6544
04:14:23,930 --> 04:14:26,500
It must be true if she told you...

6545
04:14:26,230 --> 04:14:27,700
That must be true.

6546
04:14:27,700 --> 04:14:30,430
I guess that's his nature...

6547
04:14:30,970 --> 04:14:32,770
Tsukomi people are meant to be the ones who make   things right so they shouldn't really be like that...

6548
04:14:32,770 --> 04:14:34,300
Tsukomi people are meant to be the ones who make things right so they shouldn't really be like that...

6549
04:14:34,300 --> 04:14:35,740
About Jinnai Tomonori...

6550
04:14:36,510 --> 04:14:37,810
I've got some information about him...

6551
04:14:38,540 --> 04:14:40,840
Apparently he took up jogging up for a while.

6552
04:14:41,180 --> 04:14:44,310
He was running with Yagi (Masumi) of Savanna (comedy group), who's his junior

6553
04:14:41,210 --> 04:15:02,830
Spontaneous moment

6554
04:14:41,210 --> 04:15:02,830
Jinnai Tomonori information

6555
04:14:45,520 --> 04:14:46,650
and together

6556
04:14:46,650 --> 04:14:49,750
they were running in Osaka Castle Park

6557
04:14:49,750 --> 04:14:51,220
But as soon as theystarted, he said, "My knee really hurts"

6558
04:14:51,220 --> 04:14:52,390
But as soon as they started, he said,  "My knee really hurts"

6559
04:14:52,390 --> 04:14:54,190
But as soon they started, he said  "My knee really hurts"

6560
04:14:54,190 --> 04:14:58,160
And they're wondering, "Why does it hurt? We've only just started running."

6561
04:14:58,190 --> 04:14:59,530
When they looked down at his feet, he was wearing leather boots

6562
04:14:59,530 --> 04:15:02,830
When they looked down at his feet,  he was wearing leather boots

6563
04:15:08,240 --> 04:15:09,270
For real?!

6564
04:15:13,740 --> 04:15:14,480
Right, who's next?

6565
04:15:16,580 --> 04:15:20,250
It's about a man called Endo Shozo, is that ok?

6566
04:15:21,350 --> 04:15:22,720
He really loves  his sex toys

6567
04:15:22,720 --> 04:15:25,560
He really loves  his sex toys

6568
04:15:25,560 --> 04:15:26,860
He went around loads of shops looking for sex toys

6569
04:15:25,760 --> 04:15:52,180
Endo Shozo Information

6570
04:15:25,760 --> 04:15:52,180
Loves his sex toys

6571
04:15:26,860 --> 04:15:29,560
He went around loads of shops looking for sex toys

6572
04:15:29,860 --> 04:15:30,860
But lately...

6573
04:15:30,960 --> 04:15:32,330
He found out that the stuff at Donkey Hote   are really good

6574
04:15:32,330 --> 04:15:35,600
He found out that the stuff at Donkey Hote  are really good

6575
04:15:35,600 --> 04:15:40,400
So he buys his sex toys there, and he buys so much; he's really embarrassed about it

6576
04:15:40,770 --> 04:15:43,270
so he puts the goods in  among his golf stuff

6577
04:15:43,270 --> 04:15:45,210
so he puts the goods among his golf stuff

6578
04:15:45,210 --> 04:15:48,140
so he doesn't get noticed at the checkout counter

6579
04:15:48,140 --> 04:15:48,550
and he goes  3 times a week!!

6580
04:15:48,550 --> 04:15:52,180
and he goes 3 times a week!!

6581
04:15:58,590 --> 04:15:59,460
What a bad habit...

6582
04:16:00,590 --> 04:16:01,730
Are there no more stories?

6583
04:16:01,990 --> 04:16:03,630
I have one about Matsumoto...

6584
04:16:02,890 --> 04:16:21,540
When I go to the dressing room...

Matsumoto Hitoshi information

6586
04:16:03,760 --> 04:16:05,200
There are a lot of times, when you know...

6587
04:16:05,200 --> 04:16:07,430
I'm on a program with him so I go and just greet him

6588
04:16:07,560 --> 04:16:08,630
but usually...

6589
04:16:08,670 --> 04:16:10,270
He wears a white shirt,  V neck,  and his muscles are just amazing!!

6590
04:16:10,270 --> 04:16:11,430
He wears a white shirt, V neck  and his muscles are just amazing!!

6591
04:16:11,430 --> 04:16:13,300
He wears a white shirt, V neck  and his muscles are just amazing!!

6592
04:16:13,300 --> 04:16:14,300
He's hench (buff),and because he's got dark skin and he's got a white shirt on

6593
04:16:14,300 --> 04:16:16,040
He's hench (buff), and because he's got dark skin  and he's got a white shirt on

6594
04:16:16,040 --> 04:16:17,610
He's hench (buff), and because he's got dark skin and he's got a white shirt on

6595
04:16:17,610 --> 04:16:18,240
He really looks like a porn star about to do a video

6596
04:16:18,240 --> 04:16:21,540
He really looks like a porn star about to do a video

6597
04:16:24,510 --> 04:16:26,120
He is really dark though...

6598
04:16:27,520 --> 04:16:28,590
I don't look like that, you dick.

6599
04:16:32,390 --> 04:16:33,360
He really does look it...

6600
04:16:33,520 --> 04:16:35,090
It's about like,

6601
04:16:35,130 --> 04:16:37,530
before he got so big and hench...

6602
04:16:37,530 --> 04:16:42,630
He wanted to go to the gym basically, and he had a bit of muscle...

6603
04:16:39,860 --> 04:16:59,480
A Macho story

6604
04:16:39,860 --> 04:16:59,480
Matsumoto Hitoshi Information

6605
04:16:43,170 --> 04:16:46,000
I asked him, "Bro, when do you go to the gym?"

6606
04:16:46,170 --> 04:16:48,000
And he answered, "Well, basically...

6607
04:16:48,270 --> 04:16:50,670
when I fight with my wife, and I'm annoyed,  then I go to the gym in my house."

6608
04:16:50,670 --> 04:16:52,840
when I fight with my wife, and I'm annoyed, then I go to the gym in my house."

6609
04:16:52,840 --> 04:16:55,250
when I fight with my wife  and I'm annoyed, then I go to the gym in my house."

6610
04:16:55,250 --> 04:16:56,350
And you know, he's massive now, right?  They're going to get divorced, aren't they!?

6611
04:16:56,350 --> 04:16:59,480
And you know, he's massive now, right?  They're going to get divorced, aren't they!?

6612
04:17:01,220 --> 04:17:02,420
Well yeah, if he trains that much!

6613
04:17:10,790 --> 04:17:13,300
It has got nothing to do with his muscles, but...

6614
04:17:14,000 --> 04:17:16,670
It has got nothing to do with his muscles, but...

6615
04:17:17,530 --> 04:17:19,940
There was like a house party  at the Matsumotos...

6616
04:17:20,240 --> 04:17:21,740
It was about 2 years ago...

6617
04:17:20,300 --> 04:17:58,270
At the House Party...

6618
04:17:20,300 --> 04:17:58,270
Matsumoto Hitoshi information

6619
04:17:21,870 --> 04:17:24,310
There was a conversation about Matsumoto-san and his wife...

6620
04:17:24,310 --> 04:17:27,510
It might just be hilarious for me but...

6621
04:17:28,340 --> 04:17:29,350
basically his hands were di.rty..

6622
04:17:29,350 --> 04:17:32,250
He said, "Do we have any like moist hand towels?"

6623
04:17:32,250 --> 04:17:35,350
and his wife replied "Sorry" and he said, "Yeah, just anything like a moist towel or something..."

6624
04:17:35,920 --> 04:17:40,960
so she was like "A moist towel?"... so he replied "Yeah, you know, something wet, I want to wipe off my hands."

6625
04:17:41,320 --> 04:17:44,360
and she replied, "We don't have any moist hand towels..."

6626
04:17:44,360 --> 04:17:45,430
"No no, not like that, just something to wipe off my hands with  a towel will do..."

6627
04:17:45,430 --> 04:17:46,500
"No no, not like that, just something to wipe off my hands with,  a towel will do..."

6628
04:17:46,500 --> 04:17:49,430
"No no, not like that, just something to wipe off my hands with, a towel will do..."

6629
04:17:49,930 --> 04:17:50,870
We don't have any  moist towels,  sorry

6630
04:17:50,870 --> 04:17:51,600
We don't have any moist towels,  sorry

6631
04:17:51,600 --> 04:17:53,470
We don't have any moist towels, sorry.

6632
04:17:53,470 --> 04:17:56,510
and he was like "Grrr..." Anyway that's what happened...

6633
04:18:02,550 --> 04:18:03,750
It was so funny...

6634
04:18:05,580 --> 04:18:06,480
I thought he was going to get really mad

6635
04:18:07,020 --> 04:18:08,050
Yeah, me too...

6636
04:18:08,280 --> 04:18:10,620
I can understand if it was towards a junior...

6637
04:18:10,650 --> 04:18:13,960
I was scared for her but he just kind of accepted it...

6638
04:18:14,790 --> 04:18:16,390
Obviously, he's going to go train his muscles then...

6639
04:18:16,390 --> 04:18:18,900
Yeah, if that happens, all you can do is go to the gym

6640
04:18:19,160 --> 04:18:21,430
I can't really explain this next one but...

6641
04:18:22,570 --> 04:18:26,340
It's about Tanaka Naoki...

6642
04:18:26,470 --> 04:18:29,610
When we're on the same program and our dressing rooms are like next to each other...

6643
04:18:26,540 --> 04:18:45,320
Tanaka Naoki Information

6644
04:18:26,540 --> 04:18:45,320
In the dressing room...

6645
04:18:29,670 --> 04:18:32,240
When he comes to greet me, he gets so happy  when I'm standing really close to the door

6646
04:18:32,240 --> 04:18:33,910
When he comes to greet me,  he gets so happy when I'm standing really close to the door

6647
04:18:33,910 --> 04:18:35,580
When he comes to greet me,  he gets so happy  when I'm standing really close to the door

6648
04:18:35,580 --> 04:18:38,450
So every time we are

6649
04:18:38,480 --> 04:18:40,120
on the same program,  just for Tanaka...  I stand really close to the door

6650
04:18:40,120 --> 04:18:42,150
on the same program, just for Tanaka... I stand really close to the door

6651
04:18:42,150 --> 04:18:45,320
on the same program, just for Tanaka...  I stand really close to the door

6652
04:18:51,530 --> 04:18:53,260
You shouldn't encourage that kind of behaviour...

6653
04:18:54,800 --> 04:18:56,000
But he gets so happy...

6654
04:18:55,900 --> 04:18:57,430
He goes, "Oh you're so close to the door" and he gets so happy

6655
04:18:59,500 --> 04:19:01,000
About Tanaka Naoki, basically...

6656
04:19:01,040 --> 04:19:03,970
He really loves  Mitarashi Dangos (type of food)

6657
04:19:09,850 --> 04:19:13,350
You don't need to tell people that...

6658
04:19:17,120 --> 04:19:17,990
Are we all done?

6659
04:19:18,820 --> 04:19:21,290
Okay guys, we are running out of time...

6660
04:19:22,190 --> 04:19:23,330
I have information on Miyasako Hiroyuki...

6661
04:19:24,490 --> 04:19:26,360
It's about Miyasako Hiroyuki...

6662
04:19:26,930 --> 04:19:32,340
So basically Matsumoto Hitoshi and Miyasako Hiroyuki were on the same program...

6663
04:19:32,570 --> 04:19:33,670
and after they finished with their show,  we agreed that I would come with them  to dinner

6664
04:19:33,670 --> 04:19:34,540
and after they finished with their show, we agreed that I would come with them to dinner

6665
04:19:34,540 --> 04:19:38,370
and after they finished with their show, we agreed that I would come with them to dinner

6666
04:19:38,370 --> 04:19:40,280
Matsumoto Hitoshi asked me "Mimata, what have you  done on TV lately?"

6667
04:19:38,740 --> 04:19:52,390
Miyasako Hiroyuki information

6668
04:19:38,740 --> 04:19:52,390
When they were drinking...

6669
04:19:40,280 --> 04:19:41,740
Matsumoto Hitoshi asked me "Mimata, what have you done on TV lately?"

6670
04:19:41,740 --> 04:19:46,250
Matsumoto Hitoshi asked me "Mimata, what have you done on TV lately?"

6671
04:19:46,250 --> 04:19:48,450
It's not really amazing, but for the first time,  they let me be a chairman

6672
04:19:48,450 --> 04:19:48,990
It's not really amazing, but for the first time,  they let me be a chairman

6673
04:19:48,990 --> 04:19:52,390
It's not really amazing, but for the first time, they let me be a chairman

6674
04:19:52,390 --> 04:21:03,330
Miyasako Hiroyuki information

6675
04:19:52,390 --> 04:21:03,330
While drinking...

6676
04:19:52,790 --> 04:19:55,360
So he asked me "Wow, which program was it?"

6677
04:19:55,560 --> 04:19:56,060
So I answered  "The National Squirting Competition"

6678
04:19:56,060 --> 04:19:59,660
So I answered "The National Squirting Competition"

6679
04:19:59,700 --> 04:20:01,530
So 3 female pornstars came and you know...

6680
04:20:01,830 --> 04:20:03,530
I was there with my stopwatch and...

6681
04:20:03,700 --> 04:20:05,340
I had to see who could squirt the most times in an allocated time,  that's basically what the program is about

6682
04:20:05,340 --> 04:20:06,040
I had to see who could squirt the most times in an allocated time,  that's basically what the program is about

6683
04:20:06,040 --> 04:20:09,540
I had to see who could squirt the most times in an allocated time, that's basically what the program is about

6684
04:20:09,540 --> 04:20:13,140
and he (Matsumoto) answered "Jesus! Is there such a program on TV?!"

6685
04:20:13,540 --> 04:20:15,850
Anyway, eventually Matsumoto Hitoshi went home

6686
04:20:16,410 --> 04:20:18,980
So it was just Miyasako Hiroyuki and I now...

6687
04:20:19,050 --> 04:20:22,490
and he said, "I was laughing before because big bro was there and all...

6688
04:20:23,250 --> 04:20:23,720
but being on some program called  'The National Squirting Competition'...

6689
04:20:23,720 --> 04:20:26,760
but being on some program called 'The National Squirting Competition'...

6690
04:20:26,820 --> 04:20:28,160
like taking a job like that... I mean...

6691
04:20:28,460 --> 04:20:30,530
The money might be good,  but you've got to have courage to say no to those dodgy programs"

6692
04:20:30,530 --> 04:20:33,600
The money might be good, but you've got to have courage to say no to those dodgy programs"

6693
04:20:33,730 --> 04:20:35,830
and so you know, I felt bad and apologised to him

6694
04:20:36,470 --> 04:20:41,300
anyway, the atmosphere got a bit weird so Miyasako was nice and said

6695
04:20:41,570 --> 04:20:43,870
"There's no point just us drinking alone;  I'm going to call up some girls"

6696
04:20:43,870 --> 04:20:46,680
"There's no point just us drinking alone; I'm going to call up some girls"

6697
04:20:46,940 --> 04:20:49,650
30 to 40 minutes later, a girl appeared...

6698
04:20:49,880 --> 04:20:51,310
Coincidentally, the WINNER of "The National Squirting Competition" came

6699
04:20:51,310 --> 04:20:52,620
Coincidentally,  the WINNER of "The National Squirting Competition" came

6700
04:20:52,620 --> 04:20:54,550
Coincidentally, the WINNER of "The National Squirting Competition" came

6701
04:20:56,050 --> 04:20:56,590
Is there such a thing?   A miracle like this?

6702
04:20:56,590 --> 04:21:00,360
Is there such thing?  A miracle like this?

6703
04:21:00,390 --> 04:21:03,230
You idiot!

6704
04:21:15,170 --> 04:21:16,140
Just my name being in that story hurts...

6705
04:21:16,140 --> 04:21:19,280
Just my name being in that story hurts...

6706
04:21:21,510 --> 04:21:23,610
16 hours since the start...

6707
04:21:24,910 --> 04:21:26,080
The atmosphere had changed...

6708
04:21:26,950 --> 04:21:29,920
and the 5, who were past their limits now...

6709
04:21:30,890 --> 04:21:34,420
could not even salvage a conversation...

6710
04:21:37,690 --> 04:21:38,460
We were a mess...

6711
04:21:38,460 --> 04:21:40,130
Well yeah, by this time...

6712
04:21:39,800 --> 04:21:40,660
When suddenly...

6713
04:21:46,200 --> 04:21:49,070
Gasu Earth Defense Force

6714
04:21:46,200 --> 04:21:49,070
Nursery

6715
04:21:50,370 --> 04:21:52,440
At Gasu Earth Defence Force

6716
04:21:50,510 --> 04:21:57,510
A nursery for all the female team members  with children

6717
04:21:52,540 --> 04:21:57,180
there is a nursery for all the female members of the force with children

6718
04:21:58,310 --> 04:22:03,890
and a lot of the children are taken care of here by our nurses

6719
04:21:58,550 --> 04:22:04,590
special nurses

6720
04:21:58,550 --> 04:22:04,590
The infants  are taken care  by the

6721
04:22:05,150 --> 04:22:11,130
There is an expert member

6722
04:22:05,150 --> 04:22:11,130
who knows everything about infants!

6723
04:22:05,320 --> 04:22:11,360
And out of them, there is someone who knows everything on the development of infants, and that is

6724
04:22:11,490 --> 04:22:17,400

Mother Jimmy-san...

6727
04:22:17,400 --> 04:22:19,000
There are a lot of children today  who require your attention.

6728
04:22:19,000 --> 04:22:21,340
There are a lot of children today who require your attention.

6729
04:22:22,040 --> 04:22:23,970
I understand. Well then,

6730
04:22:24,140 --> 04:22:25,880

6731
04:22:28,380 --> 04:22:29,710

This is so ridiculous...

6766
04:24:36,240 --> 04:24:38,540

04:25:55,650 --> 04:25:57,750
They were like a dream team...

6787
04:25:57,920 --> 04:26:00,490
It's the first time they were together in something, right?

6788
04:25:59,060 --> 04:26:00,490
Yeah, it was.

6789
04:26:00,490 --> 04:26:01,260
Is it?

6790
04:26:00,920 --> 04:26:02,360
Two big stars...

6791
04:26:07,730 --> 04:26:08,360

6849
04:28:32,540 --> 04:28:35,580
If you combine our ages, we are  100 years old!!

6850
04:28:33,710 --> 04:28:34,440
Yeah, seriously...

6851
04:28:35,710 --> 04:28:36,310
We understand...

6852
04:28:36,310 --> 04:28:40,620
What are you laughing at?

6853
04:28:38,380 --> 04:28:40,250
We're not laughing

6854
04:28:39,220 --> 04:28:40,280
We would never...

6855
04:28:40,620 --> 04:28:42,380
The game might allow you to laugh but  we don't allow you to!!

6856
04:28:42,380 --> 04:28:43,450
The game might allow you  to laugh but  we don't allow you to!!

6857
04:28:43,450 --> 04:28:46,720
The game might allow you to laugh but we don't allow you to!!

6858
04:28:46,790 --> 04:28:48,490
Matsumoto-san, you're so strict...

6859
04:28:48,720 --> 04:28:51,630
You're only just 100 years old together, you know?

6860
04:28:49,790 --> 04:28:51,130
Just 100...

6861
04:28:50,260 --> 04:28:51,990
Oh God, here we go again...

6862
04:28:51,990 --> 04:28:54,130
Oh jeez... This is bad...

6863
04:28:52,530 --> 04:28:58,870
Scenery has changed

6864
04:28:55,060 --> 04:28:56,570
I think you should go to the front...

6865
04:28:56,570 --> 04:28:57,870
Tanaka is so...

6866
04:28:56,900 --> 04:28:58,670
You go to the front...

6867
04:28:58,970 --> 04:28:59,770
I guess...

6868
04:28:59,440 --> 04:29:00,840
You'll fall on us otherwise...

6869
04:29:00,100 --> 04:29:02,670
You know, when something happens, you fall like this...

6870
04:29:03,840 --> 04:29:04,970
I really don't want to hurt  the either of you

6871
04:29:04,970 --> 04:29:09,150
I really don't want to hurt the either of you

6872
04:29:07,040 --> 04:29:09,110
There are signs telling you which way to go so...

6873
04:29:09,310 --> 04:29:10,480
This is too much...

6874
04:29:09,350 --> 04:29:13,180
2nd floor

6875
04:29:09,980 --> 04:29:14,920
Secret trap

6876
04:29:12,010 --> 04:29:14,550
What was that, I felt something...

6877
04:29:14,580 --> 04:29:15,720
Yeah, you're right...

6878
04:29:16,120 --> 04:29:16,790
Rubbish bin

6879
04:29:16,490 --> 04:29:17,120
What is that?

6880
04:29:16,790 --> 04:29:17,250
Rubbish bin

6881
04:29:17,250 --> 04:29:19,120
Rubbish bin

6882
04:29:17,590 --> 04:29:18,350
Holy shit!

6883
04:29:23,530 --> 04:29:27,760
The rubbish bin exploded

6884
04:29:26,000 --> 04:29:26,960
What the hell?

6885
04:29:26,860 --> 04:29:27,860
No way... no way!

6886
04:29:27,860 --> 04:29:29,330
Obviously I'm going to be scared...

6887
04:29:28,600 --> 04:29:29,230
This is   too intense!!

6888
04:29:29,230 --> 04:29:32,000
This is too intense!!

6889
04:29:29,770 --> 04:29:31,270
There's another one here...

6890
04:29:31,270 --> 04:29:33,170
They've gone full out from the start..

6891
04:29:32,000 --> 04:29:32,870
Tanaka, it's dangerous here,  let's go

6892
04:29:32,870 --> 04:29:33,400
Tanaka, it's dangerous here, let's go

6893
04:29:33,400 --> 04:29:35,500
Tanaka, it's dangerous here, let's go

6894
04:29:35,600 --> 04:29:36,640
Wait a second, wait a second, wait, wait

6895
04:29:36,640 --> 04:29:37,370
Wait a second, wait a second,wait, wait

6896
04:29:37,370 --> 04:29:39,140
Wait a second, wait a second, wait, wait

6897
04:29:38,840 --> 04:29:40,310
Wait a second, wait a second, wait, wait

6898
04:29:40,810 --> 04:29:43,910
Downtown alone together

6899
04:29:41,480 --> 04:29:43,750
Meanwhile, Dowtown were...

6900
04:29:44,480 --> 04:29:45,010
It's ridiculous how I'm the only one who has to  wear a bloody wig

6901
04:29:45,010 --> 04:29:46,650
It's ridiculous how I'm the only one who has to wear a bloody wig

6902
04:29:46,650 --> 04:29:49,790
It's ridiculous how I'm the only one who has to  wear a bloody wig

6903
04:29:50,150 --> 04:29:50,420
I think if you really hated it that much, you would have told the staff by now?

6904
04:29:50,890 --> 04:29:55,490
I think if you really hated it that much  you would have said it to the stabb by now?

6905
04:29:52,320 --> 04:29:55,490
I think if you really hated it that much, you would have said it to the staff by now?

6906
04:29:56,560 --> 04:29:59,160
You know, if I told them something like that

6907
04:30:00,030 --> 04:30:02,330
It's like I'm saying a selfish thing

6908
04:30:02,900 --> 04:30:05,800
On the other hand, you say whatever you want to  about other stuff, right?

6909
04:30:05,800 --> 04:30:11,610
I mean, about that skirt and that wig... you don't say a thing

6910
04:30:07,370 --> 04:30:11,610
I mean, about that skirt and that wig... you don't say a thing

6911
04:30:09,170 --> 04:30:11,610
I mean, about that skirt and that wig... you don't say a thing

6912
04:30:11,840 --> 04:30:14,480
It seems like you accepted them...

6913
04:30:14,710 --> 04:30:17,850
So if this had been prepared for you to wear?

6914
04:30:17,850 --> 04:30:19,320
I think that's probably impossible

6915
04:30:19,320 --> 04:30:21,150
Right?

6916
04:30:19,780 --> 04:30:21,150
Yeah...

6917
04:30:21,150 --> 04:30:24,490
That's not my character, duh!!

6918
04:30:27,260 --> 04:30:27,890
That's actually

6919
04:30:27,890 --> 04:30:32,530
The message is completely different

6920
04:30:28,920 --> 04:30:32,530
The message is completely different

6921
04:30:30,660 --> 04:30:32,530
What are you on about?

6922
04:30:32,630 --> 04:30:35,430
The arrival of the three wanderers at the armory

6923
04:30:32,900 --> 04:30:40,340
Armory

6924
04:30:35,460 --> 04:30:37,370
Isn't this?

6925
04:30:37,370 --> 04:30:39,240
Isn't this the armory?

6926
04:30:38,330 --> 04:30:39,240
Yeah, it is

6927
04:30:39,240 --> 04:30:41,100
A ray gun... Ah! Here it is

6928
04:30:41,500 --> 04:30:47,810
Ray gun taken: proceeding searching Fujiwara

6929
04:30:41,870 --> 04:30:46,540
Having grabbed their ray gun, they leave the armory

6930
04:30:51,880 --> 04:30:56,650
Skit in ... seconds

6931
04:30:52,280 --> 04:30:54,780
Ugh... That's creepy...

6932
04:30:57,020 --> 04:30:58,650
Are you okay, Tanaka?

6933
04:31:01,820 --> 04:31:04,830
Morohoshi Kazumi during a live?

6934
04:31:06,760 --> 04:31:13,370
A mysterious masked group attacks

6935
04:31:23,050 --> 04:31:27,920
The Live performances also strikes the training room

6936
04:31:28,080 --> 04:31:32,090
What the..?

6937
04:31:29,420 --> 04:31:31,920
Enough!!

6938
04:31:32,660 --> 04:31:35,420
This startled me so much!

6939
04:31:36,190 --> 04:31:38,860
They piss me off...

6940
04:31:39,560 --> 04:31:41,030
No, again?!

6941
04:31:40,430 --> 04:31:42,330
Ehh? Wait a second

6942
04:31:41,030 --> 04:31:43,230
Are we  hostages again?

6943
04:31:43,770 --> 04:31:50,870
They have been taken to the confinement room

6944
04:31:43,770 --> 04:31:50,870
They have been taken to the confinement room

6945
04:31:48,640 --> 04:31:50,540
I hate this part...

6946
04:31:52,110 --> 04:31:56,050
Huh!?

6947
04:31:53,080 --> 04:31:56,050
Enough of this!

6948
04:31:56,350 --> 04:31:58,950
Ugh, this again?

6949
04:32:01,920 --> 04:32:07,920
A giant piece of paper is placed

6950
04:32:15,200 --> 04:32:19,870
~Origami~ Shouji Tomoharu

6951
04:32:15,200 --> 04:32:19,870
~Origami~ Shouji Tomoharu

6952
04:32:16,600 --> 04:32:19,700
Wow, Shouji was there?

6953
04:32:44,260 --> 04:32:46,400
Just do it normally

6954
04:32:46,400 --> 04:32:48,730
You can just do it normally, right?

6955
04:33:05,980 --> 04:33:08,820
There's something ghastly in him

6956
04:33:22,730 --> 04:33:24,330
Wow the Origami suddenly  skipped a few stages...

6957
04:33:28,300 --> 04:33:31,210
This must have been so tough to watch...

6958
04:33:32,110 --> 04:33:34,840
It was so long...

6959
04:33:33,910 --> 04:33:34,840
Ye I bet...

6960
04:33:34,840 --> 04:33:38,210
I bet it lasted ages...

6961
04:33:36,510 --> 04:33:38,210
It was awful

6962
04:33:41,820 --> 04:33:44,990
I guess he thought about this long and hard...

6963
04:33:44,020 --> 04:33:44,990
Mhh...

6964
04:33:48,820 --> 04:33:50,990
Abenomics

6965
04:33:48,820 --> 04:33:50,990
Abenomics

6966
04:33:55,300 --> 04:33:57,500
You're an idiot, aren't you?

6967
04:33:57,770 --> 04:34:01,370
The crane he made couldn't even stand up

6968
04:33:59,230 --> 04:34:01,370
The crane he made couldn't even stand up

6969
04:34:02,970 --> 04:34:04,840
Let us free!

6970
04:34:08,710 --> 04:34:10,650
Louis Kurihara's dance...?

6971
04:34:08,710 --> 04:34:13,420
"Because the next performance takes some time to be prepared, please enjoy Kurihara Lui's dancing in the meanwhile."

6972
04:34:10,650 --> 04:34:12,580
For real?

6973
04:34:11,210 --> 04:34:12,580
Eh?

6974
04:34:12,780 --> 04:34:16,080
I wonder if he can dance

6975
04:34:18,350 --> 04:34:19,960
Can you actually dance?

6976
04:34:20,960 --> 04:34:25,930
~Original Dance~ Kurihara Lui

6977
04:34:20,960 --> 04:34:25,930
~Original Dance~ Kurihara Lui

6978
04:34:24,290 --> 04:34:25,930
An Original Dance

6979
04:34:30,300 --> 04:34:31,430
Creepy creepy creepy!

6980
04:34:31,430 --> 04:34:33,400
Scary!!

6981
04:34:33,400 --> 04:34:35,740
What kind of dance is this?

6982
04:34:36,140 --> 04:34:38,710
What's this?!

6983
04:34:36,970 --> 04:34:38,710
This dance is quite creepy...

6984
04:34:38,710 --> 04:34:40,640
Creepy!

6985
04:34:39,410 --> 04:34:40,640
Lui-kun, Lui-kun

6986
04:34:40,810 --> 04:34:44,650
Lui-kun, what's wrong buddy?

6987
04:34:53,420 --> 04:34:54,660
Woah! That's scary!

6988
04:35:02,870 --> 04:35:04,930
What just happened?

6989
04:35:05,170 --> 04:35:07,270
That's how he moves, huh?

6990
04:35:09,610 --> 04:35:12,840
The three, who were meant to find and rescue Fujiwara

6991
04:35:11,910 --> 04:35:15,740
The three are imprisoned...

6992
04:35:11,910 --> 04:35:15,740
The three are imprisoned...

6993
04:35:12,740 --> 04:35:15,740
End up being caught themselves

6994
04:35:27,790 --> 04:35:33,200
You two from Downtown
I have some bad news for you two

6995
04:35:33,360 --> 04:35:38,930
Tsukitei-san and CoCUrico-san have been
taken as hostages by my subordinates

6996
04:35:35,700 --> 04:35:38,930
Tsukitei-san and CoCUrico-san have been
taken as hostages by my subordinates

6997
04:35:36,830 --> 04:35:38,930
Tsukitei-san and CoCUrico-san have been
taken as hostages by my subordinates

6998
04:35:39,000 --> 04:35:43,040
It's a task for you two from Downtown
to go find the other three

6999
04:35:43,040 --> 04:35:47,040
Reunite and all together
Go and try to save Fujiwara-san

7000
04:35:47,210 --> 04:35:49,440
Well then, Good Luck!

7001
04:35:49,780 --> 04:35:51,650
Oh... ho... ho... ho...

7002
04:35:52,350 --> 04:35:56,080
She said that CoCUrico-san has been caught too.

7003
04:35:53,680 --> 04:35:56,080
She said that CoCUrico-san has been caught too.

7004
04:35:56,080 --> 04:35:57,190
Shall we go?

7005
04:35:57,620 --> 04:36:04,190
Stopping by the armory, then to the rescue of the three prisoners!

7006
04:35:58,150 --> 04:36:00,920
Now is time for Downtown to head to the armory

7007
04:36:00,920 --> 04:36:02,360
And after that

7008
04:36:02,360 --> 04:36:04,190
They're going to rescue the other three!!

7009
04:36:05,860 --> 04:36:08,060
This is so bloody annoying...

7010
04:36:08,360 --> 04:36:13,270
..seconds to CO2 gas spray

7011
04:36:08,360 --> 04:36:13,270
..seconds to CO2 gas spray

7012
04:36:16,810 --> 04:36:18,640
Woah!

7013
04:36:22,540 --> 04:36:26,880
I wish they would stop doing that

7014
04:36:22,910 --> 04:36:26,880
Defense Force - 3rd Floor

7015
04:36:27,180 --> 04:36:31,450
It would be nice if they would stop selling CO2 gas to the staff here

7016
04:36:27,850 --> 04:36:31,450
It would be nice if they would stop selling CO2 gas to the staff here

7017
04:36:31,450 --> 04:36:32,990
The company themselves, right!!

7018
04:36:31,950 --> 04:36:32,990
Right, right, right...

7019
04:36:33,620 --> 04:36:35,160
Stay close to me...

7020
04:36:33,620 --> 04:36:38,490
.... Seconds to next prank

7021
04:36:33,620 --> 04:36:38,490
.... Seconds to next prank

7022
04:36:35,290 --> 04:36:42,560
Defense Force - 2nd Floor

7023
04:36:38,730 --> 04:36:40,660
What's that?

04:42:13,300 --> 04:42:15,700
Do your best! Do your best! Do your best!

7209
04:42:13,630 --> 04:42:15,700
Do your best! Do your best! Do your best!

7210
04:42:13,960 --> 04:42:15,700
Do my best?

7211
04:42:15,760 --> 04:42:17,770
Just go, go..

7212
04:42:16,400 --> 04:42:17,770
Come on, go...

7213
04:42:17,770 --> 04:42:18,930
Let's go...

7214
04:42:17,770 --> 04:42:18,930
You can do it!

7215
04:42:18,930 --> 04:42:20,370
He's funny...

7216
04:42:19,230 --> 04:42:20,370
He looks good

7217
04:42:20,600 --> 04:42:21,570
Awesome!

7218
04:42:22,440 --> 04:42:24,470
That surprised me!

7219
04:42:26,440 --> 04:42:31,980
Morohoshi Kazumi reappears

7220
04:42:31,480 --> 04:42:33,180
What the- Woah!

7221
04:42:32,010 --> 04:42:33,580
Bang

7222
04:42:32,010 --> 04:42:33,580
Bang

7223
04:42:34,050 --> 04:42:35,480
He has been shot!

7224
04:42:35,480 --> 04:42:37,550
Why things like that..?

7225
04:42:36,320 --> 04:42:39,150
Ka-kun... when it was his moment to shine..

7226
04:42:37,320 --> 04:42:39,150
Ka-kun... when it was his moment to shine...

7227
04:42:38,490 --> 04:42:40,120
He got shot...

7228
04:42:39,150 --> 04:42:39,920
He was just about to start singing

7229
04:42:39,920 --> 04:42:43,630
He was just about to start singing...

7230
04:42:43,890 --> 04:42:46,290
This way

7231
04:42:44,990 --> 04:42:46,290
Ehh? Enough of this...

7232
04:42:46,960 --> 04:42:47,860
Here, right?

7233
04:42:47,460 --> 04:42:49,130
Looks like it

7234
04:42:47,860 --> 04:42:49,130
I hope it's near

7235
04:42:49,130 --> 04:42:50,670
This way, come on

7236
04:42:49,430 --> 04:42:52,330
This year's is so long!

7237
04:42:52,970 --> 04:42:55,240
Ugh... there it is

7238
04:42:54,070 --> 04:42:55,240
Here's something!!

7239
04:42:54,740 --> 04:43:00,210
A representative must enter the phone box and wait for instructions!

7240
04:42:55,240 --> 04:42:57,740
"A representative must enter the phone box and wait for instructions!"

7241
04:42:55,870 --> 04:42:59,040
"A representative must enter the phone box and wait for instructions!"

7242
04:42:58,070 --> 04:43:00,210
Waiting for orders, uh?

7243
04:43:00,710 --> 04:43:01,680
Pay attention to Hosei

7244
04:43:01,510 --> 04:43:04,750
Pay attention to Hosei

7245
04:43:06,010 --> 04:43:07,350
No way, no way!

7246
04:43:06,880 --> 04:43:09,880
But you're our leader...

7247
04:43:07,350 --> 04:43:09,120
I don't want to, it's so scary!

7248
04:43:08,180 --> 04:43:14,860
The Junior's opinion: "Matsumoto should enter"

7249
04:43:09,020 --> 04:43:10,720
It's really scary, leader!

7250
04:43:10,720 --> 04:43:13,320
Do it for us, leader!

7251
04:43:12,250 --> 04:43:13,320
Please!

7252
04:43:13,320 --> 04:43:14,860
Please, leader!

7253
04:43:14,190 --> 04:43:14,860
Do it for us!

7254
04:43:15,990 --> 04:43:17,730
What the hell!!

7255
04:43:17,730 --> 04:43:20,700
Is it okay for you to go and wait for the instructions?

7256
04:43:19,060 --> 04:43:20,700
Is it okay for you to go and wait for the instructions?

7257
04:43:24,600 --> 04:43:28,040
I don't get at all why I'm the one who has to go

7258
04:43:25,800 --> 04:43:28,040
I don't get at all why I'm the one who has to go

7259
04:43:28,400 --> 04:43:30,610
Should we decide by rock-paper-scissor?

7260
04:43:30,110 --> 04:43:31,410
No, but-

7261
04:43:30,610 --> 04:43:33,270
Let's do this, shall we?

7262
04:43:31,270 --> 04:43:33,270
Let's do this, shall we?

7263
04:43:33,010 --> 04:43:34,710
That's what I said

7264
04:43:34,710 --> 04:43:36,080
Yeah, that's right

7265
04:43:34,940 --> 04:43:36,340
Just like I said!

7266
04:43:36,340 --> 04:43:38,280
We don't know what could happen...

7267
04:43:37,210 --> 04:43:38,610
You're right...

7268
04:43:38,280 --> 04:43:39,780
Well, okay okay okay...

7269
04:43:38,610 --> 04:43:44,790
Choosing the person who will enter by rock-paper-scissor

7270
04:43:38,910 --> 04:43:40,450
I guess this is a bit...

7271
04:43:40,450 --> 04:43:42,680
Right, Rock Paper Scissors then...

7272
04:43:40,680 --> 04:43:43,520
That's scary, though

7273
04:43:43,250 --> 04:43:44,220
Ok?

7274
04:43:43,520 --> 04:43:44,220
Yeah

7275
04:43:44,220 --> 04:43:45,320
Shall we start?

7276
04:43:44,950 --> 04:43:45,320
Yeah

7277
04:43:45,320 --> 04:43:47,620
Matsumoto Hamada Endo Tanaka Hosei

7278
04:43:47,620 --> 04:43:49,090
Sweet!

7279
04:43:48,020 --> 04:43:48,660
Ah! Endo!

7280
04:43:48,660 --> 04:43:49,690
Endo has been chosen!

7281
04:43:49,360 --> 04:43:50,130
Endo, you're going?

7282
04:43:50,130 --> 04:43:51,990
No no! I won, I'm out!

7283
04:43:52,090 --> 04:43:53,960
I'm out from this!

7284
04:43:52,630 --> 04:43:58,470
Don't be a party pooper... Are you really a member of this Earth Defense Force?!

7285
04:43:54,960 --> 04:43:58,470
Don't be a party pooper... Are you really a member of this Earth Defence Force?!

7286
04:43:55,900 --> 04:43:58,470
Don't be a party pooper... Are you really a member of this Earth Defence force?

7287
04:43:58,470 --> 04:44:00,000
What the hell!

7288
04:43:59,100 --> 04:44:04,310
It's so cold in here! Plus, we have to rescue Fujiwara!

7289
04:44:01,240 --> 04:44:04,310
It's so cold in here! Plus, we have to rescue Fujiwara!

7290
04:44:02,800 --> 04:44:04,310
Yeah, yeah, we have to save him!

7291
04:44:04,310 --> 04:44:07,540
I understand. After all, we are the Earth Defense Force, right?

7292
04:44:05,640 --> 04:44:07,540
I understand, After all, we are the Earth Defense Force, right?

7293
04:44:06,510 --> 04:44:07,540
Please, enter!

7294
04:44:07,780 --> 04:44:10,650
Ok, I'm going to wait for them!! (the instructions)

7295
04:44:16,380 --> 04:44:18,220
Scary...

7296
04:44:20,590 --> 04:44:25,490
... Seconds to prank

7297
04:44:20,590 --> 04:44:25,490
... Seconds to prank

7298
04:44:24,860 --> 04:44:26,530
Ask for instructions!

7299
04:44:25,560 --> 04:44:26,530
Yes?

7300
04:44:27,700 --> 04:44:31,230
Strong Wind from the receiver

7301
04:44:35,000 --> 04:44:35,540
Woah!!

7302
04:44:35,540 --> 04:44:36,240
Woah!!

7303
04:44:36,100 --> 04:44:42,010
A large quantity of white flour fell

7304
04:44:42,010 --> 04:44:43,950
Thank God!

7305
04:44:44,710 --> 04:44:46,210
Thank God!

7306
04:44:46,210 --> 04:44:48,980
I was so close to going in as well...

7307
04:44:48,980 --> 04:44:51,320
This is the worst...

7308
04:44:50,720 --> 04:44:54,890
You just became covered of pawdur!

7309
04:44:51,650 --> 04:44:54,890
You just became covered of pawdur!

7310
04:44:54,890 --> 04:44:56,830
What about the instructions?

7311
04:44:55,460 --> 04:44:56,830
What are the instructions?

7312
04:44:56,260 --> 04:45:00,330
There was nothing about instructions

7313
04:44:57,260 --> 04:44:58,130
Eh?!

7314
04:44:58,130 --> 04:45:00,330
I guess we just follow this path ahead then...

7315
04:45:00,560 --> 04:45:02,930
That was incredible, check this smell

7316
04:45:02,930 --> 04:45:05,000
Woah, awesome!

7317
04:45:03,930 --> 04:45:05,000
That was great

7318
04:45:05,000 --> 04:45:07,170
Wait just a sec...

7319
04:45:07,370 --> 04:45:09,500
He became covered of pawdur

7320
04:45:09,500 --> 04:45:12,410
The way he removed the flour...

7321
04:45:10,870 --> 04:45:12,410
Incredible, this high tension

7322
04:45:12,770 --> 04:45:15,080
You must not liked this, uh?

7323
04:45:13,840 --> 04:45:19,410
Sports Ground

7324
04:45:14,610 --> 04:45:17,210
It's ridiculously pitch black in here!!

7325
04:45:19,550 --> 04:45:21,150
What is that?

7326
04:45:21,150 --> 04:45:24,020
There are 5 of those...

7327
04:45:21,520 --> 04:45:26,860
Crucifiction stand for 5 people

7328
04:45:21,520 --> 04:45:26,860
Crucifiction standfor 5 people

7329
04:45:23,280 --> 04:45:24,020
Yes?

7330
04:45:24,720 --> 04:45:26,860
Ehhh?!

7331
04:45:25,850 --> 04:45:26,860
Eh? Enough of this!

7332
04:45:31,030 --> 04:45:38,370
Mysterious masked group attack

7333
04:45:38,370 --> 04:45:40,600
whatwhatwhatwhatwhatwhat

7334
04:45:40,840 --> 04:45:42,340
whatwhatwhatwhatwhatwhat

7335
04:45:47,980 --> 04:45:51,150
This has never happened before, what the hell?

7336
04:45:51,810 --> 04:45:53,620
What is this, what the hell!

7337
04:45:51,810 --> 04:45:58,390
The 5 have been crucified...

7338
04:45:51,810 --> 04:45:58,390
The 5 have been crucified...

7339
04:45:53,620 --> 04:45:54,920
What's that for?!

7340
04:45:54,280 --> 04:45:56,580
Did we do something bad to deserve this?

7341
04:45:56,580 --> 04:45:57,920
What the-?!

7342
04:45:57,920 --> 04:45:58,620
Eh?!

7343
04:45:58,590 --> 04:46:02,860

7344
04:45:58,590 --> 04:46:02,860
... Seconds to prank

7345
04:45:58,620 --> 04:46:00,090
This is way too cruel!

7346
04:46:00,090 --> 04:46:03,830
Really, too cruel!

7347
04:46:02,990 --> 04:46:03,830
Uhhh?!

7348
04:46:04,190 --> 04:46:05,890
Hey!

7349
04:46:13,470 --> 04:46:14,970
What is that?

7350
04:46:14,240 --> 04:46:15,940
What the-

7351
04:46:14,970 --> 04:46:17,370
Wait a second, what the hell...

7352
04:46:15,940 --> 04:46:18,440
Did we do something bad to deserve this?

7353
04:46:18,440 --> 04:46:20,380
What is that!

7354
04:46:19,670 --> 04:46:20,380
Eh?

7355
04:46:20,280 --> 04:46:23,810
This is way too cruel!

7356
04:46:20,280 --> 04:46:24,550
... Seconds to prank

7357
04:46:20,280 --> 04:46:24,550
... Seconds to prank

7358
04:46:21,810 --> 04:46:23,810
Really, too cruel!

7359
04:46:23,810 --> 04:46:25,310
They're saying something...

7360
04:46:24,680 --> 04:46:25,310
Eh?

7361
04:46:25,880 --> 04:46:27,580
Scary!

7362
04:46:27,820 --> 04:46:29,820
What is that thing?

7363
04:46:31,920 --> 04:46:33,890
What is coming out?

7364
04:46:41,430 --> 04:46:43,500
It's a rhinoceros beetle robot!!

7365
04:46:44,830 --> 04:46:53,610
A giant rhinoceros beetle robot

7366
04:46:44,830 --> 04:46:53,610
Invading Army's Combat Weapon:

7367
04:46:45,430 --> 04:46:48,340
What appeared unexpectedly before the eyes of the five members....

7368
04:46:48,340 --> 04:46:51,170
Is a 11 meters long and proud

7369
04:46:51,170 --> 04:46:53,840
Big, enormous rhinoceros beetle robot!

7370
04:46:54,640 --> 04:46:56,040
Woah, awesome!!

7371
04:46:55,610 --> 04:46:56,040
What should we do?

7372
04:46:56,040 --> 04:46:56,840
What should we do?

7373
04:46:56,840 --> 04:46:58,580
What should we do?

7374
04:46:58,980 --> 04:47:02,020
Ah! Mika-san is riding it!!

7375
04:47:00,620 --> 04:47:02,020
Woah! You're right!

7376
04:47:01,280 --> 04:47:02,020
Is this safe?

7377
04:47:02,020 --> 04:47:04,990
It's not Mika-san, it's Kyouko-san

7378
04:47:02,450 --> 04:47:04,920
That's amazing!

7379
04:47:05,490 --> 04:47:07,590
I'll crush you!!

7380
04:47:07,590 --> 04:47:09,920
Make it stop from doing those random movements!!

7381
04:47:09,320 --> 04:47:10,490
You idiot!

7382
04:47:10,490 --> 04:47:11,890
That's dangerous!

7383
04:47:11,860 --> 04:47:13,800
You're going to hell!

7384
04:47:14,530 --> 04:47:18,500
Can Mika-san actually see?

7385
04:47:15,860 --> 04:47:17,170
Yeah, seriously, can she?

7386
04:47:17,170 --> 04:47:19,470
This thing is drawing near!

7387
04:47:19,170 --> 04:47:25,510
A desperate situation: they're in a big pinch!

7388
04:47:19,170 --> 04:47:25,510
The Rhinoceros Beetle Robot draws near

7389
04:47:20,030 --> 04:47:22,540
The rhinoceros beetle robot draws near

7390
04:47:22,540 --> 04:47:25,510
A desperate situation: they're in a big pinch!

7391
04:47:25,570 --> 04:47:28,510
Hey, Shozo!!

7392
04:47:28,840 --> 04:47:31,710
Yatta-man? Is that Yatta-man?

7393
04:47:30,450 --> 04:47:31,710
Yatta-man? Is that Yatta-man?

7394
04:47:31,710 --> 04:47:32,980
Sorry we kept you waiting!!

7395
04:47:33,310 --> 04:47:40,020
We came from Toyonaka!

7396
04:47:35,020 --> 04:47:35,950
Endo~

7397
04:47:36,150 --> 04:47:36,990
Endo~

7398
04:47:37,120 --> 04:47:40,020
Endo-man!

7399
04:47:40,460 --> 04:47:44,990
The peace of our world is something Endo-man has to protect!

7400
04:47:42,260 --> 04:47:44,990
The peace of our world is something Endo-man has to protect!

7401
04:47:43,460 --> 04:47:44,990
The peace of our world is something Endo-man has to protect!

7402
04:47:45,190 --> 04:47:47,700
Endo Toshihide, 67 years old

7403
04:47:45,190 --> 04:47:53,740
Toshihide (67 years old)

7404
04:47:47,700 --> 04:47:50,670
Endo Kiyomi, 63 years old

7405
04:47:47,860 --> 04:47:53,740
Kiyomi (63 years old)

7406
04:47:50,670 --> 04:47:53,740
Endo-men are called on!!

7407
04:47:51,800 --> 04:47:53,740
Endo-men are called on!!

7408
04:47:51,800 --> 04:47:53,740
Endo-men are called on!!

7409
04:47:52,600 --> 04:47:54,600
How many bloody times do you want to appear?

7410
04:47:52,600 --> 04:47:54,600
What are they doing?

7411
04:47:54,600 --> 04:47:57,710
How many appearances are you going to make this year!!

7412
04:47:55,000 --> 04:47:57,710
How many appearances are you going to make this year!!

7413
04:47:57,810 --> 04:47:59,540
Seriously, how many bloody times?

7414
04:47:57,940 --> 04:48:03,850
Endomen rescued the 5 prisoners

7415
04:47:59,440 --> 04:48:01,310
At least we're free to go

7416
04:48:01,540 --> 04:48:03,310
Thanks, Endoman!

7417
04:48:02,540 --> 04:48:04,850
An awesome setup, really

7418
04:48:03,950 --> 04:48:07,250
Endoman is 67 years old, wow...

7419
04:48:06,710 --> 04:48:08,980
This way, let's go this way

7420
04:48:08,150 --> 04:48:08,980
Got it

7421
04:48:08,980 --> 04:48:09,980
Here

7422
04:48:10,850 --> 04:48:14,060
Haven't they appeared too many times this year?

7423
04:48:11,990 --> 04:48:14,060
Haven't they appeared too many times this year?

7424
04:48:13,820 --> 04:48:14,790
Really...

7425
04:48:14,660 --> 04:48:17,860
You Endomen guys, wait up!!

7426
04:48:15,690 --> 04:48:17,860
You Endomen guys, wait up!!

7427
04:48:17,860 --> 04:48:20,160
She said 'wait'

7428
04:48:19,430 --> 04:48:20,160
What?

7429
04:48:20,360 --> 04:48:22,860
Let's run away, guys!!

7430
04:48:21,430 --> 04:48:22,860
Roger that

7431
04:48:21,730 --> 04:48:26,600
... Seconds to prank

7432
04:48:21,730 --> 04:48:26,600
... Seconds to prank

7433
04:48:24,100 --> 04:48:26,600
Wait! I won't let you escape!

7434
04:48:37,380 --> 04:48:38,710
This is hard!!

7435
04:48:38,710 --> 04:48:40,620
I wonder if they're okay..!

7436
04:48:41,220 --> 04:48:43,220
Wait up!!

7437
04:48:43,220 --> 04:48:47,160
Fujiwara's whereabouts are...?

7438
04:48:43,450 --> 04:48:44,920
What about Fujiwara?

7439
04:48:44,920 --> 04:48:45,750
Oh! You're right!

7440
04:48:45,750 --> 04:48:47,160
That's true!

7441
04:48:46,020 --> 04:48:47,820
We were supposed to save him

7442
04:48:47,820 --> 04:48:49,360
Ah! Fujiwara!

7443
04:48:48,860 --> 04:48:49,360
Hmm?

7444
04:48:49,360 --> 04:48:50,560
Guys!

7445
04:48:51,230 --> 04:48:52,690
Good job!

7446
04:48:51,990 --> 04:48:52,690
Ah!

7447
04:48:52,690 --> 04:48:54,800
I was somehow able to escape from the storage by myself!

7448
04:48:53,830 --> 04:48:54,800
By yourself?!

7449
04:48:56,730 --> 04:48:59,400
Yeah, that's true Matsumoto-san

7450
04:49:02,170 --> 04:49:05,770
19 hours since Earth Defense Force training started

7451
04:49:02,940 --> 04:49:05,210
Late in the night, 3:00 A.M.

7452
04:49:08,680 --> 04:49:11,610
After becoming part of the Earth Defense Force

7453
04:49:11,610 --> 04:49:16,020
Five men have completed several harsh tasks

7454
04:49:21,460 --> 04:49:23,760
The two red marks on his nose...

7455
04:49:23,260 --> 04:49:28,200
Finally, they face that moment...

7456
04:49:33,600 --> 04:49:35,040
Guys...

7457
04:49:35,040 --> 04:49:41,380
Your long Earth Defense Force task is ending here!!

7458
04:49:37,770 --> 04:49:41,380
Your long Earth Defense Force task is ending here!!

7459
04:49:38,610 --> 04:49:39,940
Thank God!!

7460
04:49:39,940 --> 04:49:41,380
We made it!

7461
04:49:40,710 --> 04:49:42,340
You did a great job

7462
04:49:42,340 --> 04:49:44,280
Thank you!

7463
04:49:44,610 --> 04:49:47,550
Ok guys, shall we go?

7464
04:49:46,110 --> 04:49:47,550
Thank you so much!

7465
04:49:47,550 --> 04:49:48,720
Thank you

7466
04:49:48,720 --> 04:49:50,050
Much appreciated

7467
04:49:50,050 --> 04:49:51,520
Thank you

7468
04:49:50,850 --> 04:49:53,450
It was harder than any other year...

7469
04:49:52,590 --> 04:49:54,890
Hamada, don't you need to take those with you?

7470
04:49:55,290 --> 04:49:56,820
These

7471
04:49:56,920 --> 04:49:59,690
It's Model 1-M

7472
04:49:58,760 --> 04:49:59,690
Why should I take those?

7473
04:50:00,130 --> 04:50:02,900
We think it's really important if you take those with you

7474
04:50:02,900 --> 04:50:04,570
You should decorate your house with these

7475
04:50:04,570 --> 04:50:06,800
Whilst you three were off doing your part of the 'do not get frightened'

7476
04:50:06,800 --> 04:50:12,570
Hamada was caressing them like his children

7477
04:50:14,210 --> 04:50:18,080
I wonder if when alone with Hamada  it will come to life and talk to him?

7478
04:50:15,540 --> 04:50:18,080
I wonder if when alone with Hamada  it will come to life and talk to him?

7479
04:50:19,080 --> 04:50:21,880
We're into the new year huh?

7480
04:50:22,280 --> 04:50:24,450
Really?!

7481
04:50:22,780 --> 04:50:24,890
It's 2014!

7482
04:50:24,890 --> 04:50:26,020
I crossed a year holding this thing? (Model 1-M)

7483
04:50:26,020 --> 04:50:27,820
I crossed a year holding this thing? (Model 1-M)

7484
04:50:28,220 --> 04:50:29,660
We don't even get to wear any jackets.

7485
04:50:29,660 --> 04:50:31,590
We don't even get to wear any jackets...

7486
04:50:30,460 --> 04:50:31,590
Yeah, you're right

7487
04:50:31,590 --> 04:50:35,230
In the past, when he came to tell us we're done,  he brought us coats as well

7488
04:50:33,090 --> 04:50:35,230
In the past, when he came to tell us we're done  he brought us coats as well

7489
04:50:33,930 --> 04:50:35,230
Right!

7490
04:50:36,100 --> 04:50:38,230
Happy new year!!

7491
04:50:38,230 --> 04:50:39,670
Thanks for your work!

7492
04:50:39,670 --> 04:50:41,500
Happy new year!

7493
04:50:41,200 --> 04:50:45,240
Legendary Captain: Suga Kenji

7494
04:50:42,470 --> 04:50:45,240
This year is the year of the horse

7495
04:50:44,210 --> 04:50:45,240
Right...

7496
04:50:45,410 --> 04:50:47,780
We have a teacher (of Rakugouka) here

7497
04:50:47,980 --> 04:50:52,550
Using the word "Umadoshi" (year of the horse) I'll make a compostistion using...

7498
04:50:49,410 --> 04:50:52,550
Using the word "Umadoshi" (year of the horse) I'll make a compostistion using...

7499
04:50:52,550 --> 04:50:54,250
Did you bite your tongue?

7500
04:50:53,080 --> 04:50:54,250
Sorry?

7501
04:50:53,280 --> 04:50:58,690
It's too cold and Suga Kenji's mouth won't work properly.

7502
04:50:55,550 --> 04:50:56,650
Don't bit your tongue

7503
04:50:56,650 --> 04:50:57,950
We know it's cold and everything!

7504
04:50:57,150 --> 04:50:59,020
Yeah, it's cold

7505
04:50:57,950 --> 04:50:59,020
Of course it's impossible

7506
04:50:59,050 --> 04:51:21,940
Topic: Horse Year

7507
04:50:59,250 --> 04:51:01,260
U-MA-DO-SHI, it goes like this

7508
04:51:01,860 --> 04:51:03,560
Umadoshi, right?

7509
04:51:02,220 --> 04:51:03,560
"U"

7510
04:51:03,990 --> 04:51:05,890
The road of no lies

7511
04:51:05,890 --> 04:51:07,160
"MA"

7512
04:51:07,160 --> 04:51:09,360
The road of seriousness

7513
04:51:09,600 --> 04:51:11,230
"DO"

7514
04:51:11,230 --> 04:51:13,730
I want to walk it, rapidly

7515
04:51:13,730 --> 04:51:14,970
"SHI"

7516
04:51:14,970 --> 04:51:17,100
I wanna walk it with Shelly!!

7517
04:51:17,840 --> 04:51:18,910
What the...

7518
04:51:18,910 --> 04:51:20,980
I... I think that's...

7519
04:51:20,610 --> 04:51:21,940
Why that outcome?

7520
04:51:22,110 --> 04:51:23,850
Why are you saying that?

7521
04:51:22,840 --> 04:51:23,850
Whatever

7522
04:51:23,850 --> 04:51:25,210
Couldn't find anything else, right?

7523
04:51:24,480 --> 04:51:27,950
That's because I'm going to do my best cooperating with Shelly for a whole year

7524
04:51:25,350 --> 04:51:27,950
That's because I'm going to do my best cooperating with Shelly for a whole year

7525
04:51:27,950 --> 04:51:31,450
Guys, I wish the best regards for you for this year!

7526
04:51:29,850 --> 04:51:31,450
Thank you!

7527
04:51:30,850 --> 04:51:31,590
If you excuse me..!

7528
04:51:31,720 --> 04:51:35,090
I couldn't understand not even a bit of what he said!

7529
04:51:32,920 --> 04:51:35,090
I couldn't understand not even a bit of what he said!

7530
04:51:33,550 --> 04:51:35,490
Everything was soooo messed up

7531
04:51:35,490 --> 04:51:37,860
He spoke so fast...

7532
04:51:41,030 --> 04:51:42,430
Everyone, huh?

7533
04:51:42,430 --> 04:51:44,270
Well, this was for sure

7534
04:51:43,430 --> 04:51:44,930
No, I think he should be OUT

7535
04:51:44,930 --> 04:51:46,170
Ouch!

7536
04:51:45,500 --> 04:51:46,970
Owowow

7537
04:51:46,170 --> 04:51:46,970
It hurts!

7538
04:51:47,270 --> 04:51:49,100
It hurts, geez!

7539
04:51:50,640 --> 04:51:53,270
Okay, everyone, we can get out of here this way

7540
04:51:53,270 --> 04:51:55,710
Once you cross this line your task comes to its end

7541
04:51:54,280 --> 04:51:55,710
Once you cross this line your task comes to its end

7542
04:51:57,040 --> 04:51:58,280
Looks like we made it through the end!

7543
04:51:58,280 --> 04:52:00,080
Yeah!!

7544
04:51:59,210 --> 04:52:01,680
It's over!

7545
04:51:59,450 --> 04:52:06,150
Endo Shozo

7546
04:51:59,450 --> 04:52:06,150
Hamada Masatoshi

7547
04:51:59,450 --> 04:52:06,150
Matsumoto Hitoshi

7548
04:51:59,450 --> 04:52:06,150
Tanaka Naoki

7549
04:51:59,450 --> 04:52:06,150
Tsukitei Hosei

7550
04:52:00,080 --> 04:52:01,680
Okay!!

7551
04:52:01,680 --> 04:52:03,750
I wish you all a happy new year!

7552
04:52:02,850 --> 04:52:04,790
Happy new year!

7553
04:52:03,750 --> 04:52:04,790
You too!

7554
04:52:07,190 --> 04:52:14,130
"I want to become kind"
Kuzayoshi Saitou

7555
04:52:07,320 --> 04:52:14,130
As the clock turns to 8 o'clock, I get ordered 'protect the earth'

7556
04:52:14,430 --> 04:52:21,640
Fujiwara is laughing at Masatoshi's wig

7557
04:52:21,840 --> 04:52:28,980
From behind Itou, draws unnoticed Gen Ichirou

7558
04:52:29,180 --> 04:52:36,280
Morisaki is now part of the nostalgic family

7559
04:52:37,180 --> 04:52:44,260
Chouno is not fast. His slap is not fast.

7560
04:52:44,690 --> 04:52:51,670
It's not something intended to end just with nicknames

7561
04:52:51,900 --> 04:52:59,010
It's not like he's just crap at Maths

7562
04:52:59,310 --> 04:53:05,980
It looks like you, this ugly Model 1-M

7563
04:53:02,380 --> 04:53:05,750
That's actually very funny.

7564
04:53:06,350 --> 04:53:13,590
It's not like I want to cry, with that letter to dear Papa

7565
04:53:13,890 --> 04:53:20,860
Words can't come out, I want to sing properly

7566
04:53:25,600 --> 04:53:32,740
The low dining table flips over, but Asei comes out, after this

7567
04:53:32,970 --> 04:53:39,750
And Matsuko, who doesn't want to get out, dance thanks to a clockwork motor

7568
04:53:40,050 --> 04:53:47,020
Okada would probably say... "Looks like you! WOW!",

7569
04:53:47,150 --> 04:53:54,200
If you can meet Maeken, it's all good

7570
04:53:55,360 --> 04:54:02,170
I don't want to laugh, I don't want to laugh

7571
04:54:02,840 --> 04:54:09,840
By Anna's freedom or Itao's dance

7572
04:54:10,110 --> 04:54:17,220
It's not like I want to eat Ebisu's rice cake...

7573
04:54:17,550 --> 04:54:24,330
Or dance to a song, or to create a rabbit...

7574
04:54:24,530 --> 04:54:31,800
It's not like I want to destroy a precious album

7575
04:54:25,530 --> 04:54:28,060
This one, huh?

7576
04:54:32,070 --> 04:54:39,070
I don't want to get caught; I want to escape from the ass spray

7577
04:55:06,400 --> 04:55:13,710
The wax waterweel is spinning, a stench comes out by farting

7578
04:55:13,840 --> 04:55:23,080
Horiken, who runs away, please don't snap at him...

7579
04:55:28,220 --> 04:55:35,460
It's not like I want to receive those slaps without any love

7580
04:55:35,630 --> 04:55:42,500
I want to be part of the disclosure, and Shouhei, I can't laugh at your jokes...

7581
04:55:42,800 --> 04:55:49,940
It's not like I want to accept this loveless explosion

7582
04:55:50,140 --> 04:55:57,050
I'm not young anymore, my joints hurt

7583
04:55:57,280 --> 04:56:04,590
I'm already over 50, but I want to be interesting

7584
04:56:04,790 --> 04:56:16,900
I want to be smiling, I want to live laughing

7585
04:56:18,070 --> 04:56:25,080
We hope that laughter fulfills your year...

7586
04:56:25,810 --> 04:56:28,720
Looks like it's finally ended!

7587
04:56:27,320 --> 04:56:28,720
It's over!

7588
04:56:29,120 --> 04:56:31,190
Greetings for the new year!

7589
04:56:29,980 --> 04:56:31,190
Greetings to everyone!

7590
04:56:31,190 --> 04:56:32,620
Happy new year!

7591
04:56:32,620 --> 04:56:34,020
Happy new year

7592
04:56:34,020 --> 04:56:35,460
We crossed a new year

7593
04:56:35,220 --> 04:56:36,660
Yeah!

7594
04:56:35,460 --> 04:56:37,630
That's right, uh? We've crossed the new year by now

7595
04:56:36,660 --> 04:56:37,630
Yeah, we did

7596
04:56:37,990 --> 04:56:39,690
What are we going to do now, seriously?

7597
04:56:39,590 --> 04:56:43,330
This is our 8th year I believe...

7598
04:56:43,800 --> 04:56:45,700
Now that I think about the Kouhaku...

7599
04:56:45,700 --> 04:56:49,140
Kitajima Saburou didn't show up this year, right?

7600
04:56:47,840 --> 04:56:49,140
Yeah, right

7601
04:56:49,140 --> 04:56:50,810
Really, uh?

7602
04:56:50,810 --> 04:56:53,980
Let's get the Kitajima family to do our jobs from next year??

7603
04:56:56,240 --> 04:56:58,580
With his family?

7604
04:56:57,650 --> 04:56:58,580
Yeah

7605
04:56:58,780 --> 04:57:01,350
Like all of them?

7606
04:56:59,680 --> 04:57:01,350
Just go get Saburo-san and everyone and just...

7607
04:57:01,350 --> 04:57:03,520
we just need to talk to the heads of Yamamoto...

7608
04:57:03,620 --> 04:57:06,420
Ye, that way, we can just go on Kouhaku

7609
04:57:07,820 --> 04:57:10,060
But seriously, this is so tough...

7610
04:57:10,060 --> 04:57:12,360
well, we'll leave it at that for now...

7611
04:57:11,330 --> 04:57:13,330
I know, right? Really...

7612
04:57:13,330 --> 04:57:16,260
Sorry, but really, viewers of Gaki no Tsukai ya Arehende

7613
04:57:16,260 --> 04:57:20,130
I hope you'll keep on watching us this year!

7614
04:57:17,500 --> 04:57:20,130
Thanks!!

7615
04:57:19,430 --> 04:57:25,640
Please continue to support us! HAPPY NEW YEAR !!
