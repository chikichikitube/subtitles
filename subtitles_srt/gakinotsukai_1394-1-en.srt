00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,850
Good evening.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,450
Tonight, unfortunately, we have some sad news

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,750
To share with all the viewers at home.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,750
Housei-kun has been a regular on this program

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,410
Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende, since our second episode

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,610
...and he's been gibing it his best shot since then.

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,350
Housei-kun has, after much thought,

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,710
Decided to move on from the show.

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,410
There's talk that he may leave the industry altogether,

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,850
Not just the show.

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,310
Yes, I've heard that too.

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,580
Might just be a rumor, but it seems he's made his mind up.

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,280
Without further ado, allow us to bring out the man himself,

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,580
Tsukitei Housei-kun.

16
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,550
Well, uh, a word or two on why you've come to this decision.

17
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,110
A reason for your retirement, because we're not quite...

18
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,080
Not quite clear on why you've gotta abandon showbiz.

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,780
So an explanation would be appreciated if possible...

20
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,780
...Yamazaki?

21
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,910
...an explanation?

22
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,510
Yes.

23
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,780
I'm already 50 years old, you know?

24
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,350
So much has happened, so much, and so I quit comedy.

25
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,750
And now intend to singularly devote myself to reproducing.

26
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,550
I want to have children!

27
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,250
That's certainly no reason to quit, though. You cold make that work.

28
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,550
My wife, her name's Aya, you know?

29
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,510
She just turned 40 and...

30
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,880
And she's just so beautiful, such a beautiful woman...

31
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,750
Such an exquisite woman, my wife...

32
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,780
Matsumoto-san, he...

33
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,780
He leers at ther and makes the most horrid faces...

34
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,780
Whenever I bring her up in conversation.

35
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,780
When we went drinking the other night,

36
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,780
Yeah?

37
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,250
You seemed weirdly interested in how my sex life was going.

38
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,780
I didn't mean it like that.

39
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,780
That's enough!

40
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,480
Ah, well I don't quite recall asking about that,

41
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
We'd had quite a bit to drink after all,

42
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,510
So I apologize for offending you. That wasn't my intention.

43
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,810
If my actions at all influenced your decision to retire,

44
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,780
Then that's on me and I'm sorry.

45
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,380
So just to confirm,

46
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,950
You're not leaving the program, correct?

47
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,710
You're leaving the entertainment industry entirely.

48
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,710
Yes.

49
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,910
...and, so...

50
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,910
Your reasoning?

51
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,380
We'd love to hear it.

52
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,450
Tanaka, why is it, you think?

53
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,880
That I've decided to quit?

54
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,880
Well I mean, I don't know.

55
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,110
Of course I don't want you to quit...

56
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,110
And I feel that if you don't have a clear reason to leave

57
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,410
Maybe you should give this decision a little bit more thought.

58
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,080
There's no reason for you to quit,

59
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,010
So if you would reconsider this choice...

60
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,780
He's right, maybe give it another shot.

61
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,080
Thank you...

62
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,080
What bliss...

63
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,110
But this is the way it must be.

64
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:16,080
And now we'd like to present a selection of
famous scenes curated by Housei-kun himself.

65
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,080
Please roll the tape.

66
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,750
Tsukitei Housei, 50 years old.

67
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:33,810
Narrated by Ashida Mana

68
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,980
Appearing on Gaki no Tsukai since its second episode,

69
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,180
Housei-kun has made his mark in dozens of memorable skits,

70
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,780
And is now retiring from the world of comedy.

71
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,580
Tonight, we look back on all the joy he has given us.

72
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,580
At number 5, Yamazaki vs. Jimmy:

73
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,580
The Blood Feud.

74
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,350
What's  your problem, dick?!

75
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,350
You got a screw loose or something, dumbass?

76
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,250
There was no greater enemy for little Housei.

77
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,750
None other than his Yoshimoto senpai, Jimmy Onish-san

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,750
Whenever they crossed paths, a bloodbath ensued.

79
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,010
Looking back at the two of them, one can't help but feel nostalgic.

80
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,180
Damn you're an annoying little fucker.

81
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,250
You're the one that's annoying!

82
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,780
Thinkin' you're such hot shit with this car.

83
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,780
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

84
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,280
Only a dumbass like you would drive this piece of junk.

85
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,280
Who you calling a dumbass, dumbass?

86
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,010
You, dumbass!

87
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,010
With your dumbass clothes and your dumbass car.

88
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,310
Number 4, Yamasaki vs. Moriman.

89
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,810
Jimmy wasn't the only villain in Housei's life.

90
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,810
Yes, that very personage responsible for so many great fights:

91
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,810
Moriman-san.

92
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,080
BURDOCK BEATDOWN

93
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,310
That got him in the face just now.

94
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,810
Hit right in the face with a burdock root.

95
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,250
A burdock root... is just a stick.

96
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,750
Number 3: Yamasaki, Music Producer.

97
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,950
Oh man, I still remember this.

98
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,310
- Is that right?

99
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,950
Aiming for a lifetime of royalties,
This song, right?

100
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,680
Housei embarked on composing hiw own pop music,

101
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
And completed a catalog of 20 original songs.

102
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,310
Let's bid farewell this evening with a very special performance.

103
00:06:52,310 --> 00:07:01,650
Ah~ Yamasaki-san The star filled sky we gazed upon

104
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:11,150
Still rings in my heart as if it were yesterday

105
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:21,010
Ah~ Matsumoto-san The promise we made on that day

106
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:30,980
I keep it in my heart because it's precious to me

107
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:40,350
Ah~ Tanaka-san Did you find what you were looking for?

108
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:49,380
I know you'll find a way to make your heart whole

109
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:59,580
Ah~ Endo-san In your room, you told me of a dream

110
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:09,110
The way you nodded and smiled, I'll never forget that kindness

111
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,880
Just out of reach, so close yet so far

112
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,780
Those stars that shine so brightly

113
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,580
Somehow, always, take us in your arms

114
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,810
For we are far too weak

115
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,280
At number 2, Yama no Ishimatsu: Slayer of 100 Men

116
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,710
Whatever the situation, you were always up for a challenge.

117
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,810
For your 20th anniversary in the business,

118
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,410
You shought to cut down 100 men.

119
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,810
The battle went smoothly at first, but...

120
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,510
Your strength was gradually sapped by your enemie's attacks.

121
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,680
And finally...

122
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,610
Hamada's mean streak is peeking out.

123
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,610
- No, he tried to run away, see?

124
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,810
No, no, Hamada-san, this is...

125
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,880
Really showing your worst qualities.

126
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,880
You fled from the set.

127
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,880
You ain't gotta cry like that.

128
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,780
My back hurts.

129
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,180
From now on we'll wait until you attack us to go after you, ok?

130
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,350
- We promise, we promise.

131
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,350
No, not you.

132
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,010
YOU?

133
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,710
Who the hell are you calling y--

134
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,280
Number 1, Yamasaki's Moving Wedding.

135
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,680
- Again with this? Come on!

136
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Seriously, how many times do we have to watch this?

137
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,710
Always childlike, our little rascal finally tied the knot.

138
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,510
You selflessly allowed us to share in your joy.

139
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,610
This looks like some sort of "How To Get Married" video.

140
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,750
Right? What the hell is this?

141
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,350
What's with this weirdly high production value?

142
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:29,480
This is... that kind of high quality you don't see on TV, right?

143
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,480
You're kidding me!

144
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,280
There's no way.

145
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,410
What happened that made you cry like that?

146
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,410
No way!!

147
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,510
Housei-kun, we watched you grow up alongside the program.

148
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:01,410
But the time has finally come for you to end this chapter of your life.

149
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,980
Even as time goes on, our memories of you will not fade,

150
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,480
For we keep those moments in the albums of our hearts.

151
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,010
Yes, for now and for always.

152
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:26,250
Farewell

153
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:26,250
And thanks for the memories.

154
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,310
And now for some parting words.

155
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,710
She changed jobs in 2014,

156
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,880
Our former receptionist, Uchino.

157
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,880
Uchino-chan?

158
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,880
You came back?

159
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,880
In 2014-

160
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:44,880
Here.

161
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,780
Everyone signed it for you.

162
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,550
Thank you!

163
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,780
Don't ever drag me back here for dumb shit like this again.

164
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,080
She came all this way, so...

165
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,080
A waste of electricity (lightning dept.)

166
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,080
Hell yeah! (manager)

167
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,080
Keep your sorry ass in Osaka (NTV)

168
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,080
Stop taking my IPhone charger (AP)

169
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,080
The next time I see you I'll kick your ass (Irie)

170
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,080
WE DID IT (the ADs)

171
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,080
We saw him shoplifting the other day (front desk)

172
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,080
Weird body (wardrobe)

173
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,080
Your ears are rotting (sound dept.)

174
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,080
disappear (all Yoshimoto)

175
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,080
this rules (Hulu)

176
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,510
We also have a few words we'd like to share,

177
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,510
Starting with Cocorico.

178
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,350
It wasn't until last night, actually,

179
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,280
That I heard you were leaving Gaki.

180
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
So when I went back home,

181
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,780
to my wife and my mother-in-law, who's in town visiting her grandkid,

182
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,680
and told them the news...

183
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,810
They were like "Thank God!"

184
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,180
Semms like they both really hated your guts.

185
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,710
They're really jazzed about this, so thanks.

186
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,710
Nice work.

187
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,110
Tanaka's turn.

188
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,980
Yes. I've always hated you.

189
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,310
I hate your face.

190
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,680
We've also prepared some words tonight.

191
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,380
You and I have know each other for many years, and...

192
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,950
Well, we've never met up outside of work for a meal or anything,

193
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,780
But these days there's tons of people going into retirement

194
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,010
And I don't think any less of them, so, you know.

195
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,380
So yeah, good luck out there.

196
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,010
Thanks for all your hard work.

197
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,380
Let's see, *** and I first met back in...

198
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,250
Oh, sorry, that's what Aya's been calling you lately.

199
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,010
Sorry about that.

200
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,650
So, as I was saying,

201
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,610
This was back in my twenties when *** and I...

202
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,610
You must have been about 20, right?

203
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,510
There's no way I'l never forget you, ***.

204
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,950
And I'll be seeing a lot more of your wife from now on.

205
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,710
You'll be great, ***!

206
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,350
Thank you!

207
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:07,310
And lastly, from Housei-kun himself, some parting words.

208
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,310
Who was it?

209
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,880
Who was it that...

210
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,980
That made these flowers bloom?

211
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,980
It was five men.

212
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,680
All five of us, together...

213
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,680
They all went away...

214
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,210
I dream that suddenly I was alone!

215
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,610
AND I WAS SO VERY LONELY

216
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,610
BUT EVEN THEN

217
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,010
EVEN THEN!

218
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,280
I shed no tears.

219
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,610
But even then...

220
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,080
Even though I was the only one from Gaki left...

221
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,080
"Don't cry", said a voice.

222
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,080
Over and over again.

223
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,880
Oh, I'm remembering now...

224
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,210
That dream, I'm recalling more of it...

225
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,250
HAMADA-CHAN WAS THE ONE SPEAKING TO ME

226
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,310
It was him! HAMADA-CHAN, he spoke to me!

227
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,310
How tragic...

228
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,980
Whas this how you pictured it would end?

229
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,380
In all these tears?

230
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,880
Did you anticipate the tears?!

231
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,880
Who would thought?!

232
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,010
I'm not feeling so hot...

233
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,710
For real.

234
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,710
No, seriously, I think I'm gonna barf.

235
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,710
I'm serious.

236
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,710
Finally.

237
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,680
Tanaka Naoki.

238
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,450
You're

239
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,180

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,850
Best friend.

241
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,580

242
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,580

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,310
I don't want to let you go...

244
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,850
I can't let go of you, Tanaka Naoki!

245
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,250
I LOVE YOU

246
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,310
I LOVE YOU

247
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,450

250
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,910
Ok, well, Yama-chan, thanks for all your hard work.

251
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,910
Is that still not enough?

252
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,910
I haven't even heard Tanaka's response!

253
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,350
Tanaka's... HEY! LET ME GO!

254
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,310
I DON'T WANNA QUIT!!

255
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,980
Hey now, someone's gonna get hurt.

256
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,050
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE!!

257
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,350
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME!! I WON'T DO IT

258
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,350
You've gotta make this your last show.

259
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,650
LET ME STAY LONGER, PLEASE

260
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,110
- No, no one wants to see this...

261
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,710
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING TO DESERVE THIS

262
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,910
I'M NOT LEAVING

263
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,310
What a mess.

264
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,950
- Well, yeah, I mean, I know.

265
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,050
But leaving the entire industry?

266
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,550
- That certainly happened.

267
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,050
It turned out that it's not the show he's retiring from...

268
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,550
Well, gentlemen,

269
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,910
Starting next week, let's do our best as a foursome.

270
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,910
WAIT!!!

271
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,210
Well, gentlemen,

272
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,850
Starting next week, let's do our best as a foursome.

273
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,710
WAIT!!!

274
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,150
HOUSEI AIN'T

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,850
QUITTIN' SHOWBIZ~!

276
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,880
All you out there in TV land, did I scare ya?

277
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,050

278
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,650
AND I GOTCHA FOR THE 16th TIME!

279
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,550

00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,610

281
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,310
NOT QUITTING NOT QUITTING

282
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:02,480
NOT QUITTING~!

283
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,150
And now he does his skit, yeah?

284
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,150
I guess that's me.

285
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,150
Is that me?

286
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,150
Yeah, that's gotta be you.

287
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,150
Can that bald guy even sing?

288
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,150
This is too much...

289
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,880
At least get rid of the glasses.

290
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,880
He's super quiet.

291
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
His Japanese was a bit shaky.

292
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,880
The bald guy doesn't even have his mic up!

293
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,880
He was so focused on the lip-sync that he forgot.

294
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,880
HOUSEI AIN'T QUITTING

295
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:55,610
NOT QUITTING SHOWBIZ, NOT QUITTING GAKI

296
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:00,010
AND DEFINITELY NOT RAKUGO

Somehow, always, LET ME STAY

00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:10,550
HOUSEI AIN'T QUITTING!

299
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,150
Somehow~ Always~

300
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:19,410
LET ME STAY~!

301
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,410
Long, long, too long.

302
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,410
Too long!

303
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,010
Really shoulda picked up the pace.

304
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,680
Thank you very much.

305
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,910
What?
- Doesn't he do one more?

306
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,910
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE YOU SUNOVABITCH

307
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,680

308
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,680
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE YOU SUNOVABITCH

309
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,850
We heard you were plannin' on retiring...
- Yeah yeah yeah!

310
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,310
And came all the way down here from Hokkaido!!

311
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,350
It's Moriman!

312
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,910
And now you say you're NOT quitting?

313
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,910
It's cuz of YOU that we had to wake up at 6 this morning!!

314
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,850
Damn straight!

315
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,950
We didn't sit in that traffic jam for nothin'!!

316
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,850
What's your freakin' problem?

317
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,710
Cue card says "Hamada-san, if you please"...

318
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,710
And?
- Oh, I get it.

319
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:18,080
BURDOCK BEATDOWN

320
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,350
Can't be helped, buddy!

321
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,350
You've gotta fight, it's the only way out!

322
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,580
You'll win this time, you'll win this time!

323
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:48,450
You gotta fight!! It'll be easier if you fight!!

324
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,050
You can't run away!! There's no way out!!

325
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:02,050
Fight her!
- Don't run away!!

326
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,280
The hell is going on?

327
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,110
Hit her, You gotta hit her!!

328
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,680
What in the hell is this?

329
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,450
Don't hit the crew!! Stop hitting the crew!

330
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,310
Too bad, huh?

331
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:37,250
If we had known you hated burdock so much...

332
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,480
Then maybe the staff could've used something else.

333
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
Yeah, that's why...

334
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,080
That's why I went after Takasu and Yanaoka.
