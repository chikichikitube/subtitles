1
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,890
I thought this had come again.

2
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:32,590
For the past weeks, there has always been a Documental somewhere in my mind.

3
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,900
Only bastards have competed in Documental.

4
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,770
You bastard!

5
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,240
You have the longest career, so you should be more imposing.

6
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,610
I have a 10 year gap!

7
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,180
You right.
Sorry.

8
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,310
First of all, Matsumoto-san is a bastard.

9
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:58,050
The bastard head and his bastard minions are in charge of this.

10
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:06,630
Aspiring is not to be chased, it must be chased.

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,070
We should do that shushutto(≒quickly).

12
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,500
What do you mean?
What's "shushutto"?

13
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,770
You don't have to do it either!

14
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,440
So I shouldn't have done that!?

15
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,710
That's right!
I've been saying that for a while now.

16
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,010
Documental - Season 10
Episode 4  “Unleash All of Your Power”

17
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,150
We are winners.
Don’t get cocky.

18
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,050
Yeah.

19
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,390
Coo-chan, you are dismissed!

20
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,360
He's going to have jokes he hasn't shown them yet.

21
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,140
"Natayooo"

22
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,670
"Natayooo"

23
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,110
Kotouge laughed.

24
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,910
This means that...

25
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,980
If he gets another card next time...

26
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,950
Here we go.

27
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,790
I envy those who have videos.

28
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,730
Can I still show you my video?

29
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,690
- Sure.
- If you have it, please show it.

30
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,960
I have a lot of that.

31
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,700
- You have a lot of that?
- Yeah.

32
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,670
Please show this.

33
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,240
[Hell Butterfly]

34
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,340
Hell Butterfly.

35
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,610
This was shot when I was in Hawaii on my honeymoon.

36
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,250
Why is he calling this hell?

37
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,350
Why the hell is this "hell"?

38
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,820
Sometimes you can see a foreigner behind him.

39
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,330
What the hell.

40
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,360
This is terrible.

41
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,030
It's tough to watch this looping video.

42
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,170
[Are there any after-parties?]

43
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,440
[KILL YOU]

44
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,770
Why should they be killed?

45
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,940
This is a message to all of you.

46
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,880
How can they stand not to laugh?

47
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,250
- Goto, why don't you go to that room?
- Okay.

48
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,290
- Well, I'm off.
- See you later.

49
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,920
- Can I play another one?
- Sure.

50
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,860
This is a pretty good one.

51
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,730
I know you are all mentality is tired, so please listen to the classics.

52
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,560
- I'd love to hear that.
- Sounds good.

53
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,530
[A Touching Classic]

54
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,220
You guys are mentally tired.

55
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,530
Kotouge is about to laugh again.

56
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,810
- Kotouge is about to laugh again.
- Yes.

57
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,150
- He is playing great one.
- Yeah.

58
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,190
There's more?

59
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,090
There's no end in sight.

60
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,730
What's the hell.

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,370
- What the hell is this?
- What is the genre of this video?

62
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,110
What is the genre of this?

63
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,550
Yuriyan is attacking.
She keeps looking at Zakoshi.

64
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,430
[Nice]

65
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,330
What's nice about this?

66
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,300
[KILL YOU]

67
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,000
I was told kill you again.

68
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,610
I was told kill you again.

69
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,210
- I don't want you to kill me.
- Stop killing me.

70
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,250
Stop killing me.

71
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,250
Oh, here he comes.

72
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,020
- Hello.
- Goto-san.

73
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,250
- He came.
- Are you done playing videos?

74
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,460
- You brought a lot of videos.
- There's more.

75
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,060
- Really?
- To show you everything right now would be waste.

76
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,660
Not even half the time has passed yet.

77
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,870
I'm off to the bathroom.

78
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,870
I will follow you.

79
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,300
Don't follow me.

80
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,840
Are you okay?
You have almost laughed several times today.

81
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,310
Sorry.
I can laugh with you, right?

82
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,180
- Huh?
- I can laugh with you, right?

83
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,680
You can't.

84
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,710
Oh, really?

85
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,350
- Of course you can't.
- Only I am allowed to laugh.
- I see.

86
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,490
- What's wrong?
- Didn't you just laugh?
- No.

87
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,260
You have almost laughed several times today.

88
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,220
Sorry.

89
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:09,990
Really so.

90
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,290
Come on.

91
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,900
Thank you for the tip.
I'm okay.

92
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,400
And, I have one request.

93
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,200
Please change your clothes.

94
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,270
Certainly that outfit is ugly to look at.

95
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,870
You should change your clothes and change your mind.

96
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,740
Sorry.

97
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,140
Do you mean I should go back to square one?

98
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,210
Hmmmm, yeah.

99
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,610
You are more of a negative than a zero, though.

100
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,390
Goto is allowed to laugh, though.

101
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,120
He seems to have a habit of not laughing in that room.

102
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,230
- He must be influenced by them.
- Yeah.

103
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,530
When I came, they were all gone.

104
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,340
Whatever.

105
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,540
What shall I set them up with?

106
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,780
Come over here once.

107
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,080
Goto came all the way here.

108
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,020
"What happened?"

109
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,320
You are Katsuo?
(Note: 1)

110
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,060
"What happened?"

111
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,190
She did that one in THE W.
(Note: 2)

112
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,290
"What happened?"

113
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,660
There was no one here earlier.

114
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,600
They have to fight here, but nobody was here earlier.

115
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,530
Why did they leave here?

116
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,970
What do you think they should do?

117
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,740
Kubota-san,
"You are making a big mistake."

118
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,110
No, I've been here all along.

119
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,250
Can I do an exaggerated Timon D impression?
(Note: 3)

120
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,780
Sure.

121
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,680
First, this is a normal Timon D impression.

122
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,350
"You can do it if you try!"

123
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,820
And this is an exaggerated Timon D impression.

124
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,130
"You can eat shit if you try."

125
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,370
Let's play a game together.

126
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,200
A game?

127
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,000
- Sounds good.
- Nice, nice!

128
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,610
This is an electric griddle for takoyaki.
(Note: 4)

129
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,380
First, put the balls in here.

130
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,810
Next, turn on the switch to make this hot.

131
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,120
Then compete with me to see who can withstand the heat better.

132
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,220
That's dangerous!

133
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,520
Can you show your balls?

134
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,160
- So I brought the skirt so as not to show it.
- Okay.

135
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,230
It's not good.

136
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,690
This is going to be very hot.

137
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,160
Okay, I'll do it if you do it.

138
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,300
Who will do it?

139
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,670
I will do this first.

140
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,170
Is it okay?

141
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,370
If you are so worried, watch me do it.

142
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,040
- Are you okay?
- Can I take it all off?

143
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,610
Sure.

144
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,910
This is where my balls come out.

145
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,680
Then put my balls in here.

146
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,450
This is scary.

147
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,050
You don't have to hold back until your balls burn.

148
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,060
- You don't put your balls on it when it gets hot, do you?
- Yes!

149
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,690
- This is going to get hotter and hotter, isn't it?
- Yes.

150
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,060
I will place this here.

151
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,660
Yamamoto-san, you should see it too.

152
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,030
This might be better placed a little higher....Oh, well.

153
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,200
- You have to bend over quite a bit.
- This looks dangerous.

154
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,040
I don't think you can do that.

155
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,640
Are you sure you are okay?

156
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,640
Don’t worry I won’t hold out for that long.

157
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,810
Do you measure time?

158
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,410
No, this is not that kind of game.

159
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,220
Now, turn on the power.

160
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,390
- Do you just stop when it gets hot?
- please wait a second.

161
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,420
It is better to have water to cool the balls.

162
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,920
Water for cooling?

163
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,320
A cup of water.

164
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,500
- Balls Cooler?
- Yes.

165
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,200
Let's get started.

166
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,500
Are others going to do that after this?

167
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,530
I won't be forced to do so.

168
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,310
- Only those who want to do it?
- If you want to do it after seeing this, please do it.

169
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,310
It's your balls.

170
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,480
Oh, it's a great balls.

171
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,250
- I'm scared.
- Is he okay?

172
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,920
I just heard the sound sizzling.

173
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,690
No.

174
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,160
I'm still totally fine.

175
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,360
I'm still fine.

176
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,900
I'm still fine.

177
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,560
Ouch!!

178
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,700
Cool it with water!

179
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,480
It smells like...

180
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,410
burnt balls.

181
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,080
It stinks.

182
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,320
I think your pubic hair got burned.
Or the skin of balls.

183
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,450
It stinks!

184
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,450
It stinks!

185
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,120
I knew this would happen.

186
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,060
It must be because my balls were burned.

187
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,460
Did you get burned?

188
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,800
Anyone want to do this?

189
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,530
No.

190
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,300
Nobody wants to do that when they see that.

191
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,130
I'll do it.

192
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,900
You don't have the balls.

193
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,030
You don't have that.

194
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,300
Damn it.

195
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,170
It's dangerous.

196
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,540
So nobody does this?

197
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,640
I don't want to do it.

198
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,610
Yamamoto-san, I think you should do this.

199
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,580
Why!?

200
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,250
Why should I do it?

201
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,320
This is a chance to rise your manliness.

202
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,020
- Why should I...
- Because you haven't done anything so far.

203
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,190
You have nothing to say back to him?

204
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,660
You should do it.

205
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,930
Yamamoto-san, can you do this?

206
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,500
You should do this.

207
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,560
You really should do this.

208
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,300
The kappa one was the worst.

209
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,210
The kappa one and the rap one were really bad.
(Note: 5)

210
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,580
Why can you do the kappa ones and not the ball ones?

211
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,720
- I don't want to do the kappa one any more than this one.
- Go ahead, try it.

212
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,380
Please try it.

213
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,990
Why do you guys only want me to do that at times like this?

214
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,090
Why don't you just do it?

215
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,290
- Earlier I did the kappa ones with you.
- That's because you said those things.

216
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,790
Kotouge was doing that one with you earlier.

217
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,000
You know it's impossible to do something like that.

218
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,600
Why don't you just do it shushutto(≒quickly)?

219
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,000
- You've never done that before, right?
- Let's do it shushutto(≒quickly).

220
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,540
"What's going on?"

221
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,610
Hey, here comes something.

222
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,910
- "What's going on?"
- What the hell is this?

223
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,780
"I'm penis-kun, who wasn't funny at all last time."

224
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,750
Too many jokes about dicks.

225
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,380
After the balls, the dick?

226
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,780
Do you really want to make it work?

227
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,950
"I love this."

228
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,050
- Penis-kun.
- "What's wrong? Hello."

229
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,920
- What do you want with it?
- "I'll answer anything, just ask me for advice."

230
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,630
He won't burn his balls.

231
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,430
"Who do you guys think is to blame?"
"I think the person who started this is to blame."

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,530
Yes, that's right.

233
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,070
Maybe it's my fault for bringing this stuff.

234
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,140
But I brought this as a game for everyone to enjoy.

235
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,480
So, if Yamamoto-san does this I can play games with him.

236
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,680
"You already know who's to blame, don't you?"
"The person who started this is to blame."

237
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,010
"You have to say I'm sorry."

238
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,520
"Hey, something is spurting out."

239
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,350
- Did he fail again?
- Something is spurting out.

240
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,390
Something thin and short spurted out.

241
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,890
Although it failed last time, this time it was a success, because it spouted more than last time.

242
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,990
- Did he ejaculate?
- Right.

243
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,560
What's supposed to happen?

244
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,400
I really wanted to make it a success, but this time I had no choice.

245
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,900
- Did you get burned? Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

246
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,140
It was hot but did not burn me.

247
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,280
Is your skin okay?

248
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,880
Something spurted out.

249
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,520
What's with the weird colors?

250
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,150
And...

251
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,050
Hey, there's a lot of something coming out.

252
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,660
- Hey, that's the wrong color.
- Why didn't you make it white one?

253
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,060
No blue one comes out of it.

254
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,660
This is because the tip of this is rotten.

255
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,690
I see.

256
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,030
- What's that?
- What the hell is this?

257
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,230
It stinks!

258
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,470
Enough jokes about dicks.

259
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,840
- Too many dick jokes.
- Yes, that is too many.

260
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,540
You did the balls joke.

261
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,210
You burned your own balls.

262
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,910
Yes, I burned my balls.

263
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,680
You think you can get this over with without doing anything don’t you?

264
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,820
I will do this because it is a good opportunity.

265
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,690
What's this?

266
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,590
Let's do it shushutto(≒quickly).

267
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,860
Shushuttoooo.
Let's do it shushutto.

268
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,730
Let's do it shushutto.

269
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,770
This is something Goto needs to do something about.

270
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,280
This is something Goto needs to do something about.

271
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,210
That's so...

272
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,920
This is getting hot, so shushutto it.

273
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,390
It's gushing out.

274
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,830
No one has ever wet the floor like this before.

275
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,300
- This is dangerous.
- Yeah.

276
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,970
I'll shushutto with my penis-kun too!

277
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,170
Shushutto!

278
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,170
- His is not spurting at all.
- This is a worst-case scenario.

279
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,740
This is a worst-case scenario.

280
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,710
This is bad.

281
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,350
Yeah, this is bad.

282
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,420
- It was a mess.
- It's dangerous if you don't wipe the floor.

283
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,720
- Yeah.

284
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,920
His is gushing too much and his is not spurting at all.

285
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,690
It can't be helped if I shushutto.

286
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,090
No one is in this room again.

287
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,100
And you did not burn your balls.

288
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,200
Balls burning is over?

289
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,930
- He should have done that.
- Right.

290
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,470
I will wipe up the rest.

291
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,670
It's okay.
Thank you.

292
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,180
- What's wrong?
- It’s nothing.

293
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,520
You're trying to make me laugh, but there's no point.

294
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,230
You should make Yamamoto-san laugh, not me.

295
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,600
There's no point in making me laugh.

296
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,970
Who are you?

297
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,140
"Shinji, you pilot the Eva."

298
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,980
I'm Gendo Ikari.
(Note: 6)

299
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,680
The light reflects off his glasses, making them glow.

300
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,690
"Shinji, you pilot the Eva."

301
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,960
"If you won't pilot it, go hooooooooooooooME!"

302
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,700
- It's not like this.
- Yeah.

303
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,400
"Fuyutsuki."

304
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,770
"Fuyutsuki, you pilot the Eva too."

305
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,770
He never says that.

306
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,070
He never says that.

307
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:31,480
"If you won't pilot it, go hooooooooooooooMEEEHHH!"

308
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,450
You are doing a much exaggerated impression of him.

309
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,550
"Eva, you pilot the Eva."

310
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,550
Eva cannot pilot the Eva.

311
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,620
I'm Gendo Ikari.

312
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,730
Right, I'm doing this job because I want to pilot the Eva.
(Note: 7)

313
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,570
Osaka dialect?

314
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,300
Are there any after-parties, hey?

315
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,970
- He loves this phrase.
- Is that what you want to know?

316
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,070
It's impossible to not have a party.

317
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,570
- Why is he speaking in Osaka dialect?
- That's not good, not good.

318
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:06,110
Right, this is the "Human - Are there any after parties? - Project".
(Note: 8)

319
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,280
All he cares about is the after-party.

320
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,290
That's all.

321
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,420
He is an idiot.

322
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,790
Was this an exaggerated impression?

323
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,200
He's a helpless guy.

324
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,700
"Are there any after-parties?"

325
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,400
- Finally, half the time has passed.
- Yeah.

326
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,070
The rest of the time is half.

327
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,210
- Let's clean up around here.
- Yes.

328
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,350
- half the time has passed.
- Yes.

329
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,590
It's yours, so you should deal with it.
You should get rid of it.

330
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,930
- That should get rid of it.
- Please, throw that away.

331
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,260
I am taking this home with me.

332
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,530
You're bringing it back?
Will you use it again?
Where will you use it?

333
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,000
Lumine the Yoshimoto.

334
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,640
You should not do that in Lumine.
(Note: 9)

335
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,570
No one will laugh if you do that in Lumine.

336
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,070
I am the only one here.

337
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,280
Wait a second.

338
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:17,120
But...you should change your clothes for jokes.

339
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,920
I'm fine with this.
Others are changing now.

340
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,320
- Really?
- Yeah.

341
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,530
You should change your clothes.
You should do something.

342
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,830
But others are changing now.

343
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:34,370
But you ended last time by saying, "I didn't get to do any of the jokes I had prepared."

344
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,870
I have nothing to change into anymore.

345
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,510
You came here with a big baggage.

346
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,310
I've already done most of them.

347
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,940
Are you okay?

348
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,150
Sorry for shouting.

349
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,680
It's okay.
But please be quiet because there are other patients.

350
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,620
Who are you?

351
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,350
I am a doctor.
Shall I examine you?

352
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,560
"Hi, we are Sandwichman."
(Note: 10)

353
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,220
"That's enough."

354
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,290
"Hi, we are Sandwichman."
"That's enough."

355
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,000
"The store manager has become the topping of this."
"That's enough."

356
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,040
"That's enough."

357
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,510
"Hi, we are Sandwichman."
"That's enough."

358
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,410
"That's enough."

359
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,710
"That's enough."

360
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,250
"Hi, we are Sandwichman."
"Hey, you're disgusting."

361
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,380
"That's enough."

362
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,320
"Hey, you're disgusting."
"The store manager has become the topping of this."
"That's enough."

363
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,590
Was this guy really listening to their comedy?

364
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,160
- Are you Date-chan?
- I'm Date-chan

365
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,530
"The store manager has become the topping of this."
"That's enough."

366
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,570
You are Date-chan?

367
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,510
- He might say something like this in his home, too.
- I've never seen him say that.

368
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,540
"That's enough."

369
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,110
"That's enough."

370
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,180
"Thanks."

371
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,190
I don't think he would talk that way.

372
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,150
"Are you okay?"

373
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,160
Are you okay?

374
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,830
Apparently...

375
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,730
- You and I are alone.
- Yeah.
- We are three.

376
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,370
There are three here.

377
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,870
You said yeah but that is wrong.

378
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,240
You are wrong.

379
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,210
Why don't you change quickly?

380
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,380
- He doesn't have a change of clothes anymore, does he?
- Someone is using the locker room right now.

381
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,020
Yamamoto stopped acting at all.

382
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,420
Last time I checked you were wandering around doing nothing.

383
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,090
Right?

384
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,860
- That's right.
- Yes.

385
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,990
"That's right"?

386
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,800
I was finally alone.

387
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,900
There are two.

388
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,970
No, it's fine.

389
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,400
We should not all go to the locker room.

390
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,870
Yeah.

391
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,880
What's this?

392
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,110
It's mine!

393
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,210
Did you bring your own chimbou?

394
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,950
Everyone is bringing their own chimbou.

395
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,520
That's right, everyone brings a chimbou.

396
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,220
Hey, don't stretch it...What's this?

397
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,360
- Hair came out of it.
- This is a white hair.

398
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,360
Wouldn't you feel disappointed i%&*#$.... someone...

399
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,530
Why did you stutter?

400
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,900
- That doesn't matter.
- Why did you stutter?

401
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,000
That doesn't matter.
Wouldn't you feel disappointed if someone you admired had white hair?

402
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,270
Did he laugh?

403
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,740
Kubota laughed?

404
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,610
He almost laughed at what he said.

405
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,780
- Would you like to play a game with me?
- Okay.

406
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,510
- Really?
- Okay!

407
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,520
Okay!

408
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,350
Let's use this.

409
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,790
Pop-up Pirate?

410
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,320
Yes.

411
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,190
Do you want to do it on the floor?
Or on the table?

412
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,430
I think it is easier to understand if you do it on the table.

413
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,300
The loser have to eat shit.

414
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,500
Are you serious?

415
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,700
- Don't do that.
- That is eatable shit.

416
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,310
There is no such thing in this world.

417
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,810
No, it exists.
It is sold at Don Quixote.
(Note: 11)

418
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,980
The ones that are on the market?

419
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,950
It is quite realistic.

420
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,480
If you lose this game, eat shit.

421
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,750
Okay.

422
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,150
And...

423
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,320
Here's...

424
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,860
the shit.

425
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,660
- Huh?
- Here's the shit.

426
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,060
The loser has to eat it.

427
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,360
Is that on Kotouge's butt?

428
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,530
Yes, I have shit on my butt.

429
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,730
- Is that eatable shit?
- Yes.

430
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,400
This is not uneatable shit.

431
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,200
So the loser has to eat my...

432
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,940
Some people can eat real shit.

433
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,040
This is not real shit.

434
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,480
It's Shimiken-san, right?
(Note: 12)

435
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,810
You don't have to say who.

436
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,350
Since we are here, why don't you join us, Goto-san?

437
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,150
But you are not a contestant, are you?

438
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,120
I have no problem joining in on this.

439
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,220
Then, Goto-san, please join us in this.

440
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,090
You like this kind of thing, don't you, Goto-san?
You used to masturbate to porn videos of women licking toilet bowls, didn't you?

441
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,190
I have heard that rumor too.

442
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,000
Hey, it's true.

443
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,200
Really?

444
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,130
Is that why you want to do this so badly?

445
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,400
- You seemed very eager to do this.
- Are you excited?

446
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,010
It's Spitton Toilet Bitch.

447
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,910
Spitton?

448
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,710
- Don't you watch those?
- No, I don't.

449
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,980
What do you usually watch?

450
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,950
I often watch videos featuring amateurs.

451
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,980
I watched "Chimpo kari sweat" the other day.

452
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,190
This can be divided into three words.
Chimpo (Dick),
Kari (Glans),
Sweat.

453
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,130
What kind of story is that?

454
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,330
Why do you want to know Chimpo kari sweat's story?

455
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,830
Women run marathons...

456
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:36,370
Women run marathons, drink sports drinks, and have sex.

457
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,270
Chimpo kari sweat...

458
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,440
I don't want to do it.
I don't want to eat shit.

459
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,780
I definitely don't want to eat that.

460
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,550
This is not real.
It is just as close to the real thing as possible.

461
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,920
- Does it smell?
- Yes.

462
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,290
Let's begin.
I'll do it first.

463
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,060
This is only the second one.

464
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,090
Is this possible?

465
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,670
What's going on?

466
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,240
- Are you serious?
- Don't worry.

467
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,870
There's nothing here.

468
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,510
I can't do it!
Help me!

469
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,610
I can't do it!
Goto-san, help me!

470
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,210
This is eatable shit.

471
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,280
Even if that is eatable shit...

472
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,850
This is really eatable shit.

473
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,420
Even if that is eatable shit, if you spread it on there, we can't eat it anymore.

474
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,550
Can I trust you?

475
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,960
This is really eatable shit!

476
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,920
If you spread it on there, we can't eat it anymore.

477
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,960
This is really eatable shit!!
Trust me!!

478
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,790
This is eatable shit!!

479
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,700
Why are you talking so passionately about this!?

480
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,100
You eat it first.

481
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,330
Okay, this is eatable shit.

482
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,170
This is really hard.

483
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,900
Oh, you eat this?

484
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,040
He ate it.

485
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,510
You shouldn't do that.

486
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,440
- It’s shit, right?
- Yes, it's shit.

487
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,210
Yeah, it's shit.

488
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,480
This is eatable, though.

489
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,350
More importantly, your ass stinks.

490
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,720
That's the smell of the shit.

491
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,720
It smelled like a Koumon (asshole).

492
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,850
Koumon-sama.
(Mito-Koumon)

493
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:01,960
Not that “Koumon”.
(Note: 13)

494
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,130
- What should I do?
- Why did you suck it?

495
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,190
Because he won't do it.

496
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,700
- That said, why did you lick so much?
- I would do it.

497
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,830
I wouldn't do it.

498
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,870
If there is shit there, I would do it.

499
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,670
"When are you going to do it?
Now, that's when!"
(Note: 14)

500
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,170
You don't do this?

501
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,470
Okay, I'll do it.
You want me to smell it?

502
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,640
No, please eat this.

503
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,910
Here is a lump of shit and you should eat it.

504
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,480
This is tough.

505
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,320
You lost, so you should do it.

506
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,220
There is also piss there.

507
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:31,850
That is the yellow one there.

508
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,150
You're the worst.

509
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,190
This is drinkable piss.

510
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,420
We can't drink this!

511
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,420
Eatable Shit and Drinkable Piss!

512
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,560
Where did you find this!?

513
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,600
- Both are sold at Don Quijote.
- Don Quijote is insane.

514
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,460
- Is this really eatable?
- Of course it is.

515
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,070
This is an eatable one.

516
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:47,900
What does it taste like?

517
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,970
- It tastes like shit.
- Then it's shit!

518
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,940
I really don't want to eat this.

519
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:57,240
But you are...
Hey, someone is waiting for us.

520
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,250
- Yeah.
- Someone is waiting.

521
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,680
- We are doing it over here now, so please wait a bit.
- Okay, I'll do it.

522
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,290
Hey,

523
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,560
I got dressed and came here and this was the situation.

524
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,290
Who are you?

525
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,930
Guess who?

526
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,970
Are you Fuwa-chan?
(Note: 15)

527
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,070
Ah, Fuwa-chan.

528
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,300
Yeah, it's Fuwa-chan.

529
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,140
Correct.

530
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,040
Is that correct?

531
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,950
Are you Fuwa-chan?

532
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,610
Fuwa-chan doesn't dress like this.

533
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,350
He's like a Street Fighter's character.

534
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,490
Chun-Li?
(Note: 16)

535
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,320
Fat Chun-Li.

536
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,690
I don't know Chun-Li.

537
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,760
Come on.

538
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,430
Then I'll do it.

539
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,830
Yes, let's deal with this first.

540
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,160
This is really eatable.

541
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,830
This is eatable shit.

542
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,270
Ugh, this is tough.

543
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,440
What's going on?

544
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,170
- How do I eat this?
- You see the lump?

545
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,310
You nibble the lumps.

546
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,210
With front teeth.

547
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,920
- This really stinks.
- Have you ever had it?

548
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,590
- Does this smell like piss?
- Yes.

549
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,020
Smell it first.

550
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,290
Does it stink?

551
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,530
My sense of smell is numb and I can't smell this.

552
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,130
It stink!

553
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,630
It doesn't smell at all.

554
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,830
I smell piss from this.

555
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,000
Then you can drink it.

556
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,370
That's drinkable piss, so you're good to go.

557
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,740
- What's drinkable piss?
- My sense of smell is numb.

558
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,210
Are you okay?

559
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,550
Yeah, that's piss.

560
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,180
I know this taste.

561
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:47,920
This is what it tastes like when you lick the hand that touched the back of your balls in your stuffy pants in summer.

562
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,160
Is that salty?

563
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,960
Is that salty?

564
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,860
- And it tastes like piss, right?
- Yes.

565
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,560
But you can drink this.
This is drinkable piss.

566
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,070
He seemed to like this very much.

567
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,540
Why did you drink it again?

568
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,740
I found myself drinking this.

569
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
It must be an addictive taste.

570
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,410
This is not good.

571
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,610
Shit, piss, and dick....

572
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,210
This is really...

573
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,750
This really smells like the back of balls in summer.

574
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,380
You don't know that.

575
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,690
I know that!

576
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,650
You haven't dick.

577
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,390
I know that!

578
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,190
You haven's that.

579
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:21,620
I have that.

580
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,190
You haven't.

581
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:22,820
What the hell.

582
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,020
You haven't dick.

583
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,160
Then let's play chess to decide who wins.

584
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,800
Chess?

585
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,500
Is his Fuwa-chan done?

586
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,370
"Rassun Gorerai"
"Rassun Gorerai"
(Note: 17)

587
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,180
"Rassun Gorerai"
"Rassun Gorerai"

588
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,710
"Rassun Gorerai"
"Rassun Gorerai"

589
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,650
"Rassun Gorerai"
"Explain this."

590
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,430
- He does a lot of things.
- Yeah.

591
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,470
Are you Hama-yanen?

592
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,400
"Rassun Gorerai"

593
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,970
"Rassun Gorerai"
"Rassun Gorerai"

594
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,570
"Rassun Gorerai"
"Rassun Gorerai"

595
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,740
"Wait a minute, wait a minute, old man."

596
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,820
- Old man?
- I think if he exaggerated that one, he would probably say old man.

597
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,420
Not bro.

598
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,590
"Rassun Gorerai"
"Rassun Gorerai"

599
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,330
Oh, Zakoshi!

600
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,760
He laughed for the first time.

601
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,100
He definitely laughed.

602
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,570
- Who laughed?
- Me.

603
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:43,470
- Did you laugh at your own joke?
- Yes.

604
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,140
- Have you lost your mind?
- Yeah.
- This is serious.

605
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,810
What was that?

606
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,480
He definitely laughed.

607
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,780
I blew myself up!

608
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,250
You laugh at things like that.

609
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,570
You laughed.

610
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,880
You were completely unharmed.
Yellow card.

611
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,210
- It's the first time, right?
- Yes.

612
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,050
The only one intact is Yuriyan.

613
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,920
It also matters how many points you are earning.

614
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,890
Did you have Fuwa-chan's costume?

615
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,390
And you're showing them now?

616
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,370
I thought I had to come out when the buzzer went off.

617
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,400
Ugh, It's not going well.

618
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,870
- You want to come back with me?
- Yes.

619
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,170
- Don't go!
- See you.

620
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,480
Here we go.

621
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,690
Two and a half hours remaining.

622
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,690
Please make me your disciple.

623
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,290
I don't need a disciple.

624
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,860
Do you want to become Zakoshi's disciple?

625
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,760
I can exaggerate too.

626
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,400
Can you really do that?

627
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,800
Only my nipples can do that.

628
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,330
Only one side?

629
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,500
This side is retracted nipples.

630
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,100
- Are you exaggerating your nipples.
- Yes.

631
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,240
That is too much of an exaggeration.

632
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,080
- Will you take me as your disciple?
- I don't need a disciple.

633
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,750
Why are you touching it a little?

634
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,420
- I don't need an disciple.
- Make me an disciple!

635
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,750
Excuse me, can I get by?

636
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,430
ACHOO.

637
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,770
Remote licking?

638
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,070
Remote licking.

639
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,720
- Ouch!
- Oh, sorry!

640
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,390
- So sorry!
- It hurts.

641
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,830
Sorry.
Really sorry.

642
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,460
That hurt, didn't it?
I'm sorry.

643
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,530
I would definitely laugh at something like this.

644
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,370
It shows the gentle side of Kotouge.

645
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:30,040
He didn't mean to go that far.

646
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,340
It's like shaking hands.

647
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,640
Thank you for your time today.

648
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,210
Thank you.

649
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,850
Thank you.

650
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:45,850
We are friends.

651
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,320
Thank you.

652
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,460
She is an idiot.

653
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,820
The thing came off.

654
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,070
Kotouge is so close!

655
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,910
- Look at this.
- Wait a moment. Yamamoto-san, don't...

656
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,780
He is so close!.

657
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,450
- It was close...
- Thanks.

658
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,460
Yuriyan, go put something on.

659
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,390
This nipple is insane.

660
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,430
- Too many dirty jokes.
- Yeah, especially the nipple is not good.

661
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,100
- Don't make any more nipple jokes.
- It's over.

662
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,900
- Hey, get your nipple somewhere else.

663
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,040
Really?

664
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,870
Hey, don't do that!!

665
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,240
Hey, don't stir my coffee with your nipple, asshole!!

666
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:44,010
Don't stir this with your nipple, aaaaahhhhh!!

667
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,910
She laughed.

668
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,080
She just laughed.

669
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,490
She was completely unharmed.

670
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,620
He made the defensive Yuriyan laugh.

671
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,530
That was close!

672
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,630
What the hell.

673
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,760
Yuriyan!

674
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,830
Yuriyan laughed.

675
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:12,040
Yuriyan's stronghold was broken.

676
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:13,340
That was close.

677
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,780
Kotouge did well.

678
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,010
This is pretty awesome.

679
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,750
It is rare to see Yuriyan laugh so clearly.

680
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,420
This was too hilarious.

681
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,890
Let's see the replay.
She laughed clearly.

682
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,000
You laughed.

683
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,370
You laughed, right?

684
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,010
She is laughing hysterically.

685
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,980
She laughed for the first time.

686
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,080
Yellow card.

687
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,590
Now everyone got a card from me.

688
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,650
Good luck.

689
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,960
Come on.

690
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,900
I was really close to laughing when your nipple came off.

691
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,130
I was really close.

692
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,670
That was too hilarious.

693
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,430
Yeah, that was insane.

694
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,910
Here we go.

695
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,980
It has started again.

696
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,180
- He did tsukkomi and won point.
- Yeah.

697
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,720
The time has finally come.

698
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,620
Come on!

699
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,630
What's going on?

700
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,270
Again?

701
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,010
- He got hit on the head again.
- He is always being hit by someone.

702
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,150
Why did you high-five?

703
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,860
Ow.

704
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,990
Hey, what's going on?

705
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,230
He suddenly....

706
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,400
It's only natural that this would happen.

707
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,670
Yeah, it's only natural.

708
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,390
Stop doing that.

709
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,800
Hey, someone's here.

710
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,670
Oh, I forgot to bring sunglasses.

711
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,230
Oh, I forgot to bring sunglasses.

712
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,570
Oh, I forgot to bring sunglasses.

713
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,870
Please don't do that.

714
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:00,540
Oh, I forgot....

715
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,510
Oh, I forgot to bring sunglasses.

716
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,220
Oh, I forgot to bring sunglasses.

717
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,750
Long ago it really happened to you.

718
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,520
I can't see ahead.

719
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:17,120
You forgot to bring your sunglasses when you were performing at the office gig.

720
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:21,560
You had no choice but to paint the glasses in the waiting room black.

721
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,630
He went out on stage.
But he was wearing those sunglasses and couldn't see in front of him, so he fell off the stage into the audience.

722
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,140
I forgot to bring my sunglasses, so it can't be helped.

723
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,540
Don't say "He".

724
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:35,940
I am Sakurai of Mr. Children.
(Note: 18)

725
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,210
I forgot to bring sunglasses.

726
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,050
You fell off the stage because you were wearing it.

727
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,750
- I am your fan, Sakurai-san.
- Huh?

728
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,290
- I am your fan.
- Really?
- Yes.

729
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,760
What part of this looks like Sakurai?

730
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,730
Sakurai-san, your...

731
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,200
I forgot to bring sunglasses.

732
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,400
Your sunglasses are black.

733
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,070
Because I forgot to bring it.

734
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:04,470
If you paint the glasses black, they will become Sakurai-san's sunglasses.

735
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,870
You want me to put this in you?

736
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,670
Please!

737
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,110
- You want me to put this in you?
- Please!

738
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,780
- You want me to put this in you?
- Please!

739
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,110
Is this the urethra?

740
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,310
What's he doing all of a sudden?

741
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,150
This is...

742
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,120
- You want me to put this in you?
- Please!

743
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,620
- Hey, you want me to put this in you?
- Please!

744
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,560
- Get your ass over here!!
- Yes!

745
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,460
- Hey, you want me to put this in you?
- Please!

746
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,700
- Hey, you want me to put this in you?

747
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,670
He drew a sudden urethral opening.

748
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,300
- He drew beautiful straight line.
- Right.

749
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,140
It is hard to believe he was the first to draw this.

750
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,780
He drew a very beautiful line without a mirror.

751
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,310
- Are you cleaning here every morning, Monk?
- Yes.
- Thank you Monk.

752
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,080
- He has not acted since wearing Fuwa-chan's clothes.
- Yeah.

753
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,190
Monks seem to be busy every morning.

754
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,590
Actually, I am not a monk.

755
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,490
Who are you?

756
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,930
I am still in training.

757
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,930
But you seem pretty seasoned.

758
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,500
Monk, look behind you.

759
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,100
Who are you?

760
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,200
Phimosis.

761
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,110
This is dangerous.
Can he breathe?

762
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,810
Can he breathe?

763
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,710
Are you trying to pull back the foreskin?

764
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,780
You can't  pull back the foreskin?

765
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,590
That's a pain.

766
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,520
How can I help you?

767
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,520
I can't pull back my foreskin.

768
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,330
Someone please surgery on me.

769
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,700
He seems to want surgery.

770
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,170
Is there a doctor here?

771
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,640
I'll cut foreskin off, just wait a second.

772
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,970
Now you can easily pull back the foreskin.
How do you like it?

773
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,640
It's much easier to pull back my foreskin.
Can you pull back it?

774
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,050
Veins become visible.

775
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,350
There are eyes, nose, and mouth on the dick.

776
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,820
- He is laughing.
- Yeah.

777
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,020
Kotouge laughed.

778
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,530
Maybe it's me.

779
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,800
You blew yourself up again!?

780
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,500
What's going on?

781
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,300
Well...

782
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,300
You blew yourself up again?

783
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,340
I got that look on my face again.

784
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,310
He had the same look on his face when he cracked the egg.

785
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,580
Because it was funny.

786
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,310
Kotouge.

787
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:29,550
I blew it.

788
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,980
I know how you feel.
I know you did that look as an expression, right?

789
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,050
Yeah, right.

790
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:39,790
I get what you were doing, but you're on thin ice.

791
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,030
Let's see the replay.

792
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,530
This is like an accident.

793
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,970
It's....

794
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,080
You showed your face with a smile.

795
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,380
You showed your face with a smile.

796
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,320
This may have been an accident.

797
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,820
I know exactly how you feel.
But this can't be helped.

798
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,760
Kotouge, you are dismissed.

799
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,010
I am very sorry.

800
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,070
- There are only four of us left.
- Yes.

801
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,380
He pulled back his dick foreskin and dismissed.

802
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,180
Thank you.

803
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,650
Thank you!

804
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,980
Oh, I lost, it's frustrating.

805
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:48,560
More often than last time I almost laughed.

806
00:42:53,900 --> 00:43:01,370
I thought I could hold back without laughing, but I did.

807
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,710
But I didn't fight a battle that I would regret.

808
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,150
I showed my shit and my dick.

809
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,220
I am the kind of person who finds shit and dicks funny.

810
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:22,260
So I'm glad I finally did that one.

811
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,080
Grand Champion Tournament winner is....
