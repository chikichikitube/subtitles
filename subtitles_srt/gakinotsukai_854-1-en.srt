1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,130
Murakami Shoji's classroom series started without anyone wanting it

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,430
It started with a ninja class

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,400
You're just an old fart!

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,610
You're not a ninja or anything!

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,980
and continued a green beret class

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,490
And today's class is...

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,900
Get yourself together!

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,430
Thanks for helping me

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,600
Matsumoto san. Yes?

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,030
The hell's that?

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,600
Well...

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,200
How shall I put it

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,370
I think we're pirates now

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,530
You're right

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,230
We're all pirates now

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,760
Our dear viewers, you've probably noticed that

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,030
Shoji already summoned us a few times

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,760
He wants us to dress up like this

19
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,230
Is this our fourth time?

20
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,630
But didn't he tell us about it?

21
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,130
It's officially the third one

22
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,870
I've heard from staff

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,930
That the most exciting part about it, is our meeting day

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,100
So far, our gathering is the most exciting

25
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,330
Our group arrives at a park

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,730
Are we supposed to walk like that around the city?

27
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,170
Right in front of the highway

28
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,970
I think, I saw it from the highway

29
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:41,770
Really?

30
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,430
This ship?

31
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,700
Right away...

32
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,200
Blackbeard?

33
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,230
"Put a stick through this hole"

34
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,830
Hamada san, please do it

35
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,400
Good morning!

36
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,070
What was that for?

37
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,730
Well, were you surprised?

38
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,750
The man who jumped out with a bang, was Murakami Shoji

39
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,070
Are you all fired up?

40
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,270
Big brother, what are we doing today?

41
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,770
What?

42
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,600
Repeat that

43
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,430
What are we doing today, big brother?

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,930
Today your brother...

45
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,880
WHO THE FUCK DO YOU CALL BROTHER?

46
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,930
WHO THE FUCK IS BROTHER HERE?

47
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,770
I'm Captain!

48
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,430
I may be a captain, but I'm not your average club captain

49
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,530
Do you get it?

50
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,830
I'M FREAKING CAPTAIN KIDD!!

51
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,300
I think, you're a bit too loud

52
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,470
A policeman may come here

53
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,930
Because of the screams

54
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,130
We're pirates

55
00:02:59,130 --> 00:02:59,930
Understand?

56
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,270
Well, we are now

57
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,400
You're just like Captain Hook

58
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,070
Like Captain Hook

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,630
That's a hook right there

60
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,770
You're wrong

61
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,660
That one's from a fishery cooperative

62
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,470
This one

63
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,600
You've already mentioned that you're a pirate

64
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,140
CAPTAIN MATSUMOTO!

65
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,100
Yes, excuse me!

66
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,870
COME OVER HERE!

67
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,500
Come to me

68
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,110
Aren't you a bit fat?

69
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,100
No, I don't think so

70
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,770
Then, alright for now

71
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,300
You see, today

72
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,620
is the third installment in our series

73
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,530
We're pirates!

74
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes. Understand?

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,170
"Please don't expect much from this episode. Nothing much will happen right through to the end."
Yes. Understand?

76
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,070
"Please don't expect much from this episode. Nothing much will happen right through to the end."

77
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,930
Don't you think we can avoid doing it?
"Please don't expect much from this episode. Nothing much will happen right through to the end."

78
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,130
"Please don't expect much from this episode. Nothing much will happen right through to the end."

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,430
I'm so tired of listening to your whining

80
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,030
Is that so?

81
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
And shall we always be eager to do it?

82
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
That's right!

83
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,330
As a matter of fact, I was born here...

84
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,630
So, have some compassion!

85
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,430
How many years ago did that happen?

86
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,170
Do you see the nuance

87
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,970
All of it? Yes

88
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,500
Listen up

89
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,800
First of all the pirates are...

90
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,470
Excuse us

91
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,400
It flies over here again

92
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,630
What have we done wrong?

93
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,930
HALT!

94
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,670
Listen

95
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,500
Do you want to sail on ship?

96
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,230
But it's still too early for ya

97
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,270
Look over here!

98
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,030
That's our pirate frigate!

99
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,900
What are you laughing at?

100
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,630
You're messed up

101
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,170
He must be retarded

102
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,530
He's out of his mind

103
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,530
Only you could have said such thing

104
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,300
The pirate class starts immediately

105
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,130
Starting with the most important training exercises

106
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,330
You still have to train enough on land

107
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,070
Wait for a moment

108
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,000
Cars are so noisy!

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,430
I guess it's hard for him to see

110
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,900
Ah, I see...

111
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,960
Starting with a navigation training!

112
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,870
Yes!

113
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,100
He really glares at you (Yamasaki)

114
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,200
What's your name?

115
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,230
Yamasaki!

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,800
Yes

117
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,630
Fine

118
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,390
Can you please seat on a bench?

119
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,530
Alright

120
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,530
Just seat there

121
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,500
Wait a moment!

122
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,860
He really hates him...

123
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,190
But I hadn't done anything!

124
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,530
YOUR FATHER

125
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,770
BULLIED ME A LOT!

126
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,630
Always getting on my nerves

127
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,630
I was called Captain Seasickness

128
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,000
I had a mental breakdown!

129
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,270
Get lost!

130
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,730
You'd better apologize, Yama chan

131
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,660
If I apologize, will you forgive me?

132
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,890
If I apologize, will you forgive me?

133
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,990
Please, forgive him!

134
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,170
Please, we ask you!

135
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,090
Show me your consistency

136
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,900
Show me better your consistency

137
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,260
He just showed him hands...

138
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,260
Are you a boke?

139
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,870
What was that?

140
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,830
I am sorry for that

141
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,370
What did you hear?

142
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,000
"Show me your hands"

143
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,030
Why would I need your hands?

144
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,800
I am sorry for mishearing you

145
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,000
But, I want to do it with everyone!

146
00:06:59,300 --> 00:06:59,930
Please, forgive me!

147
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,430
Please forgive him!

148
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,230
What shall I do?

149
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,570
Forgive him, please!

150
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,100
Don't even dream about it

151
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,970
Shall we train on land?

152
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,230
Yes, please... Get lost

153
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,270
Place your ass on the bench and watch us

154
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,230
Endo

155
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,630
Can you push me from behind?

156
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,400
Yes

157
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,000
Just push it a little bit. I see...

158
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,830
Let's go. Be careful...

159
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,770
Alright

160
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,770
Raise anchor!

161
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,130
Full starboard!

162
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,170
I said full starboard

163
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,660
Why did he jump out so sudden?

164
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,730
Didn't I say full starboard?

165
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,030
I am not very sure...

166
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,630
which side is it...

167
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,830
Starboard means right side!

168
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,630
I see, right side

169
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,630
Starboard means right side

170
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,030
Correct. Yes, I'm sorry

171
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,630
He switched so suddenly...

172
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,700
Raise anchor!

173
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,530
Roger

174
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,830
Full starboard!

175
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,500
Full starboard!

176
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,230
Full port!

177
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,970
You're good!

178
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,070
I see...

179
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,830
It sounds in Japanese like a vessel's direction
Full of memories

180
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,100
It sounds in Japanese like a vessel's direction

181
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,370
I said "full of memories"

182
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,370
Didn't I?

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,170
Didn't I?

184
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,000
Tell it

185
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,060
Last year, I had much fun with my family in Okinawa

186
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,900
What's that?

187
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,900
Is that a chocolate? That's a biscuit. He really likes him a lot

188
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,930
That's for your family

189
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,330
Thank you very much! Good job

190
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,930
Is it 'cause he's young?

191
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,330
Let's continue

192
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,200
Endo!

193
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,500
Endo is right in front of you! Captain, what's the matter?

194
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,700
What's the matter with you, captain? We don't understand you!

195
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,600
Let's go

196
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,670
All together now

197
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,800
What a relief! Thank you so much!

198
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,690
Life on frigate is impossible for a pirate

199
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,570
without a superhuman sense of balance

200
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,630
We're going to do some highly difficult training

201
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,770
What's that?

202
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,500
That thing...

203
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,900
That thing?

204
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,030
Fall in!

205
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,570
Yes! What's that? Listen carefully

206
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,100
The sea

207
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,470
is calm sometimes

208
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,870
but usually it is choppy

209
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:57,870
Because of it

210
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,430
During a battle

211
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,370
you must be stable

212
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,170
We are going to train it here

213
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,130
Got it?

214
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,200
Delivery

215
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,530
from a soba restaurant

216
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,570
Let's give it a try

217
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,100
Tanaka!

218
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,530
Get on the bike

219
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,300
Good luck!

220
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,100
That's tough...

221
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,370
That's very difficult

222
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,000
That's scary!

223
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,230
And drive it over there. Wait a moment!

224
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,170
Captain!

225
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,670
What's up?

226
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,700
The balance...

227
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,770
What's the matter? It's fine, just that angle...

228
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,130
What's that?

229
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,030
My shoulder...

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,730
No way... Are you joking?

231
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,570
No way, you're serious

232
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,300
Really?

233
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,530
Are you for real?

234
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,570
Maybe you're not fit to be a pirate?

235
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:53,760
When you'll be climbing the mast ropes, are you gonna be like this?

236
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,900
Some would need to save you

237
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,370
He's right

238
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,370
That would be quite...

239
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,230
It still looks very tough...

240
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,690
Will it really help for the battle? Hold it tight!

241
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,630
Just go ahead at once

242
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,430
Go for it!

243
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,830
What was it?

244
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,800
Wait a moment

245
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:18,900
My shoulder...

246
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,930
What?!

247
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,930
And you, Hamada san?

248
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,270
What's that?

249
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,170
How can you even move like that?

250
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,370
Is your leg alright, captain?

251
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,760
No way you'll be a pirate like that!

252
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,570
Captain...

253
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,630
Captain, perhaps...

254
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,900
You could show us how to do it?

255
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,700
Please, show us

256
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,370
That's right

257
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,900
Please, show us once

258
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,930
Oh, captain, look good

259
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,830
Oh, great!

260
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:45,870
Go for it!

261
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,470
You were so disjointed...

262
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,530
Wait...

263
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,770
What was that?

264
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,700
It's dangerous to be on the sea

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,400
You can't do that much on land!

266
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,030
You have no right being on a ship!

267
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,300
You look like you never wanted to be pirates!

268
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,100
Listen up

269
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
WE'RE NOT PLAYING GAMES HERE!

270
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:21,700
We're sorry

271
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,930
You should be all salarymen

272
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,230
with a bonus twice a year!

273
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,860
How often do pirates get that much money?

274
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,930
Let's move on...

275
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
You're hopeless...

276
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,700
Training on land is the same

277
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,800
We're sorry

278
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,630
Let's get on a ship

279
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,070
On ship?

280
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:46,930
Can we?

281
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,600
Get on it?

282
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,630
Thank you very much!

283
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,900
Thank you very much!

284
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,030
Isn't it better to teach practice on boat?

285
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:52,930
Thank you ver much!

286
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,900
Am I right?

287
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,500
Come aboard

288
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,670
It's so easy to enter

289
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,790
That's too easy

290
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,530
It's very impressive

291
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,730
It's so cool, captain!

292
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,970
Listen up, this is our vessel now

293
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,660
It's totally different, being on board

294
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,630
We've been on top and on the bottom

295
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,200
Right?

296
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,170
Listen up

297
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,890
What's the best thrill of being a pirate?

298
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,470
I guess...

299
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,560
Getting rich very quick?

300
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,160
You're spot on

301
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,000
Thank you very much!

302
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,370
Treasure hunt!

303
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,270
We see...

304
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,390
Pirates are pirates only if they repeatedly pillage and hunt for treasure

305
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,970
What's the essence of it?

306
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,500
Turn around

307
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:42,970
Over there

308
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,660
We have a treasure chest

309
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,430
Inside it

310
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,860
There's a treasure trove in there

311
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,430
so everyone has ten seconds

312
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,330
to get one treasure for yourself

313
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,800
Go and snatch things that are not gold

314
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Yes

315
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,730
Okay

316
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,030
You have ten seconds, go

317
00:13:59,170 --> 00:13:59,970
Get set!

318
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:00,870
Go!

319
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,990
Alright, bring it all here!

320
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,570
10 seconds are up

321
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,270
Why did you take it?

322
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,070
To be fair...

323
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,100
I had no intention to take it

324
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,430
I'm sorry

325
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,200
Did I do well?

326
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,630
What 'bout you?

327
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,270
I took a log...

328
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,630
This could be rented, compared to his

329
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,530
Who would buy it?

330
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,430
Excuse me

331
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,490
You're definitely not a connoisseur

332
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,100
Me...

333
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,370
I got a gold bar

334
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,630
I don't want it!

335
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,800
But don't pirates have lots of these?

336
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,200
Take it off

337
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,770
TAKE IT OFF!!!

338
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:25,970
I'm sorry

339
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,470
I took it off

340
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,700
He did it...

341
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,470
He was envious

342
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,460
They definitely don't fit him

343
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,200
How to survive after a long period

344
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,370
adrift in the ocean

345
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,330
due to an unforeseen disaster?

346
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,100
When you're in the sea

347
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,730
You're in an open space

348
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,930
Then a ship sinks, or something

349
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,300
Or get attacked by a dinosaur

350
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,100
Yes

351
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,860
What's the most important thing for a man at that time?

352
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,500
What is tit?

353
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,970
Water, I guess... You're right

354
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,100
Thank you very much!

355
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,330
But

356
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,770
When you're adrift, there's no rainwater

357
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,590
There's no fresh water

358
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,500
You're in the sea

359
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,460
It's sea water everywhere

360
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,270
We understand

361
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,600
Here it comes...

362
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,370
Ah, I see

363
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,970
So much...

364
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,030
Sea of Japan has 3,5% of salinity

365
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,930
That was so much, captain...

366
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,830
So much...

367
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,400
So, it should be like this

368
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,530
Sea of Japan has 3,5% of salinity

369
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,900
When you go to the south

370
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,830
It gets 0.5% thicker

371
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,730
Just like hatcho miso

372
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,570
Hamada!

373
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:54,970
Yes?

374
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,430
Please

375
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,830
Don't you want to survive?

376
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,830
I will drink it!

377
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,430
It's like, it can't melt

378
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,770
It's just sinking down there

379
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,700
Captain

380
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,370
That's no good...

381
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,430
You're so useless...

382
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,370
Captain, won't you?

383
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,600
Please

384
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,500
Please, so it

385
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,400
Please, captain!

386
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,560
As can be expected from you, captain!

387
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,930
What's the matter, captain?

388
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,470
Captain?

389
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,670
That was fast...

390
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,000
He just spat it

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,500
Captain, what have you done?

392
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,530
Anyway...

393
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,800
Let's move on

394
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,430
You drink so much!

395
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,530
Listen, captain

396
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,930
That's unfair, you can't do that

397
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,380
Wait for me under the slide

398
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,000
Yes

399
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,300
If you want to be a captain, you have to be able to pull of these kinds of tricks

400
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,900
On this slide, to the bottom

401
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,430
This thing

402
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,300
I'll bring it down with me

403
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,570
I see...

404
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,930
Please be careful, captain!

405
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,030
I'm fine

406
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,760
That's very spectacular

407
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,330
He's fabulous!

408
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,030
Captain, that's great!

409
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,500
Alright, let's move on

410
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,030
Let's move

411
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,000
Captain, you're drenched...

412
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,870
Let's comtinue

413
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,260
What was that, captain?

414
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,030
A pirate must never give up the fight to the last

415
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,030
even when his weapons run out

416
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,470
The set up is

417
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,070
You've driven into a tomato field

418
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,990
Are you sure, that relates to pirates? Shouldn't we deal with ships?

419
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,990
Of course, there are such situations!

420
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:13,970
Alright

421
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,300
You've driven into a tomato field

422
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
So, what are you going to use as a weapon?

423
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,100
I don't really know...

424
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,530
You only have tomatoes!

425
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,630
You will use tomatoes

426
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,030
You'll tear them off

427
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,470
You'll aim at your enemy's vital point

428
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,800
and throw it

429
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,800
Hence...

430
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,600
We have to choose one target

431
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,300
Let's get serious

432
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,760
Captain, will you also take part?

433
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
Yep

434
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,930
Will decide turns with rock-paper-scissors

435
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,270
And we'll decide it

436
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,200
through the Pop-up Pirate!

437
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,330
That's dangerous...

438
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,800
We'll play it

439
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,460
This ordering determines the fate of the six people

440
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,370
Let's start!

441
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,470
I'm going first?

442
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
My heart is pounding!

443
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,600
I absolutely hate it!

444
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm starting!

445
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,770
That thing...

446
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,800
Alright, alright

447
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,530
You can do it

448
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,500
Don't pop!

449
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:44,930
Who's turn now?

450
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,500
Captain

451
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,030
I don't wanna do it...

452
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,600
Put it!

453
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,170
Now, Tanaka

454
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,530
Do it carefully

455
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,730
This looks bad...

456
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,330
It's so scary... How are you supposed to choose it...

457
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,530
Hamada, you should be fine!

458
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,570
Hamada, that's fine

459
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,170
And, now my turn

460
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,960
I can't help but feel like it's going to pop

461
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,470
Please, pop up!

462
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,660
It's horrifying!

463
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,200
That's so bad, so bad...

464
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,300
I think there are ten left...

465
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,000
Go for that one

466
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,930
I beg you...

467
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,930
Don't... Yes!

468
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,670
I'm done if it pops...

469
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,700
Captain, I don't think that's your turn now...

470
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,700
You've messed up

471
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,270
I don't think that's good...

472
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,270
Indeed

473
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,030
Yes, but I already did it...

474
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,770
But you've messed up our order

475
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,900
I don't think such behavior is good from a pirate

476
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,160
Please, stab it once more

477
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,260
We're sorry captain...

478
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,500
Please, pop up!

479
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,700
Please, captain!

480
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,720
"Captain is the target"

481
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,930
"What will be the captain's fate after this!?"

482
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,230
Alright

483
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,600
Look at my eyes and throw at me!

484
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,400
Yes, that can't be helped

485
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,630
We're sorry!

486
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,370
Fine... Ready?

487
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,300
Look out!

488
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,330
He's trying to say something

489
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,170
What's that?

490
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,330
Why am I zoning out?

491
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,830
What?

492
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,330
CAPTAIN!?

493
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:12,770
CAPTAIN!

494
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,430
These are the tomatoes for Kagome juice...

495
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,530
What's that?

496
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,870
Let's go home...

497
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,470
"These tomatoes were later washed and eaten by the staff"

498
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,270
It wasn't worth it
"These tomatoes were later washed and eaten by the staff"

499
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,570
"These tomatoes were later washed and eaten by the staff"

500
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,140
COME BACK!!!
"These tomatoes were later washed and eaten by the staff"

501
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,370
COME BACK!!!

502
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,100
HEY!

503
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,600
PUT SOME KETCHUP ON ME!!!

504
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,730
WAIT!

505
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,900
WAIT FOR A MOMENT!

506
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,070
I'm going to announce a championship for that!
