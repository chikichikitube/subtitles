How is it?

69
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,440
The texture is firm

70
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,110
You've put a lot of different things in your mouth, right?

71
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,110

Translator's note: Yoshimoto is their production company

74
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,650
If you chew it like that, it feels more stiff

75
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,550
His tongue's surface is the dirtiest in all of Yoshimoto

I think I know this, though

113

No, it was surprisingly different

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,770
Only when Endo is onscreen

136
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,640
Can we switch the low quality display

137
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,640
at the Tokyo Tower?

138
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,100
Especially for him!

139
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,650
That's rather amazing!

140
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,650
In this high-tech world, we'd revert to analog TV!

141
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,920
Oh, this is so delicious

142
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,720
There's white shrimp in it... Oh but the flavor is very different

143
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,090
It sounds like he's saying "white snake"*

144
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,830
*translator's note: shrimp is "ebi"; snake is "hebi"

145
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,830
Hard to hear

146
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,830
So difficult to hear

147
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,050
The one I ate was NOT White Shrimp Sausage

148
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,130
He's being harshly criticized

149
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,650
He usually doesn't have that sort of character

150
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,600
They're really bad, yeah

151
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,540
(Junior)

152
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,540
If I was the kouhai,

153
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,540
I would definitely be bullied

154
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,010
"You, what the hell!?"

155
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,110
"What the hell kind of response is that?"

156
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,150
Reject, reject everything

157
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,820
What are you going on about..?

158
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,620
You guys can keep that to yourselves

He's not going to stall here

169
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,370
Maybe it's about time I go for my target

170
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,770
You've had a target?

171
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,870
Yes, my target is this "Homo Sausage"

LET'S GO, this homo sausage

177
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,920
For 60 years, right?

178
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,910
Whaaat?

179
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
No, it wasn't this stiff

180
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,620
Ahhh, but then

181
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,710
It has the same

182
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,170
"Whoa I'm eating a fish meat sausage" sort of sense I got up there

183
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,820
Ah yeah, you were saying that

184
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,150
But it really wasn't this stiff

185
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,400
Maybe I'll go ahead anyway

186
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,400
maybe I'll take the chance

187
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,310
Oh, that's what you meant

188
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,310
Yes

189
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,510
It's been 60 years (since its announcement), so as a long selling...

190
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,510
When you say 60 years, that's really amazing

191
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,980
about as long as Ke-shi-

192
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,000
Japanese actor

193
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,000
Ke-shi- Takamine*

194
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,650
longer than that

195
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,350
The sausage's history is as long as Ke-shi- Takamine's career

196
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,250
I might do it anyway

197
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,020
I've seen this before too...

198
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,870
I ate it right here, too

199
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,450
Here goes

200
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,450
Ahh, I'm begging you please

201
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:30,200
The one I ate WAS Maruzen Homo Sausage

202
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,350
Of course not!

203
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,150
You can't fail as the first challenger!

204
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,820
Ahh it's so difficult...

205
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,370
Ah ah he's here he's here

206
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,660
SHALL I TRAIN YOUR BRAIN TOO?

207
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,660
SHALL I TRAIN YOUR BRAIN TOO?

208
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,660
SHALL I TRAIN YOUR BRAIN TOO?

209
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,470
What?

210
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,450
I might not want this

211
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,620
That was very strict, too

212
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,720
This- ah- this is very strict

213
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,010
Well you were first up so it couldnt've been helped

214
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,340
It was dried out, so it was a bit stiff

215
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,250
The humidity is high today

216
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,250
Yes

217
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,250
so I don't know what could have dried it out

218
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,250
Is it dried out?

219
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,450
Are you going to use this footage of me getting scolded?

220
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,820
That's all we're going to use!

227
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,070
You can't do that to your senpai

228
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,070
Yeah, you can't do that

229
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,940
Hamada is so annoying

231
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,080
I'm going to eat it all in one go

232
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,320
Well you're allowed to eat it however you want

233
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,590
Yeah

234
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,150
Oh yeah

235
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,370
Yeah

236
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,220
It has a good amount of stickiness

243
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,800

244

with something that's totally different?

252
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,670
You'll gauge it from the difference

253
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,120
Yes, I'll see what I'm dealing with

254

Yes, one is enough

The one I ate was NOT BIG Arabiki Sausage

265
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,600
Well, if you had gotten it wrong there that would have been...

266
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,500
But you purposely tried the one that was the most different, right?

267
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,670
So you'll get closer now?

268
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,670
Yes, with this I will get closer to it

269
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,500
I'll narrow it down

270
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,010
Yeah, that's right. That's how you get it right.

271
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,250
We didn't ask him

272

WHAT IS IT?

284
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,430
It came to me stronger

285
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,430
You're not making sense

286
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,600
Are you serious?

287
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,070
I felt like it came stronger

288
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,370
Oh that's it? I had NO idea

289
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,370
NO idea

290
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,370
That's what he wanted to say

291
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,370
It's close, it's actually very close

292
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,670
but the stiffness is different

293
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,410
the flavor is also different

294
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,410
No, this is aimed for children

No, the flavor was stronger

00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,420

It's not...

356
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
He's really sniffing it

357
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,240
Just look at that, how disgusting

358
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,110

359
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,580
So grotesque

360
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,350
Is it "guro"?

364
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,330
Yes, it has a sense of "yes, this is a sausage"

365
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,250
Now, I don't want to take too much time

366

That will help you win, right

367
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,340
These over here have something in them, right?

If you take out the fish meat, then there's nothing left

373

We're doing fish meat, you know

374
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,820
He should remain faithful to the title

375
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,590

376
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,390

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,630

This has a very light flavor

396
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,200
The one I had was more like, "sausaaage"

397
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,270
Yes but that one is very...

398
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,930
It must be the oldest one here

399
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,710

He's sleeping around

His pants' zippers are very loose

418
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,840
from what I've heard

419
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,480
"Guro" it's "guro"

420

No, I'm telling you this is super close

423
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,670
So that means you'll choose that one?

424
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,370
Well I've already eaten it, so I'm wondering which to choose

425
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,250
but the thing is, this was the one that went to Tanaka;

426
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,340
would the same one be used for me?

427
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,640

429
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,280
He's thinking about making a call*

430
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:55,720
Translator's note: Kakeru (the word they're using) means to risk and to make a call

431
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,620
If you risk it once,

432
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,620
then you have to go all in

433
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,720
Yes

434
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,720
You're right

435
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,300
Oh, he's holding the receiver

436
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,850
Is he going to call?

437
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,420
Here he goes

438
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,420
It's better to call

439
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,400
Ah whatever

440
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,980
I'm gonna do it anyway

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,050
it's no use to ponder it

442
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,280
it was so bland

00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,280

00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,110

449
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,240

493
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,270
the surface was very smooth

494
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,900

495
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,150
Aren't they all like that?

496
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,850
That one is so rough, there are rough ones

497
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,770
You won't know unless you test with your tongue

498
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,940
Ah but wait a minute,

499
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,810
what should I choose with-

500
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,840
I'll base it off of the saltiness

501
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,670
alright

502
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,450

the smell is completely different

526
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,270
the hardness is also completely different

527
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,230
this one is not a problem

528
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:50,340
The one I ate was NOT Maruzen's Homo Sausage!

529
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,000
SO SHITTY!

530
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,570
No more of this!

You got it on the first try!

534
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,650
I was really struggling not to laugh

535
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,880
I was really struggling not to laugh

536
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,150
It was RIGHT AFTER you ate it

537
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,650
You're kidding right!?

538
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,440
It was so bad,

539
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,520
he was SO CLOSE and then he decided, "Nope, it's totally different"

540
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,100
What the hell!?

541
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,470

I didn't understand a thing

545
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,220
What did he even say

546
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,600
I have no idea of what he just said

547
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,320

548
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,400

550
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,610

Of course that would happen

569
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,540
It got stuck in your throat

570
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,770
Well the pieces are big, so

571
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,700
You're an idiot

572
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,270
Ah, it came out

573
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:25,920
He actually tasted it firmly and the results!?

669
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,500

Wrong

673
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,500
It's completely wrong

674
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,770
The one I ate was NOT Fish Sausage!

675
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,970

676
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,470

I wanted to hear the one from earlier

693
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,250
There are only 4 remaining...

694
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,350
This is it, this is where I will show you the difference between my level and yours

695
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,320
I feel like I've eaten this one before, and this one, ahhh

696
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,700
