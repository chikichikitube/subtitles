You know, I think we are all in serious trouble today.

Serious trouble?

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,460
Well you know....

11
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,430
The cruel staff here...

12
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,500
That's true.

13
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,530
That's true.

14
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,540
So it must be seriously difficult to get correct!

15
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,540

Yes, 12 usually.

Correct, 12 usually.

22
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,140
But this time...

23
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,510
Because we are just not winning at all in recent times...

24
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,880
They took our age into

25
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,880
consideration, thinking that our tongues are just not functioning anymore.

26
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,700
They're worried about us, and that's why they've decreased it to 10...

First Challenger

52
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,330
The first challenger is Endo, who has not gotten a Kiki right in eight years.

53
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,900
The one chosen for him:

54
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,500
I see...

55
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,030
Tezutsumi Tsubuanpan

56
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,460
The red bean has been put into the bread by hand and baked, a delicious anpan.

57
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,460
Well, it can't be helped.

58
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,330
There's no point in eating it in a clean manner...

59
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,310
Damn, this is tasty.

60
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,780
The grains in this are quite big.

61
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,800
They are quite big and firm, that's one of the clues.

62
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
The size?

63
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,800
Yes.

64
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,030
The bread...

65
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,630
Don't do that on camera...

66
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,300
People don't really want

67
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,300
to look at that kind of thing on their 4K TV's.

68
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,330

The prices are from 91 Yen to around 130 Yen today.

76
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,700
All around the 100 yen mark.

77
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,160
Yes.

78
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,730
This Oginopan, Tanzawa Anpan

79
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,110

it's most likely not

his on air time that little bit.

94
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,950
just to increase

95
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,630
It's his only way.

96
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,230
That's his usual way of thinking.

97
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,130
So easy to read the younger ones.

98
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,130
It really is.

99
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,130
I'm going for Oginopan.

100
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,860
Damn, that's tasty.

101
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,100
Maybe he really loves Anpan.

102
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,770
Damn, is anpan

103
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,770
really this tasty and delicious?

104
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,310
Who the fuck are you asking!?

105
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,100
Of course he would snap at you.

106
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,130
No no, don't get me wrong.

107
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,860
I genuinely don't know who he is asking.

108
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,200
But anyway, the taste is different anyway.

109
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,030
It's wrong?

110
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,030
It's wrong.

111
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,130
The red bean tasted simple.

112
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,660
They should've gotten a better red bean for this Japanese confectionary.

113
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,590
I'm not really sure what he means...

114
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,830
The one I ate

115
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,900
was NOT Oginopan's Tanzawa Anpan.

116
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,360
Correct!!

117
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,360
Correct!!

118
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,760
Yeah, I was sure about that one.

119
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,760
So the taste was different.

120
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,760
I could tell that the taste was different.

121
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,060
Maybe the size of the grains was just for that bite.

122
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,810
Watch

123
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,130
Yeah, was it just a one off thing or are they all like that...

124
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,730
Some of them are also sold nationally...

125
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,730
I'm really sorry.

126
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,780
This guy was yawning so much that literally

127
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,520
This guy was yawning so much that literally

128
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,520
half of his face became a mouth just now.

129
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,700
Can you believe that?

130
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,700
Senpai, please get a hold of yourself...

131
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,400
What are you on about?

132
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,490
I'm really trying my best, here.

133
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,430
If you were a coin purse, you would have definitely just broken.

134
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,830
If you were a coin purse, you would have definitely just broken.

135
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,130

167

they're kind of there, but like even the size of the grains is just...

How about the taste?

169

no parts we can use for the final edit.

235

236
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,500

237
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,360

305
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,900
Hang on...

306
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,530
The taste wasn't this light. Which means...

307
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,260
it's this one, Daichi-ya.

308
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,130
I can't eat this other one now, right?

309
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,130
Of course not.

310
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,130
I honestly thought it would be Shikishima pan, but

311
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,930
when I tried this one

312
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:47,400
the taste was too refreshing.

313
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
So...

314
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,830
I think it's this Tezutsumi Anpan.

315
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,660
If he gets it wrong he gets punished, but get it correct and get money...

316
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,330
I'm begging you!

317
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,560
The one I ate

318
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,700
WAS this Tezutsumi-Anpan!

319
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:26,050
Correct!!

320
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:26,050
Correct!!

321
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,400
YES, COME ON!!!

322
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,400
Wow, amazing!

323
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,860
Amazing, amazing!

324
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,860
That was amazing.

325
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,400
He went through them all.

326
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,460
I'm so happy!

327
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,200
It's tough on us now the first challenger got it right...

328

What the hell...

333
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,460
Thank you very much!

337
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,810
Endo 2007: Oolong Tea was last time he got it right

338
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,360
Get in!

339
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,830
Thank you so much, seriously.

340
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,860
He got it.

341
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,830
You were moaning the whole time, saying how hard it was.

342
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,130
Yeah, saying "I don't know, I don't know..."

343
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,460
"It's impossible."

344
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,160
But seriously, it is, please try it yourselves, it is really difficult.

345
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,000
There isn't one where you'll say, "Oh, this is wrong" straight away.

346
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,030
Hamada Masatoshi

347
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,030
Hamada Masatoshi

348
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,030
Second Challenger

349
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,030
Second Challenger

350
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,230
Next up is Hamada.

351
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,170
It's fine if we ALL get it correct.

352
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,900
Yes, if all of us get it right we get a total of 500,000 yen.

353
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,870
Let's make them shit themselves.

354
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,100
The one chosen for Hamada:

355
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,060
Kobe-ya, Tannenjyukusei, Tsubuan.

356
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,600
It's very soft and moist

357
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,260
and the refreshing sweet grains make it a perfect combination.

358
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,700
Well, you know...

359
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,060
There is no other way.

360
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,630
You're right, in order to get it right...

361
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,630
He's eating it like this so that he can get it right.

362
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,630
In order to find out information about it.

363
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,960
This isn't that sweet, you know.

364
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,460
But I wonder...these days

365
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,730
red bean isn't that sweet anyway.

366
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,740
Oh, really?

367
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,310
You're right though, the grains are quite firm.

368
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,040
And it's not that sweet.

369
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,360
Those are your hints I guess, huh?

370
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,580
Who the fuck do you think you are, talking down to me like that!?

371
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,920

377
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,260
I know

378
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,260
I guess it really is all about that...

379
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,200
Okay, I will go for this simple looking one.

I haven't got a clue.

394
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,530
It is hard, and that's why they've shrunk it down from 12 to 10.

395
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,100
Actually, I do get what you're saying Endo, but the one I ate before...

396
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,160
I don't think it has this many grains in it.

397
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,430
You know, in the red bean paste.

398
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,730
Then you should know the answer...

399
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,300
So I'm right, this is wrong?

400
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,140
Umm no, I don't know.

401
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,140
Then don't say anything!

402
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,000
You know, I actually

403
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,700
don't look at the correct answer when choosing.

404
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,160
I'm pretty sure the one before

405
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,630
had one or two grains, but this one has

406
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,100
loads everywhere.

407
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,600
It's wrong.

408
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,900
The one I ate was NOT Kobe-ya Tsubuan.

409
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,660
Incorrect!!

410
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,330
What are you doing!?

411
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,730
It hadn't even reached the bin yet!

412
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,260
It literally hadn't!

413
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,260
It hadn't even left his hand yet!

414
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,530
You're kidding me!

415
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,660
It was.

416
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,670
Why did you go for the Kobe-ya first!?

417
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,830
Man, that was quick.

418
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,400
It was totally different, though!

419
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,150
Eat Anpan,

420
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,150
fart, then sleep!

421
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,150
fart, then sleep!

422
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,030
It was the first one!

423
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,600
I'm happy though that we didn't have to spend too long going through all of that.

424
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,800
Yeah, he would never have gotten it right.

425
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,800
He would never have gotten it right.

The third challenger is Tanaka.

431
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,460
The one chosen for him is the same one as Hamada, Kobe-ya Tannenjyukusei Tsubu-an.

432
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,560
Everyone except Hamada needs to get it right.

433
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,630
By all means, please do.

434
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,060
We really will.

435
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,450
Which one is it?

436
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,100
What do you mean by that?

437
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,680
The one I just ate.

438
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,990
I'm not sure if it's sweet

439
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,990
or not sweet.

440
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,830
Then you're screwed.

441
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,560
You're just screwed.

442
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,630

It's not called Yamasaki Pan, is it?

462
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
No, it is Yamazaki Pan.

463
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:41,400
No, it was more refreshing before. The one I ate was a bit less sweet.

464
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,610
That's right.

465
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,780
Why are you saying

466
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,780
it like it's your catchphrase?

467
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,150
I didn't

468
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,150
actually talk about this before,

469
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,120
but I sniffed it, right?

470
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,930
When I did that

471
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
I thought the scent of red bean would hit me harder,

472
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,590
but instead the scent of bread hit me hard.

473
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,590
but instead the scent of bread hit me hard.

00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,920

524

You didn't "see through" anything after all!

I honestly thought you were going to get it!

528
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,130
Yeah, he stopped for a second to think and everything.

529
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,730
You couldn't tell anything about the scent.

530
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,960
You're existence is about as much as red bean paste!

531

What does this mean?

536
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,460
Is it hard after all?

537
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,460
So hard, so hard, it's so hard.

The one chosen for him is Ito-pan's Ogura-pan.

545
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,160
It's not too sweet, and the bread is soft and moist.

550
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,400
Oh, so the thing that is hard is the red bean paste?

551
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,400
Yes.

552

are more amateurish

700
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,660
So true.

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,300

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,800
The last challenger is Matsumoto.

707
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,830
The one chosen for him:

708
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,930
Family Mart's Hokkaido's Azuki Tsubu Anpan

709
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:32,300
From Hokkaido, there is azuki in the bread, which is mixed with a strong tsubu-an in a moist bread.

710
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,100
The bread...

711
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,330
I'll try that.

712
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,900
This edge here...

713
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,360
This guy, this guy...

714
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,830
This division in the bread.

715
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,460
7:3 okay!

716
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,100
It's a 7:3 ratio.

717
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,130
I'll try the bread first. If you try the red bean first,

718
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,530
the bread will lose, so I will just try the bread first.

719
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,900
It's good to just shove the bread into your mouth first.

720
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,600
And to be honest, if my intuition is right,

721
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,160
I don't even really need to try the red bean paste...

722
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
That bread you say is so important just flew out your mouth.
