1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,520
Librarian's Note: Not Subbed until 00:30

2
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:40,140
Subtitles starts at 10 seconds. (this part is a recap. Kinda pointless and hard to understand)

3
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:40,180
Last week's broadcasting

4
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,310
Cocorico Endo's Shichi-Henge

5
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,680
It's hard to think that Tanaka won't succeed, there are no doubts

6
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,520
Rules of Shichi-henge (seven transformations): During the planning meeting, the performer must make one "trasformation" after another. For each time someone is seen laughing, he's prized with 1milion yen!

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,850
Because he can perfom 7 characters, right?

8
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,470
That's right

9
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,430
So... let's call Tanaka here, ok?

10
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,140
Ok!

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,350
Cocorico's Tanaka, please!

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,140
Thanks, good morning!

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,470
So, now are you ready to perform perfectly?

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,020
Cocorico Tanaka Naoki

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,850
I think that the chance of failing is far away, by now

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,970
Where do you think you're going to end up in the ranking?

17
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,100
Of course, the top!

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,060
That's great!

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,350
Because I'm a comedian!

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,060
Though, those people were very funny

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,850
*Matsumoto is mocking Tanaka by pointing his partner, Endo, which scored the bronze medal.

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,850
Yeah yeah, funny...

23
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,850
If I end up getting lower than Yamazaki, than that's a total fail for me.

24
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,140
I'd say that everywhere is fine, as long as you can impress this guy (Hamada)

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,890
That's absolutely right!

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,180
I don't how can I impress him, though

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,970
That's because he's a strange sadist.

28
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:36,060
Translation, Subtitles, Encoding, Timing etc. etc. by Shion (youtube.com/user/ForegroundNoises)

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,310
So everyone, what should we do?

30
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,520
Planning meeting

31
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,220
Our number kinda increased since the other day...

32
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,930
Uhm... Let's see.

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,520
"Gaki no Tsukai staff family's athletic meet opposition"?

34
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,140
Producer - Suga Kenji

35
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,140
Isn't this good?

36
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,970
I'm dead serious, let's do this.

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,350
Budokan: an indoor arena in central Tokyo, where famous artists perform music live showsYanawana(?): That's gotta be something Hawaii-related

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,350
What about "Yanawana (?) hits the budokan?"

39
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,020
Shichi-Henge begins!

40
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,640
That's going to be good right? A hawaiian is totally random there

41
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,060
Though, I really want to see the "Family's Athletic Meet"!

42
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,060
Speaking of which, that's why we need Endo as a team member

43
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,350
And even a recovery place

44
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,810
No, that's just a little of a bad thought.

45
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,220
Right, uh?

46
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,520
Right.

47
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,520
*Each time you spot 罰金 the meaning "penalty" is repeated

48
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,520
Penalty

49
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
What's the meaning of this?

50
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,020
The oxygen that runs off by farting...

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Running out oxygen with farts...

52
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,140
The pitch of the farts had me.

53
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,520
Agreed

54
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,390
Man, he's totally going to hit the podium.

55
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:58,970
*Tanaka is wearing the outfit of a Tengu (天狗), a mythical japanese creature with a long nose.

56
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:04,970
The funny thing is that he's smelling his armpits with it.

57
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,520
Cocorico Endo Shozo

58
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,350
That's so unfair...

59
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,770
That was dangerous!

60
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,520
What do you propose, Yamazaki?

61
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,220
I wonder what can we do...

62
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,470
Should we do a Goodbye Party Consolation?

63
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,970
A Goodbye Party Consolation? No good.

64
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,180
Is that so?

65
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,140
Yes.

66
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,470
Do I look good?

67
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,390
Where aren't they pointy?

68
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,060
That was unexpected!

69
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,310
Hamada laughs way too easily!

70
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:45,850
That's Right!

71
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,850
I always laugh 'cause he's laughing.

72
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,470
In the previous skit, when he was laughing

73
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,270
"Damn, he's already laughing!" I thought.

74
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,890
Maybe we should perform stand-alone entering next time, right?

75
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:04,520
Right

76
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,310
With your right, your right.

77
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Raise your elbow, raise it-

78
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,600
All right, let's go to the court

79
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,270
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

80
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,270
I'm really sorry

81
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
"I'm sorry for touching your butt"

82
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,810
That was unfair

83
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,520
Really!

84
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,890
Wow! That's a nice amount!

85
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,180
If it keeps like that, Tanaka's estimation will start to escalate, that's bad.

86
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
Who knows...

87
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,520
I'm sorry

88
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Everyone is saying "Kitana!" meaning "How Dirty!"

89
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,970
That's against good manners!

90
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,970
That was filthy, wasn't it?!

91
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,970
It totally was.

92
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,850
Enough of fart-gags, geez.

93
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,850
You're right, geez!

94
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,180
Here

95
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,350
I probably won't have enough money to come back (home).

96
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,430
Here we go again, Hamada's laugh that makes me laugh!

97
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,310
That was impossible..

98
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,310
That was great!

99
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,520
Thanks!

100
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:09,520
Thanks!

101
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,720
How many money he gathered?

102
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,430
40,000 Yen!

103
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,310
Did he reach the top?

104
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,060
He reached the top.

105
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,310
Highest Money Amount: 40,000 Yen!

106
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,020
Congratulations on reaching the top!

107
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,470
Thank you!

108
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,020
Maaaaaaaaan!

109
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,270
1st: Cocorico Tanaka - 40,000 Yen

110
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,270
2nd: Director Ootomo - 29,000 Yen

111
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,270
3rd: Manager  Isomata - 25,000 Yen

112
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,890
Now get the hell back home.

113
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,720
Why?!

114
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,220
At this point, please let me say a thing:

115
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,850
*The money gathered in this project will be devoted in beneficence

116
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,850
Tanaka, you did well

117
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,810
You were funny

118
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,180
Even this last white-thingy

119
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:49,350
Subscribe for more clips! Read the description for infos / contacts / etc. ~Shion

120
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,640
uh-uh..

121
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,640
But that wig is not funny at all.

122
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,640
You mean those?

123
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,310
I think if it was completely smooth it would have been funnier.

124
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,520
He's right...

125
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,520
Completely smooth?

126
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,640
In that sense...

127
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,640
Wouldn't have been better to shave off your hair?

128
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,350
I'm not even able to make a comment about your last sentence!
