00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,640
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,120
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:13,900
Who is it?

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,320
Anyone there?

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,030
Welcome Miracle Light
-Hello everyone

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,390
What a rare guest!

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,040
I can't believe you're the presenter!
-Yes

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,150
So this should be a hypothesis about imitation

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,340
It is indeed related to imitation

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,440
Do you remember the previous one...

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,840
Eh...

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,350
You forgot?

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,980
You can't forget it!

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,450
You're supposed to be explaining it, right?

15
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,090
You love to switch roles

16
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,990
What's wrong? What's wrong?

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,990
Do you remember the project about imitating the teacher?

18
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,020
In the school, right?

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,160
Went to the school to imitate the teachers

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,180
Very moving
-That one was very well done

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,760
It think it won an award.
-Yes, it did

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,530
Got the Galaxy Award.
-Really great

23
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,540
This time we bring a project that can stand alongside it

24
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,040
Please take a look

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,870
"No one has done it yet" King of Imitation Showdown

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,010
No one has done it?
-What does it mean?

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,150
We generally choose people to imitiate

28
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,200
After year and a half of practice, those imitations are performed

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,730
But the project this time

30
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:32,910
The program team will select the topics to be parodied

31
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,600
And they are things that have never been imitated

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,270
They will be imitated in an improvised way

33
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,570
Sorry.
-Yes

34
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,170
I can't quite understand what you're saying...

35
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,110
Thank you for speaking up for us!

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,950
I also didn't understand

37
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,290
Absolutely awful!

38
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:58,650
In any case, the parody stars will start an unprecedented parody battle

39
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,100
And

40
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,500
They think they're shooting commercials

41
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,540
But really, they're being pranked

42
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,960
This event is an impromptu imitation of an object that no one has imitated yet

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,340
Impressive

44
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,850
The list of the much-anticipated participants is as follows

45
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,140
A serious competition

46
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,700
Hello

47
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,930
The pressure is very high

48
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,070
Feeling scared

49
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,800
If no one has imitated these things before, it means

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,540
It's difficult to do

51
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:20,850
If this passive approach to unlock your unknown potential

52
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,910
Then I think its very exciting

53
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,580
On the one hand, although it is disturbing

54
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,490
If you can win here, you should be invincible

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,230
I should say I'm a head-in-the-sand type. So I hope I can excel

56
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,230
I think Kanazuki will be a strong opponent

57
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,770
In my case...

58
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:47,240
After all, I quite often do some far-fetched imitations

59
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,980
After all, he did JB

60
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:54,250
I should be ready for it

61
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,060
Notoriously rough

62
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,250
I'm looking forward to exploring my unknown self through this

63
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,660
Because i'm competing with many legendary seniors

64
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,790
I feel like... am I really qualified?

65
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,290
And my work is subpar in comparison

66
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,430
For example?

67
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,560
"A girl becomes a dog when she agrees" or something like that

68
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,270
It has nothing to do with seniority...

69
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,840
I think it will be a very fair game

70
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,510
I am quite confident

71
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,980
What is your area of expertise?

72
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,320
Is there a certain aspect you focus on?

73
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,650
Yes, there is

74
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,590
Such as?

75
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,490
I can imitate people with protruding chins

76
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,930
"Slippery is also golden"

77
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,860
This is Midori Ito

78
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,860
※World Hall of Fame Women's Ice Skater

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,200
After all, it's my old job to do imitations that no one has ever done before

80
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,810
Compared to others, my psychological construction should be the most sound

81
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,210
Bring it on

82
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,880
I think it's a good opportunity to test my ability

83
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,110
The matchup combinations are as follows

84
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,880
Men and women will be divided into three groups and the theme of the parody will be decided by drawing lots

85
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,410
Both sides will face off in the same role

86
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:22,490
Each group will be tested until there is one winner

87
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,380
It's really awesome, this group is incredible

88
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,520
And they're parodying the same thing

89
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,820
So you can clearly see the strength of each person

90
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,080
Plus, this time, it's the impersonators scoring each other

91
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,810
I see
-The professionals are doing the judging

92
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,870
The system is the same as the first King of Conte

93
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,940
That's true

94
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,700
In the first round

95
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,700
So interesting

96
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,820
Looking forward to see what the topic will be

97
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,670
Akima Haraguchi vs. Masahiro Ehara

98
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,500
It's all about technique

99
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,900
First, let's decide which theme you two will imitate

100
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,380
The theme is..

101
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,300
Who is it?

102
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,790
Yoshiharu Doi

103
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,680
It's Doi-sensei!

104
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,850
Wait wait

105
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,080
Wait a little bit

106
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,550
Although it's basic Japanese food, it's still quite high quality

107
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,550
Very fine

108
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,220
The performance is very good

109
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,720
Really no one has ever done it

110
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,560
What do you think?

111
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,060
Wow - I never thought of imitating Yoshiharu Doi!

112
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,230
Eh ... but the Kansai accent seems to be more favorable to me

113
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:33,250
They have only 90 minutes of preparation time

114
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,770
What kind of Doi Yoshiharu will the two of them present?

115
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,410
A parody of Yoshiharu Doi, brought to you by Akima Haraguchi

116
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,040
The preparation is actually all cut out

117
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,750
Using chopsticks is so much faster with four of them

118
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,970
To say it is boiled, with water boiling, its not that simple

119
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,910
Recipes often say something like two to three minutes to be ready

120
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,870
The tone of voice

121
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,210
Two and three minutes are completely different I tell you

122
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,310
So you don't even know if it's cooked or not

123
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,050
When you don't know, how can you do it?

124
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,360
Eat it and you will know

125
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,840
Okay, it's done

126
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,290
Very impressive

127
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,590
The imitation is spot on

128
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,880
Now for the opponent, Masahiro Ehara

129
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,610
Today, I'd like to give you a taste of autumn salmon

130
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,530
What is the best way to eat autumn salmon?

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,580
Speaking of fall salmon, in the summer, they go upstream from the river

132
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,210
Very energetic, and last through the winter

133
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,900
So they are very active in the summer and winter time

134
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,020
The same as Gachapin

135
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,020
※Fuji TV's children's program mascot often appears in the weather forecast segment

136
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,920
Gachapin spends his summers surfing, and his winters skiing

137
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
As for the method of cooking

138
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,240
No need to fry or boil

139
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,960
After all, the ingredients themselves are very tasty, so just a little searing will do

140
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,470
The same as Gachapin

141
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,040
After all, Gachapin is also very tasty with just a little searing

142
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,270
Why?

143
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,900
What are you saying? Gachapin is not for eating

144
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,380
So skilled!

145
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,250
Just eat it with white rice. Thank you all

146
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,580
Impressive!

147
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,090
So strong even from the start!

148
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:31,080
It took only 90 minutes for the two to reach such a high level

149
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:37,420
Next, we'll let the rest of the participants in this event do the scoring

150
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:43,590
Each person will cast 3 votes for the ideal candidate in his or her mind

151
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,010
Will the first person to progress by Akima Haraguchi

152
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,570
Or Masahiro Ehara?

153
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,620
The results are as follows

154
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,280
Akima Haraguchi with 10 votes and Masahiro Ehara with 14 votes

155
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,070
Masahiro Ehara is advancing to the next stage!

156
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,520
Great competition

157
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,700
Scoring isn't easy

158
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,730
What a pity to lose in the first round

159
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,930
Miracle

160
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,930
Ah, how can I put it...

161
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,800
It was a struggle

162
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,770
I like Mr. Doi very much, he said a lot of quotes

163
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,400
"No need to do extra things." "The taste of the ingredients is the most important thing

164
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,440
He has a pure insistence on the taste of the ingredients themselves

165
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,640
I think he caught this point

166
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,010
So whether it's Gachapin or the other one, i'm voting for him

167
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,550
I see, the performance was accurate
-It was accurate

168
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,390
It's really hard, but... I enjoyed it

169
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:43,330
"No one has done it yet." The King of Imitation Showdown continues

170
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:49,050
2nd Match is Hori vs Yoshiaki Hanaka

171
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,840
The theme is

172
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,640
Noda Crystal

173
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,310
Noda Crystal, a very current choice

174
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,140
A champion

175
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,200
I've had a bad breakup with the master.
-You've had a bad breakup with the master?

176
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,030
Master, your magical performances are out of date

177
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,690
What the audience wants to see is more luxurious magic

178
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,340
Arguments between masters and disciplines would all go like this

179
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,650
Your magic is all superficial stuff

180
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,130
Well, how to put it

181
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,330
Noda's body movements are relatively rich compared to most

182
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,170
One of his characteristics is that he will pause in the middle of a sentence

183
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,820
What kind of Noda Crystal will the two present?

184
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,530
Even the pectoral muscles are done

185
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,480
A parody of Noda Crystal brought to you by Hori

186
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,450
Great! It's Noda!

187
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,480
Super similar

188
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,970
This is awesome

189
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,430
This is really awesome

190
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,030
A person who wants to make you laugh no matter what, I am Noda Crystal

191
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,270
Please take care of me

192
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,600
Awesome

193
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,700
We're going to eat fine French food!

194
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,600
Advanced French cuisine ah, great

195
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,630
Imitating both of them

196
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,020
I'll do it now, if its wrong, you have to say

197
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,550
No, no, no, no

198
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,780
Are you a sous chef? Are you a sous chef?

199
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,860
This guy is crazy

200
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,140
What do you mean "it's over?"

201
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,320
Emi-chan--!

202
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,540
Even Murakami's part is similar

203
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,880
Close to a perfect imitation

204
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,380
Both of them imitated

205
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:52,510
Hori, who imitated even Murakami, is up against against Yoshaki Hanaka

206
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,730
So alike

207
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,060
A person who wants you to taste no matter what

208
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,300
Noda Crystal's Three Minute Kitchen

209
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,640
To make a roasted whole chicken oh-!

210
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,060
The first thing is to put a chicken...

211
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,210
Chicken, wait. Chicken

212
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,520
Chicken... Chicken...!

213
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,840
Chicken he... chicken chicken

214
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,970
Chicken

215
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,230
Chicken-!

216
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,180
Ok

217
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,140
Flutter, flutter, flutter

218
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,140
In this way, the cooking is done

219
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,160
Now i'm going to take this in the gossip kitchen direction

220
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,160
※Emiko Uenuma's program

221
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,350
Emi-chan, wait for me...!

222
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,740
Wonderful

223
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,350
Thank you for the performance

224
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,160
This is so difficult to rate

225
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,600
Hori, who recreated the M-1 segment in its entirety

226
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,170
And Hanaka who used the person's characteristics combined with an original segment

227
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,730
Fully integrated into something else

228
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,720
The results are as follows

229
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:14,520
16 votes to 8, with Hori taking the lead

230
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,610
Hori even imitated the partner's part in such a short amount of time

231
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,880
This is something I'm not happy about but I voted for him anyway

232
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,020
Hori was able to include everyone

233
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,190
He touched upon everything

234
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,200
In this way he is really the best of all imitation artists

235
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,400
This puts a lot of pressure on me for the future

236
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,250
"No one has done it yet." The King of Imitation Showdown

237
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:53,760
Matchup 3 is Miracle Light vs Rei Maruyama

238
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,250
Miracle is also very good at this kind of it

239
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,920
The theme is

240
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,980
Harue Okada
-I see

241
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,220
A cultural person

242
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,890
Top TV appearances during covid

243
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,240
The most seen
-Very true

244
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:15,440
Appearing throughout 2020 on popular TV news programs, Harue Okada, a professor

245
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,800
Is there a wrap dress?

246
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,720
What kind of imitation will be presented?

247
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,970
Please enjoy Miracle Light's Harue Okada impersonation

248
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,920
# This year Where should I
go from here ~ w
Okada

249
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,870
I'm Harue Okada

250
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,810
Last year I made a lot of statements about covid

251
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,030
Where do I go from here this year?

252
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,930
A little malicious

253
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,950
What can I do to make Japan a country where everyone has enough to eat?

254
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:59,260
Ramen Burger 24-hour Convenience Store

255
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,780
Anything you want to eat at any time is at your fingertips

256
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:08,000
But 6,000 years ago, on the great plateau of Mexico

257
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:17,180
Aborigines ate chili and bean curd in a pie crust

258
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,390
Talking nonsense

259
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,620
That was the origin of tacos

260
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,350
All I can do this year is to make tacos a reality in Japan

261
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,580
And for the second encounter with Jijohnen

262
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,580
※Economic commentator has criticized Okada's remarks as irresponsible

263
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,700
I put on a mini skirt

264
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,910
Thank you all

265
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,560
Thank you Miracle for your performance!

266
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,950
Very similar

267
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,990
And a surprising ending

268
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,380
Miracle, who ended with a surprise, is up against Rei Maruyama

269
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,600
Rei change will put up a fight too

270
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,520
Is it my turn?

271
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:04,690
I'm Harue Okada, a professor

272
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:12,130
In the end, what is this covid?

273
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,070
It is transmitted by droplets

274
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:20,040
And suspended particle infections that are smaller than droplets

275
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,540
Then there are contact infections, which are roughly divided into these three categories

276
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,960
It would be good if this came first

277
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,520
That... I like Sakanaction the most

278
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,970
After the epidemic is over, I really want to go see their concerts

279
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:40,090
"Let's take covid away like this"

280
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:46,380
※Lyrics of "New Treasure Island" by Sakanaction

281
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,380
"Wash your hands carefully, carefully, carefully." I hope you can do this

282
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,110
Please pay attention to prevention measures

283
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,660
It's so hard!

284
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,860
It's really hard...

285
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,700
Really hard

286
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,070
The imitations of Harue Okada captured characteristics in a short time

287
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,700
Is this the same person you are imitating?

288
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,120
The results are as follows

289
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:15,110
11 votes to 13 votes, the winner is Rei Maruyama

290
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,130
You fell in the first round!

291
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,120
Let's talk to Miracle first

292
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,620
Looking at everyone

293
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,130
They use a standard approach

294
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,760
You are slapping yourself in the face!

295
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,770
With a basic look and a bit of imagination, people can win

296
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,900
So it makes sense that I would lose

297
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,740
I lost convincingly

298
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,480
I'm really shocked that I beat Miracle

299
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:51,200
Match 4 is Mikan vs Kintaro

300
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,670
The theme is

301
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,320
Michopa

302
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,990
No one has done it

303
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,830
This is really hard...

304
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,500
But it's true that we have to start from the public's impression...

305
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:16,000
Despite her popularity, no one has imitated Michopa

306
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,390
What kind of performance will the two present?

307
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,670
Michopa's parody brought to you by Mikan

308
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:40,850
Michopa's "Michopa in the small window while watching Kuro's Love Confessions VTR"

309
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,830
Good details

310
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,800
Oh nice

311
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,940
You can't be talking about me

312
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,190
It's a lie. It's disgusting, okay?

313
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,980
Next

314
00:18:52,980 --> 00:19:00,050
Michopa's delusions of grandeur while watching "What if I were to go out with Michopa?"

315
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,060
What does it mean to want to be NTR?

316
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,400
This is correct

317
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,920
Thank you Mikan

318
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,240
Next is the Michopa imitation by Kintaro

319
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,610
What are you talking about?

320
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,020
Looks like an LA American

321
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,790
Is it really true?

322
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,600
Are you stupid?

323
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,290
That cake is a birthday surprise for me, right?

324
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,730
I've seen it all. You guys are lame

325
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,550
That's so basic

326
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,060
Are you stupid?

327
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,010
Magazine shoot

328
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,930
Thank you

329
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,110
This content is all guess work

330
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,470
No, its all out now, it's really lame

331
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,260
At least hide it, so basic!

332
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,620
This prank was a big success... this is where it is!

333
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,240
Never seen such a Michopa

334
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,100
It's so hard!

335
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,230
It's so hard...
-Two different styles

336
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,840
Can Mikan advance?

337
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,270
Or will the short-legged Michopa win?

338
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,340
The results are as follows

339
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,080
What'll happen?

340
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,880
13 votes to 11 votes. The winner is Mikan

341
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,170
Kintaro-san, your neck is more and more like "Lu Bu"

342
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,800
From the Three Kingdoms
-Too mean

343
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,170
Too much

344
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,080
The comparison is correct

345
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,680
She should imitate imitate "Lu Bu"

346
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,530
"No one has done it yet" King of Imitation Showdown

347
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:19,520
The 5th round is Koji Tomita vs Razor Ramon RG

348
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,690
The theme is...

349
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,760
Morley Robertson

350
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,670
So hard

351
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:36,870
It's hard even from a professional point of view.
-It's super hard

352
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,370
A parody of Morley Robertson brought to you by Koji Tomita

353
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,690
Hi everyone, I'm Morley

354
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,480
First time meeting, please allow me to introduce myself

355
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,940
I am Morley, Morley Robertson

356
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,910
Born in America and raised by Takarazuka

357
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,290
Just kidding, JOKE JOKE

358
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:12,040
I love the country of Japan. Morley is good at Kanji

359
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:17,040
Occasionally someone will say to me, "Morley, you're too arrogant."

360
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,000
Then I'd say back to him, "You're giving off a bad vibe (kanji)."

361
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,060
Who is this an imitation of?

362
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,270
Thank you all

363
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,370
Thank you Koji Tomita for your performance!

364
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,230
The "Yutti" system

365
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,100
Gentleman's YUTTI

366
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,900
The opponent is Razor Ramon RG

367
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:54,950
Morley Robertson will put on Koji Tamaki's "Field" and sing it to you while impersonating

368
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,290
What's this?

369
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,420
How will this score?

370
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,320
Is this a Morley imitation?

371
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,270
I want to say that Morley Robertson impersonates

372
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,130
He is imitating Tamaki, right?

373
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:24,210
You who want to listen to Morley Robertson's impersonation?

374
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,270
The guy who wants to hear Morley Robertson's impersonation

375
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:37,990
The girl who wants to listen to Morley Robertson's impersonation

376
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:44,860
Stop pretending. I want to get Morley Robertson's impersonation out of the way

377
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:51,010
Don't pretend to do all the work for impersonation every day

378
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:57,050
Live strong to do impersonations

379
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,510
In the end he's pretty similar

380
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:09,130
I'm conveying Morley Robertson's impersonation

381
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:14,760
Morley Robertson likes the pasta the most

382
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,830
Who?

383
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,330
Thank you all

384
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,470
The judges looked like they were in an uproar!

385
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,650
Too smooth

386
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,450
I shaved myself

387
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,550
Any hair left?

388
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,620
There was before

389
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,990
You really got ready
-Yes

390
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,960
I will live as Morley

391
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,290
Do you want to live as Morley in the future?

392
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:49,560
The verdict of this very different style of Morley parody is

393
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,770
10 votes to 14, the winner is Razor Ramon RG

394
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,020
That's KOJI Tomita!

395
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,220
The most difficult imitation

396
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,120
Think it went pretty well

397
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,820
I should continue this one in the future

398
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,040
So, the final match of the 1st round

399
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,830
Mr. Shachuhoko VS Kanazuki

400
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,000
Shachuhoko is very serious

401
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,540
The theme is

402
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,510
Nobuko Iowaki

403
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,490
A woman?

404
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,180
Energy, vitality, Inowaki!

405
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,040
An old friend of the program

406
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,410
Wearing the trademark pink suit, the former politician

407
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,990
This person is always used

408
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,550
It is not easy to be so polite

409
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,760
The clothes are a great help

410
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,340
Indeed

411
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,590
What kind of a duel will be presented?

412
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,670
This person is too distinctive

413
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,870
Lets see Mr. Shachuhoko's Nobuko Inowaki impersonation

414
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,500
Energy, vitality, Nobuko Inowaki is at work!

415
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,570
Speaking of education, recently

416
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,680
Enough is enough, I'm tired of hearing how many times

417
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,970
Have heard it hundreds and thousands of times

418
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,140
What?

419
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,400
What is it?

420
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,520
What's going on?

421
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,150
Zakoshi

422
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,610
Energy, vitality Inowaki

423
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,220
This...

424
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,030
Thank you

425
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,190
What just happened?

426
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,860
Added a lot of unexpected elements

427
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,720
Really surprising

428
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,590
So strong...

429
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,260
Why was it added?

430
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,860
Take your time to ask afterwards

431
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,030
Interrogate, I should say

432
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,900
Mr. Shachuhoko, who embarrassed the whole audience, is up against

433
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,680
Really did

434
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,480
What the hell is going on?

435
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,310
Kanazuki

436
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:22,460
Energy, vitality, Inowaki!

437
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,780
Same as before

438
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,120
Already won, right?

439
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,390
It's not your first time, right?

440
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,300
Energy, vitality

441
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,370
What should we order?

442
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,410
Sorry, let's start with a pork chop

443
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,050
Energy, vitality, Inowaki

444
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,090
Airplane

445
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,780
Flight attendant, please come over

446
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,210
Please give me the newspaper

447
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,430
Ninkan

448
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:57,830
Energy, vitality, Inowaki

449
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,410
Inowaki, golf course

450
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,430
That's great, President

451
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,880
Energy, vitality, Inowaki

452
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,630
Thank you

453
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,100
What an impact!

454
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:18,020
What was the outcome of this chaotic first round final battle?

455
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,310
What a surprise!

456
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,260
11 vs. 13 Kanazuki-san's victory

457
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,600
What a close win!

458
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,250
Surprisingly, not much difference

459
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,390
Everyone was shocked too

460
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,390
Mr. Shachuhoko

461
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,730
Why did you do such a thing

462
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,870
In such a short amount of time

463
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,600
It's not easy to make such a decent sketch

464
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,400
So I thought I better exaggerate

465
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,480
Afterwards, I realized i've been watching a lot of Zakoshi's videos
-This is not good!

466
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,080
That's the worst thing for an imitation artist

467
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,910
Infected

468
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,520
I wondered if it would be funny to imitate it

469
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,280
Kanazuki is very good at this kind of thing

470
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,350
You said something like "any theme is fine", right?

471
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,790
As long as it is something alive

472
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,430
As long as it is a living organism

473
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,340
A famous quote

474
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,430
So cool

475
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:13,090
So, the six people who advanced to the semi-finals are the above

476
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,290
Who will be the winner?

477
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,370
What do you think?

478
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:27,030
These are not seen on parody programs

479
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,820
Is it true that Kanazuki has never played Inowaki?

480
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,640
Honestly, this one...

481
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,300
This level of proficiency is amazing

482
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,880
Very skilled indeed

483
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,390
Razor Ramon's finish is also very strong

484
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,610
What a shock!
-Shocking

485
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:47,800
It's great to leave it to the end
-His back was always turned

486
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,650
It makes you want to see it quicker

487
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:06,130
"No one has done it yet" King of Imitation Showdown

488
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,860
Semifinal Round 1 Masahiro Ehara vs Hori

489
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:19,700
The semi-finals will be songs only

490
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,770
Ehara is used to doing song segments, right?

491
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,170
That's great.
-Maybe it will be very strong

492
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,440
Hori has done some?

493
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,840
Basically, no. Not on TV

494
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,050
Mikidozan

495
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,440
Don't know it

496
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,950
But a strong character

497
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,620
Isn't it quite high?

498
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,320
It's hard...

499
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,630
The title is Lifetime Respect

500
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:54,680
Mikidozan, who made reggae music No.1 on the public records chart for the first time

501
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,770
So nostalgic

502
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,040
Does Naomi know him?

503
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,980
I know, he was popular when I was in elementary school

504
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,810
I won't lose at singing

505
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,680
I must win this one

506
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,950
No confidence at all

507
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,350
Seems like it'll be hellish

508
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,990
It's terrible

509
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,990
How will they do it in just 90 minutes?

510
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,380
First, Masahiro Ehara

511
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,720
I have no strengths

512
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,280
And hate meaningless betrayal

513
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,880
I also want to grow with others who respect me

514
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,960
hear whe mi say

515
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,620
Stay with me forever

516
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,390
So similar

517
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,860
Watch my talents!

518
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,300
Please look at me with love

519
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,260
Now you are my whole world

520
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,960
Stay with me forever

521
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,240
No need to fight and no need to be brave

522
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,100
What's this expression?

523
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,500
Please love me, please believe me

524
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,920
come again

525
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,800
Thank you for performing

526
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,440
Good singing

527
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,150
Strong style

528
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,950
Great!

529
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:23,350
The person facing off against Ehara is Hori, a stranger to songs

530
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,650
What a face!

531
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,380
I have no strengths

532
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,830
And hate meaningless betrayal

533
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:43,610
I also want to grow with others who respect me

534
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,230
Stay with me forever

535
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:50,440
Watch my talents!

536
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,820
Now you are my whole world

537
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,510
Stay with me forever

538
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,830
No need to fight and no need to be brave

539
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:06,760
Please love me, please believe me

540
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,540
Thank you for performing

541
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,240
This is also quite good

542
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,280
Both sides are really evenly matched

543
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:25,160
An unexpectedly high-level duel

544
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,520
Which side is the winner?

545
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,690
Yeah...

546
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,110
It's understandable

547
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:42,210
So, please, Kendo Kobayashi, cast an additional vote.
-Really?

548
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,210
Is it ok?

549
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,280
The winner is...

550
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,120
Hori

551
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,900
Is it me?

552
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,130
Is it me?

553
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,420
Hori did well

554
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,580
Really?

555
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,880
Although I am an amateur

556
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,950
I vaguely remember the scene of him sitting on the sofa and reading

557
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,980
In the music video

558
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,640
So, the one that evokes the deepest memories in me is Hori's performance

559
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,720
Sorry, Ehara

560
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,890
Thanks

561
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,650
Next, match 2 in the semi-finals

562
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,140
Maruyama Rei VS Mikan

563
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,720
The theme is...

564
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,480
Please tell us

565
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,620
AiNA THE END

566
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,810
The one from BiSH?
-Yes, BiSH

567
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,980
Her singing voice is now in the limelight

568
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,220
Her video is now a hit

569
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,650
I haven't heard it

570
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,720
I'm stuck in the era of Ayumi Hamasaki

571
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:51,400
BiSH's AiNA THE END, who has been gaining attention for her distinctive husky voice

572
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,280
Must be tough if you haven't heard it

573
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:01,340
Two people that are also not used to singing

574
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,270
How will there improvisation pan out?

575
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,050
Also have to memorize the lyrics

576
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,150
So similar

577
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,280
The eyes are super similar

578
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:24,220
The lies you made up at that time

579
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,470
What a resemblance!

580
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,750
Haven't had a chance to ask

581
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,190
Just crying on the ramp

582
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,540
Just a glance is all it takes

583
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,510
Let me see it again

584
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:42,840
Time is quietly and angrily watching

585
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,840
Clasping hands with each other

586
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,870
The sound of laughing together

587
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:53,850
I will never forget

588
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:59,320
Uncountable tears that have been shed

589
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,450
The character is captured well

590
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:08,400
Now the only connection with you is the same sky

591
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,760
And a little bit of nonsense

592
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,620
Thank you for performing

593
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,940
The semi-finalists are very strong

594
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,730
Really similar.
-Awesome

595
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:27,560
The next one is Mikaan, a parody artist who doesn't know AiNA THE END

596
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,970
Mikan also looks great

597
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,830
So similar

598
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,730
Also doing actions

599
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,560
Can you dance?

600
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,890
The lies you made up at that time

601
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,450
Haven't had a chance to ask

602
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,840
Just crying on the ramp

603
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,180
Just a glance is all it takes

604
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,200
Let me see it again

605
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:04,530
Time is quietly and angrily watching

606
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:08,450
Clasping hands with each other

607
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:11,430
The sound of laughing together

608
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:15,610
I will never forget

609
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:20,850
Uncountable tears that have been shed

610
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:30,350
Now the only connection with you is the same sky

611
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,090
The face is really similar

612
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,640
Makeup also very good

613
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,400
Thanks

614
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,370
It's hard to choose

615
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,240
Just so you know, this is how the semi-finals should be

616
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:50,880
Have your brain waves return to normal, Shachuhoko?

617
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,580
After returning to the lounge, I was comforted by so many people for the first time in my life

618
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,620
So, please rate them

619
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,490
The results are...

620
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,040
Surprisingly, again

621
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,420
Awesome

622
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,800
Such a duel will indeed lead to this result

623
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,440
It is so hard to choose

624
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,540
So, Kendo Kobayashi, please cast your vote

625
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,550
Sorry, I'll cast this vote

626
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,180
Winner: Mikan

627
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,720
Congratulations to Mikan for winning!

628
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,540
The details are spot on

629
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:34,020
For me, a layman, this breathing technique

630
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:39,160
I thought, "It's great to be able to notice such details"

631
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,400
I was quite confident

632
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,270
But looking at her breathing technique

633
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,300
When she made the sound

634
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,610
I thought "ah"...

635
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,630
A surprising performance for such a short period of time

636
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,370
I think this is my blind spot

637
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,920
The 3rd match in the semi-finals is

638
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,570
Very interesting

639
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,210
I'm looking forward to this matchup!

640
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,500
Razor Ramon RG VS Kanazuki

641
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,990
The theme is...

642
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:12,730
It's true that no one has ever done this one

643
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,760
Never seen it at all
-AMEMIYA

644
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,670
The third game of the semifinals is to imitate AMEMIYA

645
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,780
On December 20th, my ramen store finally

646
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,180
Started selling cold noodles

647
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,910
First is Razor Ramon RG

648
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:41,330
Prepare for summer, start in spring

649
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:47,210
Try again and again before the taste passes the test, today

650
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:53,910
On December 20th, my ramen store finally

651
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,540
Started selling cold noodles

652
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:05,740
Although during the process of development and production, the wife fell in love with a cowboy

653
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,170
I still started selling cold noodles

654
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,450
Too similar

655
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:17,620
The unexplained fires that occur from time to time are also unknowingly insured

656
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:22,000
Still I wanted to start selling cold noodles

657
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,360
A strong level

658
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:25,620
Thank you

659
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,420
Thank you for performing

660
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,690
A very serious performance

661
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,110
Awesome

662
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:36,750
Up against RG is Kanazuki

663
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:48,890
Prepare for summer, start in spring

664
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:55,250
Try again and again before the taste passes the test, today

665
00:40:55,250 --> 00:41:01,460
On December 20th, my ramen store finally

666
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,210
Started selling cold noodles

667
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:13,410
Although in the process of development and production, the wife fell in love with a cowboy

668
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:16,950
But still started selling cold noodles

669
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,890
What is interesting about this?

670
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,310
The unexplained fires that occur from time to time are also unknowingly insured

671
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:30,020
I still started selling cold noodles

672
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,150
Thank you for performing

673
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,040
Not bad, you guys

674
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,030
Although they were both great its not a tough decision

675
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,380
Not tough?

676
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:47,740
As opposed to RG, who sang an unexpectedly earnest imitation here

677
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:52,160
Kanazaki unexpectedly did a lot of face art

678
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,310
The result is

679
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,870
15-3 Razor Ramon RG wins

680
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,630
How can there be so much difference?

681
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,670
RG really did well

682
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,880
In such a short period of time

683
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,310
But compared to Kanazuki

684
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:18,210
Who did you study?

685
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,020
AMEMIYA!

686
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,920
This is not sure who it was supposed to be singing AMEMIYA's song

687
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,720
It's been about seven years since I last sang on stage

688
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,020
So the three finalists are the following

689
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,840
This time, the theme is...

690
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,610
This

691
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,150
TKO Kimoto

692
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,410
So hard

693
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:47,540
And I have no advantage as a woman ah
-Very unfavorable

694
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,580
It's a lottery, so there's no way out

695
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,690
Is it ok to finish on Kimoto?

696
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:56,180
Unexpectedly, Kimoto is the final

697
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,590
I don't intend to disappear from everyone's view

698
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:03,090
So it's "people think I've disappeared"

699
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:08,200
Heavy topics that are not suitable for the finale of the competition

700
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:12,100
Three people have 90-minutes, what will be the result?

701
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,800
I don't think you're complimenting me

702
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,710
I wish I had more time, but it's not too late

703
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,910
The first time i've ever googled Kimoto

704
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,880
How to start...

705
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,680
Focus on the facial resemblance?

706
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:29,850
So, up first is Hori

707
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,570
The atmosphere is quite similar

708
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,620
Thank you for today. Thank you. Thank you

709
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,380
This is very good, very good, eat it

710
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,830
It's good, isn't it?

711
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:49,990
The place we went to the other day was also good, right?

712
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:52,570
Speaking of the other day

713
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:58,290
Did you say you wanted to praise me, praise me for being careful?

714
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,720
I'm getting the vibe

715
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,580
I am not angry at all, really not angry

716
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,860
I don't mind at all. I don't mind at all

717
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,400
But that's not quite right, is it?

718
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,860
Because I don't mind you saying it to me

719
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,720
But it would be bad if you say that to Matsumoto and Hamada

720
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:22,400
Really, I'm saying all this for your own good

721
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:23,880
I really don't mind

722
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,770
Eat!

723
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,640
Thank you for performing

724
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,210
I see

725
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,050
I see

726
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:38,090
The angle of the neck and the upper body twisted over

727
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:40,090
This is the Kimoto I've seen on TV

728
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,440
Thankfully he's still got some energy

729
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,160
Recovered already

730
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:49,210
Can the next contestant overcome the gender barrier?

731
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,440
Mikan can do anything

732
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,690
A bit pathetic

733
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,110
Very strict with male junior artists

734
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:03,550
But exceptionally gentle with female artists

735
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,170
Good morning, please give me more advice today!

736
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,700
You, didn't you do a food review?

737
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,330
I really can't watch it anymore

738
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:24,360
You will really be out if you do not learn more...

739
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,700
Good morning

740
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,980
So cute. Cute today also!

741
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,760
Eh, first time doing a food review?

742
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,200
It's okay, it's okay. Just say it's delicious

743
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:39,730
That's pretty spot on

744
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:40,590
Very good

745
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:46,300
Last is Razor Ramon RG

746
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,370
Here we go again

747
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,500
Because it was hard to find memorable jokes from Kimoto

748
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:55,410
Can it be that similar?

749
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,710
I'll be singing Thrill by Tomoyasu Hotei

750
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,140
Because the earlier ones are too similar

751
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,800
A bit of anticipation

752
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,040
Raised the difficulty instead

753
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:09,430
Kimo Kimo Kimo Kimo Kimo Kimo's Imitation

754
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,410
I want to sing quickly

755
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:13,580
Please hurry up

756
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:16,120
Kimoto's Imitation

757
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,670
I want to sing it quickly

758
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:23,970
Thrill done like a Kimoto imitation

759
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,460
Kimoto's Imitation

760
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,560
I want to sing it quickly

761
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,060
I told you to hurry up!

762
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:33,650
Kimoto's imitation is okay

763
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:38,920
Kissing you on the count of three

764
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,350
Kimoto's Imitation

765
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:44,700
Yes, I just want to hold you

766
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,460
Yes, without hesitation

767
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:53,320
Kimo Kimo Kimo Kimo Kimo Kimo's Imitation

768
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,950
Always likes to use nasal sounds

769
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,190
This is no good

770
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:08,970
Three completely different TKO Kimoto appeared, what are the results?

771
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:11,150
The results are in

772
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:14,180
Here are the results

773
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:16,130
The result is

774
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,840
Why is it like M-1?

775
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:26,030
The winner is Hori

776
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,390
Thank you all

777
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,300
Thank you

778
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,380
Hori, how do you feel?

779
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:37,630
Really happy

780
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:39,640
Just simply happy

781
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,970
Yes, thank you all

782
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:44,070
Also scared of being shouted at by Kimoto

783
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,470
Please be told off

784
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:49,280
I think he will say "I don't mind but this can't be done"

785
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:50,680
What does everyone think?

786
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,550
This is a parody program

787
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,350
That's what I call a parody show.
-Don't say that

788
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,190
You will be scolded by Fuji and Nihon TV for saying this

789
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,660
Competitions should be like this

790
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:08,000
Other places will say its been done before, and will copy it

791
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,900
Who?

792
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,370
You talked about this when we were drinking before, right?

793
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:22,340
To sum up, the winner is Hori

794
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,970
So the first champion is Hori

795
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,510
Wonderful

796
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:31,890
Will it happen again?

797
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:35,390
I also want to participate in this until I die

798
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:39,610
No one loses in this competition
-Everyone benefits

799
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:41,980
But, Shachuhoko...

800
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,290
Accidents happen

801
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,180
The only thing I'm a little concerned about is

802
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:51,700
KOJI Tomita doesn't seem to have much energy

803
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,510
The longest-running player was eliminated in the first round.
-Lost to Razor Ramon

804
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,500
Overall, that is

805
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:05,090
Let's welcome the next presenter

806
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,070
Hello everyone

807
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:13,600
It's Sanshiro's Komiya

808
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:19,330
In terms of me on this show, you tend to think of pranks, right?
-That's true

809
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,100
Hora
-Yes?

810
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,870
Do you remember any of these?

811
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:26,570
You wont detect the sound of jingle bells when you enter a coffee shop

812
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:32,100
It's a very unimpressive trick
-Yes, it is

813
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,590
It was over in a flash, okay?

814
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:37,780
But it was enjoyable
-Thanks for the compliment!

815
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,090
Why're you drinking now?

816
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:42,950
Don't start drinking water when we're in the middle of talking

817
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,160
I'm really counting on you

818
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,400
There was also a real prank, does anyone remember it?

819
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,740
Some information getting leaked in a gossip magazine

820
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,640
About going out in Atami

821
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,770
They said there would be an article about it

822
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:57,580
I was super scared

823
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,270
And I was told by an agent that it'll be really bad

824
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:04,610
Then they said with a very poor acting skills, this is actually a trick, do not worry

825
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,220
I was so relieved

826
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:10,300
Sure enough, a staff member and photographer barged in with a sign

827
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,420
I was like, "It's that one, right? I know, I know

828
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:16,150
On the sign that was held up, it said "Real"

829
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,450
What the hell is "real"?

830
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:21,760
It was all another layer of the prank

831
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:26,700
It was actually published after that

832
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,600
It'd never been done before.
-It's true

833
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:33,880
This time, we have another "real prank" project

834
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,380
This is it

835
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,320
Real Commercial Prank

836
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:44,840
With the full assistance of Coca-Cola, one of the sponsors of the show

837
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,550
The participants were able to appear in a commercial for Lemondo
-Eh!?

838
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:49,930
That's the one that Hirosi Abe also starred in?
-Yes

839
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:50,890
They're gonna act?

840
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:53,260
This is a super happy "real"
-That's for sure!

841
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,800
It's very different from the "real" one you had, Komiya

842
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,770
What's up with that!?

843
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:00,770
Real Commercial Prank

844
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,740
Here's what happened

845
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:06,040
With the full assistance of Coca-Cola Japan

846
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,700
This is really awesome!

847
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,320
We carried out a "real prank" of being able to act in a commercial for Lemondo

848
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:07,700
This one's super popular

849
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,640
That must be great

850
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,990
But, of the five

851
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:20,290
Some will be mislead

852
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:25,760
So, the targets of the pranks were these five people

853
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:25,530
It means that someone will be able to act in it

854
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,390
If in such a situation

855
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:31,440
If you're doubtful then its obviously a prank

856
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,420
It would be very disrespectful to the sponsors, and therefore out of character

857
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:41,040
Only the last person left believing it will actually appear in the commercial

858
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,880
Coca-Cola is really good at this

859
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:47,560
That's what it's all about. First, each come to a meeting

860
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:50,300
The project begins

861
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:55,550
Thank you for coming all the way out here today.
-Thank you

862
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,910
We really wanted to create a perfect advertisement

863
00:51:58,290 --> 00:51:59,850
So we'd like to ask for your help

864
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,880
Aren't you cold today?

865
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,730
I'm fat and hot, so I'm perfectly fine

866
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:07,450
Actually a little sweaty right now.
-I see

867
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,530
Incidentally, what are you doing in terms of the product?

868
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:13,860
I've been drinking it a lot.
-Yeah, thanks

869
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,740
I drink it
-Ok

870
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:18,660
Yeah, it's good

871
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,000
This time it's a product called Razor Lime

872
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,000
※The previous commercial had was a play on words using "very sharp razor" as an analogy for "Lemonade that refreshes you after drinking it."

873
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:26,050
I'm sure it's going to be tempting. I'm tempted now that I've seen the packaging

874
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,610
This guy's a real pain in the ass

875
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,260
Seriously, this is the kind of work I'd appreciate the opportunity to do

876
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,060
Thank you very much

877
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:31,560
He's a good liar, isn't he?

878
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,760
You don't have to be so obvious

879
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:38,400
There will be six tricks thrown into the mix during this deliberation

880
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,240
Nadal looks like the kind of guy who would love to do commercials

881
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,740
First

882
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:45,840
This time, we're talking about the product that we want you to endorse

883
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,840
The person in charge can't read the kanji for "Lemon"

884
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,840
The person in charge can't read the kanji for "Lemon"

885
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:50,380
It's now being endorsed by Abe

886
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,360
Uh...

887
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,600
That...

888
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:57,940
It's called Lemondo

889
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:03,040
It's a brand of lemon drink called Lemondo.
Uh-huh

890
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,970
That's not possible

891
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:06,670
Kotouge: I'll just leave it

892
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:12,150
This time, Mr. Oda, the product you're going to advertise?

893
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:14,370
Hmm...

894
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,060
It's Lemondo.
-Oh!

895
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:21,600
It's a brand of lemonade called Lemondo
-Ok

896
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,550
This... that...

897
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,290
Doesn't think it's a trick at this point

898
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:26,510
It's Lemondo

899
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:33,540
Yes, it's a commercial for Lemonade, and I'd like to cast you, Nadal
-Yes, of course. No problem at all

900
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:34,080
That's not a problem at all, is it?

901
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,320
At this point, all five of them choose to ignore it

902
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:40,480
Next

903
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,160
Since you're going to be in this commercial, I'd like to confirm a few things

904
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:48,700
Recognizing that alcohol-related matters are completely unreasonable

905
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:48,700
Recognizing that alcohol-related matters are completely unreasonable

906
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,650
I hope you can answer truthfully

907
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,730
Have you ever been so drunk that you lost your memory?

908
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:54,960
I don't know if it's possible to drink to the point of amnesia

909
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:55,240
This is turning into a quiz

910
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,840
Well, I don't know, maybe once

911
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,360
Ah, you have, haven't you?
-Yes

912
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,980
That's pretty honest

913
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:02,050
Just once in a while, I guess

914
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:05,450
Ever drive after drinking?
-No, I haven't

915
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,400
No, right?
-No

916
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,780
I don't drive

917
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:12,830
You can rest assured of that

918
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:15,780
A hell of a sales pitch.
-It is

919
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:20,330
Ever been drunk and then posted on social media?

920
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:22,100
Ah, that doesn't happen.
-No way?

921
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,800
My predecessors have gotten into all sorts of trouble because of that

922
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,800
Like Kubota or something

923
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,800
※At the celebratory dinner after M1 2018 Kubota atweeted verbally abusive words at reviewer Emiko Uenuma

924
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,620
Let's not talk about this kind of thing

925
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,540
It's like that thing with Ichi

926
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,670
We've already had one incident, and we're still making the same mistakes

927
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:32,670
What are you doing? You could've kept your mouth shut.

928
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,940
Like Shizuru's Murakami

929
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:37,950
Always tweeting in a drunken state

930
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,750
It's like they are the opposite of what they should be

931
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,540
That's why I'll never do it

932
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,880
Basically, it's best not to behave like this

933
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,920
It's never gonna happen. It's never gonna happen

934
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,390
I've been really paying attention to that

935
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,490
Now I'm all about the money

936
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:50,330
Seriously

937
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,460
Ever experienced drunken violence?

938
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,900
No, I haven't. Not even once.
-No? Sure?

939
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,170
Not even the domestic violence stuff

940
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:02,040
In 2019, Yoshimitsu Tokui was found to have evaded 138 million yen in taxes over a seven-year period.

941
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:02,040
Same with, tax evasion stuff like that

942
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:02,970
Not at all

943
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,390
No one asked you that, did they?

944
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:05,670
Dad did use violence against mom

945
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:08,350
But i've never used violence

946
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,120
This guy's really honest

947
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:14,650
Mogura speaks lightly of his hard family circumstances

948
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,640
This part also went by unnoticed

949
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,870
Yeah, so far

950
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,270
The next one is...

951
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:25,850
Here's the contract for the performance. Please take a look at it

952
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:29,400
I can't see page three, article eight.
-Article 8...

953
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,260
Yeah, that's an important one

954
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:41,680
For the duration of the advertisement, you can only drink Lemondo

955
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:41,680
For the duration of the advertisement, you can only drink Lemondo

956
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:41,700
They were forced to sign a contract saying that they could only drink the Lemondo product for the duration of the advertisement

957
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,880
What do you think?

958
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,310
This...huh?

959
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:49,010
So that means drinking beer or something like that is a no-no, right?
-Yes, it does

960
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,360
And it's not okay to drink at home even if you're drinking something else.
-Not even at home

961
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,890
That's pretty harsh

962
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,830
As for the duration, it's about a month

963
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:01,370
That's ok. No problem

964
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,230
No problem at all

965
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,630
I don't drink much anyway

966
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:06,710
I'll just have this

967
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,090
I'll contribute to sales
-Thank you

968
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,410
It's perfectly fine. That's what I'm drinking at home

969
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,960
There's no problem at all

970
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:17,080
Oh, no problem, no problem. I think I've heard that somewhere

971
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:19,660
Don't drink anything else even at home? There's no such thing, is there?

972
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,150
Compared to the four's unexpectedly oblivious reaction

973
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:36,960
For the duration of the advertisement, you can only drink Lemondo

974
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:36,960
For the duration of the advertisement, you can only drink Lemondo

975
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:33,690
What's going on here...

976
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,450
In terms of content?

977
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:40,000
Just anything with alcohol in it...?

978
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,420
Ah, I think we found someone. Do you think there's something wrong?

979
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:45,980
Oda, he began to suspect something was wrong long ago

980
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,030
Hold on a second. What's going on here?

981
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:52,840
What's wrong with you?

982
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:55,480
Yeah, okay, okay

983
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,010
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

984
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,110
Is something wrong?

985
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,520
No, no, no, no. There's nothing wrong with that

986
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,720
Hold on a second. What's going on here?

987
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:11,380
Showing a little bit of skepticism, he nonetheless quickly retreated, just scraping by

988
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,960
But it's getting dangerous

989
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,560
And the rest of them, even in the face of this unreasonable contract

990
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,380
Finally, they all signed the contract

991
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:19,220
How could this happen?

992
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,180
Using the fingerprint and everything...

993
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,640
This time, the role I want you to play

994
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:28,250
It's an office worker role

995
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,890
Well...

996
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:33,170
It's called Lemondo

997
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:35,410
The setting is, after a long day's work

998
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:54,330
The guy in charge still can't pronounce the word "lemon."

999
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:54,330
The guy in charge still can't pronounce the word "lemon."

1000
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:41,310
The feeling you will be evoking

1001
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:45,900
Is that all you want is drink after work

1002
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:50,880
Which progresses to you ultimately drinking the lemonade

1003
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,330
Ok

1004
00:57:55,620 --> 00:58:02,980
So far, only Kotouge, Hashimoto, and Mogura have not suspected any of the three traps

1005
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:05,060
After all, they're gonna be shooting a commercial

1006
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,300
And then there's Oda, who's beginning to suspect that it's a trick

1007
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:10,890
Whereas Nadal is bending over backwards to please them

1008
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:13,900
Later

1009
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:16,860
Although its rare since you've only just agreed

1010
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:23,280
We will shoot the commercial now

1011
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:35,820
Despite having just had the meeting the filming starts immediately

1012
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:35,820
Despite having just had the meeting the filming starts immediately

1013
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:26,650
That's obviously impossible

1014
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,420
Yes, it's impossible

1015
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:32,120
Totally, uh, totally fine.
-Is that so? Thank you

1016
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,450
I'm glad you are so motivated

1017
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,150
It's not something you can shoot on a whim, okay?

1018
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:41,010
Just ten minutes after, the commercial is shot

1019
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:51,510
The director's attire is too bizarre

1020
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:51,510
The director's attire is too bizarre

1021
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,770
Bizarrely dressed CM director arrives

1022
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:48,110
Hey, this is too weird

1023
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,820
They do come around once in a while

1024
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:50,080
Thank you

1025
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:56,290
As the situation accelerates in an outrageous direction

1026
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,990
That's a lot of staring

1027
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:59,110
He can't help but stare

1028
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,140
Not only that, but ...

1029
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,580
Didn't they make a set for the last commercial?
Uh-huh

1030
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:07,820
Why don't we shoot it at an izakaya this time?

1031
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:25,320
The location hasn't been decided until the day

1032
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:25,320
The location hasn't been decided until the day

1033
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,560
Really?

1034
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:13,210
Like in Ebisu or something. There's probably a lot of them there

1035
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,590
No problems with the car or anything like that?

1036
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:18,300
We've got a car coming now.
-Really? Really? Okay, I get it

1037
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:19,590
What do you think?

1038
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:20,300
Well...

1039
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:25,320
I think it's OK if you go with that momentum

1040
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,200
As we've been talking

1041
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,700
I think you're going to be very busy

1042
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,850
If there's no problem, you can head for the car...

1043
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,650
What is this!?

1044
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,850
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you?

1045
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,940
He said it.
-And very clearly

1046
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,950
What's going on here?

1047
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:42,280
Hey, no

1048
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,150
This... is too fake!

1049
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:45,950
Oh, come on. There you go

1050
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:47,280
It's so fake...

1051
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,350
What is this?

1052
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:51,700
How dare he say that!

1053
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:54,290
Instead of going with it, he couldn't help but shout

1054
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,740
That's why Oda is hereby disqualified

1055
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,610
Mogura, he's like the type that never knows what's going on, right?
-Aah! Aah!

1056
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:05,440
Kodoki's a veteran, so even if he finds out, he'll just go with the flow, won't he?

1057
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,020
Even if he knows what's going on

1058
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,750
That means that even if you know it's a trick, you still go along with it, right?

1059
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:12,210
What is this?
-Huh? What's wrong?

1060
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:16,090
Although Oda is disqualified at this point

1061
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,130
This... is too fake!

1062
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,810
Hey, it's not fake

1063
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:21,320
I even told my wife

1064
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,500
Coca-Cola commercial

1065
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:24,490
You'd be happy sure

1066
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:26,840
I was so happy for me

1067
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,130
Lets continue, then

1068
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:32,470
Your passion comes through loud and clear

1069
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:34,540
I think it's a good idea to shoot this now

1070
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,230
So, he was taken to an izakaya

1071
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:42,120
After all, it's a rare opportunity. Let's keep him with us for a while longer

1072
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,930
I can't believe it didn't end after him shouting like that

1073
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,890
Your mind is already broken, right?

1074
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:48,910
Incidentally, the other members

1075
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:54,930
Despite having just had the meeting the filming starts immediately

1076
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:54,930
Despite having just had the meeting the filming starts immediately

1077
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,690
You can book the venue now, right?
-No problem

1078
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,930
I can't believe you can still book it.
-Yes

1079
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:57,760
There are plenty of izakayas in Tokyo, so I'm sure its fine

1080
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,790
Oh, really? That's pretty fast

1081
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:05,430
Just like that. Hashimoto has started to comment subtly

1082
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,140
So we're actually going to shoot at the place?
-Yes

1083
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,280
That's perfectly fine

1084
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,260
Ahhh it's totally fine, anything...

1085
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:18,270
Its impossible to tell what they're thinking

1086
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:19,950
After this

1087
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,680
As for the costumes, I think they're ready

1088
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:26,690
We were give your measurements beforehand, and you're supposed to wear a suit

1089
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:28,660
So now it's being prepared

1090
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:31,920
I think there's a store for that. Let's go there first

1091
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,700
Okay, that's a good point...

1092
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,450
Thank you...

1093
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,420
Unsure if its a prank or not

1094
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:42,560
Nadal's excitement is noticeably lowered

1095
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:47,100
After all, I want it to be the best-selling drink in Japan

1096
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:48,840
Thank you

1097
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,680
It's really appreciated

1098
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,190
Yeah, I'll do my best

1099
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:55,340
A man like this, who was so excited just a moment ago

1100
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,690
Okay, that's a good point...

1101
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:57,840
Thank you...

1102
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,040
It's only been 30 minutes

1103
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,500
The tone of his voice has now plummeted

1104
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:06,900
All in all, there are five of them, including Oda, who's already disqualified

1105
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:12,410
All embark in a car in search of an izakaya to use as a photo location

1106
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,410
And that's when this happened

1107
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:18,270
Ah, looking for the camera

1108
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:20,180
Looking for the camera properly

1109
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:22,880
He's found it

1110
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,880
You've found it!

1111
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:30,400
As soon as Oda gets in the car, he starts looking for hidden cameras

1112
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:32,880
After that

1113
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:36,130
Ah, there's an izakaya with a nice atmosphere

1114
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,550
Ah, it's okay.
-It's got a nice atmosphere

1115
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,870
Looks comfortable

1116
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:47,610
Go to the place to get permission

1117
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:47,610
Go to the place to get permission

1118
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,630
After finding an izakaya with a nice atmosphere

1119
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:47,610
The staff get permission from the store

1120
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,540
This isn't a venue for a celebration party, is it?

1121
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,220
This is unbearable

1122
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,380
What's going on?

1123
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,950
I'm sure that's what happened

1124
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:00,450
Well, that's certainly the way it's going to turn out

1125
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,580
It's not like, "Can you please shoot a scene here?"

1126
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,610
It's an advertisement

1127
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,100
Seemingly having made up his mind

1128
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:11,290
Even in this situation, Hashimoto decides to go with the flow

1129
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:16,640
And what about Nadal, who already thinks it's a prank?

1130
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:24,050
No good

1131
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:27,750
I'm sorry. No permit

1132
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:32,250
First of all, the owner of the store wasn't there, and secondly, the request was too sudden, so they refused

1133
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:33,850
Looking at the camera!

1134
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:35,430
Surely looking for the cameras

1135
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:36,600
I guess we'll have to go to Ebisu after all

1136
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:41,120
Like Oda, this man confirmed the existence of the hidden camera

1137
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:47,770
After that, they moved to the 2nd location

1138
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,900
Is this place a bar?
-Is that a bar?

1139
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,100
I wonder if it's open for business?

1140
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,870
Well, I'm gonna go see what's going on

1141
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:59,620
He can't help but laugh at this stupid conversation

1142
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,620
It's true, you'd have to laugh

1143
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,080
Already pretending

1144
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:01,080
Not only that, but ...

1145
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,170
Oh, oh, oh, coming out

1146
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:06,310
Uh-oh. OK?

1147
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:07,420
OK！？

1148
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,630
Really? That's amazing

1149
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:10,620
How can that be possible?

1150
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,040
Looks like it's okay

1151
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:12,540
Oh, oh, that's great

1152
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:18,520
As this place agreed to do the shoot, it was chosen as the location

1153
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:25,090
So, they've finally arrived at the izakaya where they'll be shooting

1154
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:29,220
I'm sure you're thirsty now

1155
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:29,720
A little bit

1156
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:32,010
Would you like some tea or something?
-Well...

1157
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:34,580
Is there an AD around?
-I'll drink anything

1158
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:40,320
Third AD (79 years old)

1159
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:40,320
Advanced Age AD

1160
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:40,320
Advanced Age AD

1161
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:38,820
Thank you

1162
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,670
So old but only 3rd AD still?

1163
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,690
Is this the AD?

1164
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:43,080
Third AD, 79 years old

1165
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:44,620
Well...it's an AD

1166
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:46,690
Been doing this a long time

1167
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:48,600
How much do you like being an AD?

1168
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:47,760
A living fossil

1169
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:49,750
Meanwhile

1170
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,820
Oda, who was disqualified while still in the conference room

1171
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:55,420
You're out, why're you still here?

1172
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,370
Is there an AD out there?

1173
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:57,210
AD?

1174
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,040
Oh, there is

1175
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:04,180
Do you have any tea for Oda? Tea or water is fine

1176
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:06,710
There's nothing here. See if you can get something to drink

1177
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:08,380
Eh? ...AD?
-Yes, AD

1178
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,590
No thats just weird

1179
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,590
What is this scene!?

1180
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,640
Shouted clearly

1181
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,790
What's all this!?

1182
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,240
It takes a little guts

1183
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,090
What!?

1184
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,360
It's a commercial...

1185
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,130
No, no, absolutely no way

1186
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:23,130
What the hell is this?

1187
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:30,610
It's a weird commercial shoot, but it's a real commercial shoot

1188
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:31,480
It's a real commercial

1189
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,600
It's just that Oda doesn't want to cooperate at all anymore

1190
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,740
It's not his fault

1191
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:35,830
It ends here

1192
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:38,160
And we tell him it's all true

1193
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:40,750
You've worked hard

1194
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:45,850
What's this?

1195
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:48,320
May I ask what you are working on today?

1196
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:54,160
I was going to... come and do a commercial for Coca-Cola's Lemondo

1197
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:54,800
I don't know what it is

1198
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:56,230
Ready?
-Yes

1199
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:58,230
I don't know exactly which program...

1200
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,040
Yes you do

1201
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:00,000
But it's been exposed for a long time, and we've been filming it all along

1202
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:05,390
"It's been exposed for a while"

1203
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:07,140
That's why we're here to reveal the project to Oda

1204
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:12,250
Actually, the commercial shoot thing that's going on today

1205
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:18,020
It's real

1206
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:21,360
Can't make any sense of it

1207
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,060
Too much, its too much

1208
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,190
What? What? What? What are you talking about?

1209
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,110
No, it's not. It's not. It's not

1210
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:29,730
It's real

1211
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:30,700
No, no, no

1212
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,830
It is true

1213
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:34,200
That's not true. That's not true

1214
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,540
Eh? Eh?

1215
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:36,800
No, right?

1216
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:37,470
No, no, no, no

1217
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:42,010
So, this whole commercial thing today, it's really...

1218
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:39,300
He's done for

1219
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:45,480
You were asked to do a commercial.
-No, no, no

1220
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:48,420
By the way, who are you? May I ask?

1221
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:51,870
What... what is this? What do you do?

1222
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:54,490
We're from Wednesday Downtown

1223
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:55,820
No, no, no, no. You guys, wait

1224
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,390
Wait a minute. Wait a minute

1225
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,760
You say that like its nothing

1226
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:01,530
Eh?

1227
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:03,560
Wednesday...

1228
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:06,560
So, we carefully explained the project to Oda

1229
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:10,640
And the sad fact that he's out

1230
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,210
It'll take a while to figure it out

1231
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,780
As a result

1232
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:14,580
It's impossible... it's impossible for me to ignore this situation

1233
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:16,880
I've been holding back

1234
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:19,940
I was going to kick off

1235
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:21,650
But then I thought, what if it's true?

1236
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:25,990
This is the "what if?"

1237
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:29,560
Seriously, no way!

1238
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:32,330
I've told everyone. I've told my wife everything

1239
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:34,100
I said, "I got a Coca-Cola commercial."

1240
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,460
This is the worst

1241
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,720
So far there are four left

1242
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:46,180
Who exactly will end up starring in the commercial?

1243
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:49,280
It's Oda first

1244
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:55,520
I'm simply disgusted to see Hashimoto trying his best to get this commercial

1245
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:58,560
It does feel a little bit like that

1246
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,280
It's a bit overshadowed by Nadal, though, and Hashimoto's got his hands full

1247
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:04,320
In terms of roles

1248
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:08,500
The tsukkomi people might be more likely to say something

1249
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,810
You can't help it, can you?

1250
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:10,990
I can't help it

1251
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:14,660
If someone couldn't pronounce "lemon" i'd definitely say something

1252
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,900
So, excluding Oda, there are four left

1253
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:23,130
From now on, it's officially time to move on to the shoot

1254
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:25,220
The content of this advertisement is

1255
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:27,560
After ordering lemonade at the izakaya

1256
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:31,270
The result is a bitter or sour drink

1257
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:35,360
Content that requires a quick retort

1258
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,860
The content of the ad

1259
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:40,460
So, let's start with the Lemondo scene

1260
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:44,950
So big

1261
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:46,890
Huge

1262
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:55,480
The board is unusually large

1263
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:55,480
The board is unusually large

1264
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,740
Are you okay, Kotouge?

1265
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:53,140
I'm fine. It's too big for me

1266
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,490
It's always been like this.
-All the time?

1267
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:57,510
You always use such a big one?
-Yes.

1268
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:59,080
It's in the way

1269
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,920
Already complaining

1270
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,210
I think it's redundant

1271
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,600
Faced with an oversized board

1272
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,860
Kotouge can't help but comment

1273
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,460
And Hashimoto did the same

1274
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:10,700
Seems like he's gonna say something

1275
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:16,600
I haven't even said "ready--" yet

1276
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:19,530
"Ready, set, go" is followed by the board, remember?

1277
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:22,580
That's the first time I've ever heard a command for a board

1278
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,160
Ok, start!

1279
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:27,510
I'm sorry

1280
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:29,210
When should I start?

1281
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,980
You can still see it. The board

1282
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:33,070
It's too big

1283
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:34,950
Is it okay to start when the board is moved?
-It's fine

1284
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:37,550
Because its a little big, and when it's moved out of the way...

1285
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:37,540
It's moving slowly

1286
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:39,890
"Because its a little big" he says...

1287
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:42,020
Its impacting the shoot badly

1288
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:44,170
By the time Nadal gets here

1289
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:47,120
The look on Nadal's face

1290
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,130
Please go faster

1291
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:52,790
"I can't"

1292
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:53,510
Ok, start!

1293
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:58,050
Laughing

1294
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,600
The usual

1295
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,220
Here you go

1296
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,480
You were laughing a bit at the start

1297
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,350
Can we get a new marker board?

1298
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:10,080
That... board

1299
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:14,620
That one's a little too big. And the AD is a little old

1300
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,810
That's not very polite, is it?

1301
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:17,890
AD (72 years old)

1302
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:17,890
That's all we've been using, it's all we have...

1303
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:17,360
What do you care about his age?

1304
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:19,270
He's too old

1305
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,290
Don't say he's too old

1306
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,470
Wait...

1307
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,460
Everyone get ready

1308
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,280
Still ready to act?

1309
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,920
Ok, start!

1310
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,810
The usual

1311
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:32,360
Here you go

1312
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,780
I don't think they're going to be able to shoot this scene

1313
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:36,980
Uh...

1314
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,640
The AD is in the shot

1315
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:45,960
In light of the screw-up

1316
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,030
These three all couldn't help but comment

1317
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:49,280
Impossible not to

1318
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,320
What about Mogura?

1319
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:52,530
Next up, Mogura says, "The usual"

1320
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:55,120
And then the shopkeeper says, "Here you go," and passes the drink over

1321
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,120
Concentrating

1322
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,500
Ok

1323
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:57,860
We'll start as soon as we're ready

1324
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,450
He probably thinks that's how it's done in commercials

1325
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:00,610
Ok, start!

1326
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:00,630
Maybe it is

1327
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,300
The usual

1328
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:03,850
Here you go

1329
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:04,960
Not bad at all!

1330
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:07,580
Mogura is great

1331
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:08,680
Ok, cut!

1332
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:13,350
So, only Mogura performed naturally

1333
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:13,350
Ah, not bad

1334
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:17,020
Has he realized the prank and is simply playing along?

1335
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:20,040
Or has he just presumed everything is as it should be?

1336
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:20,870
Can't tell

1337
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:23,720
At this point it's impossible to confirm which

1338
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,480
Not thinking about anything, is he

1339
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,480
Yeah

1340
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:28,100
A further trap for these four men is now set

1341
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,330
Let's take a little break

1342
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:31,000
Ah, okay

1343
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,500
It's break time

1344
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,100
I'll take one

1345
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,960
Oh, I see

1346
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:54,060
The staff start drinking

1347
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:54,060
The staff start drinking

1348
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:48,190
That's bad

1349
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:50,760
There's no way that's gonna happen

1350
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,240
Absolutely not

1351
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:55,530
I don't think i'd be able to hold on now

1352
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,010
This isn't going to last, is it?

1353
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:02,990
It's already a mess

1354
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,030
That's kind of...

1355
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:06,030
Yes

1356
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,000
They're drinking between takes

1357
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:13,170
It's mainly targeted at young people

1358
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:14,130
I see

1359
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:27,420
Eh...

1360
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:29,860
It's okay if we all let loose and drink?

1361
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,810
Despite being just a break

1362
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,640
The staff start drinking

1363
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,230
Though it was a little light, they commented

1364
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:42,270
Comparatively

1365
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:48,540
Ah, that's good

1366
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:52,220
Come on, its too much

1367
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,790
Not a word is said here

1368
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:02,930
He might even be thinking, "I'd like to drink it, too."

1369
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:03,340
Really?

1370
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:07,830
Mogura stares with envy at the drinking staff members

1371
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:09,010
Yeah

1372
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,360
Mogura is good

1373
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:17,600
Among them, Kotouge, basically switched to tsukkomi-mode upon arriving at the izakaya

1374
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:17,600
Looks like he's ready to fight

1375
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,280
Thank you for your hard work

1376
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,390
What's the point of talking about hard work at this point?

1377
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:34,570
Isn't this a break?

1378
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:36,650
That sound

1379
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,010
Anyone would laugh at that, wouldn't they?

1380
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:48,200
It's still working hours, isn't it?

1381
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,370
They're all drunks

1382
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:56,480
It's just a break from work now, right?

1383
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:00,420
I've never seen anyone drink on the job

1384
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,200
He said it

1385
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,670
It's over. It's over. The commercials done for

1386
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:02,420
Bad work environment

1387
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:04,220
Everyone's tired

1388
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,000
He's doing it

1389
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,290
No, no, that's not the problem

1390
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:09,190
You shouldn't drink just 'cause its tiring

1391
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:09,520
So true

1392
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,030
That's why everyone's drinking though, isn't it?

1393
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:15,530
They're still shooting after though, right?

1394
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:16,400
Yes, of course

1395
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,650
It's gonna be bad, right?

1396
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,200
Can they still work?
-Yes

1397
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:19,240
Something bad's about to happen

1398
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:20,970
A bit disorganized and undisciplined

1399
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:24,830
A powerful statement

1400
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:24,830
He's said it

1401
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:26,880
So

1402
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:31,880
I don't think we're going to be able to get away with this

1403
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,570
This is really...

1404
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:36,720
I won't say anything, of course

1405
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,990
Well, well, well, well. That's it, I guess, isn't it?

1406
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:39,960
It's not like that, Kotouge

1407
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,000
As strong words have been spoken

1408
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,200
Kotouge is eliminated here

1409
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:45,460
You have to look past it!

1410
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:46,790
Who can look past this?

1411
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:48,030
Who can!?

1412
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,950
So, here we tell him everything

1413
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:54,130
You've worked hard

1414
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:58,740
Well, well, well...

1415
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:00,440
Well, that's how it is, isn't it?

1416
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,400
"That's how it is" What is it?

1417
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,170
They all look pleased with themselves at the start

1418
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:05,710
The look of a winner

1419
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,580
After that, they'll become a loser

1420
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,320
Its Wednesday, right?

1421
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,550
It's Wednesday, right?

1422
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:13,090
You are correct

1423
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:14,020
Of course it'd be Wednesday

1424
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:18,460
Kotouge recognizes the staff

1425
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:26,900
First of all, I've never seen such a spontaneous commercial shoot

1426
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:26,950
Indeed

1427
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,260
Sure enough, he mistook the commercial shoot for a prank

1428
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:41,020
Today is actually a shoot for Coca-Cola's Lemondo product

1429
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,050
What?

1430
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:47,100
The biggest trick of all

1431
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:47,590
Eh?

1432
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:48,460
Eh?

1433
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,190
It's true

1434
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:52,790
Eh? True?

1435
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:53,930
Eh? Really?

1436
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:55,600
Really

1437
01:15:55,590 --> 01:16:00,670
So, what was filmed today will actually be on TV

1438
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:02,630
It's a real commercial

1439
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:04,510
Eh? Really?

1440
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:03,980
Getting angsty now

1441
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:06,510
However

1442
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,640
You suspected it was a prank

1443
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,480
So you're out

1444
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,650
Out
-Yes

1445
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,790
Out...

1446
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,090
Why?

1447
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:24,090
I'm a little confused by this prank

1448
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,230
He didn't know there was anyone else

1449
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,790
So, Kotouge is now also qualified

1450
01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:33,550
So, the joke is on the remaining three contestants

1451
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:41,100
Next up is a shot of the owner mistakenly serving another drink

1452
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,600
Yeah, that's it

1453
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,070
So bitter! Not this one. The usual one

1454
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:49,780
Ok, cut

1455
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:52,890
It's a second over...

1456
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:54,590
I'm sorry.
-No, no, no. It's totally fine

1457
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:57,360
Wow, it's really that strict

1458
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,490
Let's go ahead and get another one

1459
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:01,230
Yeah, that's fine with me

1460
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:02,800
It's still the same board

1461
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:02,800
Ok, start!

1462
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:07,010
Yeah, that's it

1463
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:11,490
So bitter! Not this one. The usual one

1464
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:15,440
The timing is still not right.
-The timing? Ok, got it

1465
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,940
Half a second over.
-Half a second

1466
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:27,690
Have to drink repeatedly

1467
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:27,690
Have to drink repeatedly

1468
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:22,010
Like any other commercial, the director just won't let it go

1469
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:27,000
This development forces the individual to taste the unpleasant drink repeatedly

1470
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:28,610
Cut!

1471
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:30,930
Super bitter

1472
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:32,160
So tough

1473
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:37,920
Compare to the two who don't complain...

1474
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:38,770
Little scary

1475
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:39,650
Get ready

1476
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:41,540
Ok, start!

1477
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:44,890
Yeah, yeah, that's it

1478
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:48,180
It's bitter. It's not that. The usual!

1479
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:51,750
So bitter! Are you serious!

1480
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:53,240
He's angry

1481
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,180
So bitter!

1482
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:54,120
It's an uncomfortable thing to say

1483
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:56,780
Better for it be real...
-No need

1484
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:57,990
Tastes like medicine

1485
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:58,820
No need for it

1486
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:00,690
I can act without this

1487
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:02,220
We wanted to make it as real as possible

1488
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:02,590
Not speaking politely anymore

1489
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:04,290
I can't drink this more than a couple of times

1490
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:07,350
He's really pissed off

1491
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:11,670
Nadal complains and asks to change the drink

1492
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,140
As a result

1493
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:20,070
Second AD (84 years old)

1494
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:20,230
The second one is older than the third one

1495
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:21,230
Get ready

1496
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:22,860
Ok, start!

1497
01:18:23,730 --> 01:18:24,880
Yeah, yeah, that's it

1498
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:29,080
So bitter...

1499
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,660
That... director...

1500
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:40,730
It's the same as earlier.
-The same?

1501
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,080
Is it that bad?

1502
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,930
Honestly, I don't need to suffer so much. I can do it without this

1503
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:49,340
I'm really shocked. I can't even say my lines

1504
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:50,570
Because it's too bitter

1505
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,160
Is this one okay?

1506
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,180
This one will do

1507
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:56,500
Is it okay if I try it first?

1508
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,750
Yes, yes, yes

1509
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,030
Testing

1510
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,320
It's still bitter

1511
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,820
Hey, AD!

1512
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:07,050
I don't mean to sound harsh

1513
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:08,860
But its really bitter

1514
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:12,090
Her sense of taste must be failing her

1515
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:13,080
What a foul mouth

1516
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:15,330
The AD's tastebuds have deteriorated

1517
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:15,330
How dare you!?

1518
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:16,360
AD?

1519
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,870
Don't refer to them as "AD"!

1520
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:20,770
You're the one who hired them

1521
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:23,070
It's not their fault. It happens to all of us when we get old

1522
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,170
This is not the right mood

1523
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:27,600
He blames the senior AD one minute and then speaks up for her the next

1524
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,850
Nadal has his hands full

1525
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:32,270
Yeah, yeah, that's it

1526
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:37,220
So sour! Sour!

1527
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:39,420
AD!

1528
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:41,860
Our AD works hard

1529
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,120
Please be generous. I apologize in advance

1530
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,260
We'll do better

1531
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:47,030
You've worked so hard

1532
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,000
I can't support myself on just my pension alone

1533
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Ah really...

1534
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,130
Can you ask the AD not to talk?

1535
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:56,240
"I can't support myself on my pension alone."

1536
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:57,510
What's he doing?

1537
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,140
I'm being talked to through the board

1538
01:19:58,770 --> 01:20:00,570
Really...

1539
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:01,420
What are you doing?

1540
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:02,320
It makes me feel bad about myself

1541
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,350
Ah, I'm sorry

1542
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:07,750
What's going on here?

1543
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:06,860
What the hell are you doing?

1544
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:11,190
Really? What's going on here?

1545
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:16,690
His suspicion is now clear

1546
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,360
Ah, it's over

1547
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,690
Can't do it anymore

1548
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:19,010
Nadal loses here

1549
01:20:17,690 --> 01:20:20,570
There's something wrong this guy

1550
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:25,280
What the hell are you doing?

1551
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:25,630
You've worked hard

1552
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:30,280
I know everything

1553
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:31,100
I can tell

1554
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:32,480
It's like interrogating a criminal

1555
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:32,870
You can tell?

1556
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:34,540
Pretty much figured it out

1557
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:37,910
Got it?
-Hold up the sign already

1558
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:38,320
Are you sure?

1559
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:39,550
By the way, do you know what this is?

1560
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:41,390
There's no commercial at all, is there?

1561
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:43,120
Eh?
-There's no commercial at all, right?

1562
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,240
So cool

1563
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,090
And what makes you feel that way?

1564
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:45,490
He's like a detective

1565
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:50,390
It all started with "let's film here"

1566
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:52,360
That was enough

1567
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:55,160
It was a real mess, right?

1568
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,600
I shouldn't have been so hopeful all along

1569
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,530
I thought this might be a trick!

1570
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,740
It's so messed up!

1571
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:05,940
I really love doing commercials!

1572
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:10,700
To Nadal, who has cut off the last vestiges of hope

1573
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,020
We reveal that it was all, in fact, "real"

1574
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:13,150
What's wrong?

1575
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:14,430
It's obviously your own fault

1576
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:16,470
Eh?

1577
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:17,650
It's true.
-Really?

1578
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:20,720
It was true, but...

1579
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:24,390
Nadal, you suspected since the midway point, right?

1580
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:26,430
You made the odd comment here and there

1581
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:29,360
I knew it was a trick.
-And sometimes you laughed

1582
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:30,400
What's wrong with that?

1583
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,900
Eh, why am I disqualified?

1584
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:34,530
Why do I feel like I'm out of the race?

1585
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,500
You're out

1586
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:36,570
I feel like I'm out

1587
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:39,070
I don't get it. I really don't

1588
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:42,440
They want to work with artists who can be more active in filming

1589
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:45,350
That's what the sponsors think
-I was going with it! I was cooperating!

1590
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:48,080
Lemondo Coca-Cola!

1591
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,590
Please let me do the commercial! Please!

1592
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:54,020
I've lasted this long!

1593
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:55,920
I've been working on it for a while now with a glimmer of hope

1594
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:56,810
No, no, no. Not enough

1595
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,290
So, you're out

1596
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:03,900
Did I do something wrong?

1597
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:04,560
He's back to his old ways

1598
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:10,800
So, only Mogura and Hashimoto are left

1599
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:13,510
That means these two survived the second AD

1600
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:17,370
Now, we reach the final stage

1601
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:21,770
Song and dubbing recording

1602
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:28,720
Lets do the voice-over for the product summary at the end of the commercial

1603
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:31,860
And then there's the recording of the theme song

1604
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:38,400
Lemon lemon lemondo lemonade~

1605
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:38,620
Eh? Wait a minute

1606
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:42,810
It's delicious to drink, lemon lemonade~

1607
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,380
Awful

1608
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:48,410
The advertisement song is a complete copy

1609
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:48,410
The advertisement song is a complete copy

1610
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:47,380
Lemon lemon lemondo lemonade~

1611
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,740
Should say something

1612
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:52,110
This tune is the tune

1613
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:54,250
Lemon lemon lemonade~

1614
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:56,450
Gotta dance too

1615
01:22:56,630 --> 01:23:00,550
It's delicious to drink, lemon lemonade~

1616
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:07,560
It's not being filmed, but it's got dance moves

1617
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:07,560
It's not being filmed, but it's got dance moves

1618
01:22:58,730 --> 01:22:59,950
That's a lot of excitement

1619
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:05,410
Lemon lemon lemonade~

1620
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,630
It's all good

1621
01:23:06,630 --> 01:23:08,000
Impressive

1622
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,030
Thank you. It's not a hard song to sing, is it?

1623
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:10,310
Uh, no, it's not

1624
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:11,300
This won't be filmed, will it?

1625
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:11,670
This one's off camera

1626
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:13,030
Don't shoot

1627
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:15,740
It's better not to be filmed

1628
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:19,480
It has that "Demai" feeling...haven't you seen it? The Demai commercial

1629
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:20,630
Couldn't help it after all

1630
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:20,670
Is it plagiarizing?

1631
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:21,510
It was inspired by that

1632
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:23,240
Its a little embarrassing

1633
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,110
It's better without images

1634
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:26,950
I'd be perfectly fine without the video

1635
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:29,450
Then it's fine.
-Yeah, it's totally fine

1636
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:30,800
Next

1637
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:36,320
"Lemondo is popular!" Say it in 2.5 seconds!

1638
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:38,890
Lemondo is popular!

1639
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,170
Lemondo is popular!

1640
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:43,470
Lemondo is popular!

1641
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:59,450
30 versions of one line

1642
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:59,450
30 versions of one line

1643
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:45,400
A little more calm

1644
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,140
Lemondo is popular!

1645
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:48,600
That's a wide range of voices

1646
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:50,570
Lemondo is popular!

1647
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,700
Lemondo is popular!

1648
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:56,810
Lemondo is popular!

1649
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:57,470
All kinds of recordings

1650
01:23:56,970 --> 01:23:58,810
Lemondo is popular!

1651
01:23:59,170 --> 01:23:59,960
Takeshi Kitano?

1652
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:00,670
OK
-Thank you

1653
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:01,940
Thank you

1654
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:04,100
Which to use?

1655
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:06,730
A prevailing feeling of "something's up"

1656
01:24:06,730 --> 01:24:09,400
But the final duo persevere seriously

1657
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,050
Mogura is trying really hard

1658
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:15,970
Therefore, the final outcome will be determined by the reaction to being informed

1659
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:17,660
See what the response is?

1660
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:21,600
Its up to the "I knew it!"

1661
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:31,680
You've worked hard

1662
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:32,750
You've worked hard

1663
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:33,810
How're you feeling?

1664
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:37,350
No way...

1665
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:39,320
Something's not right

1666
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,420
Is that so?

1667
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:42,760
No, it's very wrong

1668
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:43,630
He doubted

1669
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,130
That's too bad, it really is...

1670
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,590
My heart is so tired...what is this?

1671
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:50,930
In fact, today's commercial shoot

1672
01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:52,930
So it's all fake?
-Well...

1673
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,400
It's real

1674
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,070
Wait a minute. I don't know what's going on

1675
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:02,610
It's all true

1676
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:01,930
Indeed

1677
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,500
Dumbstruck

1678
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:09,220
It's too out-there

1679
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:10,280
I still don't get it

1680
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,950
In that case, you don't have to come and talk to me, do you?

1681
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:13,650
What? "Real" What?

1682
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,590
What are you talking about?

1683
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:17,990
That means it's all true

1684
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:20,730
So it's just a fun day of work...

1685
01:25:20,730 --> 01:25:23,530
There's actually no commercial, right?

1686
01:25:23,530 --> 01:25:25,430
There is

1687
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:26,470
It's real

1688
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:27,970
Eh?

1689
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:29,670
Eh? Will it really be aired? Eh?

1690
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,270
Is it really possible to broadcast with the way you're filming it?

1691
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:34,170
That song too?
-Yes

1692
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,810
Is the song also true?
-Yes

1693
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:39,950
Ah, but isn't that the one from Demaican?

1694
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:45,050
At this point, Hashimoto started to strongly doubt "reality"

1695
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:46,670
Ah, still skeptical

1696
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:46,670
In contrast

1697
01:25:46,670 --> 01:25:48,730
No response so far

1698
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:51,960
Mogura, the man who still doesn't know his true feelings

1699
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:55,850
You've worked hard

1700
01:25:57,230 --> 01:25:58,770
You've worked hard

1701
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:01,450
You've worked hard

1702
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:04,400
Saw the board?

1703
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,440
No no no no

1704
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,480
It feels like he's just reacting

1705
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:11,440
How does it feel? Today

1706
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,880
Eh? No way...

1707
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:15,220
Still believed it!

1708
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:15,220
Really?

1709
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:20,020
No way this... eh?

1710
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:22,560
This is a prank?

1711
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,690
What do you think? Today's work

1712
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:24,960
So shocked

1713
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:27,890
It's a Coca-Cola commercial

1714
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:30,130
Is there something wrong going on?

1715
01:26:30,130 --> 01:26:32,870
There was some strange things

1716
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:36,710
Undoubtedly felt something was wrong

1717
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:37,230
That's for sure

1718
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:39,280
It's okay. It's okay

1719
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:42,910
But I thought maybe this is just how commercials work

1720
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:47,310
All the documents were signed

1721
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:51,620
In fact, the commercial shoot that took place today

1722
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:52,350
Was real

1723
01:26:54,650 --> 01:26:56,860
Eh!?

1724
01:26:56,860 --> 01:26:59,490
Really?
-Really

1725
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,480
Not bad

1726
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:01,790
Very refreshed

1727
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:04,700
Eh? Really?
-Really

1728
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:06,340
You're happy, aren't you?

1729
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:09,170
Really?

1730
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:09,660
Who're you asking?

1731
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:10,970
So happy!

1732
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:12,490
Eh? What's going on?

1733
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:14,540
If it was real, there'd be no need for this

1734
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:15,380
It's all true

1735
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:17,430
So we're here to tell you it's true

1736
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:21,310
I've been treating it like a real job since the beginning

1737
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:23,350
I've always believed it to be true

1738
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:26,720
You didn't laugh much during the whole thing

1739
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:30,420
I feel like if I laughed or said, "That's not right," or something like that...

1740
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:34,030
The company bigwigs are there

1741
01:27:34,030 --> 01:27:36,200
Maybe they'd replace me

1742
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:36,530
Very serious

1743
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:38,130
Thought it was real

1744
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:41,670
Mogura, who shows his heart for his sponsors to the very end

1745
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:44,980
Is confirmed for the Lemondo commercial

1746
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,680
Great!

1747
01:27:50,610 --> 01:27:52,310
How about that song?

1748
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:54,850
Well, it's Demaican.
-Yes, it is

1749
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:58,850
I just don't feel like it goes well

1750
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:01,020
It's the same as Demaican

1751
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:03,490
Ah, Demaican!

1752
01:28:03,490 --> 01:28:06,090
Ah the take-out one

1753
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:06,810
Didn't realize at all

1754
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:08,110
Ah, indeed

1755
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:09,590
A little naive

1756
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,560
Wow, it's the one with Mr. Hamada

1757
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,130
It is

1758
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:14,530
Wow, really?

1759
01:28:14,530 --> 01:28:18,100
Eh? Demaican is red clothes, right?
-Yes

1760
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:23,840
It's true that if you have money in your eyes, you are blinded to a lot of things

1761
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:25,690
That's it

1762
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,320
Congratulations

1763
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,010
It turned out to be Mogura

1764
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:29,820
Indeed

1765
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:33,470
His reaction when the board was lifted

1766
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:35,600
It's a total comedian killer, isn't it?

1767
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,200
My fellow warriors, who have fought many battles

1768
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:41,490
They all ended up tilting their heads

1769
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:43,790
So will any be aired?

1770
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:45,890
What's going on? Do they have to do another commercial?

1771
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:48,810
It was planned beforehand

1772
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:50,800
So regardless it was still a serious shoot

1773
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:56,090
At the time of the shoot, Mogura just didn't know what was going on

1774
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:56,710
I see

1775
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:59,880
So he was later informed that he is going to be in the commercial

1776
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:04,040
We can have a look now

1777
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:09,520
So, Mogura was informed that he was confirmed for the commercial

1778
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:12,360
Hello

1779
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,030
Eh? Is the advertisement finalized?

1780
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:19,300
The commercial will be featuring Mogura

1781
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:21,340
Super happy

1782
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,040
That's great!

1783
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:23,530
In retrospect

1784
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:28,410
That's great. Is it true?
-It's real

1785
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,540
Good job

1786
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:29,540
Wow!

1787
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:31,810
It's true now, and it was true before

1788
01:29:31,810 --> 01:29:32,780
Ah, yeah

1789
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:36,810
So, here it is

1790
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,240
I'm looking forward to it

1791
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,230
The usual

1792
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:40,010
Here you go

1793
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:42,200
Yeah, yeah, that's it

1794
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,820
Really using this music

1795
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:46,140
So sour! Not this one. The usual one.

1796
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:46,640
Here you go

1797
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:49,400
Yeah, yeah, that's it

1798
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:53,680
So bitter! Not this one. The usual one

1799
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,280
Here you go

1800
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,680
Yeah, yeah, that's it

1801
01:30:01,050 --> 01:30:02,480
Delicious!

1802
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,220
Full marks for freshness!

1803
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,120
Lemondo, hugely popular

1804
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:09,950
This will be on the air

1805
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:11,390
Really using this?

1806
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:13,490
Wow. So happy

1807
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:14,950
It's awesome

1808
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:18,630
So there's a paycheck or something, right?
-Of course

1809
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:20,560
Payment for advertising, right?

1810
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,360
Wow!!

1811
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:22,790
That should be a lot

1812
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:24,150
Yeah

1813
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,270
It's Coca-Cola, after all!

1814
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:31,070
Lemondo is a big seller, too

1815
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,570
The look in his eyes when faced with gold

1816
01:30:31,070 --> 01:30:36,140
That's something to look forward to

1817
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,110
Have you thought about what you're going to spend it on?

1818
01:30:39,410 --> 01:30:42,220
I have a second child on the way

1819
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:41,760
Really?

1820
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:44,780
Around the end of March

1821
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:47,290
I need to buy the crib

1822
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:53,860
I'll watch my kid sleeping in the crib while drinking Lemondo

1823
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,530
That's a great use for it

1824
01:30:50,970 --> 01:30:51,850
Yeah

1825
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:53,850
That's good

1826
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:58,200
Will it really air?

1827
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,910
Starting today, even though it's limited to TBS

1828
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,840
It's about to go on the air

1829
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:09,030
So, the staff at Wednesday Downtown is a little bit out of their minds, too

1830
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:15,080
But it's probably Coca-Cola that's the craziest

1831
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:16,880
Demaican also agreed, right?

1832
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:21,870
That is unclear

1833
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,090
Don't be unclear about that part

1834
01:31:24,090 --> 01:31:26,490
I'm not sure.
-Don't be unclear about that

1835
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:28,450
I don't know about these things

1836
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:32,670
The circumstances of the trick might change a bit

1837
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:33,570
What do we do after that?

1838
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:36,400
It's bad if you're unsure even at the point of the commercial being out

1839
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,990
What if I'm asked to sing "Soft, Soft, Softbank" later?

1840
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:41,250
I'm not sure what to do

1841
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:46,440
By the time this program airs, there'll probably be commercials on the air

1842
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:50,580
I think it's gonna be on after this, so please watch

1843
01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:52,090
The usual

1844
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:52,780
Here you go

1845
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,170
Yeah, yeah, that's it

1846
01:31:56,570 --> 01:31:58,840
So sour! Not this one. The usual one

1847
01:31:59,200 --> 01:31:59,630
Here you go

1848
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:02,410
Yeah, yeah, that's it

1849
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:06,660
So bitter. Not this one. The usual one

1850
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:07,240
Here you go

1851
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,480
Yeah, yeah, that's it

1852
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:15,180
Delicious!

1853
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:16,880
Full marks for freshness!

1854
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:20,130
Lemondo, hugely popular!

1855
01:32:20,130 --> 01:33:04,490
