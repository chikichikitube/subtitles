00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,900
Hamada Masatoshi

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,900
Matsumoto Hitoshi

00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,800
Yes, that's right.

85
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,070
Yamazaki Hosei

86
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:37,080
It's inevitable Matsumoto-san, that we couldn't include everything in the New Years run.

87
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,240
Endo Shozo

88
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,240

Could you please stop me from doing this Yakko-dako kite soon.

91
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,180
You can keep doing it.

92
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,420
Really? Alrighty, I'll do some more.

93
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,190
A yakko dako joke!!

94
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,590
So we'll show everything today!

95
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,230
People that appeared as guests might have watched on the 31st

96
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,700
The five of them will finally watch the complete show.

97
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:58,330
and be like "Huh!? Didn't I appear on this".

98
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,700
Claudia didn't appear though.

99
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:08,310
Umemiya Claudia

100
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,700
No she didn't.

101
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,240
Apparently she's busy doing business.

102
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,310
Yes, business.

103
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,010
Yama-chan, please cue the video.

104
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
You know, since you're Tsukitei.

105
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,880
You're in charge after the new year starts.

106
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,080
From January 1st

107
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,080
Yamazaki Hosei will be

108
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,080
Tsukitei Hosei

109
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,080
Yes, from tomorrow you're Tsukitei!

110
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,150
You'll be Tsukitei Hosei now.

111
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,050
So then!

112
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,960
Heeeey!

113
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,960
Maeda (Time Keeper) saaaaaaan

114
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,890
Roll that VTR for meeeee!!!

115
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,430
This is the art of Tsukitei Hosei.

116
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,900
So let's take a look at "Absolutely No Laughing Enthusiastic Teachers"

117
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,900
from the beginning.

118
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,170
No Laughing Enthusiastic Teachers

119
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:50,080
Changing into

120
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:50,080
suitable attire for the job as teacher

121
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,410
This time, the 5 were to work as teachers

122
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,720
and were forced to dress as Kinpachi-sensei.

123
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,720
This one! This! This one! This!

124
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,320
The taste of the Kinpachi wig is different

125
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,790
The moment they enter the bus laughing will not be tolerated

126
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,790
The moment they enter the bus, laughing will no longer be tolerated.

127
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,100
Oh! He went!

128
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,100
24 Hours

129
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,100
Absolutely no Laughing

130
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,100
Enthusiastic Teachers

131
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,270
Enthusiastic Teachers

132
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,270
24 Hours

133
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,270
Absolutely no Laughing

134
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,470
Right now, only Yamazaki will get punished if we laugh...

135
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,470
If we laugh... it'll be totally fine...

136
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,980
Pfft hahahahah!!

137
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,580
See, he laughed!

138
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,150
Hey! Why aren't you guys on board!?

139
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,590
Rules only apply to Yamazaki

140
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,660
He looked at Hamada from inside the bus and laughed.

141
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,030
Rule

142
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,590
It was a start full of commotion, with the rules only being enforced on Yamazaki.

143
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,030
Black Army  will

144
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,030
Spank their bottoms

145
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:42,400
Towards the assigned school they   depart

146
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,300
The first assassins of laughter were...

147
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,150
Band Guitarist

148
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,150
Itou Ichirou (ELT)

149
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,190
Two-Timing between band members exposed

150
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,390
Two band members clash in competition for the band manager.

151
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,130
I'm, seriously in love with you.

152
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,940
Female Manager's Request

153
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,940
Get a stag beetle to clamp your nose and show your true love!

154
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,700
So the female manager asks them to clamp a stag beetle

155
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,570
on their nose and show her their true love.

156
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,740
UWWAAAA

157
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,350
Isn't he a bit pissed off?

158
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,890
The next assassin was a movie critic

159
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,860
The next assassin was that movie critic.

160
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,860
I'm sick of this shit

161
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,860
So fed up...

162
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,670
(Sekine Tsutomu)

163
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,670
Movie Critic

164
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,670
Osugi

165
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,560
I loathe being mistaken for piko (his twin clothing critic brother)

166
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,630
Just really, recently it's...

167
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,370
In regards to "Nihonkai", a movie that Hamada starred in 20 years ago...

168
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,470
Introduction to Hamada's starring film

169
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,470
Released in 1991

170
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,470
I saw your movie! This one!

171
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,780
By Osugi

172
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,040
"Nihonkai" Starring Hamada Masatoshi

173
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,110
This is a very shocking tale, and if you ask why

174
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,650
The star, Hamada Masatoshi, does a splendid job of portraying the dark yakuza world and yet...

175
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,150
I can't get over the fact he looks like a gorilla

176
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:17,260
Breaking promises or shooting guns, no matter what he does he's a gorilla! A child-faced gorilla!

177
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:23,230
Whatever he's doing he's still a gorilla! Even though its a yakuza film, it's become an animal film!

178
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,170
Anyone who doesn't watch this gorilla flick will be trampled!!

179
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,740
Critiques with harsh comments

180
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,740
He critiques the movie with some harsh comments.

181
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,450
And now, for the unreleased footage! There were other jokes set on the bus.

182
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,220
45 minutes passed since start

183
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,220
Haven't we reached the school yet?

184
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,990
Maybe the train would've been better.

185
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:52,560
Arrival at bus stop

186
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:05,780
Arrival at bus stop

187
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,680
Which one is the opening?

188
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Pardon me.

189
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,420
Just walked a little bit and my legs are already tired.

190
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:20,830
(Fake)

191
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:20,830
Shoots for Ikushima Hiroshi's  "Lunch Time Everyday" Show

192
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,330
Basically, the problem is how we cut scenes to here.

193
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,770
In any case, let's just start with this and...

194
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,630
(Nakagawake)

195
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,630
(Tomochika)

196
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,630
Akikawa Sumiko

197
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,630
Director & Cameraman

198
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,630
Trip Guide/Actress

199
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,630
Tsuyoshi & Reiji

200
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,770
Let's just hurry up and shoot this.

201
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,240
So I link it with "Treat every encounter like your last"

202
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,240
Okay, I understand.

203
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,210
Begin the shoots with a punchline

204
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,470
Should we start with a shot of the scenery?

205
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,010
Should we?

206
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,710
I think it'd be good to start with scenery.

207
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,950
5 seconds to go, 4, 3, 2.....

208
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:53,390
Cue Card

209
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:53,390
Treat every encounter

210
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:53,390
like your last

211
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,820
So it's been a while since I've rode a bus during a trip

212
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,530
but I've got to say that it's a leisurely feeling.

213
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,630
Isn't she gonna say the show's title?

214
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:02,070
Akikawa ignores the arranged lines

215
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,370
No, you should be saying the title.

216
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,810
It says "treat every encounter like your last" on the cue card.

217
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,650
I can't take anymore!

218
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,120
Isn't it like a title call?

219
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,760
Treating every encounter like your last is a great.

220
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,030
I think that relationships with others are important for people.

221
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,030
Weeell but I suppose, for me, the best thing are hot springs.

222
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,600
I'm still going, so get outta the way! I need to get into here!

223
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,540
I have to say it again!

224
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Yeah, don't worry.

225
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Yeah, right...it should be fine.

226
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,440
How many times are you going to make me say it.

227
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,440
Err yes, sorry.

228
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,450
Don't ask me that you idiot.

229
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,320
Why is she holding a persimmon?

230
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,360
That persimmon is so annoying!

231
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,430
Dunno what they supposedly did before this.

232
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,070
The persimmon won't....make the scenes consistent.

233
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,300
Persimmon given by a passerby.

234
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,140
In the location just before....

235
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,170
It's reversed.

236
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,970
It becomes reversed.

237
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,840
You gotta explain this...

238
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,080
Can we take take that persimmon for a bit?

239
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,080
Yeah, we don't have time.

240
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,350
Apparently it's seedless.

241
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,350
Oh really.

242
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,050
Now rolling, okay, yes...go.

243
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,420
In my opinion, hot springs are the things...

244
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,290
that make people feel warm inside most.

245
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,330
Ha, hahahaha

246
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:41,200
Cameraman forces a laugh

247
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
The hell was that?

248
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,970
Nothing was funny about it.

249
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,840
There are people like that though.

250
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,750
Alright! That hit on Endo was great!

251
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
Keep destroying Endo!

252
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,760
We'll have to go with that.

253
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,860
I understand.

254
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,130
I'll just go film the outside of the bus.

255
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,390
We should just ask again outside.

256
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,690
Ask someone on the street.

257
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,900
You want the persimmon? Should I take it?

258
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,370
Stop asking me the same question over and over again.

259
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,030
The persimmon will link to the next scene.

260
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,630
Let's just film her wandering around.

261
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,610
You know how she entered while saying "My legs hurt from just walking a little bit"?

262
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:35,150
The 5 guys faced  troublesome happenings

263
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,750
You laughed at yourself saying it!

264
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:35,190
In no time, the 5 faced troublesome happenings.

265
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,960
Your's is that all girls school!

266
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,120
I know right? It's full of cuties!

267
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,660
Excuse me, I've got bad legs...

268
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:44,300
Delinquent students occupying seats

269
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,630
...so could you please give up a seat for me?

270
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,200
HELL NO!!

271
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,970
So friggin' annoying.

272
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:55,070
Bus arrives

273
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:06,550
Bus arrives

274
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,190
They're gonna come.

275
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,160
See, here they come.

276
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:21,370
Mighty Sou

277
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:21,370
Oowada Shinya

278
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,160
I am the Dragon God exiled from the land of Gods...

279
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,140
Mighty Sou!

280
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,670
Ahhh

281
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:34,450
Hock Eye

282
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:34,450
Terence Lee

283
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,680
I am the world's greatest marksman.

284
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,550
Sorry.

285
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,450
Next

286
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,660
A bill....billionaire and a genius scientist.

287
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,300
Ironmarn

288
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,300

A genius businessman who punishes evil.

290
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,670
Ironmaarrn!

291
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,670
We are...
We are

292
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:03,570
Arvengars!

293
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,080
What is this poster?

294
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,150
Well, I was expecting something like that to come.

295
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,150
Arvenjars

296
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,760
Go on grandma.

297
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,170
Go? Didn't she wanna sit down though?

298
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,630
Saves elderly lady from delinquents

299
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,640
This is lame, let's go home!

300
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,810
Take care on your way home.

301
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,640
Fucking geezer what?

302
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,680
Pheww...those guys are lucky to keep their lives.

303
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,790
Besides, it's because you guys

304
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,790
don't offer your seat to elderly people.

305
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,460
That's why all this even happened!

306
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,460
Anger gets aimed at the 5

307
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,160
Don't be silent and answer me.

308
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,990
I said answer me, damn it!

309
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,860
Hold it!

Assassin! Black Window!

314
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:18,250
The cast has laughed, but may continue to watch

315
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:23,650
I'm the legendary warrior possessing wild physical ability!

316

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,130
Ahahaha!

322
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:38,640
Anger changes my appearance...

323
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,810
You're totally different people.

324
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,670
I'm a genius scientiiiiist!

325
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,840
I have no idea what you're talking about.

326
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,140
DAAAAAHH!

327
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,250
Jeeez...

328
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,250
That's enough already.

329
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,660
These guys look even more like CG.

330
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,130
Huh, you're gonna sit down?

331
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,140
Jeez, why are you gonna sit?

332
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,940
Mighty Sou

333
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,940
Don't get so worked up.

334
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,070
They're just civilians.

335
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,710
Mighty. I told you not to get so worked up.

336
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,110
It's obvious that these people aren't bad.

337
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,110
Oh, my bad. I  just can't stand how they left the lady to die.

338
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,420
Oh, my bad. I  just can't stand how they left the lady to die.

339
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,660
Who's next?

340
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,860
.....hey.

341
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,100
Get your act together! Jesus!

342
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,040
Do it properly.

343
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,510
Surely it's not that hard.

344
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,140
Seriously, come on!

345
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,150
You're Tatsu-nii

346
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,150
You're definitely Tatsu-nii

347
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,550
Don't check now.

348
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,480
Your didn'....didn't say but...

349
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,590
I understand what you want to say but

350
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,820
Hahahaha

351
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,060
Please do it properly.

352
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,630
They haven't said their side of the case yet.

353
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,660
Argh, seriously...seriously..seriously

354
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,670
There contagious laughs were...

355
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,100
Maybe you should have practiced it a bit earlier?

356
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,940
I understand what you guys want to say

357
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,170
We haven't said anything.

358
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,940
but we are the Arvenjars.

359
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,810
Shut up you fucking hag.

360
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,080
Oh...

361
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
You just said something, didn't you?

362
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,750
I don't understand the story.

363
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,680
You didn't

364
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,680
call me a hag, did you?

365
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,920
There's no way you would, right?

366
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,220
This is crazy.

367
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,430
There's no sense of tension.

368
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,000
Get into character.

369
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,570
Script?

370
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,640
No, I heard him clearly.

371
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:58,380
Everyone is following a script

372
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,110
Mighty Sou definitely called Black Window a "hag".

373
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,380
And....you guys

374
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:07,490
when I got called a "hag"

375
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,490
weren't you laughing?

376
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,120
If you make fun of the world's final hope...

377
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,130
What is this half-assed rubbish.

378
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,060
Your neck....

379
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,660
What the hell is this!?

380
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,470
What the hell!?

381
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,200
It's not finished yet.

382
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,140
I don't understand anything.

383
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,910
What the hell, it's long too.

384
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,210
Just do it properly please!

385
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,880
It's so long too!

386
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,380
What are you doing?

387
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,920
Choking his neck.

388
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,090
I was told to "Choke it strongly".

389
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,890
Is it this bus?

390
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,660
I'm to busy to deal with random idiots.

391
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,490
Koyabu Kazutoyo

392
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,490
Policeman

393
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,430
What are you people?

394
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,930
Arvengars!

395
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,370
Arvenjars

396
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,030
Ave...

397
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:01,010
Arvenjars

398
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,010
You make me feel like crying.

399
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,140
You cocky bastards.

400
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,110
Questioning commences

401
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,180
Let's start with your real names.

402
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,180
Hey.

403
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,180
Name....

404
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,120
Ironmarn.

405
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,820
This guy's going senile.

406
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,220
Your age?

407
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,790
45

408
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,860
What's with the half-assed lie?

409
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:30,430
I really am 45...

410
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,430
You got

411
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,430
a crap load of wrinkles on your face.

412
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,110
Your skin's rolling inwards.

413
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,280
I ask for you age and you give me this bullshit.

414
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,020
Name...

415
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,450
I'm talkin'! You shut up!!

416
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,090
Don't come forward like that.

417
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,660
But you told me to say my name...

418
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,660
Agnes stop it.

419
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,670
I wonder what's up with her? Nothing is done right.

420
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,040
Please get more into your character...

421
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,710
Say your name. Your real name.

422
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,770
Black Window

423
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,870
Age?

424
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,440
I wonder how old I am?

425
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Umm...

426
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,940
Basically around 25

427
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,940
Around 25.

428
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,250
You're a friggin' old lady.

429
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:21,190
25 years is lower

430
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,190
than half my age.

431
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,190
Ufufufu

432
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,190
Fufufu

433
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,260
Stop laughing about your ages. This ain't a snack bar.

434
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,190
Snack?

435
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,130
You don't need to ask again. You sure like attention.

436
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,670
What the?

437
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,670
Woah, what is this?

438
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,840
It's a snack. Snack as in snack bar.

439
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,180
This isn't a snack bar.

440
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,050
Mighty Sou.

441
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,620
Age?

442
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,390
Might Sou is amazing. He has lived thousands of years.

443
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:02,990
Cut it with the snack bar talk.

444
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,990
Tiny bits of manzai that aren't funny at all.

445
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,130
I'm a God so I have no age.

446
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,800
The hell are you laughing about? What's with those eyes!?

447
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,670
It's like you're constantly shocked.

448
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,830
How rude. It's my real face.

449
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:14,210
You two only give lame ass responses, assholes.

450
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,710
Man this guy is rude.

451
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,150
Koyabu, you're rude.

452
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,450
Haven't they been doing this for about an hour?

453
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,460
Next old guy.

454
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,960
What's your favourite song?

455
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,430
Cold dawn (Samui Yoake).

456
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,660
Eh？

457
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,500
Cold Dawn.

458
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,670
Who's song is that?

459
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,000
Go Hiromi.

460
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,540
Mr. Policeman I'm cold.

461
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,370
yeah.

462
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,390
This policeman's having a rough time.

463
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,420
Okay, you're coming to the station.

464
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,200
Arvenjars arrested

465
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,160
You're going together?

466
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,160
Go. Be careful, don't jump out.

467
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,670
Farewell.

468
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,330
Gong!

469
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,670
Ouch!

470
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,240
That was dangerous.

471
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,320
Ahhh that was a shock.

472
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,660
Even before reaching the school,

473
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,330
Travel show filming team

474
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,330
Defenders of Justice Arvenjars

Saint Kurobikari School Building

477
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:48,670
and so, they reached the Gasu Corporation's Saint Kurobikari School, where they will be posted.

478
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,670
The first assassin to appear here was....

479
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,170
Madonna Teacher

480
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,170
Manda Hisako

481
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,670
I'm Manda, the school nurse.

482
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,680
The Madonna teacher lightly checks Hamada's profile.

483
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,110
Check Hamada's profile

484
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,550
Well usually I just wear jeans and a casual shirt.

485
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,680
Manda-san sees this and doesn't laugh.

486
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,290
Hmmmmmmmmm.....

487
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,720
Hisako here...

488
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:23,200

was once

490
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,030
incredibly

491
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:23,200
the name of an incredibly lame company

492
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,200
owned by this very man

493
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,200
, who was once considered to be a fashion leader...

494
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:36,810
Now he's...

495
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,800
weird

496
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:36,810
wearing a weird perm

497
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:36,810
with hairs resembling

498
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,410
disgusting

499
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,810
that of disgusting pubes...

500
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:45,560
He's so ugly...

501
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:45,560
So ugly...

502
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,560
He's such an ugly comedian...

503
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:48,560
Manda-sensei!

504
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,560
Let's stop here!

505
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,160
You're talking too much!

506
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,160
Manda-sensei, let's stop here, please!

507
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,570
Headmaster's Office

508
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,200
When the new teachers go to introduce themselves to the headmaster.

PIYAKO PIYAKO!

514
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,880
SIT DOWN!

515
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,450
That's your desk?

516
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,260
Don't mess with me, you fool!

517
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,560
From beginning to end, he was a high tensioned headmaster.

518
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,700
New Recruit Training Room

519
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,770
Customary jokes took place at the recruit training room where the 5 standby.

520
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,570

Mysterious panel

522
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,140
A mysterious panel came out of Hamada's drawer.

GET a luxurious prize with 100 medals

527
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,750
In the corner of the room was a slot machine.

528
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,360
It was a chance to get a luxurious prize but...

529
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,730
Tanaka...

530
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,730

532
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,730
Oh nice!

Black part and the

It was set up so that when the faces line up, you are prey to a thai kick.

539
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,500

Let's go everyone!!

567
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,280
The weather's not that good though is it?

568
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,950
It seems a bit cold.

569
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,450
Grounds

570
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,650

Singing of the school anthem.

594
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:54,810

I love you

663
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,690
Inside my head

664
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,820
He must have practiced this heaps!

665
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:56,660
The blaring music

666
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,060
He practiced properly.

667
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,630
Heavy Rotation

668
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,640
What an idiot!!

669
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:10,670
Just thinking about your face and voice

670
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,140
You can't

671
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,140
hear his voice at all!!

672
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:16,150
Makes me go crazy.

673
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:20,650
I'm so lucky

674
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,790
He put feeling in it.

675
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,790
He put feeling in it!!

676
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:26,160
to be able to feel this way

677
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,660
I want you

678
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,190
I need you

679
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,730
I love you

680
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,730
He must have practiced hard.

681
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,170
This love that overflows

682
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:42,170
in around my heart

683
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:47,180
is on heavy rotation

684
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:57,920
Heavy rotation

685
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,760
He's an idiot!!

686
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,160
He sang in the end.

687
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,300
That's the worst Haruka it could have been.

688
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,840
He had practiced that a lot.

689
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,640
I wonder why

690
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,640
he sang at the end?

691
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,910
Haruka-chan is currently

692
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,180
receiving offers from

693
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,180
5 different talent production agencies.

694
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:28,220
However

695
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:28,220
as she wants to concentrate on school

696
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:28,220
she has

697
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,220
apparently rejected every single one.

698
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,390
OOOOIII!!

699
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,390
OOOOIII!!

700
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,860
This shows that a student's main duty is to study.

701
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,260
I hope you all put your schooling first, like Haruka-chan.

702
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:40,800
A drunkard crashes the ceremony

703
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,700

We're in the middle of an important ceremony...

714
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,410
The sky

715
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,410

716
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,650

723
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,660
He didn't drink at all.

724
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,630
What? What?

725
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,940
Nothing.

726
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,670
Ahhh man, my bum hurts.

727
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,670

732

I always sleep.

733
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,880
This old man is tired

734
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,820
I'm gettin' old recently

735
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,820
but I used to work at that trading company, long ago.

736
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,990
But you know what!?

737
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,830
I've ended up like dis before I realised

738
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,660
BWHAHAHAHA！

739
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,870
So he ended up like that before he realised.

740
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,030
Maybe

741
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,030
you should get this guy out of here?

742
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Let's get him out.

743
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,170
Hey, someone get him out.

744
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,570
Hm, yeah. Hm.

745
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,570
It's better if you get him out...

746
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,140
So any o' you guys married yet?

747
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,910

936
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:04,370
Her voice isn't that loud either.

937
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:16,820
The five had attended a 100th year anniversary ceremony full of intruders.

938
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,190
School's 100th Year Anniversary Ceremony

939
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:23,190

00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,230
food praising senryu game to determine their lunches.

944
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,090

00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:32,140
The hamburger with

949
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:30,000
It was a game where you praise food with senryu poems but...

950
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:32,140
its dripping meaty juices

951
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:32,140
it's supreme

952
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,730

Gratin

957
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:46,750
Even if I'm sick

958
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:46,750
I can totally

959
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:46,750
eat it all

960
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,820
Gratin should be an easy one! (?)

961
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,590

Did you say "when it's deep fried-ied"

978
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,010
When it's deep fried-ied,

979
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,080
let's eat loads and loads of it all together, yeah?

980

Lunch with bento according to grades

981
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,650
As a result of these strange senryu poems

982
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:27,160

BONG!!!

1138
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,560
That's enough.

1139
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,100
HYUU!!!

1140
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,570
That's enough...

1141
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,700
That is enough, right?

1142
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:09,040
Yeah, enough...

1143
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,040
Ow...

1144
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,580
What the heck....

1145
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:19,680
Jimmy Ohnishi's VTR

1146
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:19,680
has passed but in no time at all...

1147
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,850
Having only just finished with Jimmy's video

1148
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,050
the next temptation to laugh came.

1149
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
You alright everyone?

1150
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:30,560
At this school

1151
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,560
there is a teacher who is very popular with the students

1152
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,900
and he said he'll let you

1153
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,900
amateur teachers observe his class.

1154
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,600
So we're gonna go look now.

1155
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:45,940
Observe the class

1156
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:45,940
of the teacher who is popular with students!!

1157
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:46,080
What is this class that is highly rated by the school's students?

1158
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,580
3rd Year Group 3 Classroom

1159
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:53,550
There are seats prepared for you at the back.

1160
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:58,820
Teacher not present

1161
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,060
Make sure you properly study him okay?

1162
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,560
Yes.

1163
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,560
Yes.

1164
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:20,480
Japanese History Teacher

1165
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:20,480
Nakayama Kinni-kun

1166
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,460
YAAHH!!

1167
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:48,570
He's way too enthusiastic.

1168
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:52,070
That voice is coming straight from his stomach~.

1169
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,010
Japanese History Teacher

1170
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,010
Kusano Hitoshi

1171
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,350
It did come from his stomach.

1172
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,880
Oi

1173
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,880
Oi

1174
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,880
Oi!!

1175
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,460
Now then

1176
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,460
are you really

1177
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,460
going to 'being'

1178
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,460
doing a class

1179
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,690
or are you not?

1180
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,260
SO WHICH IS IT!!

1181
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,960
I'LL DOO IIIIIT~!

1182
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:23,070
He said going to 'being'.

1183
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:28,010
Slightly nervous Mr. Nakayama.

1184
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,040
Kinni-kun's face.

1185
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:33,050
So, today we'll introduce

1186
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:36,050
how to make udon, a food that

1187
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:39,390
Introduce how to make udon

1188
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,050
many people of the Edo period liked.

1189
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,560
Yes.

1190
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,730
Pot and Katsuo-bushi on standby

1191
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,830
What are the doing?

1192
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,510
Well apparently

1193
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,510
they're popular teachers.

1194
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:09,590
YAAHH!!

1195
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,660
You are the most

1196
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,660
popular teacher, aren't you?

1197
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,060
Ouch!

1198
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:27,570
Jimmy Ohnishi's video and

1199
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:29,540
Jimmy Onishi's VTR (Education Counselor)

1200
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,540
Observing a very popular teacher's class

1201
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:31,040
the 'muscle' class was being conducted.

1202
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,610
Attending a

1203
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,610
staff meeting

1204
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:35,080
The five were also attended a staff meeting.

1205
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,720
Chariman

1206
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,720
Hataka Daikichi (Hakata Hanamaru · Daikichi)

1207
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,720
Suzuki Sawa

1208
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,720
Vice Chairman

1209
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,720
All the complaints are extremely self centered and unreasonable.

1210
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:42,050
The teachers announced the current news of their class and

1211
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:44,550
among them were teachers with unclear speech.

1212
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:47,090
This is class 3-1's home teacher Tenryu speaking

1213
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,560
This is impossible! Impossible impossible impossible!

1214
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,800
Homeroom teacher of 3-1

1215
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,800
Tenryu Genichiro

1216
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,630
And an unexpected event followed after

1217
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,300
Gorillaimo and Tekkamen was brought in for fighting.

1218
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:02,300
Goriraimo

1219
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:02,300
Oshima Miyuki (Morisanchu)

1220
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,640
Take that Iron Mask off

1221
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:04,640
at once!!

1222
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,080
That's right! Hurry up and take that thing of you fool!

1223
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,350
Why you!

1224
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,350
How dare you do that!?!

1225
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,850
Why you! How dare you do that!?!

1226
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,990
BAHAHAHA!!!

1227
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,990
Eh!?!

1228
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:20,290
Tanaka's wife enters

1229
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:21,460
Tanaka's wife appeared for the first time as an assassin of laughter.

1230
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,130
What a shocker!

1231
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:26,100
You two,

1232
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,100
what is the meaning of all this fighting?

1233
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,060
This bonehead was talking smack about my man.

1234
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,800
Kohinata Shie

1235
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,800
Tanaka's wife

1236
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,100
Huh?

1237
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,070
If he's gross and I said he's gross,

1238
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,070
then what is wrong with that?!?

1239
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,070
He's not gross at all!

1240
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,370
Even though he has such thick arm hair,

1241
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:38,740
his head

1242
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,740
is still going bald!

1243
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:38,740
What's up with that???

1244
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:38,740
Shut up!!!

1245
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,910
It's true that when my man

1246
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:43,580
gets out of the bath,

1247
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,580
his head is so bald

1248
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,580
that I wonder if he's sick!

1249
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,580
But that's fine with me!!

1250
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:51,050
Hey, what are you doing???

1251
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:51,050
What are you doing?!?

1252
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:56,160
Black part

1253
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:56,160
Red part of the announcement

1254
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,030
Next, when they visited the school's baddest delinquent

1255
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,330
Delinquent student

1256
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,330
Matsuko Deluxe

1257
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:10,370
The prize is a rice ball filled with love

1258
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,170
Matsuko, who took a great liking to the five

1259
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:08,670
ended up gifting them rice balls.

1260
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,780
I'm making this one for you (Yamazaki)

1261
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,780
Ah, actually...

1262
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,380
You don't want it?

1263
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,780
No no no...

1264
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,780
That's not it...

1265
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,780
You don't want it?!?

1266
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,560
Who will be the one...

1267
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,560
that will understand my feelings...

1268
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,060
Huh!?!

1269
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,070
Will you be the one that understands my feelings?

1270
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,740
What is this!?!

1271
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:48,180
Come on now!

1272
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:48,180
It kinda felt like it ended a moment ago!

1273
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:51,610
I really thought it was over just now!

1274
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,580
Do you guys really think it's THAT funny

1275
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:55,580
to see a bunch of old guys hop around?

1276
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,560
A competition event with teachers of rival schools.

1277
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,560
A competition event against teachers from rival schools.

1278
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:09,300
OK to laugh but losing representatives will be punished!!

1279
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:09,300
Competition event

1280
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,060
Although they were allowed to laugh

1281
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:10,570
the losers of a jumping box battle were to be punished.

1282
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:09,770
Competition event

1283
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:09,770
OK to laugh but losing representatives will be punished!!

1284
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,100
He's not that heavy, is he?

1285
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,710
His butt touched the vault!!

1286
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:25,710
Endo, who dragged the team down got the Thai kick

1287
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:24,080
In the end, Endo, the member who was expected to be most reliable

1288
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,050
dragged the team down to defeat.

1289
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:28,580
A Thai kick was given as punishment.

1290
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,550
This is really scary!!

1291
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:29,820
WAAAAAAHH!!!

1292
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,620
WAAAAAAHH!!!

1293
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,620
WAAAAAAHH!!

1294
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,730
That really is

1295
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,730
"The Asshole Crusher"!

1296
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:38,660
Must be, yeah.

1297
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,560
It must indeed hurt badly right now.

1298
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:46,070
Going to a field trip

1299
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,700
Finally, the five go to a field trip.

1300
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:48,570
Naturally, traps were set as they traveled.

1301
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:46,840
Arriving at Bus Stop

1302
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:46,900
Arriving at Bus Stop

1303
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:52,710
Arriving at Bus Stop

1304
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:48,870
Eh?

1305
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:49,570
Again?

1306
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:52,570
Why are we stopping here?

1307
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:59,720
Actress

1308
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:59,720
Kimiko Ikegami

1309
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:07,020
Reading a script of a

1310
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:07,020
suspense drama

1311
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:07,020
with Matsumoto as her partner

1312
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:04,050
When Ikegami entered the bus she began to read the

1313
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:07,620
script of a suspense drama with Matsumoto as her partner.

1314
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,260
From the back of the bus....

1315
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:11,590
When from the back of the bus...

1316
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:18,200
Sister!

1317
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:18,200
Please stop it already... Let's just give it up!

1318
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:25,410
* Enjoy the show even though they laughed already

1319
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:22,570
We can't defy our destiny even if we run away...

1320
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,410
Little sister Kanae

1321
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,410
Nakayama Shinobu

1322
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,470
Kanae, what are you talking about?

1323
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:31,210
Do you honestly think you could be happy?

1324
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:35,180
Prosecutor

1325
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:35,180
Toyota Maho

1326
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:37,090
...actors continuously appear.

1327
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:40,660
It unfolded just like a real drama.

1328
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:42,360
Detective

1329
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:42,360
Kawahara Sabu

1330
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,520
And in the end...

1331
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:53,540
If I build a house one day

1332
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:53,540
Akiko Kosaka

1333
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:53,540
Singer for the credits

1334
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:57,070
...Kosaka Akiko appeared.

1335
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:00,580
She sang the ending song, and the suspense drama concluded.

1336
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:04,510
Suspense drama concludes.

1337
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:09,520
From here is unreleased footage. There were more assassins on the bus.

1338
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:17,360
One danger ends and another begins.

1339
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:17,360
The bus ride becomes even more harsh

1340
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,550
One danger ends and another begins.

1341
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:16,560
The bus ride becomes even more harsh.

1342
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:18,290
Arriving at Bus Stop

1343
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:18,330
Arriving at Bus Stop

1344
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:18,360
Arriving at Bus Stop

1345
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:18,390
Arriving at Bus Stop

1346
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:24,100
Arriving at Bus Stop

1347
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,130
That was kinda quick~.

1348
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,130
Maybe we arrived?

1349
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:24,130
Arriving at Bus Stop

1350
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:24,170
Arriving at Bus Stop

1351
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:24,200
Arriving at Bus Stop

1352
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:24,230
Arriving at Bus Stop

1353
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:24,270
Arriving at Bus Stop

1354
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:24,300
Arriving at Bus Stop

1355
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,700
Hurry up and get on.

1356
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,040
Hurry up

1357
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,040
Hurry up

1358
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,540
Come on, this way.

1359
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,540
Okay, quickly quickly.

1360
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:42,680
Gaki no Tsukai - New Face-

1361
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:42,680
Takei Tokuji

1362
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,460
It's the "New Face".

1363
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,260
Ouch!

1364
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,330
Indeed

1365
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,560
Ouch!

1366
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,330
there was this guy.

1367
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,330
Forgot about him.

1368
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,470
What are they doing?

1369
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:58,570
Acchan, Toku-chan...

1370
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:03,010
Acchan

1371
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:03,010
Daughter

1372
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:03,010
Koumoto Junichi

1373
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:03,010
Mom

1374
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:03,010
Son

1375
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:03,010
Toku-chan.

1376
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:03,070
today you have an important audition for a drama.

1377
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:09,080
If you succeed at this, you'll be stars of the child acting world!

1378
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:13,680
Auditioning today to be child acting stars

1379
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:13,680
Okay? Did you read the script the director gave you?

1380
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,280
Are you okay, Toku-chan?

1381
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:18,590
Speak up honey.

1382
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,720
...mmm.

1383
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,360
Not good!

1384
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:33,970
His voice barely came out.

1385
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:34,970
Owee ow!

1386
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:37,070
Ow!

1387
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,410
I don't get it

1388
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:40,410
a child actor?

1389
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:40,580
Let's try and restrain ourselves.

1390
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,610
Firstly, Acchan. Acchan you are

1391
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:49,080
the school's madonna, okay?

1392
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:51,420
Acchan's role is the school's madonna.

1393
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,550
And Toku-chan could you please act as

1394
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:57,060
the school's gym teacher who is loved by everyone?

1395
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:58,790
Toku-chan's role is an idol teacher

1396
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,060
Ha...ahhh.

1397
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:02,560
These two people fall in love and...

1398
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:09,840
Story of a student and teacher's forbidden love

1399
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,670
and they run away together.

1400
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:10,070
A female student and a high school teacher enters a bus.

1401
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,070
Ready, start!

1402
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:24,450
Female student

1403
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:24,450
Hey sir

1404
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:24,450
I bet the school

1405
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:24,450
is probably

1406
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:24,450
making a huge fuss now because of what we've done.

1407
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:24,450
Look at that grandpa's face.

1408
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:27,660
And in response to that

1409
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:27,660
the teacher, Toku-chan says...

1410
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,790
...I dunno the lines.

1411
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:34,660
Fufu...

1412
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:40,240
I wasn't given the script.

1413
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:47,080
Arrrghh!

1414
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,080
Argh!

1415
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,050
That hurt.

1416
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:54,780
He said "I wasn't given the script".

1417
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,320
Shouldn't you start from there?

1418
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:58,150
You did get the script, right?

1419
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:00,520
I DIDN'T!

1420
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,760
Mummy has it and

1421
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,760
even Acchan has it too.

1422
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,830
Why is it that only Toku-chan

1423
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,830
ended up not getting one?

1424
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:06,130
Isn't that strange?

1425
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:13,400
Yeah, that's why I said

1426
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,400
"What the hell's going on".

1427
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:15,370
To who?

1428
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:22,080
Oh man, this is getting to me. Crap, crap.

1429
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:26,720
We gave Toku-chan a script one week ago.

1430
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,710
Argh!

1431
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:24,050
Ahhh!

1432
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,080
He's friggin' lying.

1433
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:31,250
Basically,

1434
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:31,250
this is the situation.

1435
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,290
I'm not a professional talent, okay?

1436
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,320
I'm working casual as an extra, okay?

1437
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:40,830
"You don't have to do much"

1438
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:40,830
is what they say to me.

1439
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:46,570
How am I supposed to capture what he's saying?

1440
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:54,910
It seems that Toku-chan was directed

1441
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:54,910
about this shoot by his management agency.

1442
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:49,570
That's enough, seriously!

1443
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:52,570
Ouch!

1444
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,140
Maybe that's what he was told?

1445
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:58,050
But we live together.

1446
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:07,290
Female student

1447
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:07,290
I was really happy, you know.

1448
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:05,050
Just hold it there Acchan.

1449
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,590
Wait, wait.

1450
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,590
Hey mom. Mom.

1451
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:09,260
Mom.

1452
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:09,260
That's enough.

1453
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,730
Acchan's just continuing on.

1454
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:20,700
What I'm saying is exactly according to the script.

1455
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:23,870
We can't go to the audition like this!

1456
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:25,110
Quickly get off and try once more.

1457
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:28,040
Toku-chan quickly come here

1458
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,040
we'll remember it from scratch again.

1459
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,050
Come here!

1460
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:35,950
Hurry up and come

1461
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,950
practice!!

1462
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,230
They didn't end up coming back in.

1463
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,230
They left, didn't they?

1464
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:49,400
Yamazaki kept loudly making noises

1465
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:49,400
like "Fuga fuga" next to me.

1466
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,070
Did you get hooked to it?

1467
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,730
I was hooked with Acchan.

1468
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,740
25 minutes pass since departing school

1469
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:55,940
25 minutes pass since departing the school.

1470
00:54:54,940 --> 00:55:01,310
The next assassin

1471
00:54:54,940 --> 00:55:01,310
to assault them was again a formidable enemy!

1472
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,170
The next assassin wasn't

1473
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,110
easy to deal with either.

1474
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,550
Huh?

1475
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,050
What is that!?

1476
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:12,590
Student finds something towards the front

1477
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:10,090
Stop for a second!

1478
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:12,550
Please!

1479
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:16,060
Wait, wait! Stop for a second!

1480
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:21,760
Someone stops the bus...

1481
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:23,670
Up we go.

1482
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:26,540
Jeez,

1483
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,540
Akira

1484
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,870
Mom!

1485
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:30,170
Chinese restaurant delivery

1486
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:30,170
Maeda Bibari

1487
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,570
You forgot your lunch didn't you!

1488
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,480
That was totally on purpose.

1489
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,410
Delivering her son something he forgot.

1490
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:35,680
Here!

1491
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,380

00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,560
It's the lady from the noodle shop.

1506
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:37,710

This is scary.

1520
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:02,600
Despite the horrific accident, she returns to deliveries

1521
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,060

1522
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,600

00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,880
I wonder who she's talking to?

1556
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,980
Probably the store's boss?

1557
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:27,050
Ouch!

1558
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,520

It hit him.

2397
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:48,580
Henmi's Shots All Hit The Target

2398
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:45,610
Oh wow.

2399
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,710
He doesn't get it on target at all.

2400
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,210
That Terminator doesn't hit her at all.

2404
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:02,090

2405
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:16,940

01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:54,840
He parked his bike quite far away too.

2418
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:59,750
The five had witnessed Terminator's shocking death.

2419

The changed back into clothes appropriate for a teacher

2424

01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,260
Since Beginning Work As Teacher:  17 Hours

2427
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,700
As soon as they returned to modern times,

2428
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:20,630
they attended a PTA meeting that included the staff.

2429
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:23,200
Attended a PTA Meeting

2430
01:29:21,170 --> 01:29:22,070
Please begin.

2431
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,040
Everyone

2432
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:23,270
May I speak about Hamada?

2433
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:24,340
Oh yes, sure.

2434
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:57,100
Hamada Masatoshi Secret Info

2435
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:57,100
Story of his stupidity...

2436
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,810
They then begin to talk of and episode of Hamada's stupidity.

2437
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:32,550
Hamada and Higashino do a show in Osaka

2438
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:34,010

2440
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:33,150
Ah yes.

2441
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:35,520
called "Gobu Gobu", where they wander around towns.

2442
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:39,750
Well Hamada was being egocentric

2443
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,750
and said "I don't want to walk very much".

2444
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:44,220
So the staff carried him to the location of the opening scene

2445
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:44,220
by station wagon.

2446
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:45,390
Then they open the doorand Hamada gets off.

2447
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:47,860
Then they open the door and Hamada gets off.

2448
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:47,860
and then they shoot the show.

2449
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:50,630
And at the end of the shooting

2450
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:49,800
a station wagon will come and Hamada will get on.

2451
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:50,630
a station wagon will come and Hamada will get on.

2452
01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:54,000
Every time  he gets off and gets on the car

2453
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Every time he gets off and gets on the car

2454
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,270
Every time he gets off and gets on the car

2455
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,270
he bangs his head,  apparently.

2456
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:04,680
Every time!

No idea.

2466
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:18,360
You don't make sense.

2467
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:26,030
This was really creepy.

Does He Enjoy The Show?

2488
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:24,420
However...

2489
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:27,530
...how much does he know about this show?

2490
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,360
I watch it every year but...

2491
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:35,440
I watch it around when it's time for flower watching.

Around April.

2493

I watch it around when it's time for flower watching.

2494
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:41,410
He looks at the lyrics

2495
01:31:41,410 --> 01:31:45,410
and says the he is slightly disappointed to have the jokes revealed to him.

2496
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:47,410
However...

2497
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:49,850
...the color of his eyes change as he stands in front of the mic

2498
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,390
and that great song was born.

laugh

2591
01:33:16,970 --> 01:33:19,270
ter

2592
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:23,180
It's done.

2593
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:25,580
Recording Finishes And...

2594
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:29,220
My wife was worried.

2595
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:31,920
Saying "Is it okay? To do something like this."

2596
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:32,850
I'm quite comfortable with it now  so I'm fine.

2597
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:34,620
I'm quite comfortable with it now so I'm fine.

2598
01:33:34,890 --> 01:33:35,720
Well.

2599
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:36,290
Yes.

2600
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:36,290
Yes.

2601
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:37,890
We had quite a lot this year.

2602
01:33:37,690 --> 01:33:39,890
Yes, you're right.

2603
01:33:39,630 --> 01:33:40,490
Yeah.

2604
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:41,460
Yes.

2605
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:42,230
If you see this

2606
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:45,730
you can understand that this wasn't cut because it wasn't funny.

2607
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,770
Oh, yes, yes.

2608
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:48,130
Yes.

2609
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:49,340
So, Matsumoto-san. This year...

2610
01:33:49,470 --> 01:33:51,540
No, no, I'm not worthy.

2611
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:51,840
How are you gonna end it?

2612
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:53,570
That's Great Lord Hamada's job.

2613
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:53,970
Why the hell!?

2614
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:55,910
It's not my responsibility!

2615
01:33:56,110 --> 01:33:58,680
The Nihon TV staff all moved in closer.

2616
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:01,210
No, that's his role.

2617
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,380
They call you the God of Yoshimoto though.

2618
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:05,250
You're called a God.

2619
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:05,750
You idiot!

2620
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,490
Whatever, wrap up the show...

2621
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:08,860
...Tsukitei-san.

2622
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:09,920
You gotta be kiddin'!

2623
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,260
Please wrap up the show.

2624
01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:13,690
STARTING FROM THE MORNING!!

2625
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:14,630
NEXT YEAR!

2626
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:17,130
I'LL DO MY BEST AGAAAAIN!

2627
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:19,070
Piece of trash.
