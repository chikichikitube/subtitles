1
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,650
Just for once, just for this time, in my whole life

2
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,920
I want to win this game

3
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,220
I believe I have a strong defense

4
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,490
I'll be fine even if people do some high-level gags

5
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,990
This is the time

6
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:47,060
I'm actually getting closer and closer to victory

7
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:52,500
This is the time for me to put 10 million right in front of my wife

8
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:08,530
The teddy bear who has always been humble

9
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,970
The cute teddy bear

10
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,230
The little teddy bear

11
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,550
I've already received an orange card

12
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,290
-Oh, yeah
-So he is out

13
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,170
Who brought this porno mag here?

14
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,380
This is gonna get me erect

15
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,420
What's wrong with you?

16
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,520
He's out

17
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,800
Don't give me so little

18
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,530
The pee is gonna stain my hand

19
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,670
You're laughing dude

20
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,670
Ah, here comes the alarm

21
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,890
You laughed right?

22
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,320
Let's start

23
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,510
If I don't win, this will just be an evidence of my labour

24
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,280
It's good to have that pee smell as your evidence of labour

25
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,980
-I'm so sorry for the inconvenience
-No problem at all

26
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,070
-You started cleaning it immediately right?
-You didn't resist cleaning it

27
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,460
You did those jobs before?

28
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,560
What the heck is a job that cleans pee?

29
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,660
Where can you even find those jobs?

30
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,190
-He means like a cleaner
-Yes

31
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,660
That's not limited to cleaning pee

32
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,740
Were you a permanent employee?

33
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,530
What the heck do you mean a permanent employee?

34
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,400
A permanent employee that cleans pee?

35
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,260
Never heard of that

36
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,690
-Did you laugh?
-No, I didn't

37
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,620
You laughed just now

38
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,570
-No, I didn't
-Yes, you did

39
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,790
Pretend to show off my muscles

40
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,790
But actually checking the smell of my armpit

41
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,000
That's interesting

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,780
Really?

43
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,070
Show us more

44
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,580
-Show you more?
-I feel like laughing

45
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,160
It's festival today!

46
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,960
Sore-Sore

47
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,710
Jori-jori (sound of shaving)

48
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,220
What a beautiful bikini line

49
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,260
Peekaboo!

50
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,100
So small

51
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,690
No, it's not small, it's just buried

52
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,440
It's not buried at all

53
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,440
It's as small as a turtle head

54
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,040
No way, it's big

55
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
No, Miyasako's was bigger

56
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,810
That's because he got erected

57
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,170
Huh?

58
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,480
It was so small, I want to see it again

59
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,750
So small

60
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,040
You're being hunted

61
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,170
Eh, why?

62
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,360
This is a battle

63
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,220
You have a weapon too

64
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,040
OUCH!

65
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,970
Ah, this really hurts

66
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,330
Come on, come on

67
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,070
AH! OUCH!

68
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,310
OUCH!

69
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,210
OUCH!

70
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,740
AH! OUCH!

71
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,530
Gather up! My ultra power!

72
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,200
OUCHHH!!!

73
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,000
IT HURTS!!!

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,710
Ah, my urethra somehow opened up

75
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,410
That's enough

76
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,120
That's seriously enough

77
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,510
Please stop it

78
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,920
Did you try to pee?

79
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,400
Huh?

80
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,630
Did you try to pee just now?

81
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,940
That peeing thing belongs to me

82
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,050
-Belongs to you?
-Belongs to me

83
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,200
Yeah, the pee performance art

84
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,950
The pee performance art?

85
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,640
And the erect performance art is mine

86
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,440
It won't be interesting even if you do the pee performance art again

87
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,200
It won't get a laugh

88
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,610
I want to eat that steak again

89
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,800
It was so delicious

90
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,850
-Is it?
-Yes

91
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,020
It tastes so good

92
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,650
Maybe we can call food delivery then?

93
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,350
But the zombies will come soon

94
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,970
Ah yeah, you're right, there's zombies

95
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,200
They are on standby

96
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,430
They're gonna come in group

97
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,990
-We're unable to kill those zombies right?
-Yeah

98
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,340
-And it's fine for them to laugh right?
-Yes

99
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,180
There's no way to stop them

100
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,630
Those zombies...

101
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,940
We just have to endure those zombies

102
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,850
Yes, we have to keep on enduring

103
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,490
Come on, no one will laugh at a staring-out game now

104
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,680
Zombie time

105
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,330
That scared me

106
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
It's been quite a while

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,250
They have three people now

108
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,190
Hello, everybody!

109
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,300
Thank you all for coming today

110
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,030
Tokyo's sushi just tastes so good

111
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, it's the home of sushi

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,690
I want to play the role of a sushi master

113
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,760
Ah I see, so I'll be the customer

114
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,420
Excuse me, can I come in?

115
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,670
Low ploblem

116
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,240
No problem?

117
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,250
Clum in

118
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,700
Come in?

119
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,010
Come in, come in

120
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,760
Would you like to have the chef's choice plan?

121
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,150
Well yes, I'll leave it to you

122
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,040
Here you go

123
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,230
A tiny and cold steamed egg custard

124
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,050
Who will even want that?

125
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,960
Give me a big and hot one

126
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,520
Here you go

127
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,810
A fat saury with it's entrails being taken out and then put back

128
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,710
What's the meaning of that?

129
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,150
It's meaningless to take out the entrails first

130
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,620
-Here you go
-Here it is

131
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,430
-It's fried chicken
-Fried chicken?

132
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,770
Fried chicken at a sushi restaurant?

133
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,890
That's weird

134
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,420
Here you go

135
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,360
Amberjack sushi with 800 types of secret ingredients

136
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,580
That's too much

137
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,820
Covered in curry

138
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,570
Curry?

139
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,000
Amberjack with curry?

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,500
Here you go

141
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,350
I'll make another sushi now

142
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,400
Here you go

143
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,760
-Please guess what it is
-So I need to guess it now

144
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,450
Yes, for example it's not just tuna, it's here, tuna's cheek

145
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,780
Oh I see, so some rare parts

146
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,400
-Can I make the sushi now?
-Yes please

147
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,410
Here you go

148
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,520
-Please guess what it is
-I'll try

149
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,930
I have no idea

150
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,030
It's here of a dolphin

151
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,280
Don't give me those things

152
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,940
Here you go

153
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,660
-What is it?
-It's here of a hammerhead shark

154
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,640
That's gross

155
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,370
Here you go

156
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,940
-What is it?
-It's here of a anglerfish

157
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,160
That's disgusting

158
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,640
Here you go

159
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,720
What is it?

160
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,690
It's two squid sushi

161
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,380
Two squid sushi?

162
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,330
Two squid sushi at this point of time?

163
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,610
Be quiet!

164
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,790
-Look who's talking
-There's other customers here

165
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,540
The customer over there is Kakuei-san

166

167
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,850
-Tanaka?
-Yes, Tanaka

168
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,230
No way, he's dead

169
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,480
He's actually alive

170
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,240
Japan has a lot of these people

171
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,760
So Tanaka Kakuei-san is actually still alive?

172
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,850
The customer sitting at the corner is Ken-san

173
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,940
*Ken Takakura was a Japanese actor and singer who died of lymphoma on November 10, 2014

174
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,940
Takakura?

175
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,550
It's Shimura

176
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,060
Shimura

177
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,000
The Shimura-san who is still alive

178
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,080
-The customer sitting over there
-Yes?

179

He's Yu-chan

180
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,220

*Yūjirō Ishihara was a Japanese actor and singer born in Kobe

182
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,010
Do you mean Ishihara Yujiro?

183
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:50,780
It's Gidayu

184
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,020
Gidayu?

185
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,990
You mean Great Gidayû?

186
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,630
*Great Gidayû was an actor, known for Kikujiro (1999), Vivianne: Busô Jet (2017) and Suicide Bus (1998)

187
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,630
Who would even call Great Gidayu as Yu-chan?

188
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,260
Gidayu-san, you want to have the check?

189
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,830
The scene of Gidayu having the check

190
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,370
The first ever in the history of variety shows

191
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,430
The scene of Great Gidayu having the check

192
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,170
-180 thousand yen please
-180 thousand yenm?

193
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,640
What did he order?

194
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,910
Whelk sushi

195
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,720
Whelk sushi?

196
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,360
2000 pieces

197
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,270
2000 pieces?

198
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,650
For takeaway

199
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,900
I'm enough of this, let me have the check

200
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,000
3800 yen please

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,380
That's reasonable

202
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,020
That's enough

203
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,650
Thank you very much

204
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,660
Erect, dude!

205
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,220
I even used some lotions

206
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,970
Can't get erect

207
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,440
Erect, erect!

208
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,670
No matter what I do, can't get erect

209
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,860
He kept doing this back there

210
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,240
He kept doing this behind the door

211
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,610
Saying "Wait, wait, I can't get erect"

212
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,440
I've borrowed some lotions, still can't get erect

213
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,350
In the end, they just asked me to wear a condom

214
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,220
Because I can't get erect

215
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,120
I even did it in a new way like this

216
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,010
But still, it doesn't work

217
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,500
I've never seen someone doing it like this

218
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,760
We normally do it like this, but he's like this

219
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,730
Like a whirlpool

220
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,840
I've even tried to help him out

221
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,160
Because everyone was waiting for me to get erect

222
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,810
I was trying so hard to get erect

223
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,800
And the staffs came several times to check and report the status of my erection

224
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,780
To the senior staffs

225
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,020
I'm erecting a little bit now

226
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,770
That must be tough

227
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,490
Yes, it sure is

228
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,780
He can't get erect

229
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,720
It must be difficult to get erect

230
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,460
I actually thought he was going to pee like that

231
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,200
Ah, so with the condom?

232
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,720
Yeah, and the condom will become larger and larger

233
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,770
I can't even pee

234
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,480
-I thought about that too
-Huh?

235
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,200
Here comes the pee

236
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,830
What the heck...

237
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,540
Wait a second...

238
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,460
I'm the one peeing

239
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,980
Come on, dude

240
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,760
That's horrible

241
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,620
I'm sorry

242
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,200
I'm so sorry

243
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,740
What the heck are you doing?

244
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,760
Come on, dude

245
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,520
I was caught off guard

246
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,920
Don't go too far guys, we will be scolded

247
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,200
That was awful

248
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,960
I'm serious

249
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,660
And you two scattered your clothes around the corridor

250
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,540
So you were wearing your clothes before coming in

251
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,240
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

252
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,500
Come on...

253
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,800
-Miyasako
-Yes

254
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,480
You laughed right?

255
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,770
Yes, I laughed

256
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,950
And also...

257
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,490
Itoda

258
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,630
You laughed right?

259
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,990
Yes, I laughed

260
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,580
Let's take a look

261
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,800
I can't even pee

262
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,640
I thought about that too

263
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,520
Huh?

264
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,210
Here comes the pee

265
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,370
What the heck...

266
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,680
So Itoda laughed as well

267
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,090
Itoda absolutely laughed

268
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,570
This is going mad

269
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,440
Pee zombies...

270
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,110
You guys tried hard, but...

271
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,260
Itoda-san and Miyasako-san

272
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,720
Out!

273
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:35,710
-I watched the exactly same gag at Lumine yesterday
-Yes, it's the same

274
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,140
The gag that made my daughter laugh so hard

275
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,130
-Has been reproduced in such a way
-That's terrible

276
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,100
This is the way to success

277
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,220
To make people do the Tsukommi

278
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,260
At the moment you did Manzai nakedly, it's already not successful

279
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,630
At that moment, we're no longer a Manzai comedian

280
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,520
Not much time left, let's restart

281
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,200
Damn it

282
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,400
He got me on that one

283
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,700
Come on, it's all about peeing

284
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,230
I wonder what will happen from here

285
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,840
Eh?

286
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,610
Good luck guys

287
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,790
Which way are we going? Oh, this way

288
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,150
There's nothing I can do about it, I laughed out loud

289
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,260
Huh? Here comes the pee

290
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,340
I haven't laughed this hard in a long time

291
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,730
I wasn't blown away like that in a long time

292
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,910
However...

293
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,820
I've decided to get an erect penis since that moment

294
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,360
Who brought this porno mag here?

295
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,620
This is gonna get me erect

296
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,170
Eh?

297
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,730
And indeed, I got erect

298
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:45,040
So personally, I think I've got the victory in this sense

299
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,210
Well...

300
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,960
I've done quite a few things that I wanted to do, however...

301
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,140
Nothing happened at all...

302
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,240
It's me, it's me

303
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,440
HAMBURGER

304
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,120
So I've prepared this for everyone...

305
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,980
I'm not satisfied at all

306
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,130
Because all I did was peeing

307
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,400
(If you're willing to smile for me)

308
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,730
(I will do anything for that)

309
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,250
-You two looked into each other's eyes right?
-Yes

310
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,220
Questions like "what will be interesting"

311
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,370
Or like "how to make people laugh"

312
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,720
They become really difficult to judge under that atmosphere

313
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,700
We don't know how many points we have right?

314
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,390
-Yeah, but Kurochan probably have a lot of points
-Let's start

315
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,200
-I bet you scored a lot of points
-No, I don't think so

316
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,670
No, Kurochan probably scored many points

317
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,110
Shall we do something?

318
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,300
-Yeah, let's do something
-We better do something

319
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,000
Let's do it

320
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,080
It's gonna end soon

321
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,690
It's so empty here now

322
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,800
Yeah, you're right

323
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,690
It's so empty

324
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,860
It's just so empty

325
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,260
Did something happen over there?

326
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,130
It's so cold

327
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,970
Yeah, it's cold

328
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,270
This is incredible

329
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,690
This scene is incredible

330
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,820
This scene is incredible

331
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,490
Umm...it's so hard to make people laugh

332
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,530
This is so scary

333
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:26,030
How would Nishizawa feel for listening to that

334
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:31,040
I can't find my glasses

335
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,560
Yes?

336
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,270
This...

337
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,660
Did you buy this one at a time?

338
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,270
No, I buy it in bulk

339
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,980
This looks like the Pietro salad dressing

340
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,180
Do you use it too?

341
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,050
No, not at all

342
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,410
How do you use it?

343
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,800
How to use it?

344
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,930
To make things slimy

345
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,160
And...

346
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,590
What I like is

347
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,330
To put lotion on my testicles

348
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,170
And grip it tight

349
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,700
Can I use my sword?

350
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,560
Ah, yes

351
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,700
Eh, it's over there?

352
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,960
It was quite soft

353
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,400
-But you're really strong right?
-Yes

354
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,770
What should I do...

355
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,500
-Can I hit you?
-Yes?

356
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,390
Can I hit you?

357
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,700
-Yeah sure, no problem
-Thank you very much

358
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,980
You two look alike

359
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,180
They all end up wearing the same color

360
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,580
Are you from primary school?

361
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,040
Not yet?

362
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,750
Not yet

363
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,500
Eh?

364
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,750
He's the crash test dummy

365
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,480
The crash test dummy

366
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,820
Where can you buy that costume?

367
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,040
So scary

368
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,970
What is it?

369
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,040
It's a photo of me during primary school

370
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,310
Look at the T-shirt

371
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,660
Family computer

372
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,940
-Eh, it's Famicom
-I miss it

373
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,790
That's amazing

374
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,690
Have you ever seen a Famicom t-shirt?

375
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,050
Nah

376
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,220
My dad took this photo during our family trip

377
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,320
My sister is biting my mom's hand

378
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,110
How could there be photos like this

379
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,920
-Ah...
-She's biting hard

380
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,870
And we were hold each other's hands

381
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,400
In front of the telephone box

382
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
There was only these telephone boxes at that time

383
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,230
We were hold each other's hands tightly

384
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,590
Eh?

385
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,710
And my sister is biting my mom's hand

386
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,490
But her face looks...

387
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,750
Let's get started

388
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,750
Zombie time

389
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,580
We definitely won't lose this time

390
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,590
We're gonna win this

391
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,380
Huh?

392
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,040
We definitely won't lose

393
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,600
No way, we should be the ones saying that

394
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,970
Do you know how many times our team won, dude?

395
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,940
It's not about how many times you won

396
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,020
People call us the ever victorious general, dude

397
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,230
We're never gonna lose

398
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,540
Come on, let's get started

399
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,410
Let's get started

400
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,550
-Get ready
-Wait a second...

401
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,990
Do it tenderly please

402
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,990
This is the thin one

403
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,550
Got it

404
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,770
You better change the adapter...

405
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,280
You better change the adapter...

406
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,700
Iio-san does this kind of things too?

407
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,160
Yeah, it's shocking

408
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,040
-This is not like Iio-san
-Iio-san's testicles look so old

409
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,440
-He's an old man
-Yeah

410
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,160
Yeah, I'm already 48 years old

411
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,120
-I'll put it in now
-Okay

412
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,470
Can I go further?

413
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,780
Okay, got it

414
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,330
-It really went in
-Do it slowly

415
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,610
Okay, no problem, I'll do it slowly

416
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,860
Slowly please...

417
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,890
Hey bro, hey bro...

418
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,880
Ah, the air is coming in

419
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,210
Hey bro...

420
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,210
You stink

421
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,090
No, I don't stink

422
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,270
Do you need some lotion?

423
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,290
Yes, give me some lotion

424
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,700
Lotion is over there

425
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,450
Is this lotion?

426
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,120
Yes, it's lotion

427
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,230
Actually, quite a lot came in

428
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,470
Maybe put some lotion around your anus

429
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,510
Yeah, that's better

430
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,470
This is amazing

431
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,210
-Can I move your testicles a bit?
-Yes

432
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,810
Eh, so you need to move it first?

433
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,160
It's better to pour it from the top

434
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,820
Ah, it's amazing

435
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,360
This is hard

436
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,690
-Nobu's testicles look like the back of a kid's head
-This is dangerous

437
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,570
Did it go in?

438
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,080
It's going in, it's going in

439
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,200
A lot of it went in

440
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,460
-Jun-chan okay, Jun-chan okay
-This is dangerous

441
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,540
This is dangerous, it's coming out

442
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,360
AHHH

443
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,500
Iio-san, I'll pump it now

444
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,970
I can feel something inside

445
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,660
It's not coming out at all

446
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,860
Okay, okay

447
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,550
Pan-pan, okay

448
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,930
Pan-pan?

449
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,430
That was close

450
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,720
He farted a lot

451
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,050
That was massive

452
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,010
That was amazing

453
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,360
What the heck is this game?

454
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,950
Okay

455
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,420
-Fujimon
-Yes

456
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,070
Out!

457
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,160
Oh yes, we did it

458
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,920
You're almost there

459
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,130
You were so close

460
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,850
Nothing is coming out from Nobu

461
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,970
It's not coming out

462
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,160
Okay, okay

463
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,740
Pan-pan, okay

464
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,450
Pan-pan?

465
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,900
Nobu was peeing last time and now this, will he be fine?

466
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,820
We killed one of you, so no problem at all

467
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,030
I can't believe they did that

468
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,360
Okay, okay

469
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,260
That was just...

470
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:46,730
That's the kind of thing that can ruin your whole career

471
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,840
Well...

472
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,110
What I almost laughed at is...

473
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,770
Kurosawa

474
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,220
Listen to me...

475
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,630
She kept saying the same thing as if she's chanting

476
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,780
"I can't take this anymore..."

477
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,590
"I'm 39 years old, I shouldn't be doing these things..."

478
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,840
"I can't, I can't, I'm 39 already..."

479
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,180
"Should I just give up..."

480
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,990
"I want to give up..."

481
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,610
She kept saying these things over and over again

482
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,500
She is really verging on a breakdown

483
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,800
So Documental is really pushing people this hard...

484
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,200
10 million is right in front of us

485
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,660
-Well, but...
-What should I do...

486
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,470
Yeah, you're right

487
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,850
Let's start

488
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,140
This would probably be the last round

489
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,970
Let's start

490
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,370
The winner must be one of us right?

491
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,790
One of us must be able to win the prize right?

492
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,130
If we can endure through this

493
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,590
Who should be the mood maker now though? Me?

494
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,930
I don't know too, but I'll try to do this

495
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,230
The one just now

496
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,760
Eh?

497
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,320
-Kurosawa is going to do that?
-Yes

498
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,730
-Eh? That anus thing?
-No way

499
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,610
-I shouldn't do this right? I'll be married someday
-Don't show it to us

500
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:05,080
It's better if you do it somewhere else and then show it to us

501
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,100
Don't show your anus in front of us

502
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,850
Okay, I'll do it over there

503
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,600
What you did here is going to stay forever

504
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,850
But I didn't score much points...

505
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,890
Nishizawa, do you know about my sweater?

506
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,510
What do you mean?

507
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,600
This must be shocking to you guys

508
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,750
It's super small

509
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,370
Eh, you've been wearing this?

510
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,880
-It's actually this small
-That's so small

511
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,340
-The fabric is incredible
-Yeah, it stretches a lot

512
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,760
-It's really small right?
-Can't believe you wore that

513
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,610
-It's so small
-This can't be true

514
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:41,350
-I've been wearing this
-That's so freaking small

515
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,960
It's becoming even smaller

516
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,500
Yes, it gets smaller and smaller

517
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,250
-Eh, as time passes, it becomes smaller?
-Yes

518
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,960
-It becomes like this in the end
-That's so small

519
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,870
Eh?

520
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,000
That's too small

521
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,540
You must be lying

522
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,430
Ouch, it hurts

523
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,150
How is it?

524
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:53,830
Well...

525
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,920
You did it?

526
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,420
I'm not sure about how to put it in

527
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,630
Eh?

528
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,300
Did you put it into your anus?

529
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,630
You put it into your anus?

530
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,420
Yes, my anus

531
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,810
-Are you sure it's your anus?
-Yes

532
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:05,600
-Of course, dude
-You mean she may put it in her vagina?

533
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,710
That's too thick for it

534
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,880
You know it's a delicate part of body right?

535
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,460
Don't say things like vagina to a girl

536
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,770
No, I didn't

537
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,800
You said it just now

538
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,730
No, I just said anus

539
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,070
"No, I just said anus"

540
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,490
He's mocking me

541
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,520
Eh?

542
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,960
-I didn't notice that
-Wait a second...

543
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,620
Finish!

544
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,400
Eh?

545
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:48,150
I was worried that you guys may think the end game buzzer is the sound of Kurosawa's fart and laugh out

546
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,710
This time

547
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,710
There is a winner

548
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,450
Eh, there is?

549
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,330
Thanks to the point system

550
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,990
The winner is

551
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,360
Kukky

552
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,980
-Oh yes, I did it!
-Congratulations

553
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,460
Oh my god, I did it

554
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:07,950
Is this real?

555
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:08,280
Eh?

556
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,880
-For real?
-For real

557
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,690
Kukky scored the most points

558
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,690
Eh? Really?

559
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,270
-Eh? You must be joking
-You're amazing

560
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,580
This is the first time in my whole life

561
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:25,650
10 million plus my 1 million, adding up to a 10 million prize for Kukky

562
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,820
Let's put it in the bag

563
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,890
Kukky is the winner!

564
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,700
-You're amazing
-I won for the first time ever

565
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,330
I'm going home with big money today

566
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:51,880
I can't believe this! This is amazing

567
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,590
You invested 3 million, and you get back 10 million

568
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,660
-You're right
-That's amazing

569
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,480
That was close

570
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,820
That's incredible, you're determined

571
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:08,870
This is really the first time for me to win the first place in something

572
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,990
First time in my life

573
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,120
We thought that you've been playing aggressive to win

574
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,690
Really?

575
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,920
-You deserve victory
-Ah, I'm so happy

576
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,530
Did you feel like you're going to win?

577
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,120
No, not at all

578
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,640
I noticed that my defense is getting weaker during in the second half of the game

579
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,580
I feel like I can't defense that well

580
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,000
And I tried to do something

581
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,910
I always kept this in mind

582
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:37,030
This is the third 1 million that I've paid

583
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,420
Ready

584
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,310
Go

585
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:48,020
I can't just keep on paying like a dumb ass

586
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,530
Ugh, boobs, boobs

587
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:58,110
I could have been working some part time jobs

588
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,130
In order to cover the cost

589
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,000
Where is the 10 million now?

590
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,420
I don't have it with me now

591
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,310
The staff took it back

592
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,560
I'm a bit worried

593
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,350
He said he need it for a moment, and took it away

594
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,780
Will it come back?

595
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,430
He seems to be a senior staff

596
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,910
Is that a scam?

597
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,700
I never saw that staff before

598
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,110
Not at all

599
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,170
I don't think he's from Amazon too

600
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,470
The player that deserves to win has won the game

601
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,470
He's a contributor

602
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:30,870
And I didn't want him to laugh too

603
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:35,090
So the contributor finally became the winner

604
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,920
Miyasaki-san did the erect performance art too

605
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,450
This is gonna get me erect

606
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,390
What's wrong with you?

607
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,660
Well, I don't know if I can talk about this

608
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,730
But...

609
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,400
He's turned on when there's many players

610
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,740
Different from the previous season

611
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,410
This time the main theme was peeing

612
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,940
I really think this is incredible

613
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,740
They all did this for Owarai

614
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,710
It's difficult for a normal person to pee under those situations

615
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,950
Even if you want to pee, it's difficult under those situations

616
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,800
Like when you're having an examination at the hospital

617
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,270
It's just won't come out when you need to

618
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:21,670
And yet, they're able to pee such an amount in front of everyone

619
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:26,170
Itoda is just insane

620
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,890
He's absolutely insane

621
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:32,340
That dude is wicked
