We got to see a 24-hours long show full of courage and love

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,900
The challenge of our 5 old dudes will begin!!

The challenge of our 5 old dudes will begin!!

00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:28,900
They'll have to eat in a relay-style

00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:25,000
They'll eat one dish at every Gyoza's King in Tokyo in a relay style

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,940
Their objective is to complete a meal in all the 32 shops!

Yamazaki Hosei

26
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,360
Hosei, that car censored your best part

27
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,060
I wonder why

28
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,420
That caught me off guard

The marathon starts from Minato Ward, the objective is to eat one dish from every shop

35
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,770
The quota is 6 shops each

36
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,580
Will they be able to complete it before the shops close?

37
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,180
You're the first one, are you ok?

38
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,180
Yeah, I'm good

39
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:12,820
Are you sure?

40
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,600
I'm not worried at all, quite the opposite...

41
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,480
When the staff told me I could eat as much as I want I got pumped

42
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,260
Oh, is that so?

43
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,260
I'm gonna eat so much today

44
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,020
You sound so confident about it

45
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,220
- You're gonna eat a lot?

46
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,220
Definitely

47
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,960
That's amazing

48
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,860
- He's going for it, folks

49
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,860
I'm ready

50
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:33,780
1st shop

51
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:33,780
In front of Shinbashi station, Minato Ward

52
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:33,780
Total of 32 shops

53
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,340
The old dudes marathon will start at our first shop, in front of Shinbashi's station

54
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,320
Here's our first dish

55
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,820
Here it is

56
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,280
And we're starting

57
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,280
This is it

58
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,960
This is what I'm talking about

59
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,500
Bon appetit

60
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,950
He's so focused

61
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,950
- And the marathon has now started

62
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,220
This is only our first shop

63
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,700
Delicious

64
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280
Glad to hear that

65
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,300
Are you enjoying it?

66
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,100
It's so good

67
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,100
I bet it is

68
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,240
He's keeping up a nice pace, isn't he?

69
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,240
- I agree

70
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,800
Yamazaki easily eats 3 gyoza in a row,
and he's ready to finish them

71
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,960
That's a pro move, soaking them beforehand

72
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,180
I just realized this

73
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,900
Yeah?

74
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,780
I see

75
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,820
I've become able to calculate the exact amount I can eat

76
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,940
Now that you're done?

77
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,140
What do you think of this as a starting point?

78
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,820
- It's a really good start

79
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,820
Don't you think he's done really well?

80
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,690
By the way, you've just eaten 5 of those,
how's your stomach?

81
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,020
I'm hungry to be honest

82
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,020
Oh my, I think...

83
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,400
Hosei can probably do 10 shops by himself

84
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,950
I definitely can, this is nothing

85
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,060
Well, it's a marathon after all

86
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,900
- And so, as we're speaking...

87
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,900
Yes

88
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,620
6

89
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,620
Meal finished

90
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,620
total amount of eaten gyoza:

91
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,680
He finished them all

92
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,680
- That's right

93
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,810
Thanks

94
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,540
You ready, Hosei?

95
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:49,580

96
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:49,580

99
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,540
Yamazaki had a perfect start

100
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,920
It's time for their second shop at Togoshi-ginza

101
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,400
He's usually not much of an eater

102
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,420
But nevertheless

103
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,580
He completed his second meal in a blink of an eye

104
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,300
And now Hosei...

105
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,660
He completed his second meal

106
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:08,020
12

107
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:08,020
Meal finished

108
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:08,020
total amount of eaten gyoza:

109
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,660
- Nice done

110
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,800
Congratulations

111
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,800
Alright

112
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,920
I wanna eat

113
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,020
I wanna eat some more gyoza, let's go

114
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,620
Meguro

115
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,620
Minato

116
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,620
Next up, Hosei, is the shop on Kamata's east exit

117
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,620

118
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,620

to Kamata east exit

125
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,860
You're killing it

126
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,560
I have so much space left, I wanna eat more

127
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,060
Right now?

128
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,060
Yeah

129
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,520
It's gonna take us some time to move to our next location

130
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,260
It's gonna take us some time to move to our next location

131
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,980
Is this time going to affect Yamazaki's determination?!

132
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:32,860
(1 hour and 2 min. since start)

133
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:32,860

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:32,860

shop no. 3

136
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,940
They've finally arrived to the third shop in Kamata

137
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,860
But how is Yamazaki's stomach going to be?

138
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,600
Let's go

139
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,500
Let's do this

140
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,620
Come on

141
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,160
Let's get in, Hosei

142
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,160
Ok

143
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,300
Let's just do this

144
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,980
You said you were still hungry on our second shop...

145
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,840
- That's right

146
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,840
I bet you're gonna destroy these

147
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,460
Huh?

148
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,800
The pace has suddenly slowed down

149
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,800
- How are you doing?

150
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,520
Are you ok?

151
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,720
It looks like...

152
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,980
You've lost your motivation, what happened?

153
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,880
Why--

154
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,140
Why do you suddenly look dead inside?

155
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,500
To be honest, I'm starting to feel really full right now

156
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,500
Yes?

157
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,220
To be honest, I'm starting to feel really full right now

158
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,620
Maybe it's because it took so long
to get there, but he's feeling full

159
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,260
Still, his fast pace has crumbled down

160
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,480
I know you've lost your pace, but give your best here

161
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,900
Just few more

162
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,440
And now

163
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,740
18

164
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,740

166
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,220

173
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:30,580
You completely changed during the time span
between the 2nd and 3rd shop

174
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:33,580
Travel distance: 8,1km

to Ookayama

178
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,740
Can you see how hard this is pressing on my belly?

179
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,820
- Are those leggings?

180
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,820
Oh, I can see it

181
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,540
Yeah, they're so tight now

182
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,540
It became adherent?

183
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,540
I think

184
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,780
They're gonna affect me a lot

185
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,250
I definitely underestimated this

186
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,200
Is that so?

187
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,200
Yeah

188
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,580
It was so sudden, wasn't it?

189
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,540
(1 hour and 26 min. since start)

190
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,540
32 total shops:

191
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,540
Ookayama shop (Ota Ward)

192
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,540
shop no. 4

193
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,360
Yamazaki is so full he's not feeling at ease anymore

194
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,540
But it's still time for their fourth shop

195
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,960
As expected, his expression can't hide his distress

196
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,180
His chopsticks barely move

197
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,280
And there's something glittering on the tip of his nose

198
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,580
Say, Hosei...

199
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,480
This isn't easy

200
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,480
- I can tell you're in danger...

201
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,820
'Cause there's sweat on your nose's tip

202
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,420
It's pretty bad

203
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,500
Oi

204
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,500
Yes?

205
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,900
Remember I told you I got hospitalized 2 years ago?

206
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,500
Remember I told you I got hospitalized 2 years ago?

207
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,500
I do

208
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,580
You had stomach problems, am I right?

209
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,420
Yes, my large intestine

210
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,420
Large intestine, right

211
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,500
From that time on...

212
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,730
I've been taking so much medicine

213
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,720
Even now?

214
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,980
But don't broadcast this, alright?

215
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,320
It's been how long? 2 years?

216
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,900
Don't broadcast this intestine talk, ok?

217
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,600
If you eat this one here...

218
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,650
- You have like... 10 left

219
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,880
You just have to do two more shops

220
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,040
You have to do 12 more

221
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,690
- Only 12 left, yes

222
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,690
Only 12, Hosei

223
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,500
He did it!

224
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:48,940
24

225
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:48,940
Meal finished

226
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:48,940
total amount of eaten gyoza:

227
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
- Meal finished

228
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
All done!

229
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,340
Oh shit

230
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,220
Would you like some water?

231
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,220
No, I'm fine

232
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,690
You sure?

233
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,820
I'm...

234
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,240
Look here

235
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,780
Looks like you're about to burst

236
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,780
I can't keep it in

237
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,900
Travel distance: 3,8km

238
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,900
Travel time: 7 min.

239
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,900
from Ookayama

240
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,900
to Gakugei University

241
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,960
I think he's pregnant

242
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,580
'Morning

243
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:17,220
2nd runner

244
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:17,220

Tanaka

246
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:17,220
arrives to Sangenjaya's shop

247
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,600
At the same time, our next runner Tanaka arrives at Sangenjaya

248
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,640
How are you feeling?

249
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,520
My stomach?

250
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,080
I'm ready

251
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,780
Are you?

252
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,980
I'm feeling really good today

253
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,920
And...

254
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,920
You had breakfast?

255
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,400
I didn't, of course I came here empty

256
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,860
And my condition is just perfect!

257
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,860
Glad to hear that

258
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,860
(1 hour and 55 min. since start)

259
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,860
32 total shops:

260
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,860
Gakugei University's shop (Meguro Ward)

261
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,860
shop no.5

262
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,280
Let's go, Hosei

263
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,000
Yamazaki arrives at the fifth shop at Gakugei University

264
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,660
He tries his best to munch some more gyoza

265
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,780
But then he thinks about something...

266
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,780
Are you feeling it?

267
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,780
It's getting harsh, isn't it?

268
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,780
- I can tell

269
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,480
If you overcome this...

270
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,780
Pass me the phone, please

271
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,480
He suddenly makes a call

272
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,300
And he's calling...

273
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,300
He's really full

274
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,700
He's about to explode

275
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,040
You can see the curve from this side

276
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,900
Hello?

277
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,900
Yes, hello?

278
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,500
Tanaka?

279
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,520
It's me

280
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,660
'Morning, listen...

281
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,900
I wanted to ask you...

282
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:13,260

Yes?

288
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,160
If you could come to Komazawa University

289
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,100
Mh?

290
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,450
It's where I'm going now

291
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,260
Is he trying to blame the staff for this?

292
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,260
- Definitely

293
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,780
No way, wait--- didn't we agree to do 6 shops each?

294
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,700
Just come

295
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:23,300

Yamazaki Hosei

300
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,650
I'll explain everything once you're there

301
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,300
Once I'm there?

302
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,300
Yeah, sorry about this

303
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,860
Komazawa University?

304
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,060
Just go there

305
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,280
I can't talk to you unless we meet

306
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,220
Call

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,220
Yamazaki Hosei

311
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,760
Alright, I got it

312
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,760
Thanks

313
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,020
He couldn't eat, right? He's giving up

314
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,400
And he's trying to blame the staff for it

315
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,860
That sucks

316
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,860
It sucks so much

317
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,140
30

318
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,140

- And he's done!

321
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,880
Alright, he did it

322
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,680
Nice

323
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,140
Let's move on

324
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,450
It took some time, but Yamazaki somehow cleared 5 shops

325
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,140
But the limits of this old dude's weak
stomach are turning sweat into tears

326
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,840
His steps towards the next shop are as heavy as lead

327
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,080
His stomach is swelling like a balloon

328
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,430
Can he rely on his friends to help him?

329
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,560
Here we are

330
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,200
Yamazaki finally arrives at the sixth shop

331
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:23,580

shop no.6

335
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,580
He enters the shop at Komazawa University to wait for Tanaka

336
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,340
- 'Morning

337
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,340
Welcome

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,020
Welcome

339
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,740
He's here already

340
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,740
- Here we are

341
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,040

Yeah

345
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,740
Just so you know

346
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,240
Yes?

347
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,600
I'm still pressing the 10 mins. button

348
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,600
What?

349
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,620
So please keep it short

350
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,640
What? Really?

351
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,960
Welcome!

352
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:39,960
- Yes

353
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,740
Just a quick chat, ok?

354
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,240
Please, eat some more

355
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,420
I really can't Tanaka, I'm dead serious

356
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,800
Please, I beg you

357
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,540
I can't, I can't, I'm done for

358
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,400
But I promise, Tanaka, next time

359
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,420
I'll do it for you next time

360
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,420
- He's passing the baton

361
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,500
I promise

362
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,700
You're not doing it

363
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,700
I'll do it

364
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,740
I swear

365
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,620
Haven't you been lying like this for your whole life?

366
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,140
Haven't you been lying like this for your whole life?

367
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,140
That's not true

368
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,180
Seriously, Tanaka

369
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,220
I can see through your act

370
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,220
You get it, right? Seriously

371
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,180
I'm dead serious here

372
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,290
I've been watching how you live

373
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,200
I swear I'll help you next time

374
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,380
I'll take my part

375
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,880
Are we doing this?

376
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,880
Fine, let's do this

377
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,280
From now on

378
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,240
I'm taking this sash

379
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,390
And continuing this marathon

380
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,490
Let's go then, start!

381
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,840
Our second runner receives the sash

382
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,440
And this is Tanaka's first shop

383
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,820
So, how is it?

384
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,900
They're really delicious

385
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,900
Are they?

386
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,980
They're really good

387
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,220
Not to ruin anything, but we already saw that face on Hosei

388
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,660
So nostalgic

389
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,660
- I agree

390
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,340
But I swear, these are really good

391
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:38,920
Well, yes

392
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,140
Your face is gonna become like this

393
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,820
Look at him, look at his face

394
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,460
Really? Is that true?

395
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,820
- Yes

396
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,460
- Yeah

397
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,930
Good luck

398
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,560
Such a weak support

399
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,340
- Barely heard him

400
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,220
I think I can do this

401
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,900
You think so?

402
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,900
Mh-mh

403
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,360
Only one left

404
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,400
- Only one

405
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,400
Yes

406
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,420
That was quick

407
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,540
Only one

408
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,940
I'm gonna eat it

409
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,640
He's done

410
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:09,740
36

411
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:09,740
Meal finished

412
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:09,740
total amount of eaten gyoza:

413
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,480
I can do this, it's fine

414
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,260
Can you?

415
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,800
If I keep this pace

416
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,080
I thought I would have started later

417
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,580
But I think I did my part

418
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,700
Are you excited?

419
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,700
Yeah, I am

420
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,020
To go to other shops?

421
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,020
I am, really

422
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,020
I'm serious

423
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,020
Why are --

424
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,900
Why are you sympathizing with him?

425
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,940
I can do this

426
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:27,140
Travel distance: 2,0km

427
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:27,140
Travel time: 8min.

428
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:27,140
from Komazawa University

429
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:27,140
to Sangenjaya

430
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,820
Are you sure?

431
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,200
I'm pumped

432
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,240
We're counting on you here

433
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,240
I'm gonna do this

434
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,240
We can tell by your voice you're ready

435
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,240
I know, right?

436
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,300
I really think I can do this

437
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,660
But the fact Hamada is right after me...

438
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,460
It's pretty terrifying, you know

439
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,460
Yeah, I know

440
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,480
And you can't see him

441
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,480
Yeah, I mean

442
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,820
Oh boy

443
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,820
I'm gonna do my best here

444
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,940
(2 hours 42min since start)

445
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,940
32 total shops:

446
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,940
Sangenjaya's shop (Setagaya Ward)

447
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,940
shop no. 7

448
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,940
As Tanaka feels Hamada's pressure,
he heads to the shop he started from

449
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,200
That was quick!

450
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,100
Let's go!

451
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,320
Ready and... start!

452
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,380
Let's go

453
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,020
Gotta hurry up, there's not much time left

454
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,940
How is it here?

455
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,530
It's just as delicious

456
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,530
It's just as delicious

457
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,700
Tanaka quickly eats one gyoza after another

458
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,220
He's looking promising

459
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,350
That's a nice pace

460
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,840
It took me an instant

461
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,260
It really took you an instant, yes

462
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,260
- Really quick

463
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,060
What should we do? Can I get the check?

464
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,780
I think it's ok

465
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,320
Sure, go get it

466
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,160
While he's eating

467
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,160
- Are you sure?

468
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,020
Yeah, I'm comin' in a flash

469
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,020
Alright then

470
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,980
Really? Alright, I'm gonna pay then

471
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,380
Yeah

472
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,020
Don't mind if you do

473
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,020
I'm going

474
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,500
Here I go

475
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,500
Counting on you

476
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,100

Yes

478
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,940
He did it

479
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,940
Thanks for the meal

480
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:29,260

481
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:29,260
Meal finished

total amount of eaten gyoza:

483
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,400
What do you think?

484
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,060
Very good  - So quick!

485
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,860
Let's go

486
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,860

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,860
Tanaka rushes towards the next shop!

488
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,260
That was fast, huh?

489
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah, last one was really quick

490
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,520
I knew it

491
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,900
From when we arrived and got back to the car now...

492
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,420
4 minutes... or 5, that's how long it took

493
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,460
4 minutes... or 5, that's how long it took

494
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,380
The fastest yet

495
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,340
The fastest?

496
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,340
Yes, the fastest

497
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,300
The fastest today?

498
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,260
It's today's record

499
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,260
Neat, I did it

500
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,180
At least for now no one else has made it this fast

501
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,180
- Alright, I'm glad

502
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,440
You're #1 in the world

503
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,700
- World record

504
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,700
I've been aiming at it

505
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,260

Tanaka quickly enters Kyodo's shop

512
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,140
His fast-paced technique shines again

513
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,310
The gyoza disappear in his mouth one after another

514
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,100

And now it's time for their 9th shop at Shimokitazawa

It's perfectly cooked

532
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,840
Must be nice

533
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,900
He's still enjoying their taste

534

So good

535
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
He's a professional

536
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,420
He's taking one shop after another

537
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,900
And he's not wasting time around

538
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,940

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,860
- Shibuya's shop

564
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,140
Shibuya, huh

565
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,140
How are you feeling?

566
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,300
Are your leggings still ok?

567
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,740
Hosei told us that

568
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,460
Halfway through it, they got tight

569
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,180
Nothing, no problem at all

570
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,020
Nothing, no problem at all

571
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,320
He told us that if they feel tight

572
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,760
- I heard that

573
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,760
Then you can't eat anymore

574
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,980
They're not tight at all

575
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,960
Are you really ok?

576
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,030
On the opposite, I think I'm raising the speed

577
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,020
Nice

578
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,020
Yeah

579
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:08,260
But this car ride is going to bring
a sudden change inside Tanaka

580
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,180
Alright, Tanaka

581
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,720
Yes?

582
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,140
We're finally at our 10th shop

583
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,300
Oh, number 10

584
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,300
Yes

585
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,220
We're at Shibuya's Hachiko exit

586
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:22,140
(4 hours 7min since start)

587
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:22,140
32 total shops:

588
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:22,140
Shibuya Hachiko Exit's shop (Shibuya Ward)

589
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:22,140
shop no.10

590
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,640
Finally they arrive at shop no.10

591
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,320
It's Shibuya Hachiko's exit shop

592
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,780
Oof...

593
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,120
"Oof"?

594
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,100
Here they come

595
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,500
The fifth dish is placed before a sighing Tanaka

596
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,240
Thanks

597
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,890
He wanted to easily clear this shop too, but...

598
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,380
Ok, tenth shop

599
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,060
At Shibuya Hachiko, let's go

600
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,980
Start!

601
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,980
Alright!

602
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,980
Foohhh...

603
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,120
You've been breathing a lot

604
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,470
- Right

605
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,700
He just went "foohh" now

606
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,700
- Yes

607
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,530
I'm fine, I'm completely fine

608
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,370
How is it?

609
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,370
- So?

610
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,280
Mh, it's good

611
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,500
Is it? Glad to hear that

612
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,460
How's your stomach?

613
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,810
I'm completely---

614
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,780
I'm full

615
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,780
Full?! Excuse me?!

616
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,420
Can you repeat it?

617
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,420
- Sorry

618
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,850
I'm feeling full

619
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,580
Are you for real?!

620
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,740
I can do it

621
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,060
I'm starting now

622
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,320
That was bound to happen

623
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,300
- Well, yes

624
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,300
Of course you'd get full

625
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,800
Alright, I'm ready to face it

626
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,540
Let's move on then

627
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,540
I'm not drawing back

628
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,040
Well said

629
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,740
I'm dead serious

630
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,740
Yes

631
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,920
From now on it's all about willpower

632
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,550
True...

633
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,550
I know

634
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,540
Tanaka's stomach is already full of gyoza

635
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,320
But he's getting his willpower back

636
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,840
You shouldn't drink that much

637
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,440
- You're gonna swell, man

638
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,500
- You'll explode

639
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,500
Don't drink that much

640
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,340
Alright

641
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,000
If you give your best here

642
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,500
It'll be easier for the runner after you

643
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,500
- That's right

644
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,700
My leggings are getting really tight...

645
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,920
My leggings are getting really tight...

646
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,460
I swear

647
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,300
Wha-

648
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,240
I told you so

649
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,660
I swear, I wonder why

650
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,490
Are they tight?

651
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,660
They feel really tight

652
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,460
It's incredible, they're so tight

653
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,320
Really, it feels like...

654
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,590
They just shrunk---

655
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,660
You spat something out

656
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,130
- Something fell down

657
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,130
It feels like they're down two sizes

658
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,580
Sorry

659
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,480
I'm going

660
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,000
Alright, let's finish this

661
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,000
Here I go

662
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,500
And it's in

663
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,860
Let's see how it's going to affect him...

664
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,860
Last one!

665
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,860
- One last gyoza

666
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,440
Hang in there, Tanaka

667
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,440
I'm really about to

668
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,400
To...?

669
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,490
To reach my limit, really

670
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,490
Hang in there

671
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,560
And he's done

672
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:43,020
60

673
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:43,020
Meal finished

674
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:43,020
total amount of eaten gyoza:

675
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,900
Let's pay up and move

676
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,900
Ok

677
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,250
Oh boy, I can feel it now

678
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,700
Back there in Shibuya...

679
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,550
I ate the first gyoza and thought "oh crap"

680
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:56,460
13th shop

681
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:56,460
Hamada

682
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:56,460
Third runner

683
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:56,460
arrives at Nakano's shop

684
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,480
At the same time

685
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,210
Hamada, our next runner

686
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,460
Doesn't look like anyone's coming, huh...

687
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,280
Here we are

688
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:02,420
(4 hours and 55 min since start)

689
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:02,420
32 total shops:

690
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:02,420
Shin Okubo's shop (Shinjuku Ward)

691
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:02,420
shop no.11

692
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,230
And Tanaka has arrived to the 11th shop at Shin Okubo

693
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,420
Come on, let's go

694
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,160
In order to pass his sash to Hamada...

695
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,950
Tanaka keeps on eating gyoza with a dreadful look

696
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,800
Is he getting close to his limits?

697
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,460
I think this is probably the best cup of water I've ever had

698
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,100
I think this is probably the best cup of water I've ever had

699
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,580
Like, in your whole life?

700
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,580
In all my life, yeah

701
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,930
If you eat this one...

702
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,720
You're done

703
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,980
Come on

704
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,480
Alright

705
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,260
66

706
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,260
Meal finished

707
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,260
total amount of eaten gyoza:

708
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,060
- Excellent

709
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,060
Meal finished

710
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,260
You cleared Shin Okubo's shop

711
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,260
- You did it!

712
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,460
Can you wait a sec?

713
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,460
Let's go

714
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,580
Tanaka?

715
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,740
Is Hamada...

716
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,620
Is Hamada already inside that shop?

717
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,620
He is

718
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,500
Hamada is currently inside Nakano's shop

719
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,400
And now, Tanaka...

720
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,400
Wait a second...

721
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,600
What's wrong?

722
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,180
I can't do this

723
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,680
I hate this phone call...

724
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,520
Tanaka is finally at his limit and calls Hamada

725
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:10,380
Call

726
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:10,380
Hamada Masatoshi

727
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:10,380
Nakano

728
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:10,380
Shin Okubo

729
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:10,380
Tanaka Naoki

730
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,860
What do you want?

731
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,210
"What do you want?" already...

732
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,210
Oi

733
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,820
He's already pissed off...

734
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,820
Hello?

735
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,860
Don't keep him waiting

736
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,780
He's angry

737
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,780
Hello?

738
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,120
Answer

739
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,380
Hello?

740
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,740
What do you want?

741
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,740
He's pissed!

742
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,620
Weren't you expecting it?

743
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,620
He's furious

744
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,100
He's so angry he's gonna kill me

745
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,620
Of course he is

746
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,620
Hamada is seriously pissed off

747
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,700
You gotta do it

748
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,700
The hell is wrong with you?

749
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,760
Hello?

750
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,140
Sorry for this, it's Tanaka

751
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,220
Sorry but, Hamada...

752
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,260
Well...

753
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,700
I think I've reached my limit

754
00:17:28,260 --> 00:18:12,740

Oh?

And I'm... I'm currently at Shin Okubo's shop

761
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,820
Shin Okubo, ok

762
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,820
So...

763
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,360
You're currently at Nakano's shop, am I right?

764
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,320
Yeah

765
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Can we meet at shop no.12 at Takadanobaba?

766
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,400
Takadanobaba you say?

767
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,400
Right now I'm--- yes, that's it

768
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,330
I'm at my limit, I can't fit one more gyoza in my mouth

769
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,120
Not a single one

770
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,750
I just can't get 'em inside me

771
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,200
What are you talking about?

772
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,200
Listen to me

773
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,040
I beg you, I'm really sorry about this

774
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,440
But please--- leave Nakano's shop

775
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,880
And move to the previous one

776
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,500
It's at Takadanobaba, can you go there?

777
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,740
No way dude

778
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,400
I'm really sorry about this

779
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,800
But please--- Takadanobaba's shop---

780
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,100
Take a ride to Takadanobaba pleeease

781
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,740
DEAL WITH IT YOURSELF!!

782
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,240
He got so mad I didn't know what to say

783
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,700
For now let's--- let's just head to Takadanobaba

784
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,720
Let's go then

785
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,480
Then I'll think again

786
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,180
That's the best choice

787
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,780
Right, I'll think about it again in there

788
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,780
Yes

789
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,830
This is tough, huh

790
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,580
Can I say something?

791
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,580
Please

792
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,220
I'm suffering so much

793
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm dying

794
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,780
It's really unbearable

795
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,840
The hell is this? It came so suddenly

796
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,180
Was it sudden?

797
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,180
Yeah...

798
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,800
Gyoza really fill you up for good, huh?

799
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,100
They do, actually

800
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,100
- Right...

801
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:03,140
(5 hours 32min since start)

802
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:03,140

shop no.12

805
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,360
Fearsome Hamada, fearsome gyoza

806
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,140
Tanaka arrives at Takadanobaba's shop

807
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,860
He forcibly eats one gyoza against
his screaming stomach's will

808
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,140
Can I ask for a take-out?

809
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,860
Sure, I'll get you a box

810
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,860
Sorry

811
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,460
I can't anymore...

812
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,460
What are you gonna do with it?

813
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,800
Here's a box for you

814
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,520
Can I?

815
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,680
Thank you

816
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,240
Sorry, it's a take-out

817
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,580
But what are you gonna do with it?

818
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,580
I swear, I can't...

819
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,120
A take-out is all I can do

820
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,120
Are they for Hamada?

821
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,660
You gonna give 'em to him?

822
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,660
M-mh...

823
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm really sorry

824
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,030
Tanaka unexpectedly chooses a take-out and
heads to Nakano's shop where Hamada is waiting

825
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:43,820
(6 hours 2min since start)

826
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:43,820

shop no.13

829
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,020
An exhausted Tanaka heads to the 13th shop, Nakano

830
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,820
To deliver his gyoza to Hamada

831
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,180
Welcome!

832
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,400
'Morning

833
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,820
You're so goddamn late, man

834
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,820
Good morning

835
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,960
I'm sorry, hear me out

836
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,960
Sorry for being late

837
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,620
Hamada Masatoshi

838
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,620
Third runner

839
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,620
I'm leaving now, you take care of it

840
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,660
Come on, touch

841
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,140
I'm going home

842
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,860
W-w--wait, wait a second

843
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,220
Hear me out

844
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,220
What?

845
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,640
Please listen to me

846
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,640
What was that?

847
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,340
I have no room left for a single gyoza anymore

848
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,660
You're the third runner, aren't you?

849
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,080
That's not it, what is this?

850
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,260
I got these from Takadanobaba's shop

851
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:21,220
Gyoza take-out from Takadanobaba's shop

852
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,740
Did you... is that a take-out?

853
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,460
I'm sorry about that

854
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,560
He's the worst

855
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,540
He ate one of them

856
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,800
But I did my part, I ate them all

857
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,180
So it's Yamazaki's fault?

858
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,700
That's right

859
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,180
In other words, this is Yamazaki's part

860
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,840
I want you to understand this

861
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,540
Well, if it's Yamazaki's part let's have him eat it at the end

862
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,660
I see

863
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,660
Makes sense

864
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,160
I see, it's his part... let's save this for last

865
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,580
I know, right?

866
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,580
Let's do this

867
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,600
Here's your sash

868
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,360
What the hell...

869
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,360
I'm giving it to you

870
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,760
It finally happened

871
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,940
He's finally passing it

872
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,730
I have a bad feeling already

873
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,680
Sorry

874
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,580
It's  time for our third runner

875
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,580
It's yours

876
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,580
How do I put this on?

877
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,300
Here

878
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,580
The sash has been passed

879
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,920
Here I am

880
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,860
We're counting on you

881
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,860
Alright

882
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,160
Can I eat?

883
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,160
Sure

884
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,980
We're starting

885
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,980
Counting on you!

886
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,660
Deli~cious!

887
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,500
King's gyoza are so good!

888
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,260
And it's a downhill from now on

889
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:11,340
If you think your stomach can do it, why don't you
do a bit more than the scheduled 6 shops?

890
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,340
What?

891
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,540
Can I?

892
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,540
Of course you can

893
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,540
Of course

894
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,620
Are you kidding me?

895
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,620
It could really help the second half

896
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:24,260
73

897
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:24,260
Meal finished

898
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:24,260
total amount of eaten gyoza:

899
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,860
Really good

900
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,350
He's done

901
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,260
Nakano's shop has been done

902
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,080
If you think you can eat these as well, please do it

903
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,120
Ok

904
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,620
Hamada completes his first meal too easily

905
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,940
He's now wearing the sash of hope

906
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,860
I think it was around the 4th shop

907
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,860
Maybe the 5th, that's when it hit me

908
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:46,980
Also, I really hope it's clear enough to Hamada
that those leftovers are actually Yamazaki's

909
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:52,900
(6 hours 35min since start)

910
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:52,900

A joyful Hamada enters the 14th shop at Fujimidai's station

914
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,220
Let's go

915
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,180
So good!

916
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,200
I can eat hundreds

917
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,200
Good

918
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,160
Despite his old-dude poor appetite,
he easily clears another meal

919
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:07,580
79

920
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:07,580

922
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,200
Alright, he's done here

923
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,760
They're really good

924
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,580
Fujimidai's station shop is done

925
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,820
They're delicious!

926
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,370
He's so lively!

927
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,760
That was really quick just now

928
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,110
No big deal

929
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,140
Still feeling hungry?

930
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,700
Yep

931
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,540
Can you do this?

932
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,380
I can

933
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,640
So much confidence, wow

934
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,640
I'm doing this

935
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,580
I'm feeling great

936
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,580

00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,090
A still hungry Hamada enters shop no.15 at Nishidai's station

942
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,260
This is Hamada's third shop

943
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,260
Yes

944
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,410
Let's do this: start!

945
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,220
Mh, very good

946
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,790
He's so fast

947
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,140
Even after his third dish, Hamada is still fine

948
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:47,550
He might be an old dude, but his pace is fast
and gyoza are disappearing one after another

949
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,340
He's really the man you can trust in the crucial moment

950
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,220
He's done after less than 3 minutes

951
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,270
Were the other two as fast with the first three dishes?

952
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,970
Yeah, they were all pretty quick at the beginning

953
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,520
Curse of the 4th dish?

954
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,520
That's right

955
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,340
I can do it

956
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,240
I can keep up all the way to shop no.22

957
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,060
Until shop no.22 at Suidobashi? That's Endo's territory

958
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:14,820
85

959
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:14,820
Meal finished

960
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:14,820
total amount of eaten gyoza:

961
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,820
How much do you think you can eat? It's 10 dishes, you know

962
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,820
currently

963
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,820
objective

964
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,460
How many gyoza?

965
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,140
60 gyoza

966
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,660
Hamada's stomach finally reached its limit...

967
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:46,500
Next week...

968
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,180
I smell trouble

969
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,980
Endo will help his senpai in a pinch and raise the pace

970
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:34,820
And then, the sash arrives to Matsumoto

971
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,820
Why is this happening? You should have eaten more

972
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,130
I'm thinking about going home...

973
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,260
You want me to #%@&!§ now?

974
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,300
No no no no, that's not it

975
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,500
What will they see at the goal !?

976
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,480
Whaaat?!

977
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,500
And now...

978
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,340
It's time to announce the release of Matsumoto's movie!

979
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,340
Matsumoto's movie: about to be released!

980
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,180
Director

981
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,180

982
00:23:49,340 --> 00:24:04,380

986
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,180
I wanna go home...

987
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,900
