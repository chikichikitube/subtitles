1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,960
So everybody

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:07,490
*Jiji-nuki is a tweaked version of Baba-nuki (Old maid)

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:07,490
Today, we will be playing Jiji-nuki again, which was highly praised

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,850
-Endo should remember this game right
-Yeah, Endo lost twice in a row last time

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,980
To be honest, I hate this game

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,370
Endo, you're having the same hair color as Megumi

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,390
You mean Megumi-san from Hiruobi!...

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,260
-Well yeah...
-Yeah it's the same as Megumi-san

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,180
You better turn around and face the camera to say it again

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,520
For having the same hair color as Megumi? Is it necessary?

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,160
Well, my hair color is the same as Megumi-san

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,720
No way, not at all

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,740
The highly praised Gaki Jiji-nuki

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:56,740
Each card has a different question on it

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,750
The rule is the same as Old maid,
you win if you have no more cards left

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,750
But if you lose, you'll need to perform
based on the instructions of the last card

17
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,010
So Tanaka will be hosting the game

18
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,080
Bunny-chan come on!!

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,360
Here comes the Bunny-chan

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,450
Is it the same girl as last time?

21
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,060
Yes

22
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,370
I see, so it's the same

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,870
Stop staring at her

24
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,570
Please stop it

25
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,680
*Jiji-nuki literally means "Remove the old man"

26
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,680
This is not how you play Jiji-nuki

27
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,210
Let's start by deciding the dealer

28
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,100
I don't remember this at all

29
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,760
So Endo with be the dealer to start the game

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,630
At this stage, please draw a card, which will be the joker

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,620
Hamada-san can you pick a card for us?

32
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,110
Then put it over here without looking at it

33
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,000
Get off dude!!

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,820
This is making me nervous, I really hate this game...

35
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,090
Endo please show it to the camera only

36
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,180
Okay, we won't look at it

37
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,090
You can't look at it too, Endo

38
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,850
-I won't remember it anyway
-Of course you will

39
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,560
-Let's start
-Can I distribute the cards?

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,270
Yes please

41
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,620
What are you laughing at?

42
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,040
Wait, what happened to you?

43
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,400
You're in a cranky mood today

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,900
-You're right
-What happened?

45
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,220
-Let's try to be kind here
-You're right

46
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,530
The first theme is

47
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,110
Vulgar imitation

48
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,340
No, no, no way

49
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,650
Some of the characters are not vulgar at all

50
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,210
Mine are all vulgar though...

51
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,810
-Anyone have any pairs?
-Yes, here it is

52
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,140
Inakawa Junji

53
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,140
Well, glad that this character is discarded

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,330
-No one else?
-Nope

55
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,230
Who should go first? Speak dude!!

56
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,200
-Why are people being so unfriendly today?
-No that's your fault

57
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,970
-There was an awkward silence
-Yeah it's kind of Tanaka's fault

58
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,010
Tell us who is the first player to start dude

59
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,530
Hey!!

60
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,450
Ouch, ouch, ouch!!!

61
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,550
Hurry up, you idiot

62
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:29,130
So please draw a card from my hand

63
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,890
Who is it?

64
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,100
Well, this is a difficult character to imitate too

65
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,410
Nagashima Shigeo

66
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,060
This is stressing me out

67
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,060
Let me see, no pairs

68
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,820
I wonder which character is the joker

69
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,580
Yeah

70
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,510
Not even close

71
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,030
I have tons of cards

72
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,790
I'm the same too

73
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,800
Oh, I see

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,220
They are paired up?

75
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,770
So it's Kuro-chan

76
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,430
Tanaka looks like he's about to cry

77
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,830
Anyway, these are paired up

78
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,480
Thank you very much

79
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,300
The game starts off with
the cards getting paired one after another

80
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,030
These are paired up too

81
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:31,420
Glad that this character is discarded,
it's a difficult character to imitate right?

82
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,650
Sanshiro Komiya

83
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,650
This is a difficult one right?

84
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,530
Thank you very much

85
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,440
-Here it is
-This is relieving

86
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:50,000
Hanzawa Naoki

87
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,610
I didn't know he's here

88
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,880
This is such a high-calorie character

89
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,000
It's like two Tuna-Mayo Onigiri

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,140
Endo why don't you just do the imitation
as the camera goes "syuuu" and fades out

91
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,250
-Just leave it to the editor
-Edit it as if I lost the game?

92
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,520
Well it's possible but...

93
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,220
Syuuu

94
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,700
No way, no way, let's play this properly

95
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:09,860
However, here starts the nightmare of infinite loop

96
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,690
-Tanaka is left with one card for a long time
-Yes I am

97
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,500
It's difficult to pair up that last card right

98
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,320
Which one do you suggest?

99
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,570
Suggest?

100
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,370
I suggest the middle one

101
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,580
The middle one?

102
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,950
No way!!!

103
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,250
What's wrong with this guy?

104
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,860
(Matsumoto could have paired up if he took Housei's advice)

105
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,430
What should I do with this?

106
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,390
It's back again

107
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,520
Kitano Takeshi

108
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,680
This card is going round and round

109
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,420
Some cards never move, and some goes round and round

110
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,210
If it's back again, this means that...

111
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,280
...it's back again

112
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,170
Rola

113
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,170
It's been quite a while though

114
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,260
Please be something I have

115
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,960
It's back

116
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:04,910
This is the same card "Kitano Takeshi" but from Takana

117
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,890
It's back again

118
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,910
What's going on with that card

119
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,430
So no one was able to pair it up

120
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,290
Let's see if it's coming back...

121
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,780
It's back

122
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,800
We're talking about this card right?

123
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,460
This card is always coming back

124
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,980
Yeah it's always coming back

125
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,870
Come on, who is holding the other one

126
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,350
It's back again

127
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,130
What's happening?

128
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,490
This card is always coming

129
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,780
Wait a second? This means that...

130
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,550
Maybe the cards just shifted by chance

131
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,220
No, no, no way

132
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,460
The card was passed round and it's still here!
Something is strange about this right?

133
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,280
Probably someone is holding on to it

134
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,990
Maybe the cards just shifted at a different timing

135
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,670
Okay, yeah I see

136
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,430
Thank you Matsumoto-san

137
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,410
-I thought this must be the joker
-Me too!

138
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,200
I thought it must be Takeshi-san

139
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,370
Yeah it came back many times, but...

140
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,590
How dare you say it came
(same pronunciation as Kitano)

141
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,010
You should never say that

142
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,080
Yeah, it should be Kitano-san

143
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,010
He said it's "Kitano"

144
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,730
This scene itself is enough for today's show right

145
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,090
It's "Kitano"?

146
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,480
You're annoying man

147
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,800
Anyway, Hamada wins

148
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,380
It's surprising to know he's not the joker

149
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,250
I already started to do simulations

150
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,650
I thought it must be him

151
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,590
However, the infinite loop never ends

152
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,490
Maybe Tanaka is going to finish

153
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,040
It's not finishing yet

154
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,670
It's not finishing yet

155
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,370
Sadly, it's not finishing yet

156
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,930
Then it's probably Endo

157
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,230
Let me pair up this last card

158
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,360
Please let me win!

159
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,240
It's not finishing yet

160
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,770
Please!

161
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,320
Give me a second

162
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,250
Which card is the joker, seriously

163
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,940
-This one
-We all know the remaining cards right?

164
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,270
Yeah I've been doing simulations too

165
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,700
Maybe I'll pick this one

166
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,110
I hate this nervous atmosphere, please let me finish this

167
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,720
It's back again

168
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,580
The card IKKO has turned full circle back to Matsumoto

169
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,140
Who is that?

170
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,410
I thought this person was dead already?

171
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,760
No he's not

172
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:44,160
It's you again?

173
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,540
This always comes back

174
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,240
Maybe it shifted by chance...

175
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,780
This is taking forever

176
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,220
And after 20 minutes

177
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,310
The person that wins after Hamada is...

178
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,930
Here it comes, here it comes!

179
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,130
Antonio Inoki

180
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,570
So this is how it is

181
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,400
I thought it must be this person at one time

182
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,100
Endo wins too

183
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,140
In addition, Matsumoto also...

184
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,470
I told you!

185
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,220
I told you!!

186
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,440
Matsumoto wins

187
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,600
So IKKO is the joker right?

188
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,880
Wait a second...

189
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,090
No way

190
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,610
So Tanaka will take my card

191
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,310
This means that...

192
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,370
Matsumoto wins

193
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,920
and if it pairs up with my card, I'll be winning too

194
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,130
Please don't

195
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,150
Let's see what happens

196
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,340
You need to do the imitation immediately

197
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,060
-Ok
-Right after you lose

198
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,130
Please don't, please don't!

199
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,990
Paired...with nothing

200
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,170
Yes! Yesssss! All right!

201
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,980
So if Yama-chan can pair it up...

202
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,020
Get prepared for the imitation Tanaka

203
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,720
Wait a moment please...

204
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,280
Yeah you have to be prepared

205
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,520
It must be one of them anyway

206
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,810
Ok, pick one Yama-chan

207
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,290
Let's see

208
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,820
Oh, God. Please!

209
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,830
Can he make it?

210
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,360
Let's see

211
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,870
Oh, God. Please!

212
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,360
Can he make it?

213
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,330
Yes! Yesssss!

214
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,740
Housei wins

215
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,040
Which means that the joker is...

216
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,630
is IKKO-san

217
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,800
How come~~~

218
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,360
This must be a joke~~~

219
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,740
I am so surprised~~~

220
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,580
How come~~~

221
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,650
Please behave yourself

222
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,560
Please behave yourself~~~

223
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,600
It's you!!

224
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,620
He's worried about you

225
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,660
It took a long time

226
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,250
Well yeah

227
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,700
But just as Matsumoto-san said

228
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,780
Endo you should have did it right at the beginning

229
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,720
You should say "let me do all of it please!!"

230
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,710
Yeah you really should have did it

231
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,930
That's just awkward, Hamada-san

232
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,690
Well yeah, because it's Downtown

233
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,920
And he moved from a thin house, to a thicker house

234
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,820
Well yeah, it is a thin and tall house

235
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,160
But there is nothing I can do to help, that's a 35 years mortgage

236
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,800
Let's go for a second round

237
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,130
The theme for the next Jiji-nuki...

238
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:32,680
Is to create a XXX associated to the title on the cards

239
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,160
What's this?

240
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,490
I have no idea

241
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,930
So each card has some words on it

242
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,530
And the theme for this round

243
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,080
Is to create a nursery rhyme

244
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,650
-This is awful
-That's ridiculous

245
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:52,220
So the words on the card,
will be the title of the nursery rhyme

246
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,960
The titles are completely random

247
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,880
And use it to create a nursery rhyme

248
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,540
This is tough

249
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,330
But on the contrary, this means none is better than any other

250
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,330
What is paired up?

251
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,770
"Castella cake shop" is paired up

252
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,340
"Castella cake shop" sounds easy man

253
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:18,190
"Castella cake shop" sounds easy right?

254
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,580
-I got it
-What is it

255
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,490
Taraxacum's adventure

256
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,710
So the plant that flies far away right

257
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,100
I got another one

258
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,770
Seriously?

259
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,910
Dango (sweet rice dumpling) under the sunset

260
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,480
I can't even imagine that

261
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,370
You're so lucky Tanaka

262
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,740
The title for the nursery rhyme is

263
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,740
Bamboo shoots on the hill

264
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,390
The dealer Endo will start the game

265
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,520
Tanaka is already about to win

266
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,560
Yeah because 2 pairs were matched

267
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,730
-You don't have any pairs?
-Yeah, I have tons of cards

268
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,590
I'm probably gonna lose this time

269
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,320
But Yama-chan also didn't pair up anything right

270
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,630
No pairs at all

271
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,610
I already came up with a nursery rhyme for "Castella cake shop"

272
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,770
That is such a good title

273
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,580
You have tons of cards man

274
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,750
I got it

275
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,230
The Jizo statue that farted

276
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,330
Well, this also seems to be a good title

277
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,420
I don't think so

278
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,200
I got it

279
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,570
-Spanking
-That's quite simple

280
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,240
I got it too

281
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,250
The school of Earthworms

282
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,390
This is also a good title right?

283
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:45,080
Yeah, I thought it's a easy one too

284
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,140
Different from the first round

285
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,910
The cards are paired up in a fast pace

286
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,800
The snacks samba dance

287
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,610
And Housei's good luck continues

288
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,790
I got them all

289
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,320
Amazing

290
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,050
-Tengu’s festival
-I never saw that card

291
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,250
You're done?

292
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,100
Housei wins

293
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,290
Following Housei, Tanaka also...

294
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,450
Thank you so much

295
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,670
Tanaka wins

296
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,910
Just let Endo do it

297
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,940
In addition, Hamada also...

298
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,940
-Really?
-Seriously?

299
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,180
Hamada wins

300
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,400
And this means that...

301
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,650
I'll win if this card matches

302
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,710
Please! Seriously, please!!

303
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,640
Wait a second, wait a second

304
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,540
GIve me a break, this is stressing me out!!

305
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,120
This is too tough

306
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,480
Try to be a creator

307
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,730
This demands a lot of artistic sense!!

308
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,800
This is going to reveal your artistic sense dude!!

309
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,460
Come on!!

310
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,810
Please take the card

311
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,290
It must be one of them

312
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:57,070
Please, please!

313
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,060
GOD DAMN!!

314
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,440
It didn't match?

315
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,410
That's a chance for you

316
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,120
One more pair and I'm done right

317
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,190
It must be one of the 3 cards

318
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,410
Please! I always think this is something perfect for Endo to do

319
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,660
I really think this suits Endo

320
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,430
I want to listen to Endo's nursery rhyme

321
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,680
I have nothing to do with nursery rhyme

322
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,230
Please! Just let it be Endo! Please!

323
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,630
You guys are annoying!!

324
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,040
Choose one

325
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,280
You should be able match this right

326
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,950
I'll choose it!

327
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,760
Why can't I see through it...

328
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,750
Senpai is being desperate

329
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,000
Ok let's go!

330
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,520
Why can't I see through it!!

331
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,800
Please---!!

332
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,760
Why can't I see through it!!

333
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,400
Please---!!

334
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,930
Oh yes!!

335
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,680
The Onigiri caught a cold

336
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,590
This means that...

337
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:02,000
Give me a second...a nursery rhyme...

338
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,240
Matsumoto wins

339
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,060
What's the joker?

340
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,960
So this is paired up

341
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,900
And this is the joker

342
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,800
Bamboo shoots on the hill

343
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:20,480
Over here, over there

344
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,930
All over the hill

345
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,860
-This is shit
-Wow, wow, that's amazing

346
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,420
There is no space to walk through

347
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,990
-What the heck!!
-Over here, over there

348
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,990
-Too long dude
-All over the hill

349
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,510
I did it

350
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,190
No, you didn't

351
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,480
-I cleared that with ease
-No not at all

352
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,790
That was with none artistic sense

353
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,170
Nice song, nice song!

354
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,690
There's no space to walk through?

355
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,640
Yeah, because the bamboo shoots are all over the hill

356
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,900
That was tough

357
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,260
Let's go for the third round

358
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,520
Spin the roulette to decide the dealer

359
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,110
So it's Housei-san

360
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,300
Choose the joker first...

361
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,060
It's already chosen

362
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,210
Joker is already chosen

363
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,620
Oh yeah, for this time...

364
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,050
Hey dude...

365
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,580
What's going on with you dude?

366
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:30,340
Umm, the rule changes a bit...for the third round...

367
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,290
And I just forgot about it

368
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,270
Excuse me everyone,

369
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,160
for this time...

370
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,410
-The joker is already chosen?
-Yes

371
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,730
And the theme is...

372
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,960
Batsu game

373
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,830
Just let Hamada do it

374
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,850
Why man? It should be Endo right

375
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,000
You came this far with reaction performances anyway...

376
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Then it should be Tanaka right

377
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,830
He've been performing reactions since he was a kid

378
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,150
Batsu game immediately after you lose

379
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,440
Please guess which card is the joker together this time

380
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,090
You only have 2 cards left

381
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,330
Yeah, but it's still hard to tell

382
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,130
Yama-chan is the dealer right? You can go first

383
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,130
You're really lucky Endo

384
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,350
What's this?

385
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,070
No way, no way!

386
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,060
What's that

387
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,340
*The card says "A sweet bite from Tosa (dog)"

388
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,380
It won't be able to control itself!

389
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,590
What does that mean?

390
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,940
What does that mean!! This is pissing me off

391
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,340
It can't control itself?

392
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,240
This is just absolutely impossible

393
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,470
*The card says "Human-sized flash cotton"

394
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,470
Are the staffs idiots?

395
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,810
What the heck is this

396
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:55,020
While the members are terrified by the Batsu games...

397
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,800
Please! Please let me win!

398
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,150
I got it!

399
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,960
Thank god!

400
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,170
*The card says "50 electric machines"

401
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,170
I seriously hate those electric things

402
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,960
The terrifying cards are getting less and less

403
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,780
Of course this is out

404
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,310
I thought it's definitely a fake one too

405
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,830
*The card says "A sweet bite from Tosa (dog)"

406
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,830
I actually even wanted to do this

407
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,650
-If it's possible
-Yeah, if it's possible

408
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:26,150
I think this is out too

409
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,130
What the heck is this?

410
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,760
Do you need to read it that close?

411
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,970
*The card says "Cannonball in your mouth"

412
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,970
I can't even understand this

413
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,680
What the heck is this?

414
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,400
Umm?

415
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,630
-No idea right?
-No idea at all

416
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,410
-Is it dangerous?
-It's way too dangerous

417
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,830
Well, Hamada is the one to do it, so never mind

418
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,870
I'm not doing it

419
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,440
Human-sized flash cotton

420
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,550
I thought this is impossible too

421
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,400
Hamada-san?

422
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,230
Yes, please take it

423
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,630
-He's good at this
-Hamada is going to win

424
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,630
What's going on with this guy!

425
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,260
Hamada wins

426
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,840
What's going on with this guy

427
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,080
I got it too

428
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,280
Billiards headshot

429
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,630
Will definitely be dead for this

430
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,340
I thought that's possible, because the staffs are idiots

431
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,870
Both of the cards are horrible

432
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,200
For real!?

433
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,340
*The card says "Earthworms in the nose"

434
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,670
Can we not do this? Seriously

435
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,560
He's talking about this right?

436
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,010
It's his partner right?

437
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,400
Can we seriously not do this?

438
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,540
I hope they are combi

439
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,760
This is...

440
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,440
*The card says "Earthworms in the nose"

441
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,890
This is going to make you sick

442
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,570
Must be the same card!

443
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,120
Which means if I can get this right...

444
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,300
This one?

445
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,590
This is the one that make you sick right!

446
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,620
Oh yes!!

447
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,530
Earthworms in the nose

448
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,610
Matsumoto wins

449
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,560
Well that's also a good news though

450
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,720
It's good that the card is discarded

451
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,640
I'll win if this card pairs up too

452
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,920
I hope you will win

453
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,440
Nope

454
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,070
No?

455
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,180
Give me a break

456
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,040
So now it's Endo's chance

457
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,110
Yeah

458
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,790
Cocorico is so weak

459
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,050
It looks like it is Cocorico's TV show now

460
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,810
*Golden Legend is an ended TV show hosted by Cocorico

461
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,810
It's like Golden Legend 2

462
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,700
*The card says "Cannonball in your mouth"

463
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,740
It didn't match?
Then it's now Yama-chan's chance

464
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,630
Hopefully Endo got the card

465
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,050
It's quite possible

466
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,730
Yeah so a 50% possibility

467
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,030
Draw the card

468
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,430
This is getting interesting

469
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,060
So if this matches...

470
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,550
Please!

471
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,520
I got it!

472
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,090
Housei wins

473
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,810
This card makes no sense, so I thought it must be joker

474
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,720
Battle between Cocorico

475
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,420
Golden Legend 2

476
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,540
Wait a moment...

477
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,730
Maybe this will be the last round

478
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,600
Are you ready Tanaka-san?

479
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,510
Wait a second...

480
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,300
-I'll go for this
-This is nervous

481
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,370
How come!!

482
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,280
-Really?
-Seriously?

483
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,650
Here comes your chance

484
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,370
Endo know which is joker right?

485
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:44,840
Yeah, this is terrible

486
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,440
This is just terrible...

487
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,670
What a fight for Cocorico

488
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,360
*Miracle Type is another TV show hosted by Cocorico

489
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,360
It's Miracle Type

490
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,490
You're just saying the title of their shows

491
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,620
Yeah, it's somehow embarrassing

492
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:00,530
Who will be playing the Batsu game, Endo or Tanaka?

493
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,280
Let's go!

494
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,920
One, two...

495
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,010
Oh yes!

496
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,210
Tanaka wins

497
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,750
So the joker is "Chinese foot massage"

498
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,750
It's quite vulgar, so I thought it won't be joker

499
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:27,080
This guy looks completely different from what I thought

500
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,130
He's young right

501
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,190
His eyes are going mad

502
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,650
-Hey Endo, stay put
-OUCH OUCH OUCH!!!

503
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,690
This really hurts

504
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,040
These masseurs have no mercy

505
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,550
His eyes are going completely mad

506
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,640
Yeah he's going mad

507
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,210
Hamada's eyes are also going mad

508
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,450
Both of them are going mad

509
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,570
Thank you very much

510
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,660
Good for you

511
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,790
Good for your health
