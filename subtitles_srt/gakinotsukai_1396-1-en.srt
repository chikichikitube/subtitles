We've been too quick today

Yeah, kinda

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,860
It is

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,860
It's so thick

33
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,560
Just a bit

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,430
It's way thicker than usual

35
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,630
It's way thicker than usual

36
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:02,640

It does

44
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,690
You go first

45
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,440
Are you ok with that?

46
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,080

57
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,500
How should we do it?

58
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:55,090
Making noise would bother the others
they can't raise their voice no matter what

Oh, like this

62
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,130
Shh! Quiet

63
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,250
That hurt!

66
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,950
I'm going next, ok?

67
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,940
Let's sit down

68
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,220
Rice spoon on forehead

69
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,000
Shit

70
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,240

It was a shoehorn last time

75
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,020
That's right

76
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,040
It's basically the same

77
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,670
I really don't want this one

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,370

How should we...?

90
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,350
Just one hit

91
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,350
Only one

92
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,570
So loud

93
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,500
It scared me

94
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,650
I swear

95
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,650
What the hell, man

96
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,990
How is it looking?

97
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,990
It's fine

98
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,760
Flip it

00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,000
Huh?!

115
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,960

Give me a break, please

00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,230
Today's not my day

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,200
Go as hard as you want to

122
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,480
Wait--

123
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,480
Why flat?

124
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,580
Come on

125
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,580
Why like that?

126
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,230
Don't use angles

127
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,360
On this side, please

128
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,240
Not like this?

129
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,240
No, sideways

130
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,900

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,900
Yes

132
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,250
Alright, I'm ready

133
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,250
Stay still

134
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,520

It hurts so bad

138
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,260
Haven't we agreed to trick him
into getting the card?

139
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,220
No way, it's random

140
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,180
That's so mean

141
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,260

Give me a break...

Tongue grab? Is that it?

151
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,620
It's disgusting

152
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,440
Really, it's the worst

Of course it happened, it had to

166
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,380
You're our representative here

167
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,450
Is he gonna do it?

168
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,450
Yes

00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,580
No way...

172
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,580
Do I grab it with my hand?

173
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,460
Yes

174
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,280

Wait

Let it out, dude

184
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,540
It hurts!!

186
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,210
I'd hate it so much

00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,210
Yeah...

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,860
Aren't we going too fast?

189
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,860
He's right, I don't like this pace

190
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,330

Hamada

207
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:04,590
Shh

208
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:04,590
Trans d*ck grip

209
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,880
Alright, he's the most suited for this

210
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,500
Alright alright alright

211
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,300
I'm so glad

212
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,930
Wait, what now? What?

213
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,060
It's fine, stay still

214
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,690
Scary!

215
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,500
She's so tall

216
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,140
So intimidating

217
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,820
It was no big deal, hun

218
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,820
Sure...

219
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,320
A bad one, huh?

220
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,670
She went for my balls, not my dick

221
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,670
Ouch

222
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,210
Did she tell you something?

223
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,210
At the end

224
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,480
At the end?

225
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,480
What did she say?

226
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,550
She said "no big deal, hun"

227
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,550
Whoa, that's harsh

228
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,740
Extra emotional damage

229
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,490
I guess so

230
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,990
Does it mean she'll get back to you?

231
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,540
My balls really hurt, I swear

232
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,540
It's a grip after all

233
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,090
Ready for the next one?

234
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,090

235
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,540
Oral cracker

236
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,700
Can I pick first?

237
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:27,280
Oral cracker

238
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:27,280
topic

239
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,510
For real?

240
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,500
Let's go together

241
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,290
Ready?

242
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,420
One, two and...

243
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,820
Endo

244
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,820

249
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,130
Hakamada

250
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,130
Oral cracker

251
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,130
Shh

252
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,340
Alright

253
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,960
Magnificent

254
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,870
A way too dangerous punishment for Hakamada!

255
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,230
Have mercy

256
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,870
You'll have to bite on this

257
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,870
Hakamada

258
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,870
Oral cracker

259
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,870
Shh

260
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,050
Are you firing it inside his mouth?

261
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,110
Let's move him

262
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,280
I've never done it before

263
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,120
Use your tongue

264
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,120
Protect your throat with it

265
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,940
Open up

266
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,820
This looks terrifying

267
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,820
Wait-

268
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,150
Open your mouth

269
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,150
Say "aah"

270
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,400
I'm so scared

271
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,400
It's fine, just open up

272
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,510
Don't forget the tongue

273
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,760
Ready? Don't forget your tongue

274
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,640
Three, two, one...

275
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,000
No way

276
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,540
No friggin' way

277
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,640
The impact was way stronger than imagined

278
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,540
The impact was way stronger than imagined

279
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,200
It's a cracker after all

280
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,720
Incredible

281
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,380
I couldn't do it

282
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,190
I don't think I could have done it

283
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,460
That was really something

284
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,590
You haven't gotten anything yet

285
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,940
Right, both of them

286
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,940
You're right, those two here

287
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,300
Static electricity kiss (☠ x 2)

288
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There it is

289
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,190
Oh shit

290
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,190
I hate this

291
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,810
Static electricity kiss

292
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,810
topic

293
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,780
I really don't want this

294
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,780
This one sucks

295
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,800
What now?

296
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,810
Oh, right

297
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:11,250
Two skeleton cards will be used for this round
this punishment requires two victims

298
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:11,250
m 0 0 l -1 -16 l -45 -16 l -45 0 l 0 0

299
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,500
Here

300
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,140
'Cause it's two skulls  That's right, it's for two

301
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,270
Geez...

302
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,250
Oh, is that so?

303
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,480
It's even worse than usual

304
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,480
These two are still unharmed

305
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,790
I don't want this

306
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,790
These two, yeah

307
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,110
You got the last one, you go first

308
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,040
I'm so scared

309
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,100
I hate static electricity

310
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,170
Remember it's for two

311
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,170
Please!

312
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,010
Endo

313
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,010
Endo

314
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,010
Hakamada

315
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,010
Hakamada

316
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,010
Hamada

317
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,010
Hamada

318
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,010
Hosei

319
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,010
Hosei

320
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,010
Matsumoto

321
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,010
Matsumoto

322
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,010
Tanaka

323
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,010
Tanaka

324
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,440
Ready?

325
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,050
Lucky me!

326
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:46,550
Hosei & Tanaka

327
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:46,550
Shh

328
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:46,550
Static electricity kiss

329
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,520
Alright!

330
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,850
It's Tanaka and Yama-chan

331
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,420
Hosei stand there and get charged

332
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,420
Eh? Me?

333
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,820
Yes, just stand still

334
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,820
Crap...

335
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,230
We'll load Hosei's back with electricity

336
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,660
How about Tanaka?

337
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,690
He's fine

338
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,760
electricity generator device

339
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,690
This is terrifying

340
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,400
Can't blame him

341
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,400
It's making sound

342
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,610
Can you hear that?!

343
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,610
It's so scary

344
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,220
I'd be so scared

345
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,810
Man, it's making such a loud sound...

346
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,920
Normally your hair would raise up a bit

347
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,650
But he's balding so they're not moving

348
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,790
But he's balding so they're not moving

349
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,530
Such a shame, right?

350
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,860
What a shame

351
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,030
Oh, it's working!

352
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,030
I can see it

353
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,820
Is this enough?

354
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,230
Ok?

355
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,580
This is the worst

356
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,950
He's too tall

357
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,680
It's making things worse

358
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,880
Oh shit

359
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,480
Not yet

360
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,620
Shut up!

361
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,690
*toot*

362
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,460
Huh?

363
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,420
He just farted

364
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,620
What the...

365
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,780
He farted

366
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,620
He farted!

367
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,600
He farted...

368
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
What the heck

369
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,360
He farted and it stinks too

370
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,360
So lame

371
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,740
I'm glad it wasn't electric

372
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,790
He even farted...

373
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,950
What's wrong with him?

374
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,370
I don't like stuff like that

375
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,400
Matsumoto is the only one left

376
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,710
Amazing, right?

377
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,710
That's right

378
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,320
He's the only one, yes

379
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,320
Only Matsumoto

380
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,620
Right...

381
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,620
So far I'm loving this

382
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:33,420
Endo  1 time

383
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:33,420
Tanaka  3 times

384
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,620
He got it three times

385
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:33,420
Hakamada  2 times

386
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:33,420
Matsumoto  0 times

387
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:33,420
Matsumoto  0 times

388
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:33,420
Hamada  1 time

389
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:33,420
Hosei  1 time

390
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,620
Three?

391
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,900
Two for him, one for you

392
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,960
Two and one?

393
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,960
And he got one now

394
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,420
Only Matsumoto never got any

395
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,930
Well, I'm fine as I am right now

396
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,660
Hamburger set mix drink

397
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,660
What's this?

398
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,430
Hamburger set mix drink

399
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,430
topic

400
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,640
What's this?

401
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,640
What the...?

402
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,760
Doesn't sound horrible

403
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,700
It's not that bad, isn't it?

404
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,700
You think so?

405
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,300
Can I...?

406
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,160
Oh

407
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,440
You're going first?

408
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,440
I am

409
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,590
I don't know what to expect

410
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,760
Ready and...

411
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,590
Endo

412
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,590

Hamburger set mix drink

419
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:14,700
Shh

420
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,360
What's this one?

421
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,190
Doesn't it feel like a reward?

422
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,000
Ahh, it could be

423
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,700
I'm a bit hungry to be honest

424
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,000
This is messed up

425
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,700
It's gonna get messy

426
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,700
I don't think it's gonna be good for me

427
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,700
Looks nice

428
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,780
Why do you have to do this?

429
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,780
Let me eat it normally...

430
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,810
There's also a cola

431
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,190
I mean, it's made of edible stuff

432
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,630
Well, yes

433
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,100
Oh god

434
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,100
Ugh...

435
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,910
Look at that color

436
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,420
This sucks

437
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,420
Look at that

438
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,400
Oh shit-

439
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,870
It stinks

440
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,920
It... it smells bad

441
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,260
This is gonna suck, Endo

442
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,650
Give me a break...

443
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,100
This is incredible

444
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,340
No way, this is horrible

445
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,690
You can do it, Endo

446
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,690
What the... what is this?

447
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,760
Eat up, please

448
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,610
I don't think we can air this

449
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,980
I agree

450
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,580
I'm freaking out

451
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,110
Look at him!

452
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,110
No way...

453
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,680
No friggin' way

454
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,680
How about a refill?

455
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,850
Holy crap

456
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:22,960
There's still more in there

457
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,960
Yeah, there is

458
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,960
Really?

459
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,460
It stinks

460
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,330
Ping Pong smash in the face

461
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,080
I mean...

462
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:34,770
Ping Pong smash in the face

463
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:34,770
topic

464
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,980
It couldn't have been clearer

465
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,980
Why...

466
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,770
Why are we doing this?

467
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,380
Ping Pong? In the face?

468
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,840
This one

469
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,750
It's going to be painful

470
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,780
One, two and...

471
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,820
Endo

472
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,820

478
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,060
Ping Pong smash in the face

479
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,060
Shh

480
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,520
It was about time

481
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,920
Finally

482
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,920
I don't want to

483
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,000
The tables have turned

484
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh, come on

485
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,580
I'm really scared

486
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,550
This is terrifying

487
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,240
I don't even know him

488
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,240
You gotta do it

489
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,410
I don't want to

490
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:17,810
A strong smash right on Matsumoto's face!

491
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,940
I don't like this stuff

492
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,640
How are we doing this, Tanaka?

493
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,810
Do I have to wear this?! I'm scared

494
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,810
Come on, Matsumoto

495
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,850
Sit there

496
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:27,860
Matsumoto

497
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:27,860
Ping Pong smash in the face

498
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:27,860
Shh

499
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,930
Is it going to hurt?

500
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,650
Alright

501
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,650
Please

502
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,860
Make sure you don't move

503
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,380
How am I...?

504
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,080
Place your chin there

505
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,800
Like this, here

506
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,800
That's right

507
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,860
Don't move

508
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,970
It could be even worse

509
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,240
Well, it's scary

510
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,580
Whoa, he's ready

511
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,580
Wait--

512
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,220
Wait a sec

513
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,440
Ouch!

514
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,440
Ouch!

515
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,810
Oh shit!

516
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,560
That was a strong one

517
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,560
That's too much!

518
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,220
How was it?

519
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,650
It hurts so bad

520
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,130
Who the hell is that guy?

521
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,400
He simply hit your face

522
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,100
He simply hit your face

523
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,760
I bet it hurts

524
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,140
I'm glad he didn't hit my forehead

525
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,140
I see

526
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,810
That was a nice shot, wasn't it?

527
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,530
It looked good and it sounded good

528
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,360
Aren't we going too fast?

529
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,990
Too fast indeed...

530
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,930
D*ck missile

531
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,740
Huh!?

532
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,090
Man, you really love d*cks, don't ya...

533
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:44,170
D*ck missile

535
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,490
Those guys...

536
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,490
This isn't ok, you know?

537
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,880
Why all this stupid stuff?

538
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,220
That's too much

539
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,840
It wasn't like this last time

540
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,840
Why are you obsessed with d*cks?

541
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,790
Come on, Matsumoto

542
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,980
He chose for us

543
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,480
That's unfair

544
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,450
Ready?

545
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,690

552
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,060
Come on-

553
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,460
D*ck missile

556
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,500
Good

557
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,080
You got that

558
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,800
Prof. Ichioka Genki

559
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,800
Yonemura Denjiro's disciple

560
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,240
What now?

561
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,580
I hate this kind of stuff

562
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,330
From where is it...?

563
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,140
From there?

564
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,310
Where should we stand?

565
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,310
Over there

566
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,150
Is it gonna hit my belly?

567
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,020
Stay still  My belly--- wait--

568
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,280
That's a lot

569
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,040
Wait-- that's too far

570
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,040
That's so scary!

571
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,390
Too far! Too far! Too far!

572
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,390
Scary

573
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,280
Too much

574
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,600
It's way too far! Too far!

575
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,600
I'm scared for him

576
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,140
Here comes

577
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,460
Get ready

578
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,860
3... 2... 1... Go!

579
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,400
3... 2... 1... Go!

580
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,630
3... 2... 1... Go!

00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,760
Go!

00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,640
Go!

583
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,620
So fast

584
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,810
Very fast

585
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,080
Did it hit your stomach?

586
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,320
No

587
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,420
Makes sense

588
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,390
The missile came below the belt

589
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,390
It hit you, right?

590
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,090
Can't you tell?

591
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,090
It did

592
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,030
No way

593
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,930
That's ingenious, isn't it?

594
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,630
I'd hate it

595
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,630
Right?

596
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,260
It hit perfectly

597
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,270
Oh, he's standing now

598
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,670
Is everything ok?

599
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,020
I doubt it's gonna get worse

600
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,020
Yeah

601
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,210
Can't we call it a day?

602
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,340
We did a lot of those

603
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,180
Isn't it enough?

604
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,220
There's still more to come

605
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,590
Old dude's freshly
removed underpants

606
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,590
No way

607
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,590
Oh for crying out loud...

608
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,890
Old dude's freshly removed underpants

609
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,890
topic

610
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,720
This type of stuff...

611
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,890
It's hard to bear

612
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,180
This type-- I can't

613
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,000
Can't we skip this one?

614
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,000
What was that for?

615
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,340
What's going on?

616
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,870
Let him be, he's our guest

617
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,870
That was so pointless

618
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,540
It's fine

619
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,540
They're the same cards we had

620
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,440
Endo

621
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,440
Hakamada

622
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,440
Hamada

623
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,440
Hosei

624
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,440
Matsumoto

625
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,440
Tanaka

626
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,840
Ready and...

627
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,240
Hakamada

628
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,240
Old dude's freshly removed underpants

629
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,240
Shh

630
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,210
I'm so glad!

631
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,240
You have it, don't you?

632
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,500
As expected

633
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,500
Hakamada

634
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,280
I'm glad

635
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,100
Alright!

636
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,100
You're perfect for this show

637
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,570
This one sucks

638
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,350
It's the worst

639
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,350
Come here

640
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,150
You'll get even more famous now

641
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,600
Move to the front, please

642
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,290
Come here, to the front

643
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,760
He's so unlucky

644
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,760
Yeah

645
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,760
He's unlucky, isn't he?

646
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,300
He's so unlucky

647
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,300
Yeah

648
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,930
What now? Should he sit?

649
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,180
No, stand up

650
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,180
Ah, while standing?

651
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,640
Like this, just like this

652
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,370
Like this, stand still

653
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,370
Like this

654
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,410
Oh no

655
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,750
Really?

656
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,220
It reeks!

657
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,460
Hakamada!

658
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,360
Don't move

659
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,130
But it stinks

660
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,870
He's not coming back

661
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,870
It stinks!

662
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,340
Is this the return of Hentai Kamen?

663
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:10,970
hentai kamen (masked pervert) has returned

664
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,450
It stinks!

665
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,750
It stinks for real

666
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,010
So his real identity is Hakamada, huh

667
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,450
So his real identity is Hakamada, huh

668
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,450
Whoa

669
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,210
I thought he would do it

670
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,210
Yeah me too

671
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,180
It stinks...

672
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,230
We didn't know

673
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,170
I thought he was in charge

674
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,170
I know

675
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,400
Same here

676
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,040
He's back, isn't he?

677
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,040
I didn't think I'd see him again

678
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,040
That was incredible

679
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:54,790

PART TWO IS COMING NEXT WEEK
(OR IT'S ALREADY ONLINE IF YOU'RE
A PERSON FROM THE FUTURE)

680
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,270
Next week we'll see the second half of Silent Library

681
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,020
The punishments will grow harsher and harsher

682
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,200
Holy shit that's scary

683
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,110
And a tragedy is about to hit our guest Hakamada

684
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,410
Tragedy

685
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,080
What's this?

686
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,200
That's enough, isn't it?

687
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,750
9th silent library, second half!

688
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,750
A tragedy awaits Hakamada!

689
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,600
You're right

690
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,520
He's got nothing more to lick by now
