1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,660
This studio...

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,320
Isn't every room really cold?

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,590
I've had to start wearing long sleeves

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,740
This room was super cold!

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,680
That scared me!
Good morning!

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,520
G'morning!

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,290
He's smiling so hard

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,290
Such a beautiful smile

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,800
C'mon, you can tell what this is from this outfit

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,820
Could it be?

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,820
What day is it today?

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,220
It's September

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,120
Right?

14
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,360
What happens in September?

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,000
He has the same birthday as my son after all

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,840
You get it right?!

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,500
This month is Matsumoto's birthday

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,140
The date has passed us, however,

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,660
The Tokyo Olympics,

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,540
there were lots of events,

21
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,700
But there was one thing he thought was super cool

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,940
And that's what he wants for his birthday

23
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,600
The black masks have helped Matsumoto 8 times so far,

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,120
and helped him achieve his dreams

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,800
It started with the world record high jump,

26
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,740
And a 10 tier vault!!

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,040
And a miralulous skateboard trick

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,970
Batting a 150km/h ball!!

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,730
A new world record in weightlifting

30
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,800
50cm limbo dance!

31
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,680
Swimming 25 metres in 10 seconds!

32
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,440
And lastly,

33
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,110
The still rings challenge!

34
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,020
They've broken various records,

35
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,000
And now that he's 58 years old,

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,170
What challenge will he take on this time?

37
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,750
For now let's watch this

38
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,040
What is it that we're watching?

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,040
This

40
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,710
This (x4 at least)

41
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,620
This!

42
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,260
This super cool this

43
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,110
He wants to do this?

44
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,350
He wants to do an alley oop dunk

45
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,030
No no no no

46
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,900
But you guys will helo him out right

47
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,370
We do have some trust

48
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,370
Right

49
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,640
Let's get it over with quickly

50
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,150
It's his birthday right?

51
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,110
Let's go in these clothes

52
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,330
Let's change and go

53
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,860
Matsumoto's dream...

54
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,480
after 2 years,  a new record!

55
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,620
Matsumoto Hitoshi will do the Alley oop!

56
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,460
The big guys here, make sure,

57
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,930
Help put

58
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,840
It's quiet loud

59
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,420
It's pretty tall yeahhh

60
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,400
It's taller than I thought

61
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,950
GOOD MORNING

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,950
Good morning!

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,950
Good morning!

64
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,950
Good morning!

65
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,930
Did you tell them?

66
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,240
Yes I did explain,

67
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,200
He told you?

68
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,860
Even though I'm 58,

69
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,370
Don't I seem like a young person?

70
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,370
That feel

71
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,660
Did you explain it properly?

72
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,950
I did I did

73
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,240
What tone did you use?

74
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,200
What kind of tone?

75
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,000
You want us to help you do that trick

76
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,910
Sorry I didn't see the setup part,

77
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,000
But I heard through rumors,

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,200
Someone said "Let get this done and over with"

79
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,570
And according to Yanaoka, Hosei-san said this

80
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,710
Then let's begin, let's begin

81
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,020
Don't push me!

82
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,260
For now pick it him up, and go to the end

83
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,530
Alright, excuse me please

84
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,710
His feet

85
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,880
Ready, steady,

86
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,620
He's not putting any effort at all

87
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,620
He's not putting any strength in...

88
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,620
I wish he would try, it would be easier

89
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,020
His hand has gotta move

90
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,950
Let's put him down once

91
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,020
Let's put him down once

92
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,150
Let's put him down once

93
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,770
Hold on this won't work

94
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,700
Bring a mat

95
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,040
Yeah, everyone

96
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,970
We'll do it with this, we got this

97
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,880
He's not happy

98
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,420
When we're getting ready,

99
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,970
Why does he stand properly

100
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,600
He won't speak a single word though

101
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,770
Make him jump on the trampoline,

102
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:06,410
Jump using the trampoline to do the alley oop

103
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,910
And when he reaches the right height I'll pass the ball to him

104
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,880
Time it right please

105
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,600
At the right timing, here we go

106
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,220
This is good, we're in good shape

107
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,780
Bring him up to the bound here

108
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,850
Put his feet on it

109
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,600
Put his feet on it

110
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,530
His feet are on it

111
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,460
You gotta stand him up

112
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,240
His feet! Oh, isn't this good?

113
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,420
Like that! More!

114
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,880
Keep that up!

115
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,660
It's gonna work!

116
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,310
1! 2! 3!

117
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,060
My armpit hurts...

118
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,110
That was pretty...

119
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,110
That seemed pretty good

120
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,950
Did you hear?

121
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,350
When he stood here and went there

122
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,020
In a silent whisper,

123
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,790
"My armpit hurts"...

124
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,860
It was bright red

125
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,620
For real?

126
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,460
Someone pulled him from there,

127
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,460
Was it you?

128
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,900
Is he angry?

129
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,900
I don't think he would be angry

130
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,330
He just said it hurts

131
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,260
If he was angry he would've gone "AHH" just now

132
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,510
Let's go see, if he doesn't wanna do it anymore then...

133
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,550
That means we can finish this

134
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,340
Maybe he left cause he was satisfied

135
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,650
They head to Matsumoto's dressing room

136
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,150
Excuse me

137
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,130
Does this mean we don't have to do this anymore?

138
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,120
Who held my armpit?

139
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,910
Yes, yes

140
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:19,940
You took all of my armpit hair with you

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,510
You know, what is it, it's, fine,

142
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,110
I finally understand you have no intention of helping me succeed

143
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,000
That's not true

144
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,000
That's not true

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,550
I UNDERSTAND NOW

146
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,680
That's not true at all

147
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,150
You had no motivation from the beginning

148
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,840
I SAID LEND ME YOUR STRENGTH

149
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,370
There aren't any senpais who have to insist so much like this, conversely

150
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,680
There aren't many senpais who ask for your strength, conversely

151
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,000
Grabbed my armpit hair and pulled all of it out

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,080
Would it be better without the gloves?

153
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,820
Think about that shit on your own

154
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:10,260
Why is a grown man like you

155
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:10,260
asking a grown man like me about gloves

156
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,930
Time for the 2nd attempt!!

157
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,420
Will this be alright?

158
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,860
It does seem like it'll work

159
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,600
This should be more comfortable for him

160
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,440
But either way-Oh, welcome

161
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,350
his mood has improved

162
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,390
Sorry, things got kinda...

163
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,420
I might have gone too far

164
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:48,200
I was thinking that unless we're all dedicated to this we won't succeed,

165
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,330
We definitely all understand each other

166
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,820
Except for Inomoto

167
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,840
Eh? Really?

168
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,840
He doesn't seem to like you very much

169
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,510
Let's do this, Matsumoto-san please come here

170
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,880
This is something we have to attach,

171
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,650
It would be best if he's on his back?

172
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,570
If you could lay on your back please, alright

173
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,200
Attach it

174
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,280
Here we  go!

175
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,600
Stop thuddign

176
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,830
Don't thud

177
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,310
His flesh is stuck!

178
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,130
He's gonna get blisters!

179
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,680
Yeah for real! This is bad

180
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,370
The shoulder, his shoulder,

181
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,400
Don't force it on

182
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,150
Did you do a simulation?

183
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,080
It's fine it's fine, we did

184
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,460
Inomoto did they do a simulation?

185
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,840
Do it exactly the same as the simulation alright

186
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,150
Once the preparation is done Tanaka and License' you come here

187
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,860
Which young man did the simulation?

188
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,060
The age of the guy

189
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,900
Tell me the age of the guy who did the simulation

190
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,350
Alright attach them

191
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:08,350
Using the power of balloons to complete the Alley oop

192
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,810
Don't pinch his flesh!

193
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,590
Move him towards the goal

194
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,220
Inomoto why are you under his shoulder?

195
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,630
You need to put the ball in

196
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,620
Yes, put his hands in a catching position

197
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,240
Let's do it on steady,

198
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,420
Ready, steady!

199
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,950
Thank you very much

200
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,000
He can't get out like that

201
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,400
That was, probably,

202
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,830
When we made him jump, immediately,

203
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,500
He fell straight on his face

204
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,500
Yeah that's it

205
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,240
He just can't reach it. I guess balloons are out.

206
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,660
However, he did say "Thank you very much" before leaving

207
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,950
Maybe he means "That's enough"

208
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,130
Well if he wants to quit then that's fine, let's go

209
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,130
We did what we had to do

210
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,800
We can't do much more than that

211
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,730
Once again they visit Matsumoto in his break room

212
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,510
Excuse us

213
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,750
Excuse us

214
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,750
Excuse us

215
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,200
Former DownTown manager Nakamura

216
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,200
Nakamura Dress Up Game

217
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,200
Producer Nakamura

218
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,200
We gave up on the trampoline,

219
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,060
And thought of using the balloons to lift you...

220
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,310
We thought of using them to lift you...

221
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,020
But that didn't work out so...

222
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,990
If you want to quit, then there isn't really anything we can do

223
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,530
"Don't pinch his flesh! Don't pinch his flesh"
you guys kept yelling,

224
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,200
That made me super scared

225
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,330
Cause you did actually pinch it

226
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,860
And when that happened, I don't know who it was,

227
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,370
"KEKA KEKA KEKA" - some guy was cackling like that

228
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,550
It's not something to laugh at

229
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,530
You guys are all over the place

230
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,400
We can't get anything good out of this, that's bad

231
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,000
I asked you guys cause I trusted you!

232
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,080
Except for Inomoto

233
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,080
Why

234
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,140
Right?

235
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,930
For real, can I trust you guys?

236
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,800
Starting over, time for the 3rd attempt

237
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,000
Alright let's go!

238
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,970
I think we can do it with this next one

239
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,410
This mat always gives me concern

240
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,570
Just like last time get on here,

241
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,370
And lay down on your back

242
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,370
Did you do a simulation?

243
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,020
Yes we did

244
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,020
On my back? Where should my head be

245
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,310
Your head over there

246
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,060
Did the kid who did the simulation do the same?

247
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,930
What kid?

248
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,930
You really want to know that

249
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,330
Alright please take it away

250
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:18,500
Was the kid who did the simulation well educated?

251
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,550
Probably this time...

252
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,520
This will be fine

253
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,740
Did he go to a proper university?

254
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,800
These 3rd parties are super scary

255
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,170
These 3rd parties...did they do the simulation?

256
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,220
Of course

257
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:40,080
What kid did the simulation? Was it an assistant director?

258
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,080
Don't really know

259
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,510
Was he young and fit?

260
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,510
Yes

261
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,700
If he's too young, you know it'll be too different for me

262
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:50,000
But we don't have any 58 year old ADs

263
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,910
There aren't many 58 year olds to do the simulation

264
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,910
Oooh you've got a mouth on you!

265
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,530
That's dangerous

266
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,530
Watch out!

267
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,770
Help them out

268
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,150
More carefully

269
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,420
Let him down

270
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,400
Put him down

271
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,030
Try lifting him now please

272
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:30,010
Attempt to use a wire rope to complete the alley oop

273
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,930
This could work!

274
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,930
There we go

275
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,680
There it is!

276
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,020
He's up there!

277
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,680
There it is!

278
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Only the pass is left

279
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,950
Yeah!

280
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,130
Stick your hand out!

281
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,330
This side works better

282
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,330
This way, oh right

283
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,430
Fighting!

284
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,860
This could work

285
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,020
Let's go!

286
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,640
So close!

287
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,060
This angle here is good

288
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,820
Matsumoto-san, still,

289
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,440
Just a bit more

290
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,740
Matsumoto-san seems very concerned about his nose

291
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,240
He left again huh

292
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,750
If this doesn't work then...

293
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,350
It would've been better if his hands were like this

294
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,970
It would've been better if they were raised

295
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,970
Yeah raise them like this

296
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,680
Let's go tell him this, we'll tie his arms like this

297
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,480
Right? Let's go

298
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,430
Once again they head to his dressing room

299
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,040
I feel like I've been thoroughly bullied

300
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,150
You were straight up aiming for my face

301
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:16,750
When you said "So close"
I thought you were talking about the ball almost hitting my face

302
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,800
Matsumoto-san, that's a misunderstanding, the one who hit your face is-

303
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:31,500
Former Gaki producer - Suga Kenji

304
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,400
Honestly,

305
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,730
I think teamwork is super important

306
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,680
Do you want to do this or not, for real

307
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
Seriously

308
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,780
I can't take in what Matsumoto-san is saying

309
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,780
It's too surprising

310
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,330
Did he watch us? He didn't right

311
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,080
His eyes are bloodshot red

312
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,930
Of course he's angry

313
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,730
Anyone would get angry if that happened

314
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,150
It's better if it doesn't hurt right?

315
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,150
No shit!

316
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,330
I'm counting on you! It's the last time!

317
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,770
Yes!

318
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,770
Yes!

319
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,770
Yes!

320
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,020
Yes!

321
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:16,840
Reflecting on their mistakes, time for the 4th attempt!

322
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,950
We can definitely do this one

323
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,950
Yes it'll be fine!

324
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,110
It'll look like it went in

325
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,320
Fujiwara for real we're counting on you

326
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,110
The idea is perfect

327
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,930
I just need to do my best

328
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,110
And it won't hurt either

329
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,840
There's no danger or anything

330
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,530
No pain for sure

331
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,430
let's do this

332
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:44,740
Didn't you want to show off your youthfulness?

333
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,400
All's well that ends well

334
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,760
Of course

335
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,240
Let's go

336
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,150
Why is there a mat if this isn't dangerous?

337
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,750
For now just get on the mat

338
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,330
Watch out please

339
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,370
Get up there

340
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,420
Alright Fujiwara, get ready

341
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,330
Place it on properly

342
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,910
There we go

343
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,150
Alright yes!

344
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,440
Just like that! Alright

345
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,860
Pass the ball!

346
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,780
Using perspective tricks to complete the alley oop

347
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,860
Here we go!

348
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,860
Here it coooomes!

349
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,800
This is super cool

350
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,840
This is super cool

351
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,240
The ball...

352
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,360
The ball fell off. Put the ball on

353
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,950
Here it comes

354
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,440
Take it nice and slow

355
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,440
The ball's here!

356
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,180
It went in!

357
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,930
It went in!

358
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,930
Congratulations!

359
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,610
It went in so nicely

360
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,610
What is he angry about?

361
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,880
Maybe we celebrated at the wrong timing?

362
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,710
We stole the moment?

363
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,220
Maybe we should have celebrated afterwards

364
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,220
Yes that could be it

365
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,350
That's unfortunate, that's my fault

366
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,330
I said "We did it!" right away

367
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,630
Let's go apologise for that

368
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,040
Then we can finish this

369
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,660
It was nice the 2nd time

370
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,660
Yes yes yes

371
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,500
Once once once again they visit Matsumoto's dressing room

372
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,380
Excuse me, If this is the case,

373
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,510
After we succeeded we got too prideful, and before you,

374
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,950
We went "we did it!" and messed up by celebrating

375
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,150
It's not just one thing you did wrong

376
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,750
The thing I want to say most though is that breeze was too strong

377
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,840
It was friggin cold. It was cold in a lot of ways.

378
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,840
TN: Cold is slang for lame/unfunny

379
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,510
Also why the hell were you guys in the frame?

380
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,860
I want to do this by myself

381
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,220
You were totally in the frame

382
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,750
Should we go try again?

383
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,200
We don't have to do it. There's no need to force it to happen.

384
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,000
Sorry but, what,

385
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,240
What is this?

386
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,300
This...

387
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,970
It's a face roller

388
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,440
I get that it's a facial roller,

389
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,860
But why is Suga-chan here?

390
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,240
What happened? Why can't he be here?

391
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,850
His face is red from doing it too much

392
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,820
Will the next attempt succeed?!

393
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,820
Time for the 5th attempt!

394
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,350
It's the last one

395
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,750
Let's nail this

396
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,930
This time for sure

397
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,330
It'll be alright

398
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,330
It would be great to get it right away

399
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,480
If we did this right away...

400
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,480
Yeah we could've finished right away

401
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,280
He's in a great mood again

402
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,570
Sorry about that seriously

403
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,390
I'm not mad at all

404
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,130
I'm not mad AT ALL

405
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,550
Heading towards the ending, everything that happened,

406
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,650
All the hurdles and challenges, twists and turns,

407
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,530
That's just how life is,

408
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,400
Up until the end-

409
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,170
Let's do this

410
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,170
You're right

411
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,880
I didn't really have a punchline for that

412
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,660
It's a mat again...

413
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,310
Put your head here, lying on your back

414
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,530
If you could lay down

415
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,530
A lot of laying on my back...

416
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,000
You won't get hurt at all it's totally fine

417
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Let's go

418
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,220
Be careful

419
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,130
Sorry about this

420
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,260
Alright Shozo. Counting on you

421
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,040
This is perfect

422
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,910
There's gonna be no problems at all

423
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,350
Alright take it way, is here OK?

424
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,160
OK then, please begin!

425
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:12,800
Matsumoto-san completed the alley oop!

426
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,040
Thank goodness

427
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,040
Thank goodness

428
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,970
Maybe he's crying

429
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,970
Why is he crying? He should be happy

430
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,970
He should be happy

431
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,000
One of you pressed on my face

432
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,350
I couldn't breathe for a second

433
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,970
Was it you? Was it you?

434
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,970
Yes
