00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,840
Translation/Timing: eChie

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,850
Excuse me?

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,190
Oh dear..that was not even funny..

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,450
What the hell was that?

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,650
I am getting pissed.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,870
Darn it...weather forecast does not help at all.

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,290
Nah...to tell the truth,

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,590
I am in a little hurry, but I need to go to a party.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,800
All of a sudden, it started raining, right?

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,700
Well, I can't go to a party when I am like a wet mouse, right?

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,440
Now is not the time to be a "a tremendously
handsome guy in rain", right?

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,440
Why are you not laughing at all?

13
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,640
You better laugh.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,190
Anyway, I came here to purchase an umbrella today.

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,450
Every time I buy one,

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,620
I follow 3 rules.

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,620
Well...the first rule is..

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,620
the umbrella should be well made.

19
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,140
Secondly..it should be light.

20
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:57,890
and..

21
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,390
CHEAP!!

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,640
Damn..you should know it!

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,170
What kind of a sales man are you?

24
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,170
Is your head price-numb or something!?

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,090
Never mind, it's not important

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,420
You understand, right?

27
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,820
Please hurry and get me...well.. anything.

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,420
As I have not much time.

29
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,420
I gotta go soon. Make it quick!

30
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,670
Oh..it was great...it started just like a squall.

31
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,390
Give me a break.

32
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,540
yes yes yes...that's it.

33
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,200
Like this...and this...

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,370
Don tah-tah-tah don tah-tah-tah

35
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,370
Birds...birds.. birds...♪

36
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,520
Tancho-zuru is...♪

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,520
That's why Yako and Miku also are..

38
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,540
Even Nanko-san.

39
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,720
Hey Nanko-san!!

40
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,090
What the hell is that?

41
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,090
Who the hell..

42
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,350
Don't make me do such a stupid thing!

43
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,390
Why an axe!? That's wrong, right!?

44
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,340
Didn't I tell you what I came here for?

45
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,340
Please...

46
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,670
No wonder that you..eh..

47
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,770
your SM queen got tired of you.

48
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,270
Stand up...come on!

49
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,340
Get up!

50
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,190
I am telling you I have no time! Hurry!

51
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,320
I need to go to a party.

52
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,350
I don't care if you lay down like that!

53
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,890
Well...what you call it...you know..

54
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,470
Your recommendation is fine.

55
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,700
Your recommendation.

56
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,470
Even from this shelf is fine!

57
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,340
What?

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,240
Bring one soon!

59
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,240
Really..is he sane?

60
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,240
He is pissing me off.

61
00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:00,720
I am all alone..playing with shadows..Chan(Daddy) is..

62
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:08,970
not coming back yet...Chan...Chan...

63
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,870
Chan-to (Properly) do it!

64
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,340
Chan-to do it!!

65
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,100
You made me embarrassed by this stupid performance.

66
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,670
Stupid stupid and stupid.

67
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,640
As if it was a squall of stupids!

68
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,520
That's enough. This is not even a product.

69
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,690
You just took it from wherever. Did you think I didn't know?

70
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,190
This is wrong! Should be easier to put up.

71
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,090
Good umbrella is easy to put up.

72
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,320
Just bring me ONE!!

73
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,240
Hurry up!

74
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,940
I am not crying because I am sad..

75
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,650
I am rather happy..

76
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,520
Honey..Toshihiko-san did..

77
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,720
He called me Mother for the first time.

78
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,740
Toshihiko-san...Who the HELL IS IT!?

79
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,270
Who is Toshihiko-san?!

80
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,470
Da-da-da-dan Da-da-da-dan!

81
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,370
Entry number 1 Toshihiko-san!

82
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,940
You play Toshihiko-san! Why are you introducing?!

83
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,590
If both of us play moderator, there will be no Toshihiko-san!

84
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,190
You can understand, right?!

85
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,390
Give me a break..

86
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,890
Wrong...wrong...totally wrong!

87
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,370
How can I explain to you..

88
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,140
That's not it...you know?

89
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,840
Well...yes that's it..

90
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,300
Well, Umbrella is good when it's raining,
but it's a bother when sunny.

91
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,840
So I want something compact..

92
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,340
Kasa (Umbrella) is kind of Kasabaru (a hassle
to carry), Kasa is Kasabaru, isn't it?

93
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,190
I bet he is laughing his ass off.

94
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,790
Let me check out his face..

95
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,350
Bring me a folding umbrella!

96
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,920
HURRY UP!!

97
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,690
Folding umbrella!

98
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,790
Cut it out..I am pissed!

99
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,870
You can't sleep on the folded tatami mat ♪

100
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,190
That's why you can't relieve your tired body ♪

101
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,690
It's outtake!

102
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,390
This is not making any sense!

103
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,190
Can you just put it away?

104
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,770
If you didn't, we can't retake!

105
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,790
Nonsense!

106
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,570
Put it away, hurry!

107
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,770
We don't need that. Put it away.

108
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,100
Why can't you understand? Cut it out!

109
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,100
I am not here to play with you!

110
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,220
Right? You are just fooling around.

111
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,940
I really don't have time. Oh, well...please get me that.

112
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,420
The one..you can open with one touch of a button,

113
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,220
when you are carrying baggage.

114
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,490
Right? The one you can just open with one finger.

115
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,090
Hurry up and bring that for me.

116
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,790
YOU HURRY UP!

117
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,870
I'm gotta kill you if you don't rush.

118
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,690
What's wrong?!

119
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,270
Really..

120
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,670
Making me pissed.

121
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,940
Yes yes yes. That is it.

122
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,500
All you have to do is to click on the button!

123
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,040
Aren't I beautiful and sparkling?

124
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,670
I am an attractive woman.

125
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,420
Corner corner at the corner!

126
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,420
Loosen and tighten! Loosen and tighten!

127
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,690
Which is that!

128
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,440
YOU STUPID!

129
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
Go to the hell!
