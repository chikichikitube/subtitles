1
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,800
THIS PROGRAM IS THE RECORD
OF A "BATTLE" AMONGST COMEDIANS.

2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,730
IN ORDER TO PRESERVE QUALITY,
IT IS MOSTLY UNEDITED.

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,430
AS SUCH, VIEWERS MAY ENCOUNTER
EXPLICIT CONTENT.

4
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,030
What would it be like if you participated
as a player?

5
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,760
Well...

6
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,660
What do you think?

7
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,200
There's a certain element to consider,
that I can't really deny.

8
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,400
Them being polite to me
would interfere with the comedy.

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,530
That's pretty much unavoidable.

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,030
Now that I'm over 50 years old,

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,130
it's tough to work with young comedians
in their twenties and thirties.

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,200
I want to work with them,

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,260
but you can't tell if they really think
I'm funny, or if they're being polite.

14
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,660
That's the age I've reached.

15
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,130
That's hot.

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,700
That's hot.

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,560
Things like, "The mechanism of laughter."

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,330
And, "What is laughter?"

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
"What is it that we find truly funny?"

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,600
I think this program will make us consider
concepts like that.

21
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,800
I still haven't found answers
to questions like that myself.

22
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,530
-Jimmy Onishi!
-Damn!

23
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,030
You're out!

24
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,660
THE PREVIOUSLY ELIMINATED PLAYERS ARE:
JIMMY ONISHI & DIENOJI'S OHCHI

25
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,660
He let you go so many times.

26
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,130
That's still only two gone.

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,060
Two people out in one hour and a half.

28
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,300
-How's the pace?
-Pretty fast.

29
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,330
-Several of us have no more chances.
-You're right.

30
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,830
I have one chance left.

31
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,330
Losing Jimmy is huge.

32
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,630
Start.

33
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,700
It's a huge difference.

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,700
-He was dangerous.
-I'm going to smoke.

35
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,760
We have only eight left.

36
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,060
Kawahara keeps opening
new bottles of water.

37
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,760
Someone keeps taking mine.

38
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,360
I had one there, but...

39
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,700
you drank it, right?

40
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,760
Did you?

41
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,600
-Kawahara keeps opening new bottles.
-Fujimoto drinks from others' new bottles.

42
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,360
He's always been like that.

43
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,860
-Not always.
-I never realized that.

44
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,500
He never drinks from his own.

45
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,900
I wouldn't say that.

46
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,500
He looks strong.

47
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,630
-He looks like a demon.
-This is a strong one.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,330
-This one's definitely strong.
-Please don't hurt me again.

49
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,330
He can't breathe through his nose.

50
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,660
-Please don't hurt me.
-Look at his eyes.

51
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,330
They're squashed.

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,330
-I still hurt from that fall.
-Can he breathe through his nose?

53
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,660
His mouth's open.
He can't breathe otherwise.

54
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,060
-It's wide open.
-It's stuck open.

55
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,360
That is funny.

56
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,200
He is scary.

57
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,700
-The mask makes him do it.
-Give up?

58
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,600
Shut up. Shut up.

59
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,460
"Shut up"?

60
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,100
Give up?

61
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,400
Shut up!

62
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,060
Why is he saying, "Shut up"?

63
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,700
What a bad actor.

64
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,760
He's so bad at faking it.

65
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,300
My bone's broken.

66
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,960
It's broken.

67
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,400
My bone's broken.

68
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,760
Shall I make something to eat?

69
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,730
-You don't mind?
-Not at all.

70
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,260
-No, thanks.
-I watch the show Cooking Papa.

71
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,400
I said, "No."

72
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,230
-You can only make hamburgers, right?
-My dad's a sushi chef. I'll make sushi.

73
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,560
-No sushi, please.
-I don't know what sushi is.

74
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,830
Why not?

75
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,030
Bake me some beans.

76
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,800
You always cook beans, right?

77
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,500
-What?
-With ketchup and...

78
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,860
Oh, here's a new one.

79
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,760
I use salt and pepper...

80
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,960
Soy sauce,
and the flavor of the ingredients.

81
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,860
That's pretty funny.

82
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,930
-Give up?
-Shut up!

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,200
"Shut up"?

84
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,400
How cute.

85
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,760
Heart-shaped eyes.

86
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,360
-Sorry I didn't bring my American cape.
-Why don't you use mine?

87
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,230
The mouth part is so small.

88
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,530
You sure have a lot of masks.

89
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,400
-That's so cute.
-Yeah.

90
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,560
He's doing it again. The third time!

91
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,630
Give up?

92
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,830
Shut up.

93
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,000
-He broke my throat bone.
-How many throat bones do you have left?

94
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,860
-He's got so many masks. More coming?
-You're all out, right?

95
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,730
-We don't need any more.
-You're all out, right?

96
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,230
You keep eating that.

97
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,600
-He does.
-You like dumplings?

98
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,560
He likes bald, round things.

99
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,360
You like dipping them in sauce?

100
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,660
Kukky, he's back.

101
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,900
The masked man's here.

102
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,460
This wrestler is a funny one.

103
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,760
He's a funny one.

104
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,260
Not your typical wrestler.

105
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,600
-Does he really exist?
-Probably made it himself.

106
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,430
Is that really a lucha libre mask?

107
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,130
Does he really fight in Mexico?

108
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,460
What are the horns for?

109
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
That's intense.

110
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,030
-He's scary.
-Isn't he supposed to be zany?

111
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,930
Maybe he's just plain insane.

112
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,200
-They look alike.
-He's trying to say something.

113
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,260
What?

114
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,460
-What's this?
-"They're mother and child."

115
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,060
"They're mother and child"!

116
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,960
-That's Jimmy's line.
-It must be him.

117
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,630
-He's back.
-Jimmy came back.

118
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,030
-The next one is the last.
-Last one?

119
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,200
Last one.

120
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,460
That would have made me laugh.

121
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,560
What's up, Saito?

122
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,560
I can't stand the bugs.

123
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,730
They are gone.

124
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,460
Those bugs.

125
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,430
So that's what your scalp looks like wet.

126
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,660
There's more?

127
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,600
-We've had enough.
-That's a new mask.

128
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,460
Is it a different color?

129
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,730
It's a different color version of
the first one.

130
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,960
-It's a leopard pattern!
-Yeah, it is.

131
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,230
-It says, "M."
-What does that mean?

132
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,560
What does the "M" stand for?

133
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,160
"Masato." From the comedy group
The Bonchi.

134
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,630
The Bonchi.

135
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,330
Masato.

136
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,730
Masato doesn't wear masks.

137
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,530
When he eats lunch,
he does it really, really slowly.

138
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,730
Then he says, "Now I don't need to eat
three meals today."

139
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,730
He showed me the inside of his mouth once.

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,630
His tongue was tiny.

141
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,600
Really.

142
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,200
He has a really big mouth,
but his tongue is tiny.

143
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,400
That must be why he eats so slowly.

144
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,360
-Is his tongue short?
-It's not short.

145
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,560
It's a normal shape, it's just tiny.

146
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,160
I have a long tongue.

147
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,000
-Really?
-Yes.

148
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,230
I can stick it in my nostril.

149
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,430
Show us.

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,800
-That's super short.
-It doesn't reach at all.

151
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,500
Maybe you should aim for one nostril.
Not the middle.

152
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,400
Make your tongue longer,
or your top lip shorter.

153
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,860
Why did you lie? It doesn't reach at all.

154
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,530
-You must be too far away to see.
-I can see from here.

155
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,530
It's in my nostril.

156
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,530
Is it?

157
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,630
See, I wasn't lying.

158
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,460
-On closer inspection, it does reach.
-No, it doesn't.

159
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,660
It didn't reach.

160
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,860
-Anthony's been gone for a while.
-You're right.

161
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,600
Anthony, your seniors are waiting for you.

162
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,200
-Sorry.
-What are you doing?

163
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,530
-I had to wear something more comfortable.
-Going somewhere?

164
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,660
-You're looking fine.
-I didn't go out much this summer.

165
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,260
-He's mighty fine.
-Yeah.

166
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,360
-Let's brighten things up and play a game.
-Nice idea.

167
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,460
-Do you have one?
-I do.

168
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,500
We used to play it in the dressing rooms.
Can I take the mic off?

169
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,400
Sure.

170
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,300
-Should we do that too?
-No need.

171
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,000
-It's called "Analympics."
-"Analympics?"

172
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,230
It's a contest to see
who can show their anus the quickest.

173
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,530
I was the champion.

174
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,330
-Really.
-Wow.

175
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,660
I don't have any trademark gag to rely on.

176
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,130
I can't really think of
any great strategy.

177
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,560
So, I'm going to do what I used to do.

178
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,160
My seniors used to really laugh at
the silly things I did

179
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,360
when we were in the dressing rooms
at the comedy theater.

180
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,960
That's what
I'm planning to spring on them.

181
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,830
That's my only plan.

182
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,560
-First, you strip down to your underwear.
-Okay.

183
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
And then, the Analympics start.

184
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,160
-What cute underwear.
-They are.

185
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,430
Nice curves.

186
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,630
Can someone say, "Ready, go"?
You'll figure out the rules.

187
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,400
Here we go.

188
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,400
Ready, go!

189
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,160
Wait. I saw toilet paper...

190
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,330
Seriously. Stop being an idiot.

191
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,330
-Toilet paper?
-You have toilet paper stuck on your hole.

192
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,000
-No way!
-You do!

193
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,230
You didn't just show your anus.
You showed toilet paper crumbs, too.

194
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,400
-You had tons.
-It looked like termites.

195
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,860
-No way!
-I thought you had termites.

196
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,660
That is so embarrassing!

197
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,330
Kukky.

198
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,400
Hachimitsu.

199
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,700
-Saito.
-No way!

200
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,530
Let's take another look.

201
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,930
Because there are so many of you,

202
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,800
I didn't catch everyone,
so let me watch it again.

203
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,260
Then I'll decide the color of your cards.

204
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,430
Ready, go!

205
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,860
Something's there!

206
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,230
Saito's laughing, right?

207
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,800
It's kind of hard to tell, right?

208
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,430
And then who's the other person?

209
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,400
-Hachimitsu.
-He laughed.

210
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,830
-He laughed.
-With his mouth open.

211
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,130
Ready, go!

212
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,500
See?

213
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,800
-Didn't I hold it in?
-Well, okay.

214
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Decision made.

215
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,060
So, Hachimitsu gets an orange card.

216
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,460
Kukky is on yellow now, right?

217
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,930
-I have one yellow card.
-Then you get orange!

218
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,800
Okay, Saito is safe this time!

219
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,860
Yes!

220
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,700
-That was close.
-You're lucky.

221
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,860
I didn't laugh.

222
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,230
I'm wondering whether that toilet paper
was part of Daisuke's plan or not.

223
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,230
Will you show me?

224
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,260
-You want to see?
-Why do you have toilet paper there?

225
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,100
That's the big question.

226
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Here we go.

227
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,160
Ready, go!

228
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,000
-He has toilet paper stuck on it.
-Why the hell is it there?

229
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,730
That would make anybody laugh.

230
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,760
That has to be the worst.

231
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,000
It's gross.

232
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,400
-The toilet paper part was embarrassing.
-That means you pooped today?

233
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,830
I did. Earlier.

234
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,360
Then you used a bidet, right?

235
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,300
I did.

236
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,830
The toilet paper absorbs the water.

237
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,930
From the bidet.

238
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,730
Then it sticks to your ass.

239
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,430
You end up with leftovers.

240
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,700
-That was gross.
-That was embarrassing.

241
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,830
-So, you were the quickest?
-Yeah. Want to try?

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,900
-I want to check for toilet paper first.
-It gets in the wrinkles.

243
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,130
Want me to check?

244
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,160
That's the only scary part.

245
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,700
How is it?

246
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,900
How was it?

247
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,330
-Any toilet paper?
-You have to tell him.

248
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,300
-Look at it.
-Take a proper look.

249
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,200
I have some? Seriously?

250
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,260
Saito, take a look for me.

251
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,560
-Saito.
-Is Saito out?

252
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,500
-Kubota!
-Do I have any?

253
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,230
-Kubota still has some lives.
-Check for him, Kubota.

254
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,260
-Those without penalty cards should look.
-Kubota, look!

255
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,360
Those without cards, take a look.

256
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,160
Look at him!

257
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,460
-I see some.
-Please show us properly. A bit more.

258
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,800
-Show us more.
-A bit more.

259
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,960
How's this?

260
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,260
You can't blame him.

261
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,360
Showing your ass is gross.

262
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,530
What was that?

263
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,030
Please wash your hands.

264
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,260
That hurt.

265
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,200
Did you stick a bunch of needles up there?

266
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,660
We wouldn't stick a bunch of needles
in your anus.

267
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,000
Only a bunch of needles can hurt
like that!

268
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,700
That's what I'm talking about!

269
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,660
That's what I'm talking about!

270
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,000
We can hear you.

271
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,430
My butthole really hurts.

272
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,200
Seriously.
That rubber is really strong.

273
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,100
He's washing his ass.

274
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,330
Don't do that in the kitchen!

275
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,130
-Don't do that in the kitchen.
-That's disgusting.

276
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,360
Don't touch my anus.

277
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,000
Fujimoto, that's not cool.

278
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,800
-That's not right.
-But he still has lots of toilet paper.

279
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,300
That was the most painful thing ever.

280
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,860
Hurts more than when
that 750 cc bike hit me.

281
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,030
What a liar.

282
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,230
Is it all gone?

283
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,900
-Wipe it off.
-Yeah, wipe it off for him.

284
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,600
Is it gone?
Do I still have some?

285
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,760
Remove it.

286
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,160
Blow on my ass.

287
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,200
Blow on it.

288
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,400
Huff on it. Puff on it.

289
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,160
Please huff on his ass.

290
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,300
You've come this far.
Go all the way.

291
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,330
Blow it. Huff and puff.

292
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,100
-Check it out, ya'll.
-Yo, yo.

293
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,030
Huff onto his anus, endlessly

294
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,830
Yeah, yeah
Huff on his anus

295
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,400
Huffin' on an anus

296
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,330
Yeah

297
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,100
Anus, flowing endlessly

298
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,630
-Something wrong?
-It's "Anus Flowing Endlessly."

299
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,660
What's wrong?

300
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,430
If you're going to blow, go for it.

301
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,360
Turning the pages of old photographs...

302
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,330
Anus flowing endlessly

303
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,760
Yeah, yeah

304
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,160
Anus, flowing endlessly

305
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,830
-Should we all try the Analympics?
-I think so.

306
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,500
Do you have any advice?

307
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,860
You have to be quick.

308
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,460
So... Let me take off the mic.

309
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,630
Take off your pants first,
or you'll be too slow.

310
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,030
-But you can leave your underwear on.
-Okay.

311
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,460
And it's easier to see with your top off.

312
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,100
And then...

313
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,260
Wait for the "Ready, go!"

314
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,830
-Don't touch until you hear "Ready, go!"
-Okay.

315
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,100
-Say it for me.
-Ready, go!

316
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,260
He's quick!

317
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's fast.

318
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,730
You do it that quickly?

319
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,360
-That was ultra fast.
-Want to try?

320
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,960
You were like a gunslinger.

321
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,930
-You move the cheek out of the way?
-That's right.

322
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,160
Give me a cue.

323
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,160
Ready, go!

324
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,130
Ta-da!

325
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,130
Ta-da!

326
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,860
Ta-da!

327
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,400
-You're next, Anthony.
-I want to see a worldly butt.

328
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,430
-Like a "World Expo"?
-A "World Anal."

329
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,360
He looks fast.

330
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,160
He does.

331
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,830
-I think he has potential.
-He's in another league.

332
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,860
Wow!

333
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,700
-Wow!
-He's hot.

334
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,530
-I can see it already.
-Are you ready?

335
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,760
-If he sits, we'll see it.
-Don't sit.

336
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,060
-Representing America!
-Ready, go!

337
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,530
What was that "ka-pht" sound?

338
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,230
You're laughing.

339
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,630
Did he take himself out?

340
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,400
You self-destructed?

341
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,030
Did he laugh?

342
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,360
Did Anthony laugh?

343
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,560
It was my "Anus Time" cheer.

344
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,830
Put it back.

345
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,200
We'll do it again.

346
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,000
-Do it with one hand.
-Okay.

347
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,230
Okay? Ready...

348
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,000
Go!

349
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,930
Too slow!

350
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,530
Do it like you're fighting for
the American flag.

351
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:25,560
And do it exactly when the clock hits
30 seconds.

352
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,930
Start the moment it counts down
to thirty.

353
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,030
Four seconds left.

354
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,030
Three...

355
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,400
Two...

356
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,860
I said, "With one hand."

357
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,160
Look how slow you were!
It's already 28 seconds!

358
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,930
-Maybe you should cheer yourself on.
-Say what you did before.

359
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,400
I think "USA" is better.

360
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,730
Go "USA"!

361
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,100
Drop your pants on "U."
Bend over on "S."

362
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,400
Show it on "A."

363
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,060
Ready, go!

364
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,000
-That was faster, but I want more.
-He's still a little out of sync.

365
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,500
-Good idea.
-USA.

366
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,060
USA...

367
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,830
Let's take a break.

368
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,230
Can I stop now?

369
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,360
Sorry.

370
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,130
Maybe I should tie it.

371
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
Will you help me tie this?

372
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,460
-That's scary.
-You're cutting off the blood.

373
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,500
Scary!

374
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,160
I can do "USA" with this!

375
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,830
I think it will work.

376
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,960
-Give me a cue, please.
-Ready, go!

377
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,260
Still not right?

378
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,830
Nice try.

379
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,430
More than two hours have passed.

380
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,430
That was quick.

381
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,960
-I'm getting hungry.
-Me, too.

382
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,660
Shall I cook something?

383
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,530
I want to eat sashimi.

384
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,630
-You want to eat sashimi?
-Yes, I do.

385
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,960
-You're gonna eat sashimi?
-There's some here.

386
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,930
-Sashimi?
-Nope. I can't eat sashimi.

387
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,300
Chopsticks, please.

388
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,200
-Anthony, what do your parents do?
-They own a sushi restaurant.

389
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,700
Sushi, right?
Why don't we get him to make us some?

390
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,160
But he was just touching near his anus.
Not with those fingers.

391
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,860
-You're right.
-Bad idea.

392
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,400
-He was touching around his anus.
-During the "USA" performance.

393
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,400
Wasn't "USA" my thing?

394
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,130
No, it wasn't.

395
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,800
All you've done is drink wine.

396
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,330
-In two hours and 15 minutes.
-And he wore that cheap school uniform.

397
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,260
With that knife stuck in his head.

398
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,000
We should share that properly.

399
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,960
What's wrong with you?

400
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,960
-What was that?
-I thought you didn't want any.

401
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,430
-Behave properly.
-Always looking out for yourself, eh?

402
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,960
Junior members shouldn't act like that.

403
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,260
You're right. That was out of line.

404
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,430
-Come here, Saito!
-Yes?

405
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
What's your problem?

406
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,460
That was wrong.

407
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,260
-That wasn't cool.
-I'm sorry.

408
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,430
-Behave properly. Open your mouth.
-What's this?

409
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,500
You know the hierarchy at Yoshimoto.
Seniors eat first, right?

410
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,560
Yes, sir.

411
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,500
-I'm sorry.
-Grit your teeth.

412
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,230
-Okay?
-Yes.

413
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,060
-You're working for Yoshimoto.
-I am.

414
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,230
Don't only serve yourself.

415
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,230
-Okay?
-Yes.

416
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,100
This is the career
you always dreamed of, right?

417
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,430
-Who did you aspire to become?
-That's enough.

418
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,000
Who was your hero?

419
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,460
Shingo Yanagisawa.

420
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,800
He's not with Yoshimoto.

421
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,830
-Sorry.
-Okay, that's enough.

422
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,730
-Is it less funny?
-Things are messy enough already.

423
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,100
-We have lots going on here.
-It's a real mess.

424
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,860
Fujimoto, that's not Scotch tape.
That's called glue.

425
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,960
-Does the uniform make it less funny?
-Are you listening?

426
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,060
The material on that is too thin.

427
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,460
It's too messy.

428
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,100
Can he eat like that?

429
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,900
-Wow!
-He did well.

430
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,960
He must be used to eating like that.

431
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,160
But he chews so loudly.

432
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,600
How vulgar.

433
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,460
-Hey!
-That's dangerous!

434
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,530
Spit it out!

435
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,500
-Spit it out.
-I want to spit, too...

436
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,760
Ptooey!

437
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,930
He said, "ptooey."

438
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,260
-Did you use Scotch tape to hold that up?
-What did you use?

439
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,430
-Glue.
-Oh, you used glue?

440
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,860
Remember his little pouch?
Glue must have been the only thing in it.

441
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,300
-Now it makes sense.
-All he brought was glue.

442
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,300
-Just glue.
-Amazing.

443
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,760
Things have calmed down, haven't they?

444
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,760
Yeah, sort of.

445
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
All right.

446
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,260
Where are you going, Kukky?

447
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,930
To the bathroom.

448
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,300
Excuse me.

449
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,830
I don't want to just sit and persevere,

450
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,630
waiting for the others to fail and leave.
I definitely don't want to win like that.

451
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,500
Ideally, I'd like to win the prize
by going on the offensive.

452
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,060
What should we do?
Should we have him make sushi?

453
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,760
-Yes.
-It's easier to eat, right?

454
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,500
-But everyone's been touching their anus.
-You're right.

455
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,500
We don't have any chopsticks.

456
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,660
Daisuke.

457
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,430
Kubota, don't look away.

458
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,200
No way. That was too much.

459
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,800
That one was too much.

460
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,730
-What is that?
-An Egg Tenga.

461
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,200
The masturbator?

462
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,000
That one was Daisuke.

463
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,930
Let's take a look.

464
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,760
He was actually out at this point already.

465
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,830
-Right, Daisuke?
-I knew I'd lost it already.

466
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,530
So, Daisuke gets an orange card!

467
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,230
-Last chance.
-Yep.

468
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,860
-Things could go down pretty fast now.
-I see.

469
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,660
And Jiro's mask is so long,
I can't tell whether he's laughing or not.

470
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,200
-That's not fair!
-You're right!

471
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,900
-What a cheat!
-That's not a nice strategy.

472
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,330
Kukky, stop using that.

473
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,130
The moment I realized what it was...

474
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,360
Just stop it.

475
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,700
-Sure, I'll leave it here.
-Egg Tenga...

476
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,260
-But that is amazing.
-It stretches so much.

477
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,000
That was scary.
You stayed behind me the whole time.

478
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,860
It's so noisy when you breathe.

479
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,300
Saito's on the move.

480
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,560
That's right.

481
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,460
Ow!

482
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,430
-Watch out for your hair.
-It's so sticky.

483
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,800
Your hair will get stuck.

484
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,060
Wow, this is so stretchy.

485
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,830
But be careful with your nails.
It rips easily.

486
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,560
This is amazing.

487
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,430
Breathe in first.

488
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,560
Take a deep breath.

489
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,260
Blow it up.

490
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,430
That's it.

491
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,960
-Awesome!
-Right?

492
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,660
-That's awesome.
-It is.

493
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,430
Lift your head up.

494
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,100
Yes, that's it.

495
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,430
You're really good at it.

496
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:07,730
He's good.

497
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,900
Watch out, Fujimoto.

498
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,060
You're close.

499
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,230
-Are they brothers?
-He can blow it so big.

500
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,060
That's scary!

501
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,460
-That's awesome.
-They're collaborating.

502
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,830
They're resonating.

503
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,260
Well done.

504
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,830
-You're good.
-Thank you.

505
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,100
Anybody want to try it?

506
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,630
-No, thanks.
-But...

507
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,730
It feels like you're in the ocean.

508
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,530
Or your mother's womb.

509
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,530
You hardly hear anything. Wanna try?

510
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,660
But your face might be too big.

511
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,760
-Don't do it.
-Enough already.

512
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,060
-We've had enough.
-Jiro, don't do it.

513
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,130
-Anthony, stop it.
-You guys look like a comic duo.

514
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,560
Oh, no.

515
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,360
You need to breathe first.

516
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,330
Breathe.

517
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,400
-It looks beautiful on Anthony.
-But I don't fit at all.

518
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,130
This is fun.

519
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,900
He's laughing.

520
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,660
Who laughed?

521
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,730
Who is this for?

522
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,030
I wonder.

523
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,800
Who is it?

524
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,800
-Jiro was laughing.
-He was.

525
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,130
Anthony, when you said, "This is fun,"
you smiled.

526
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,200
It was fun, but I didn't smile.

527
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,400
-He did.
-He was smiling.

528
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,100
He was trying to trick us.

529
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,560
-For real?
-Anthony...

530
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,230
Yellow.

531
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,900
You deserve it.

532
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,500
This is fun.

533
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,560
He's smiling.

534
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,900
You smiled, right?

535
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,160
That's exactly what everyone's trying
not to do.

536
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,300
-I know.
-How many hours have you been doing this?

537
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,930
Kubota keeps turning away.

538
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,960
He's sly.
He always swivels around.

539
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,230
I'm still embarrassed about my ass.
I'm going to have a shower.

540
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,800
My ass...

541
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,330
Want me to wash it?

542
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,430
Want me to remove it?

543
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,430
-No...
-I'll clean it for you.

544
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,230
We've known each other for ages.
We're cool with things like this.

545
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,630
Yeah, but you're still my senior.

546
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,130
How will you remove it?

547
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,660
Will you rip it out?

548
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,130
It's okay.
We've known each other for ages.

549
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,330
You don't have to.

550
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,930
-Want me to lube you up a bit first?
-That's a good idea.

551
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,860
-You don't have to.
-Hand soap will do.

552
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,530
I'll just take a shower.

553
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,300
-You don't have to go that far.
-I'll wash my ass quickly--

554
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,760
-We'll clean around your anus.
-Just like this--

555
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,530
-That won't work.
-Yes it will.

556
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,230
No, it's stuck inside.

557
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,700
Get the soap.

558
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,930
Of course, it'll come off.

559
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,700
-I'll be fine.
-We'll help.

560
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,160
We can't have you
feeling embarrassed anymore.

561
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,830
-You definitely need it done.
-I said I'll be fine.

562
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,300
Hey, don't tickle me.

563
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,300
-Tickling is off-limits.
-You're smiling.

564
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,560
I'm not. You shouldn't tickle.

565
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,560
You took so long, the soap's gone dry.

566
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,400
-You don't have to.
-I'll take care of it.

567
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,560
-Come on.
-But...

568
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,860
You've been depressed ever since
you realized you have toilet paper there.

569
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,060
I was embarrassed. But this is worse.
I'll take a shower.

570
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,260
Don't stare at him.

571
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,460
Put your hands down.

572
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Poke your ass up.

573
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,000
Doing it slowly is embarrassing.

574
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,930
And please don't go silent on me.

575
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,460
We're trying to figure out what this is.

576
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,830
Like I said, I'll just go take a shower.

577
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:46,000
-You don't have to go that far.
-It's not "that far."

578
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,930
To be honest, I've always dreamed of
removing toilet paper from your anus.

579
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,760
What?

580
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,830
-I think you should let him.
-Why?

581
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,630
-The timing's perfect.
-Make today special.

582
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,500
-"Make today special"?
-I want this.

583
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,300
I've been waiting for a moment like this
for so long.

584
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,300
It's a little embarrassing to tell you,
but it's true.

585
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,030
-He's such a kind man.
-Indeed.

586
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,730
This is so embarrassing.

587
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
-Would you? From both sides.
-Sure.

588
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,330
We should make it easier for Fujimoto.

589
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,830
-Need a cue?
-Here goes.

590
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,360
Do it slowly.

591
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,560
Ready, go. Slowly...

592
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,460
-There's so much toilet paper.
-There's a ton.

593
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,330
That's gotta make you squeamish.

594
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,930
Kubota, don't let go.

595
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,160
Don't let go!

596
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,260
Don't let go. I'm not finished!

597
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,400
-Never let go!
-Yes, sir.

598
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,760
Here, sir.

599
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,630
-Hm?
-You're laughing.

600
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,730
No, I'm not.

601
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,600
Both of you are laughing.

602
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,860
No, I'm not!

603
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,960
The two laughing men are at it.

604
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,360
He's removing it now!

605
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,200
He is. It's really working.

606
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,730
Is that a baby sardine?

607
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,260
It's not a baby sardine.

608
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,260
Gone?

609
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,800
All gone.

610
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,130
What was that sound?

611
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,460
Everything's fine.

612
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
No way.

613
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,330
Why didn't anybody laugh?

614
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,560
Hey...

615
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,500
What did you use on me?

616
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,760
What was that "phssst"?

617
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,330
That was terrifying.

618
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,800
Wait.

619
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,800
What the hell was that?

620
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,160
If it's me, I'm finished.

621
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,730
Daisuke and Saito!

622
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,160
A double elimination?

623
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,130
You had no more chances.

624
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,360
Wait. Fujimoto was laughing, too.

625
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,230
Everyone was laughing, Mr. Matsumoto.

626
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,860
I couldn't really see Fujimoto.

627
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,800
If he didn't see, that's that.

628
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,900
Others got off the hook for that earlier.

629
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,200
Let's look at Daisuke and Saito.

630
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,900
What was that sound?

631
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,600
Everything's fine.

632
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,900
Daisuke was...

633
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,030
Pretty much the whole time...

634
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,930
Look at that face.

635
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,800
Damn.

636
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,530
-So, that's it?
-That's it.

637
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
-Seriously?
-Saito and Daisuke...

638
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,200
You're out!

639
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,900
Well, it's like they all got to me.

640
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,360
But we do have to create
situations like that.

641
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,730
I was actually trying to fart.

642
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,700
But no farts came out.

643
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,230
I tried to pee,
but I couldn't do that, either.

644
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,960
To be honest,

645
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:30,460
I started to break when Kukky showed up
with that thing on.

646
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,200
I nearly lost it.

647
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,460
I really should have done something then.

648
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,260
But I was too passive. I was...

649
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
I let my guard down.

650
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,860
Well...

651
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,060
I knew it...

652
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,830
I shouldn't have actively participated
in a situation like that.

653
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,860
I mean, did you see
that toilet paper thing?

654
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,900
Just watching Fujimoto
trying not to laugh was intolerable.

655
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,030
You can't help but laugh
when someone tries not to.

656
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,800
My fate was sealed
the moment I stood there.

657
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,500
We still have three hours left.

658
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,900
Still only halfway.

659
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,930
Start!

660
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,330
Everyone's used up all their
prepared gags, right?

661
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,060
Our prepared stuff? Yeah.

662
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,800
Fujimoto, have you run out?

663
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,530
I'm not exactly out.

664
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,060
-This place is in such a mess.
-You're right.

665
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,360
-Can't we clean this up?
-Let's do it.

666
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,660
It's our first time in this area together.

667
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,030
-It is.
-You're right.

668
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,060
He has a kid?

669
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,160
I didn't know that.

670
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,560
Wasn't it funny when I did this?

671
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,630
You didn't do that.

672
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,730
-Ohchi did it.
-I made that.

673
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,400
-You didn't make it.
-I did.

674
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,030
You didn't make that.

675
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,700
What was that?

676
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,730
What the hell was that?

677
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,430
You said I didn't make it.

678
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,300
Because you didn't make it.

679
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,360
What else should I say?
You didn't make it.

680
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,200
-That was the simplest straight-man reply.
-Seriously?

681
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,660
But I did make this.

682
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,200
No, you didn't!

683
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,360
-You didn't shape it.
-It just broke.

684
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,430
What happened?

685
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,530
We have no idea.

686
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,830
What happened, Hachimitsu?

687
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,700
I guess I got tired.

688
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
-What happened?
-It hit me all at once.

689
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,560
Of course.

690
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,730
I'm gonna watch it again.
He shocked me, too.

691
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,860
That was such a cheerful laugh.

692
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,500
You didn't make that.

693
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:53,130
Hachimitsu, it's disappointing to see you
go out like this.

694
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,060
This is how it ends?

695
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,100
A little before it happened,

696
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,600
I'd lost my focus.

697
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,230
I couldn't get why Fujimoto was
so persistent about something so trivial.

698
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,660
I thought, "When you think about it,
I made that prop."

699
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,930
But he kept at it.

700
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,760
-He kept insisting.
-You didn't make it.

701
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,200
I wondered why he was so persistent
about something so trivial.

702
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:21,130
This Documental might be
even more of a mental game than I thought.

703
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,730
Watching Kawahara and Anthony
keeping their faces expressionless,

704
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,460
I have to wonder
what kind of nerves they have.

705
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,860
The fact they don't laugh at something
so funny makes me wonder,

706
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,260
"Is something wrong with these guys?"

707
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,830
-Remember, the prize is 10 million yen.
-It sure is.

708
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,130
It's 10 million yen!

709
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,500
But remembering that puts pressure on me.

710
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,730
-Stop mentioning that.
-What a prize!

711
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,460
-Please, stop that.
-Losing a million yen is a bigger deal.

712
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,160
If I lose it...

713
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,000
You're already thinking of losing.

714
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,930
I borrowed the money.

715
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,260
-From whom?
-Bike Kawasaki-Bike.

716
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,100
What? He had one million?

717
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,730
-No, he gave me 200,000.
-You borrowed here and there?

718
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,100
How about Kawahara?

719
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,030
I just happened to...

720
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,700
-I happened upon it.
-What does that mean?

721
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,030
Fujimoto, how did you get a million yen?

722
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,100
I used my savings.

723
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,230
Excuse me, can I have your autograph?

724
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
Your autograph.

725
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,630
Okay.

726
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,300
-As a group?
-What?

727
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Do you want us to write it as a group,
or one from each?

728
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,800
-One from each, so 10.
-That many?

729
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,000
Okay. Thank you.

730
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,000
Got a pen?

731
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,830
-I have one.
-Okay.

732
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,460
-Could everyone gather around?
-Here's your pen.

733
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,860
-That's a thin pen.
-Sorry.

734
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,600
Could you write, "Takeda Tetsuya"?

735
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,800
"Takeda Tetsuya."

736
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,460
-"Dear Takeda Tetsuya..."
-No, sign it as Takeda Tetsuya.

737
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,430
Please sign it as Takeda Tetsuya.

738
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,430
-Like this?
-Yes. As "Takeda Tetsuya."

739
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,360
TAKEDA...

740
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,500
How do you write "Tetsuya" in Kanji?

741
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,860
-Any way you like.
-But...

742
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,430
-Hiragana will do.
-Okay...

743
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,600
I prefer it that way.

744
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,160
-Like an autograph?
-It's fine like that.

745
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,500
Thanks. They'll be overjoyed to receive
Takeda Tetsuya's autograph.

746
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,700
But I'm not Takeda Tetsuya.

747
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,300
It's for a friend back home in Kansai.

748
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,930
-Could you address it to them?
-"Dear Friend Back in Kansai"?

749
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,160
No, "Dear Kansai-ite."

750
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,230
"Kansai..."

751
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,930
-"Kansai-ite."
-"Kansai..."

752
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,360
"Kansai-ite."

753
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,700
Great. Thank you so much.

754
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,030
No problem.

755
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,360
Who is this joke for?

756
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,900
Can I have your autograph?

757
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,260
Sure.

758
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,960
This is bothersome.
Could you just write it here?

759
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,230
Could you write it here?

760
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,900
-On your face?
-Yes, "Good luck."

761
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,060
Could you write, "Good luck"?

762
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,560
GOOD LUCK

763
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,700
Who is this for?

764
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,160
Thanks so much!

765
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,200
I'm a big fan of yours!

766
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,930
-Thanks.
-You know him?

767
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,330
Of course I do.

768
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,130
I've been a fan forever.

769
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
I'm not on TV that much.

770
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,860
You're Haruka Igawa, aren't you?
Haruka Igawa.

771
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,330
You're Haruka Igawa, right?

772
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,200
-Okay.
-Thanks.

773
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,300
Lastly, can I get your hand print?

774
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,600
If you don't mind.

775
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,960
-Do you have a print set?
-I'll go get it--

776
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,460
That's usually for sumo wrestlers.
Go find one.

777
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,230
You're not a sumo wrestler?

778
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,730
Can you pull your thing out for me?

779
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,700
I want to slap it here.

780
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,100
-What?
-Can I slap your thing here?

781
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,800
-You want a print of it?
-I do.

782
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,930
-You want a dick print?
-A peni-print.

783
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,930
-A peni-print.
-Penis?

784
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,400
I don't want to.

785
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,730
Please.

786
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,860
I can't do that.

787
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,130
Pretty please.

788
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,260
Do it for him. Then he'll leave.

789
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,460
-Just get it over and done with.
-I can't miss this opportunity.

790
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,160
You can leave your shirt on.

791
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,700
Sorry for the inconvenience.

792
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,760
I've never made a dick print before.

793
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,430
It's a "peni-print."

794
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,430
He already has three autographs.

795
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,530
Yes. I've got three.

796
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,500
Not many people give peni-prints, right?

797
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,330
So, can I take a print?

798
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,830
I really don't want to.

799
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,230
-Will you use the marker?
-Yes.

800
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,000
-You'll draw the ink onto it?
-Just the underside.

801
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,160
-Seriously...
-It won't take long.

802
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:20,900
Excuse me.

803
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,260
I won't be long.

804
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,060
-Sorry.
-Don't pull it.

805
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,460
Sorry. I won't be long.

806
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,960
That hurts?

807
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,760
Shall I bring a thicker marker?

808
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:35,030
Why is he doing it bit by bit,
line by line?

809
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,260
-You could do it yourself.
-Sorry.

810
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,160
How about using some soy sauce?

811
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,230
That'll work.

812
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,830
Dip it in soy sauce,
slap it on and get it done.

813
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,860
Sorry, but...

814
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,130
My parents own a sushi restaurant.

815
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,260
That gives more meaning to the soy sauce.

816
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,500
The gods will punish me.

817
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,030
I'll treasure the peni-print forever.
Sorry.

818
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,060
Let me dip it in.

819
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,760
Stop it, please!

820
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,160
-It'll be over quickly.
-Stop it, please!

821
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,630
Ready?

822
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,930
How is it?

823
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,000
Thanks so much!

824
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,700
Please look at this.

825
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,360
This is the worst!

826
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,560
I'm going home. Thanks so much!

827
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,230
That was scary.

828
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,600
Terrifying.

829
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,460
Kawahara, do you have any gags?

830
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,530
Yes, I do.

831
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,900
I've never seen yours.

832
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,060
Really?

833
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,830
-I do.
-You do?

834
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,400
Show me.

835
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:36,900
Okay.

836
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,930
-This one's new.
-Sounds good.

837
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,400
It's a greeting joke.

838
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,200
"It's very nice to muscle you."

839
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,360
My body's not quite there yet.

840
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,600
Don't show it, then.

841
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,260
I'm planning on working out.

842
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,660
Will you really work out?

843
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,900
Yes. After all, I have this joke.

844
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,330
The joke came first?

845
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:05,600
Regardless of which comes first,
isn't the quality of the joke...

846
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,830
a bit too low?

847
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,160
Shall I help you kill some time?

848
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,730
-Shall I do that popular thing?
-What?

849
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,100
The Pikotaro thing.

850
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,100
Pikotaro.

851
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,030
-Pikotaro.
-It's been trending.

852
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,700
He goes, "I have a pen..."

853
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:25,560
-I'll do an unfunny version of it.
-Huh?

854
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,400
-That sounds even better.
-May I?

855
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,100
Ba...

856
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,000
Nana...

857
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,500
Banana!

858
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,930
-He sure makes it unfunny.
-That's amazing.

859
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,830
He's been trying to spread this.

860
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,500
He makes it unfunny.

861
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,900
Then he says, "That gag's not funny."

862
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,100
B...

863
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,930
Oo...

864
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,760
Boobs!

865
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,760
Seriously, stop being such an idiot!

866
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,900
-Stop being such an idiot!
-You lost to Pikotaro?

867
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,100
What the hell was that?

868
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,800
-That wasn't even remotely funny.
-Not funny at all!

869
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,000
It wasn't funny at all!

870
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,130
I told you.

871
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,000
I'm lucky I've seen this before.

872
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,130
I warned you it's not funny.

873
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,100
-Well, I had no choice, right?
-Yeah.

874
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,030
But that really wasn't funny.

875
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,460
-I know. That's why I did it.
-Okay.

876
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,760
Did you really know it wasn't funny?

877
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,430
Of course. That's why--

878
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,200
-It's funny because it's not funny?
-That's why I did it.

879
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,030
Daikichi laughed so hard
when I showed him, he hit the floor.

880
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,530
I thought, "This will work."

881
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,360
Well, you can't help but laugh.

882
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,100
I had some close calls
from the very start.

883
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,800
I held on to it somehow, but in the end,
I just couldn't pull through.

884
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,830
Sometimes the least funny things
become the funniest.

885
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,130
Kubota hits the spot for me.

886
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:15,100
I knew I was in trouble the moment I saw
he was one of the members.

887
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,060
I think Kawahara hasn't shown
his true potential yet.

888
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:23,730
I look forward to seeing what
he does from here on.

889
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,400
NEXT EPISODE

890
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,500
SEASON 1 FINALE

891
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,660
Dodge-bee.

892
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,860
What the hell is that?
It's not dodgeball?

893
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:43,130
It's dodgeball using a Frisbee.

894
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,660
Dodge-bee is... A moth landed on my arm!

895
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,460
Why?

896
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:52,100
They're too soft. Isn't that hot?
