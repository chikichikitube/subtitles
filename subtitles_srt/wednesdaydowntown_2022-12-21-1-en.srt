00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,170
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,540
Today is an extra-long episode

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,310
Is it really good to add time for this?

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,920
It's good

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,870
Shortening its seems more appropriate

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's welcome the next presenter

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,270
That's the one, right?

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,150
It's Fujiwara!

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,180
Don't enter like Junji Takada

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,520
Today is a special episode

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,550
I'm going for it

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,620
You know what I mean

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,810
3 2 1

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,890
Not a theory!

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,330
How can we all say it together?

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,550
So hard to guess

17
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,490
You know it all, right?

18
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,700
It's this

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,230
MONSTER LOVE

20
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,470
I'm looking forward to it!

21
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,800
Very happy

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,480
This is the only project today!

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,570
Just this one

24
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,240
A very popular project!

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,100
Honestly, I really enjoy watching it

26
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,180
I'm just watching this and The 13 Lords of the Shogun

27
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,950
These two

28
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,240
They don't match

29
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,450
What else will be broken after breaking the cookies?

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,920
Nothing else

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,830
Here's a brief review

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:27,620
Kuro-chan has been living lives in Okinawa with a mix of women who like him and are just pretending to like him

33
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,900
Later, he found out that the ones pretending are doing it in the hopes of becoming idols

34
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,640
The three remaining individuals have now formed an idol group

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,450
The song is also very good

36
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,900
The song is so funky!
-Have you heard it already?

37
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,640
It's a popular type of song

38
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,150
I don't get it.
-Very trendy

39
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,290
So, although 3 people have debuted together

40
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,810
This project is, in the end, a love project for Kuro-chan

41
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,440
Indeed

42
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,770
So he'll now date each of them

43
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,460
Then confess to one of them

44
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,540
There is still 1 woman left that likes him

45
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,060
Michopa, what's up with that expression of yours?

46
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,420
Always this expression

47
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,530
What?

48
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,050
The difference with him is too large

49
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,690
Do you want to keep the persona?

50
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,360
It's ok to admit you like watching it

51
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,230
Yeah, Michopa
-There's no need to hide it

52
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,830
Be honest with yourself, you love to watch it

53
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,110
No, no, no

54
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,170
So let's get started, guys.
-Let's go!

55
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,470
Please take a look at the finale of Monster Love

56
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,540
It's fashionable!
-Yokohama?

57
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,560
I'm already pissed off just looking at him

58
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,920
Aki-kun!

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,420
I've been waiting for you.
-Miku

60
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,050
What do you want to do today?

61
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,790
Let's go to the planetarium

62
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,960
Oh, so romantic!

63
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,790
Well, i've always wanted to go

64
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,330
Let's hurry up and get over there.
-Go?

65
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,000
Let's go

66
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,970
It's here

67
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,150
Oooh wow, hand in hand

68
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,700
Wow, awesome!

69
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,700
Maybe Miku actually likes him?

70
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,940
Well, it seems pretty fashionable so i've always wanted to come

71
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,450
The most natural

72
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,120
Miku is very aggressive

73
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,440
Oh, awesome!

74
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,840
Did you forget about me, Miku?

75
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,280
I haven't forgotten

76
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,850
Really?

77
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,650
Yes, all I think about is Aki-kun every day

78
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,530
Holding hands?

79
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,920
I haven't seen a single person since I got back to Tokyo and I'm so lonely

80
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,150
So powerful

81
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,030
I'm the one who's lonely!

82
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,660
Finally we can date

83
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,930
If she's a fake then she's pretty impressive

84
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,410
I'd be surprised if she's lying

85
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,970
I like you

86
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,670
Me too

87
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:57,080
Now is the closest

88
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,160
So peaceful

89
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,450
Finally we can date

90
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:09,330
I'll fill up on happiness with Aki-kun while I can

91
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,590
What?

92
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,770
Then I also

93
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,120
If this is acting it's really good

94
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,390
It's really awesome

95
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,640
You can use my arm as a pillow

96
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,270
Really? I'm so happy

97
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,280
Really?

98
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,570
Is this real?

99
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,920
I've always wanted that

100
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,230
Is that Kuro-chan?

101
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,490
No, it's a full moon

102
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,320
I've always wanted to do the same

103
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,200
So close, so close, so close

104
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,170
Stop it!

105
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,470
Miku

106
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,630
This sound, why do you need to gasp

107
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,780
So powerful

108
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,320
Impressive

109
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,610
So happy

110
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,470
So erotic, really

111
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,810
Were you aroused?

112
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,480
Super aroused! Seriously

113
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,750
What a dirty room!

114
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,920
Straight up seducing me

115
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,000
Where is this place?

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,690
Pretty snazzy, huh?
-Yeah.

117
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,500
I wanted to come here, so I made a reservation

118
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,890
It's great

119
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,360
Cheers

120
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,880
Why does it have to be so fashionable?

121
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,400
Drinking a lot!

122
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:24,940
Tastes good

123
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,740
Yummy

124
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,910
But what I'm a little concerned about is

125
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,110
I haven't asked about Miku's previous relationships

126
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,580
What kind of love have you had before?

127
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,580
He cares

128
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,220
Hmm...

129
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,360
A little embarrassed to say

130
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,400
Almost all of the people I dated before were...

131
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,900
I got cheated on

132
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,570
Eh, why?

133
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,540
I guess my presence became too normal

134
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:08,580
So going after others was more exciting

135
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,580
The back of his head is really interesting

136
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,880
How did you find out he was cheating on you?

137
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,020
I had a bit of suspicion

138
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:22,130
But at that time I wanted to believe him

139
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,040
Don't eat pizza now!

140
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,050
Don't eat pizza!

141
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,990
Eating and drinking pizza

142
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,100
I guess he thought he wouldn't be shown

143
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,330
Don't eat it now!
-Listen well

144
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,000
Everyone thinks so...

145
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,440
He sent message saying, "I'm looking forward to tomorrow," but it was for someone else

146
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,150
I replied "Huh? We aren't meeting tomorrow, this is Miku..." like this

147
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,010
Don't eat it!

148
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,360
I realized becuase of this mistake

149
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,340
Also got a fork in his other hand

150
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,790
Probably underestimated me

151
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,810
At least look at her face

152
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,390
I'm not like that
-Yeah

153
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,290
Just had to say it

154
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:01,270
If I go out with Miku, I won't cheat

155
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,130
Has to say it
-Who'd want to cheat with you?

156
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,450
True

157
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,270
I know

158
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,540
Miku

159
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,810
Don't touch her!

160
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,190
Touching people without moving

161
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,850
Like you

162
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,560
Are you drunk? Your face is hot!

163
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,960
So happy, really happy

164
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,830
Soft and sticky, really cute

165
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,200
Smells so good
-Eh, it smells good?

166
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,670
Yeah

167
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,790
Like

168
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,810
Good morning
-Good morning, Mina

169
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,810
It's been a long time.
-Yeah

170
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,580
Today, because Kuro-chan said he likes "rock climbing"

171
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,750
I want to go to the place where you can do it

172
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,020
Have you ever done it?
-No

173
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,690
Bowling

174
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,860
Want to use the bowling pin?

175
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,860
Will it be hard?

176
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,580
Where is the bowling pin?

177
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,390
Ah, this is quite difficult

178
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,630
It's pretty scary

179
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,250
He does this a lot
-Really?

180
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,740
Seems so hard

181
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
Huh?

182
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,840
Wait, wait, wait

183
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,040
So high! Wait!

184
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,740
Ah wait, no

185
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,820
No rope

186
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,710
Mina wants to try it.
-Want to try?

187
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,410
Then you try

188
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,010
I'll do it, then

189
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,250
It's not that easy!

190
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,720
Cute

191
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,850
Put your hands here, your feet are free, right?

192
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,980
Seems pretty good at it

193
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,280
She's young, after all

194
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,850
Can you do it?

195
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,300
Eh? Eh?

196
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,500
Whoa, Mina is so good at this

197
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,970
Aren't I good? I guess I'm good at it

198
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,640
She's shown him up

199
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:48,640
Smiling as she went, so much energy!

200
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,870
So dirty!

201
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,210
Where does he usually sleep?

202
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,880
I was really happy!

203
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,940
Looks great
-Yeah

204
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,120
So fashionable, I want to take pictures

205
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,050
It'd be a shame not to

206
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,180
Let's take as shot together

207
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,020
Shoot

208
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,590
So natual

209
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,120
Ok, cheese!

210
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,960
Let's eat

211
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,430
So cute!

212
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,360
Have you joined any club activities?

213
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,330
Disney Club

214
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,600
Disney Club?
-Yeah

215
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,000
We all go to Disneyland together

216
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,400
And watch movies and stuff

217
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,140
What is the ratio of male to female students?

218
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,740
Uh, probably more men, I guess?

219
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,750
They're trying to pick up girls?

220
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

221
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,220
What would you do if you got hit on?

222
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,180
Getting worried

223
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,670
What are you talking about?

224
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,620
"I like Kuro-chan"

225
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,320
Will you say it? Will you say you like me?
-Is it better to keep it a secret?

226
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,720
That's fine, then

227
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,790
Is that OK?

228
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,100
So cute

229
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,950
Ginza

230
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,170
Kuro-chan

231
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,170
Ah Richi

232
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,670
It's been a long time since I've seen you.
-Long time no see

233
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,040
Where are we going?

234
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,510
There is a place I want to take Kuro-chan to

235
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,540
Hey wait, you brought a lot of things?

236
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,480
For the sauna

237
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait, you should have told me earlier
-Let's go to the sauna

238
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,050
You should have told me, I haven't brought anything

239
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,550
Sauna?

240
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,720
This place?
-Yeah

241
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,400
Going in together?

242
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,250
Super trendy, huh?

243
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,620
Not together, surely?

244
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,520
Very clean

245
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,490
You went to a sauna with Shoji, didn't you?

246
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,690
Rock bath

247
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,200
Oh, so awesome.
-Awesome!

248
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,630
Kind of nervous right, in this sort sauna with an erotic vibe
-Erotic sauna

249
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,700
I'll go change. See you later

250
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,670
Richi are you still not ready? So hot!

251
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,910
So hot, so hot on the back

252
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,510
I've been waiting for a long time.
-Richi

253
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,410
Ah

254
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,850
Different from usual

255
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,190
Stop staring!

256
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,750
Really?

257
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,090
Oh, awesome!

258
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,320
Indeed

259
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,120
It's like this...

260
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,510
No problem, right?

261
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,560
This sporty vibe is awesome

262
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,250
What "no problem"?

263
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,460
Really suits you

264
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,530
Ah, it's hot!

265
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,200
Wow, awesome

266
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,700
So, Richi, are you competing?

267
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,800
To go out first

268
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,620
Go out?

269
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,370
Who can stay longer?

270
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,070
That's right!

271
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,670
Ah, yes, yes, I got it wrong

272
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,110
Why do I have to say it again? Richi

273
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,630
You said it as if the first one out wins

274
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,880
Ah no no

275
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,820
The winner must fulfill one request

276
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,320
Absolutely cannot lose

277
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,320
Is that okay?
-Yes

278
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,890
That's it then

279
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,660
Shall we start right away?

280
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,160
Richi, start!

281
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,560
Okay, here we go

282
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,000
Ah, Richi, your face is sweating more than your body?

283
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,470
Wow, really?
-Yeah

284
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,460
Kuro-chan is so excited

285
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,770
I'm look forward to your makeup running

286
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,290
Why?

287
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,440
What'll it look like?

288
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,070
So disgusting

289
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,610
So hot, so hot...

290
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,000
What are you looking forward to?

291
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,180
It's not working anymore, right?

292
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,630
Hurry up and get out!

293
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,380
So hot, so hot...

294
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,120
Such a classic play

295
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,990
It's...it's not working. It's not working

296
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,170
Like the old skit from The Drifters

297
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,920
It's hot! It's hot!

298
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,980
This is what you do as a comedian

299
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,660
Win!

300
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,390
Richi laughs very happily

301
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,130
I didn't see that kind of smile in Okinawa

302
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,370
Seeing Richi smiling so happily

303
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,940
Made me like her even more

304
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,900
The sauna is great

305
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,270
Yes, so happy-

306
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,740
We have a bet, right?
-What?

307
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,440
Hmm?

308
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,310
Well, what did you say?

309
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,410
Eh?

310
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,140
Don't you remember?

311
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,450
What?

312
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,250
The winner gets one request

313
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,290
Have you thought about it already?

314
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,920
I have always wanted to ask you for something

315
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,830
Me?
-Yes, a request

316
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,460
Request... i'll do whatever I can

317
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,990
You have a request for Kuro-chan?

318
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,520
I want to know your contact information

319
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,870
Ah, yes

320
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,910
Then let's trade.
-Oh, that's great

321
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,370
Great!

322
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,340
Can I have the queen's

323
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,250
Let's send messages every day!
-Hmm

324
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,620
Queen?

325
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,120
Then, Richi, grill to your heart's content.
-Awesome

326
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,190
Wow, look's great!

327
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,970
He's watching!
-Her mouth

328
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,330
Mmmm, so soft

329
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,270
Is he looking inside again?

330
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,730
He's looking

331
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,260
Pretending to be eating, but actually peeking

332
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,430
Eating with Richi makes the food even more delicious

333
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,070
Yeah, everything's delicious if you eat with someone you like

334
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,480
You're a good talker!

335
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,170
Has Richi taken classes recently?

336
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,780
Singing

337
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,510
And dance with everyone

338
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,220
How to put it? The last time I saw you

339
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,190
The recording?
-Yeah

340
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,220
I was just focused on producing

341
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,190
That day was super scary

342
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,860
Scary?

343
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,700
The feeling of "Producer Kuro-chan"

344
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,360
Kuro-chan-san

345
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,030
Don't say it like Ms. Agnes Chan

346
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,570
It was that kind of feeling

347
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,710
Ignored

348
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
So I was very nervous before the meeting today

349
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,880
Completely ignored

350
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,670
Right now, completely

351
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,180
I just want to find the girl who liked me in Okinawa

352
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,780
I really like Richi

353
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,950
But the thought of you saying "like" to everyone is...

354
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,560
Yeah, he's said it to everyone

355
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,020
Feels kind of weightless

356
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,790
It doesn't have any weight?
-Yeah

357
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,760
If Kuro-chan likes everyone

358
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,370
And you've said "I genuinely want to find someone and be together with them"

359
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,900
Does that mean that you'd go out with anyone

360
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,710
No

361
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:29,110
To think that two people other than me would also date Kuro-chan like this

362
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,620
It's even more intense than that

363
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,450
It's a bit worrying

364
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,440
Clinging to each other at the planetarium

365
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:41,060
I want to know who you care about the most

366
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,420
Thinking about it

367
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,030
It's really Richi

368
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,170
Really

369
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,550
It's hard to say

370
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,440
Really?

371
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,600
This guy is a liar!

372
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,280
Richi is not lying either, right?

373
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,410
No lies!

374
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,550
I believe in you!

375
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,960
A very angry face

376
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,550
Trust me

377
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,280
Ah, it's burnt. It's burnt

378
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,760
Now you've dated all 3 people

379
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,220
When will you confess?

380
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,890
About this

381
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,890
I've narrowed it down to 2 people

382
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,530
2 people?

383
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,460
Yeah

384
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,670
There's 1 person that is a wrong choice

385
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,970
But I haven't decided who to choose between the other two

386
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,040
I want to go out with these 2 people again

387
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,710
Then I can decide, is that OK?

388
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,980
Understood

389
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,880
By the way, who is the one who is eliminated?

390
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,180
Mina

391
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,750
Mina?
-Yes

392
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,020
If she is sincere, this is the end of the project

393
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,360
No problem. Absolutely not. Absolutely not

394
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,090
The other 2 people are genuine

395
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,060
I'll tell you now, then

396
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,630
Mina

397
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,530
Lied

398
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,670
I knew it, that one...

399
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,270
So scary

400
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,180
So close, so close...

401
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,580
I'm sorry, I'm a little...

402
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,250
I don't know if i'm happy or not, but I'm sorry

403
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,120
Didn't like her?

404
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,090
I've been lying

405
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,490
At that time in Okinawa

406
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,720
The buffalo time?

407
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,590
We were very close

408
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,090
Always holding hands

409
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,530
It was kind of...

410
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,070
Super... disgusting

411
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,970
That was close. That was close

412
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,870
If we hadn't dated, I would have thought it was Mina

413
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,740
That liked me

414
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,270
Is that right?

415
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,210
Dating is critical, absolutely

416
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,280
That... sorry

417
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,780
Please let me go on a real date with Miku and Richi!

418
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,110
Therefore, Mina is eliminated

419
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,110
What?

420
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,740
So, the remaining choices for Kuro-chan are Richi and Miku

421
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,810
He guessed correctly

422
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,940
Impressive

423
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,670
Or he actually saw through...
-Yeah

424
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,300
Awesome

425
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,130
Mina was pretending

426
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,770
Buffalo experience

427
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,940
Buffalo experience... no no

428
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,620
A buffalo experience would be pulling a cart while on all fours

429
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,190
This is called a buffalo experience

430
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,150
What they did was a buffalo ride

431
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,130
It's not right

432
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,370
Yeah...
-Do we have to do this again?

433
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,560
That's not right...sorry
-I've learned

434
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,620
Please heat up the atmosphere at once
-No, no, no

435
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,300
So who, out of Richi and Miku, is sincere?

436
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,760
The planetarium

437
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,740
That part was quite impressive

438
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,240
So I think its Miku

439
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,850
Quite intimate

440
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,170
It's hard to fake it...
-It can't be acting, right?

441
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,880
I think it is impossible to act it

442
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,140
So, you think Miku is sincere

443
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,940
I think it's Miku

444
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,020
It should be Miku, right?

445
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,670
But the kiss...

446
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,990
Richi

447
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,020
Miku just kissed him on the cheek

448
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,420
Richi actually kissed him

449
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,590
But either way they're both very hardworking

450
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,360
Don't say hardworking

451
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,620
It is hard work, though

452
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,090
But its to debut as an idol

453
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,830
They'll do anything

454
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,670
So bad, don't say that

455
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,310
No, not that they would do anything

456
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,310
Is that what being an idol is about?

457
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,980
No, no, no, it was to shut him up

458
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,480
I don't think so

459
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,650
Are all idols like this?
-To shut him up

460
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,670
What?

461
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,780
What he said is obvious

462
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,200
It's so comfortable.
-The view is great too

463
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,200
What do you think?

464
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,840
Delicious

465
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,480
That's good. Give me a bite too

466
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,690
Ok

467
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,770
Eat up!

468
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,910
Don't breathe!

469
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,390
It's delicious!

470
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,160
It's obviously a matcha cake, but the cheese flavor is also very strong

471
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,260
Yes, it is obviously a matcha cake, but the cheese flavor is also very strong

472
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,230
It also has the flavor of Richi~

473
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,540
He's mocking her

474
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,080
A cold smile

475
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,600
It also has the taste of Kuro-chan

476
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,400
Yes? Really?

477
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,940
Wait!

478
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,950
Are you thinking "what do I say now?"

479
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,010
Must be

480
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,510
A loss for words

481
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:31,880
After adding you on LINE, I'm super happy every day.
-Right?

482
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,620
Send LINE every day

483
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,560
Didn't Michopa announce her marriage?

484
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,890
At that time I was very shocked

485
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,660
We talked on LINE
-Yes

486
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,760
Do you remember?

487
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,680
I said "One less competitor"

488
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,170
You replied "great"

489
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,800
Seeing this reply

490
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:59,110
I decided that afterwards I liked Richopa instead of Michopa

491
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,010
Don't use my name to name someone else

492
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:07,480
Thanks to Richopa, I'm so energetic now

493
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,450
Richi may think this is just for the cameras

494
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,390
That I say these things

495
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,600
But I really mean everything I say

496
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,530
Really

497
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:26,200
I've been watching Wednesday Downtown

498
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,640
It's strange for me to say this

499
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,550
But i'm glad you liked me because of watching me

500
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,950
I really like Kuro-chan

501
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,350
And not just because of the program

502
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,350
So really

503
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,490
Now Kuro-chan is in front of me

504
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,290
I feel like i'm in a dream

505
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,630
You did love projects in the past

506
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:56,170
And have been pranked so many times

507
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:04,940
Every time I look watch, I think "I want to make him happy"

508
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,580
So this time

509
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,050
Very heartfelt

510
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,830
What?

511
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:17,890
So this time it is up to me to put an end to those pranks and make Kuro-chan happy

512
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,930
Awesome

513
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,900
Not even a single tear came out

514
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,400
Will this be the end of it?

515
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,620
What is this?

516
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,480
She's laughing

517
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,910
You're so caring, I've obviously been making you cry

518
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,580
Is she moved or just finds it funny?

519
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:46,980
If you say so, if you are not sincere, I will really storm out

520
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,390
If it's all a lie, i'll really storm out

521
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,060
"I'll really storm out"

522
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,830
Ah, sorry Richi, I forgot

523
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,130
I forgot this is about time together with Richi

524
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,260
Because Richi said, "I want a gift" in the past

525
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,670
I bought something

526
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,770
That face

527
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,840
Can I add one more request?

528
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,170
Add another one?
-Yeah

529
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,280
I want something I can carry with me

530
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,780
A gift from Kuro-chan

531
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,450
Jewelry?

532
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,780
No, anything is fine

533
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,020
Really, just something small is fine

534
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,320
That will make me think of Kuro-chan

535
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,230
Something that will make me feel like you're with me

536
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,670
I kept my promise!

537
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,050
What?

538
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,470
What a beautiful box

539
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,340
A present

540
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,570
A necklace

541
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,980
Eh?

542
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,780
An hourglass necklace

543
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,120
Why an hourglass?

544
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,170
That's good

545
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,260
Is it good?

546
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,520
For example, if you're angry

547
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,050
Or have a bad day

548
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,120
Can't wear this

549
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,820
No matter what, you can always go back

550
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,120
That's the meaning

551
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,530
That's true

552
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,350
Not happy at all

553
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,870
Also, later on

554
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,340
There may be quarrels and many things will happen

555
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:19,240
But, no matter what, we can always go back and return to the two people who like each other the most

556
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,980
We can fall in love again
-Yeah

557
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,890
Good taste

558
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,850
So happy

559
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,860
I especially like the park

560
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,370
It's more fun to come with you

561
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,730
Aki-kun, you said you wanted to eat my bento

562
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,000
So I made one

563
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,650
This girl is very much like true love

564
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,800
So cute!

565
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,520
Handmade bento

566
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,200
Happy, I'm so happy!

567
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,470
It might not taste good, though

568
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,110
Awesome

569
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,040
Cute, super cute!

570
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,650
This is painted on the cling film
-That's right

571
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,220
Small octopus sausage!
-Yes

572
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,250
I want to put MIKU's love into my body

573
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,660
Please put it in

574
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,190
What is this? Oh, plum?
-Yeah

575
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,740
Do you need to be so shocked?

576
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,130
Delicious

577
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,260
Due to plum

578
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,900
It's good.
-Great!

579
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,240
Do I have something stuck here?

580
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,890
Nothing is stuck, okay?

581
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,740
Stop it, please, it's disgusting

582
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,010
Take it off!

583
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,450
I can taste the taste of Miku's hands!

584
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,740
Everyone please watch quietly

585
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,650
"I can taste the taste of Miku's hands!"

586
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,020
He's playing dumb

587
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,020
In fact, there is nothing

588
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,320
I can taste the taste of Miku's hands!

589
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,230
Tasted Miku's hands!

590
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,090
Very funny

591
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,460
She's laughing

592
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,600
So cute

593
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,660
Laughing though, right?

594
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:52,540
So happy, this is happiness, right?

595
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,930
If they like each other, then its ok, right?

596
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,770
I have something I want to ask

597
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,040
If they like each other...
-That's right

598
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:05,020
My principle is not to fall in love with idols

599
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,870
He's said it before

600
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,220
If I ask you not to be an idol, will you give it up?

601
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,880
Yes, what are you going to do?

602
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,060
I'll give up if you want me to

603
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,860
Thank you

604
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,520
Don't laugh, Matsumoto

605
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,630
You're not supposed to laugh at this part

606
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,330
Then I'm relieved

607
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,270
Great!

608
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,840
I really can't fall in love with idols

609
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,210
I can't lie to myself

610
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,080
I like you

611
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,680
So I just want you to be mine alone

612
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,120
Ok

613
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,030
Isn't it better to support her dream?

614
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,060
I like your honesty

615
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,800
Impressive

616
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,570
Miku Miku

617
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,230
Then you'll be just mine
-Yes

618
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,930
Gross

619
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,100
I already am

620
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,970
Me too

621
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,420
Its love, right?

622
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,780
That hurts!

623
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,410
Ouch!

624
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,080
What?

625
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,420
Who?

626
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,450
You scared me to death
-Long time no see

627
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,990
Long time no see indeed

628
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,260
What did you just do? It hurts!

629
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,120
How are you? It's been a long time.
-Yes, i'm good

630
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,930
I need your help buying something

631
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,860
What? So sudden?

632
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,730
Have you got a girl you like again?

633
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,630
Bingo

634
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,330
Want to buy another pendant box?

635
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,870
I'm not buying that.
-You're not?

636
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,000
Come, come, let's go

637
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,510
Please, help me choose

638
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,400
Just follow the trend of this action down

639
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,080
Hello

640
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,050
Hello

641
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,010
The seniors

642
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,640
The MONSTER IDOL members

643
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:59,730
AiKA·THE·SPY

644
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:59,730
KAEDE PHOENiX

645
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:59,730
NAO·OF·NAO

646
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,830
First meeting

647
00:26:54,830 --> 00:27:01,690
We are Mameshiba no Taigun

648
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,700
I really like you

649
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,310
Really? That's a great thing to say

650
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,140
I really like you
-Really?

651
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,640
Always listening and singing your songs

652
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,550
So happy

653
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:19,780
So nervous

654
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,320
So cute

655
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,250
So happy

656
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,920
Today is the first meeting

657
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,030
A little nervous

658
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,930
Everyone is so cute

659
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,530
You are especially cute

660
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,970
Have you all been tortured by Kuro-chan?

661
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,950
All victims

662
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,370
We have had a lot of interactions with him

663
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,250
Good way to put it

664
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:52,180
Do you the 3 of you really like Kuro-cha?

665
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,620
Some do

666
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,850
Do you all know?

667
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,090
No
-You don't?

668
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,560
Really?

669
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:04,230
By the way, does his mouth stink?

670
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,850
What a question?

671
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,300
Really stinks

672
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,170
It stinks, doesn't it?

673
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,230
Seems like I'm the only one who thinks it stinks

674
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,980
If it stinks, say it stinks

675
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,570
You really don't think it stinks?

676
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,640
Doesn't stink at all...

677
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,710
Did you get up close?
-Yes

678
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,840
I kissed his face

679
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,300
A shriek of terror

680
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,820
Kissed his face?

681
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,120
Eh? The mouth... not there, right?

682
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,320
I have

683
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,160
Mouth-to-mouth? Mouth-to-mouth?

684
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,160
They're all so surprised

685
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,000
Unimaginable
-Yeah

686
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,800
Was it difficult?

687
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,630
Difficult

688
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,210
"Was it difficult?"

689
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,970
But it might also be because you like him
-Yeah

690
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,310
Really? I'm so curious

691
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,420
Here here here

692
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,870
Engagement rings

693
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,410
What kind of girl is she?

694
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,680
Want to see?
-Yes

695
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,390
Her

696
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,450
And her

697
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,520
And? What?

698
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,960
2 people again?

699
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,830
Don't say "again."
-Two people again?

700
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,500
I'm torn.
-What about the ring?

701
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,170
You buying two?

702
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,200
No, no, it's for one person

703
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,840
They are quite familiar with each other

704
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,570
Yes, indeed. Kicked him when she saw him

705
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,580
What to do, seriously

706
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,010
Who should I give it to?

707
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,610
Which one do you think is better?
-I like this 310,000 one

708
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,610
※Just under $2500

709
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,950
Why? Why this?

710
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,090
Because it's shiny

711
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,460
Yes, 319,000 yen

712
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,220
Okay, then I've decided

713
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,990
It's expensive

714
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,290
I want the simple one

715
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:39,620
※Just over $2600

716
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,740
It's 340,000

717
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,730
Are you not satisfied?

718
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:46,800
You were the one who said you wanted my advice

719
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,970
This is the case, the final decision needs to be made by me

720
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,840
So which girl are you giving it to?

721
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,250
Have you decided?

722
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,140
I haven't decided yet

723
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,510
To be honest, I'm struggling

724
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,680
Have you decided who to confess your love to?

725
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,020
So dirty

726
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:11,050
Yes, i've decided

727
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,260
But it is difficult

728
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:20,930
I've been wondering who's real and who's not

729
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,700
But ultimately I have not decided by this standard

730
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,270
What do you mean?

731
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:32,180
I still want to choose to confess to the girl I like the most from the bottom of my heart

732
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:36,850
So, if she doesn't really like me after confession

733
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,880
I won't regret it either

734
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,520
I may have liked one more from the start

735
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,820
But I want them to know my true feelings

736
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,730
And for them to become my girlfriend

737
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,100
I see

738
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,930
An hourglass necklace

739
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,270
That can be reversed

740
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,800
Mikitty doesn't seem to like the necklace very much

741
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,030
It's a bit lame, isn't it?

742
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,490
No, no

743
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,010
Someone must like it

744
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,270
It's not the necklace's fault

745
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:11,140
Saying "you can turn back time" is the most lame thing

746
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,370
It's still lame!

747
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,150
No, I'm talking about Kuro-chan's taste.
-Yes, yes, yes

748
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:21,060
The girl made bento, I think maybe they were in Odaiba?

749
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:26,230
Them eating bento together, it really felt like love

750
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:29,000
It was tough to see anything else

751
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,260
But it's possible that the bento was prepared by the staff.
-No way!

752
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,590
Can you quit it with that sort of thing!?

753
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:40,980
Doing such a cute little rice ball, would such a nice thing come to this mind of this program's staff?

754
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,580
What?

755
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:50,240
But after all, it's handmade, so, when you compare the two, Miku is more attentive.
-True

756
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,360
This girl, the one that got the hourglass
-Richi

757
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,930
Just receiving

758
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,300
Maybe its not good to say it, but she didn't give anything

759
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,930
The girl did not do anything
-She did

760
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,800
Maybe that's a bad thing to say.
-Indeed

761
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:07,290
But I think it's good for Kuro-chan to choose the girl he likes

762
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,440
That's was good point at the end.
-That's the only thing that's good

763
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:14,240
I seem to be a little nervous

764
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,980
So much has happened

765
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:24,720
To be honest, I didn't want to say this but...

766
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,230
I am grateful to the program team

767
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,300
If the program team did not give me this opportunity

768
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:39,240
I may have never had the chance to find a girlfriend

769
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:51,780
It's thanks to Wednesday that i've been able to meet a girl I really like

770
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:56,090
Truthfully, I really appreciate it

771
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:04,230
No, no, we also hope you can confess and find a girlfriend successfully

772
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:11,770
So, Miku and Richi are both waiting for Kuro-chan

773
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,440
He'll choose one

774
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:24,150
Who will Kuro-chan meet?

775
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,260
A little nervous

776
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,880
Is it Miku?

777
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,990
I think it'll be Miku, seems that way

778
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,890
Hasn't his mouth been stinking for a bit too long?

779
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,230
From the start with Mameshiba no Taigun

780
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,190
The stench is very persistent

781
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:48,300
So, be careful
-I'm off

782
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,060
Go!

783
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,120
Go for it!

784
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,250
Wearing a hat now

785
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,350
Who was chosen?

786
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,270
Who is it?

787
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,920
I see...
-Richi

788
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:39,820
Did you wait long, cold?

789
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,730
You came
-Sorry

790
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,260
I thought you would go to Miku

791
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,540
Crying

792
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,360
Why? Why do you think so?

793
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,400
So happy

794
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,860
Poor thing

795
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:03,750
Miku, Kuro-chan went to Richi

796
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,980
Ok... ok

797
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,450
Ok

798
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:14,120
So that's it...

799
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,250
I don't understand, can't tell if its real or not

800
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,560
Both crying

801
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,630
Would you cry if you're lying?

802
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,770
Nothing can be done

803
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:35,280
I've worked hard

804
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,260
What does it mean?

805
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,050
I'm a little late

806
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,020
Sorry if it's cold

807
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,250
What are you talking about?

808
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,960
It's okay

809
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,350
She's wearing the necklace

810
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,730
Richi, are you happy to be an idol?

811
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,130
I'm happy

812
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,760
You're happy?
-Yeah

813
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,200
What are you practicing?

814
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,970
I see them both every day

815
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:10,880
We danced, practiced singing, ate together, and had a lot of fun

816
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,920
Wow, really wearing that lame thing

817
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,360
Not lame at all

818
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,920
All getting acquainted.
-Yeah

819
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:20,160
By the way, does you actually like Kuro-chan?

820
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,150
Does she?

821
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:26,160
In terms of Kuro-chan...

822
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:36,210
We've only known each other for 2 months

823
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:43,350
But it seems we have known each other for a long time

824
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,780
We have known each other since a long time ago

825
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,420
I feel so too

826
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,120
But for me

827
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:56,060
I've seen you on TV since about 5 years ago

828
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:02,830
At that time, I thought that you might live near me

829
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,840
And then every day, every day, I thought

830
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,140
Maybe I'll see Kuro-chan when I go out

831
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,560
Seems pretty real

832
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,180
So I was happy going out everyday

833
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,280
I've been excited to go out every day for the past 5 years

834
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,950
Looking forward to meeting Kuro-chan

835
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,610
Really?

836
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:30,530
That's how I suddenly found myself liking you

837
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:37,870
In my heart you have been by my side for 5 years

838
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,800
Really?

839
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,400
It started so long ago.
-Yes

840
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:48,080
So, that we can meet and talk like this

841
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,150
It always feels so incredible to me

842
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:56,790
Every time I meet with you, it feels like a dream

843
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:01,590
Do you really like Kuro-chan?

844
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:08,030
I do not really like Kuro-chan

845
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,870
That means...

846
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,170
Great acting

847
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,240
So you've been lying the whole time?

848
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:19,810
Yes, I've been lying

849
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,870
What's up with this kid!?

850
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,050
You've become an idol.
-Yeah

851
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,270
Her acting skills are too strong, right?

852
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:28,420
So why did you insist on lying?

853
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,150
That's amazing.
-Acting skills are too good

854
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:37,660
Initially the goal was to become an idol after being confessed to by Kuro-chan

855
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,700
So I've been trying to get Kuro-chan to confess to me as a goal

856
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:46,300
So I worked hard to reach this goal until the end

857
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,750
She's worked hard

858
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:58,250
I was determined to stay until the end to let Kuro-chan confess to me

859
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,750
I worked hard for my goal

860
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,970
That means

861
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:06,890
May I tell you what I think?

862
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,660
Yes

863
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:15,930
Richi, 2 months ago, you were 1 of 9 girls

864
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:20,270
From the very beginning I thought you were so cute

865
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,910
You reluctantly showed me the inside of your mouth

866
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,410
Made you feel embarrassed

867
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:35,920
After going to Okinawa to buy groceries, you said you didn't want me to think of you as a casual woman

868
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,490
It made me think "I want to protect you"

869
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:43,060
Since then, I thought about you a lot

870
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,270
Can't help but laugh at that line

871
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:48,130
I came here today

872
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:55,240
It's not to know if you really like me or if you're lying

873
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,810
Why I came...

874
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,780
True feelings

875
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,010
I am a person who always makes the wrong choice

876
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:10,150
My decisions never lead to anything good

877
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:14,360
I was nice to a girl, but she dumped me

878
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:26,940
But I now believe that this love of mine is real

879
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,210
I came here because of genuine feelings

880
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:38,820
You said you like me, and I really like you

881
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,650
This like of mine, this love

882
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,260
Don't laugh!

883
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:46,690
This is my final love

884
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,990
A little too long

885
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,790
Although I have no self-confidence

886
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,950
Say you like her, confess already!

887
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:52,800
Although I say a lot and get carried away

888
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,030
I still haven't had a girlfriend in ten years

889
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,370
I also almost do not know how to fall in love

890
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,440
I

891
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:12,920
The one in front of me, Richi, I like

892
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,890
If you are willing to accept this kind of me

893
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,860
Coming
-Here we go

894
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:25,160
Please go out with me

895
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,830
Please

896
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,760
She likes him, right?

897
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:36,670
Kuro-chan

898
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:41,910
First of all, thank you for your confession

899
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,290
What's going on?

900
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,170
What's going on?

901
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,290
But I want to confirm one thing

902
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,460
Confirm?

903
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:03,830
Do you have to give up being an idol to go out with Kuro-chan?

904
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,870
Here it is. Here's the problem

905
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,400
Eh...

906
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:18,150
Although I signed up because I like you

907
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,550
Eh?

908
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:27,890
I ended up becoming a member of the group

909
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:34,530
I've been surrounded by girls who wanted to become idols

910
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:37,700
I know they all took this opportunity very seriously

911
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:47,240
I feel bad for them that I am the one able to debut as an idol

912
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,650
So I decided to make a serious effort to be recognized by everyone

913
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:59,290
I've held on to the determination to practice being an idol with everyone

914
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,540
This is a good thing

915
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:03,460
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
-So

916
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:12,740
I want to be like you said, 3 people trying to work towards becoming leading idols

917
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:19,880
I want to work towards this goal

918
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,580
So I want to continue to be an idol

919
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,050
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

920
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,280
Wait...wait...what's going on?

921
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,250
Wait, can I confirm?

922
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:36,660
Do you like me, or have you been lying?

923
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:41,660
I signed up because I like you

924
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,400
Do you want to fall in love with Kuro-chan?

925
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:48,440
I really like him

926
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,410
Wait, wait, wait, why are you crying? Why are you crying?

927
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:55,180
Wait wait wait Richi, calm down, calm down

928
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,850
Tell yourself that!

929
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,050
Richi

930
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:00,320
I signed up because I like you

931
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:07,360
But I also always wanted to become an idol

932
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,230
Wait, wait, wait!

933
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:18,100
Although the plan was different, we are now idols

934
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

935
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,440
Suddenly... Richi, wait, that

936
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:26,080
Are you thinking straight right now?

937
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,010
Speak for yourself!

938
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:30,510
Cursing himself

939
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:33,020
You liked me from the beginning, right?

940
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,020
Yes

941
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,090
If you like me then that's enough

942
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,390
I know it's fun to be an idol

943
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:42,890
I know working hard will make you happy

944
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,960
But your fondness for me is true love, right?

945
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,030
You've worked hard because you like me, right?

946
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,030
Yes

947
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:56,110
Think about your first thoughts, your first feelings

948
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,710
Hey, staff, what's going on here?

949
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:00,290
Indeed, there is nothing wrong with it

950
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:01,110
Does this make sense?

951
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,180
It's weird!

952
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,420
She signed up because she liked me but this is the result? Do you think it is reasonable?

953
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,920
Don't you think it's outrageous?

954
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,650
Absolutely unreasonable

955
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,950
I can't do this

956
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:17,360
I came to erase the memories of heartache

957
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,630
Say something!

958
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,000
"Say something"
-There is nothing to say

959
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,240
Impossible to say

960
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:24,400
Richi this is wrong, its wrong

961
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:27,540
This, this, this

962
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,130
Scary

963
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,610
I bought a ring

964
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:33,010
This one I bought is the most expensive

965
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,150
I really like you

966
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,830
The price doesn't matter

967
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:39,580
I bought such an expensive one so that it can be used as a wedding ring

968
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,620
It cost 340,000. 340,000!

969
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:43,460
What are you saying it!

970
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,920
Much better than in MONSTER IDOL and MONSTER HOUSE

971
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,970
This love is completely different

972
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,830
That was like puppy love

973
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,960
With Richi...

974
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,800
I can't live without you

975
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:59,100
I understand, I understand, I know you have a dream

976
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,640
I, I really like you

977
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,770
Richi

978
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,880
You said it, you said it

979
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:11,910
It was you who said you didn't want to see me in pain

980
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,660
Can't stand to see it

981
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:18,920
That's why I said "I want to make you happy" in the cafe

982
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,520
Didn't you say so, Richi?

983
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:25,830
I took it all seriously

984
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,450
Don't give up

985
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:31,170
You're all I have. That's what I've always thought

986
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:35,270
I really I ah I really

987
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,920
Talking nonsense

988
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,610
I really love Richi

989
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:39,550
Now it's time to get down to business

990
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,340
Richi

991
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:43,980
Eh...

992
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,550
How...

993
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:48,850
How... how... how to do it?

994
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,190
He's broken

995
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:55,130
Scary!

996
00:46:54,660 --> 00:47:00,530
I really like... you

997
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:56,260
He's broken!

998
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,660
He's starting to laugh now

999
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,530
Parts are dropping out now

1000
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:05,170
Richi

1001
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:13,810
Richi

1002
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:22,220
Being an idol, or me, I want you to think clearly about which one you want

1003
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,030
So scary

1004
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:31,130
Really, I'm like a clown

1005
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:29,270
Emotions are out of control

1006
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:35,970
I have never liked a person so much

1007
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:43,210
The more I like someone, the more timid I become. I'm scared

1008
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:47,210
I don't know what to do anymore

1009
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,150
Because it's you I like so much

1010
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:53,750
I've never liked anyone this much

1011
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:02,590
Please give me a chance, Richi!

1012
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:05,730
Let me confess once more

1013
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:09,430
Think back again

1014
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,250
It's gone on long enough

1015
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:16,870
Turn the hourglass of the necklace upside down once more

1016
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,950
Here we go. Here comes the role of necklaces

1017
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:20,100
Turning back the clock
-Turn back the clock

1018
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:33,360
Let me confess once again

1019
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:42,230
You are the only one in my eyes

1020
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:47,240
You are the only one I like

1021
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:54,740
With me, such a lame me

1022
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:59,880
Please take this. Go out with me

1023
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,880
Please

1024
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,420
Please, Richi

1025
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:15,700
Sorry, I'm so torn

1026
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:19,640
Kuro-chan

1027
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,370
Please go out with me

1028
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:28,840
Seriously?

1029
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:34,580
Please go out with me

1030
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,320
Really?

1031
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,820
Really? Richi?

1032
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,150
Think again!
-No, no, no

1033
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,980
You're not lying to me, are you?

1034
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,910
Don't! Refuse!

1035
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,820
Please go out with me

1036
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,160
Richi

1037
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,840
No, right?

1038
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:53,110
RICHI says "Please go out with me, sorry I'm so torn"

1039
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,600
Calm down!
-Richi, calm down

1040
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:00,070
Sorry

1041
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:03,240
Richi, think again, Richi!

1042
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,810
Are you sure its okay?

1043
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,850
Sorry to make you cry

1044
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,520
I will always cherish you

1045
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,490
What are you doing?

1046
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,650
Scary scary scary

1047
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,610
Nothing like each other

1048
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,670
They like each other!

1049
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:29,910
It's horrible

1050
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:35,300
No, no, no. So scary.
Look at Richi's expression

1051
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,210
I'm not letting go

1052
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,360
Coming again
-From below again

1053
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,640
Another kiss from below
-It's coming again. It's coming again

1054
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,620
Here we go!

1055
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:48,220
How many times do you want to kiss. Hey, hey, hey
-No, no, no, no

1056
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,310
Still sticking out the tongue, also sticking out the tongue

1057
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:57,440
Look, look, look, look.
-It's too hard on my eye

1058
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,020
Don't do it

1059
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:01,530
RICHI is so happy!
-Enough, enough!

1060
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,710
You're mine. You're mine, Richi

1061
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,470
Really?

1062
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:10,530
Michopa, look at Kuro-chan's great expression!

1063
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:12,110
Richi, let me put the ring on your finger.
-Ok

1064
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,470
Seriously?
-Yes

1065
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,760
Probably also very torn

1066
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:22,090
The engagement ring is on the left hand. We're saving it for the wedding.
-Yes

1067
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:24,390
Please give me your right hand

1068
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,230
So cute, so beautiful

1069
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,800
It suits you

1070
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,840
Show me

1071
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:40,580
So great

1072
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:43,080
So beautiful

1073
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:48,420
So happy

1074
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:57,130
I've cried over so many things

1075
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,390
I love you

1076
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,480
Not finished

1077
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,770
Too much!

1078
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,880
Looks so happy

1079
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,980
I did it!

1080
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:22,080
Yes, 3rd time's the charm!

1081
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:27,420
Too good, too good, Richi, Richi

1082
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:27,330
Looks so happy

1083
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,230
You are mine

1084
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:31,830
So cute

1085
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,830
It's so cute, Richi

1086
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,670
You are mine!

1087
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:41,040
I'll never let you go

1088
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,380
Enough already!

1089
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:48,040
I was so panicked for a moment

1090
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:51,750
I thought you didn't want me anymore

1091
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,290
You're not going to change your mind again, are you?

1092
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:57,720
No

1093
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,860
Ah the sound!

1094
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,370
My mouth doesn't stink, right?

1095
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:21,180
It stinks a bit

1096
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:22,300
Spoken with great affection

1097
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,770
Enough!

1098
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,790
It doesn't stink!

1099
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:35,420
Everyone
-Really?

1100
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:41,780
It went well
-In summary, Kuro-chan and Richi are together

1101
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:45,460
That's great
-Congratulations!

1102
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,200
Well, good for them

1103
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,840
They've got everyone's blessing, right?

1104
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,640
Hamada's volume was really loud at the moment of confirming the relationship

1105
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:55,940
"Eh!?"

1106
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,710
Exceeded the volume of the "here are the results"

1107
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:59,620
It's really bigger than the "here are the results"

1108
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,620
It's the first time I've heard it louder than "here are the results"

1109
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,490
No, no, no.
-It was surprising

1110
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,580
Really surprising

1111
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,980
I really thought it would not work

1112
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,290
Kuro-chan's expressions were very interesting

1113
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,420
Too much kissing too

1114
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,620
The kissing was too much

1115
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,360
What was your reaction when kissing

1116
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,540
From below

1117
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,770
What was everyone's reaction? Unpleasant?

1118
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,300
These two

1119
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,770
Mikitty, Michopa and Hamada

1120
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,280
They kissed a little too much, right...
-It was too much

1121
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,980
My stomach's hurting watching it

1122
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,050
But its been a long road for him

1123
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:33,350
It's emotional that it's over right?

1124
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:37,050
Because the kisser is ugly, you don't want to see the kiss scene

1125
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,890
Now it is better not to say such things

1126
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:40,800
It's not that kind of time anymore
-It's not those times anymore

1127
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,560
But after the confession...

1128
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,560
If Kuro-chan is a handsome man, you'd love watching it

1129
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,930
But immediately after the successful confession, kissed

1130
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:50,670
So you're all disgusted

1131
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:54,730
That reflects badly on your worldview!

1132
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:55,200
What a pain

1133
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,640
You're all out of touch with the times

1134
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,570
It has nothing to do with whether Kuro-chan is ugly or not

1135
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:00,080
Personality
-Yes

1136
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,840
Seeing Kuro-chan like this

1137
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,480
It has nothing to do with whether he is a handsome man

1138
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,520
He just has a bad personality

1139
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,120
The bottom of the bottom of the bottom of garbage men

1140
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,450
Why is this happy ending getting such a bad response?

1141
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:14,860
The kiss at the beginning is not even a kiss

1142
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,130
Just biting lips, its gross

1143
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:20,160
Like a unicorn sucking on the sap

1144
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:22,300
Just say sucking the sap

1145
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,520
That's not going to happen, is it?

1146
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,910
Will the hourglass necklace be sold out from tomorrow?

1147
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:27,770
This is going to sell out!
-No way

1148
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:30,710
The same model as Kuro-chan's
-No way!

1149
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:34,510
Its sold out on Amazon

1150
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:36,460
Please buy it as soon as possible

1151
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,150
Production has been stopped.
-Production has not stopped

1152
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:41,780
This Christmas, get the hourglass necklace as Kuro-chan for a gift

1153
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:44,590
So, everyone has said so much already

1154
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,800
Let's have them both come out

1155
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,560
The couple, Kuro-chan and Richi, please come out

1156
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,200
Congratulations

1157
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,440
Congratulation
-Congratulations to everyone!

1158
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,370
Congratulations
-Thank you all

1159
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:05,270
Is it true?

1160
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:06,650
It's true.
-It's true

1161
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:09,540
That's great.
-That's great, Kuro-chan

1162
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,710
Really good

1163
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:13,150
Although it's great

1164
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:14,320
Do the women have to say such things?

1165
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,910
It's too much, isn't it?
-It's true, Hamada too

1166
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,460
No, you kissed too much

1167
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,890
Because I liked her so much, I just wanted to make sure

1168
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:24,790
Do you think it's OK?

1169
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:25,710
I was very happy

1170
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:26,560
Really?

1171
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:30,370
Richi, what do you think about what Mikitty just said?

1172
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:32,190
It's really outrageous.
-It's too much, right?

1173
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:35,520
Didn't think they'd come out

1174
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,790
What a mess!

1175
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:38,080
Mikitty, please apologize to Richi

1176
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,630
Apologize. Apologize to her first

1177
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:43,810
No, I'd rather bend than break

1178
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:45,380
You've gone too far

1179
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:48,250
I don't want to apologize against my will

1180
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,580
What do you think?

1181
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,690
I think it's too much...

1182
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,230
It's too much, isn't it?

1183
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:53,590
It's really too much

1184
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:55,290
"Richopa"

1185
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:56,730
Not happy to be called that, right?

1186
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:59,760
I really think of you as my greatest love rival

1187
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,110
No, no, you don't have to

1188
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:05,400
Then you win!

1189
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,730
Michopa also has her eyes on Kuro-chan

1190
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:09,890
Michopa has lost

1191
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,780
Don't say it, give me a break!

1192
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,020
You guys are good together. Really.
-Michopa, Michopa, Michopa. Sorry

1193
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:22,980
It's like a wedding reception!

1194
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,250
Don't you have anything to ask?

1195
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:28,290
How many dates have you had together since?

1196
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,790
Because it cannot be exposed

1197
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:33,660
So, we have to keep it secret until the show airs.
-Keep it a secret

1198
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,460
We haven't met up in public

1199
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:37,470
That means you went to Kuro-chan's dirty place?

1200
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:39,270
It's not dirty, it's just a lot of stuff

1201
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:39,830
It's just messy

1202
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:40,570
She'll help with the cleaning, right?

1203
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:42,440
From now on

1204
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,070
There will be various considerations and countermeasures, right?

1205
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:47,160
Did you go?
-Did you go to Kuro-chan's?

1206
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,090
Yes, I've been there.
-You've been

1207
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,250
After all, we are dating

1208
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,580
Stayed over?

1209
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,520
Not yet?
-Of course she has

1210
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,890
Of course

1211
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:00,020
Because we're dating!

1212
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,290
Indeed

1213
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:02,270
It's normal

1214
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,790
Normal

1215
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:06,860
Do you still think it's okay after going through all this?

1216
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,890
Yes, I like him even more

1217
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:12,570
Would you break up afterwards?

1218
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:14,170
What do you mean, Matsumoto?

1219
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:15,670
And this...?

1220
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:16,910
This?

1221
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,780
This thing

1222
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,520
It's okay to be with this thing after this experience?

1223
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,430
Yes

1224
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:30,540
Because the Wednesday team installed something in the bedroom and living room

1225
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,310
Camera, right?

1226
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:32,220
24-hour surveillance cameras

1227
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,520
It's still there

1228
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,680
So while I was thinking about alternatives

1229
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,290
But I think the first time must also be in bed

1230
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,100
What are you talking about...
-But the room has...

1231
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,050
24-hour surveillance cameras

1232
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:43,910
So I used tape to wrap the camera in a towel

1233
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:45,970
And that's how the night went

1234
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,740
After all, you're a couple

1235
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,010
Indeed

1236
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,950
After this episode airs, you'll start dating normally?

1237
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:00,350
Of course, we'll be dating like crazy

1238
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:01,580
Is it okay to be his girlfriend?

1239
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,590
It's okay to be pelted with stones, right?

1240
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:06,020
Remember to bring a helmet

1241
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,290
Even when walking outside there will be no pelting, it's fine

1242
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:12,810
Richi, do you know who the culprit of the cookie incident was?

1243
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,230
No, I don't know

1244
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:18,270
That episode hasn't been broadcast yet

1245
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:19,170
Didn't say?

1246
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:21,150
What do you mean you didn't say? That thing that everyone...

1247
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:22,920
The culprit who smashed the cookies to pieces was

1248
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,440
The Okinawa incident
-It's nobody's fault. It's nobody's fault

1249
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,800
I don't know

1250
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,780
Even if we find the culprit, what can we do?

1251
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:32,710
We went through it all together, everyone was sad

1252
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,660
No, the culprit has been found

1253
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:35,790
As a producer, these things happen

1254
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:37,110
No, we know who the culprit is

1255
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:38,320
You know best who the culprit is

1256
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,160
The day of the broadcast will also be exposed

1257
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,190
Eventually it will be exposed

1258
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:43,100
You'd better be honest with Richi

1259
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,060
The culprit who smashed the cookies to pieces was

1260
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,160
The offender is

1261
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,230
Miku

1262
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:52,770
Hey! What a piece of crap

1263
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:54,920
You're such a piece of crap

1264
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,640
Too disgusting

1265
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,990
Didn't Miku make it?

1266
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:01,570
It wasn't

1267
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:02,680
Don't lose your memory without permission!

1268
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,910
Do you really want it to be revealed?

1269
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:07,700
You have to say it

1270
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:12,230
There are many complex reasons for that incident

1271
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,100
I did it

1272
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:14,910
Eh...

1273
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,460
I did it. Oh, it was me

1274
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,120
So shocked

1275
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:19,890
Totally stunned

1276
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:21,010
The hot love has been dunked in cold water

1277
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:22,530
Lying to you, lying to you, lying to you

1278
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:23,970
It's not a lie!

1279
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:26,570
It was hard at that time, wasn't it?

1280
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:28,670
Very difficult

1281
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:30,380
No, no, no

1282
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,850
Made you look bad

1283
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:33,610
Made her look bad!

1284
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:34,720
Don't make people cry!

1285
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,560
But Richi is super cute when she cries

1286
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,330
No, don't say that either

1287
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:42,220
Because they are a couple

1288
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:46,690
Isn't Richi going to quit the group?

1289
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:48,160
Yes, that's right

1290
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,720
What do you think, Richi?

1291
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:56,520
I did come to this project at the beginning because I like Kuro-chan

1292
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,970
This goal or this dream has been achieved

1293
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:02,770
This point has been accepted

1294
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:04,880
So I'm quitting

1295
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,890
Want to quit?
-Yes

1296
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:08,770
If not

1297
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:13,810
It would be hard to get support as an idol while being Kuro-chan's girlfriend, right?

1298
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:17,020
That's what Kuro-chan thinks, right? That's what idols are all about

1299
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:19,730
I am trying to support her

1300
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:22,570
But idol's can't fall in love, this is an important thing

1301
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:25,430
So I weighed it out and wanted her to be my girlfriend instead

1302
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:29,200
So since Kuro-chan has a girlfriend now

1303
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,730
You are retiring from the entertainment industry

1304
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:33,030
Why? It's not right. It's not right

1305
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:34,810
You need to retire

1306
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:35,990
Don't say its great and it's a relief, Michopa

1307
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:37,270
Not so

1308
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:38,710
Not quitting?

1309
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:39,960
Not quitting

1310
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,650
I will continue as a member of Yasuda Dai Circus

1311
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:42,610
And incidentally, I'd like to mention

1312
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:48,780
We have a video of Richi talking to the other two members about this

1313
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,650
Being confessed to by Kuro-chan

1314
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:54,380
We've decided to date

1315
01:01:56,290 --> 01:02:00,620
Because of that choice, I can't continue with you

1316
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:08,900
Take a break?
-Yes

1317
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,870
This kid is amazing

1318
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:09,970
Take a break

1319
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:15,680
That...

1320
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,880
There is something I must report to the two of you

1321
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,850
What... what... is it bad?

1322
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:26,350
Being confessed to by Kuro-chan

1323
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:29,620
We've decided to date

1324
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,890
I didn't know!

1325
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:38,370
So Richi is the one that really liked Kuro-chan?

1326
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:40,100
I thought it was Miku

1327
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,640
No, I thought it was either of you

1328
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,570
Really?

1329
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:46,440
It was close. Almost got stolen

1330
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:48,510
Do you guys really think Kuro-chan is disgusting?

1331
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:50,780
Uh...

1332
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:53,620
My comments in the interviews were always "disgusting"

1333
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:55,320
I said "I'm trying so hard to act"

1334
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:56,790
I kissed him on the cheek

1335
01:02:56,790 --> 01:03:00,660
You're really strong. You don't even like him.
-And slept next to him

1336
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,520
I slept on his arm

1337
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,160
The person that likes him is still here, you know

1338
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:09,260
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry

1339
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:14,840
Does Richi hate me a little?

1340
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:17,140
Really super annoying

1341
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:21,140
You'd surely hate it, right? Doing those things to the person you like...

1342
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:24,780
Super jealous... I might be the most jealous of you

1343
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,920
Going after him in front of me the whole time

1344
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,050
It was impressive

1345
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,040
This girl is really impressive

1346
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:35,990
So, do you want to continue your idol career?

1347
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:40,700
I kept thinking about it when I was confessed to

1348
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,830
Ultimately, I chose Kuro-chan

1349
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:45,770
Really...?

1350
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:50,540
So I can't continue with the both of you

1351
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:53,510
Really? Decided?

1352
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:56,310
Was it your decision?

1353
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:58,580
Or was it a decision made only after being told by Kuro-chan?

1354
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:02,580
Kuro-chan kept saying "I won't date an idol"

1355
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,490
So this was the basis of the decision

1356
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:07,570
I think the final decision was Richi's

1357
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,260
But I think we need Richi

1358
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:16,200
If Kuro-chan confessed to me

1359
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:18,200
Although this is not a good approach

1360
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:21,800
Richi would have been able to stay in the group

1361
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,070
This is a huge opportunity

1362
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:28,110
And you've worked hard for this opportunity

1363
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,610
But I've given it a lot of thought

1364
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:36,120
Although only for a short period of time

1365
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:44,460
Being with the two of you

1366
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:48,360
I've really been happy every day

1367
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:53,970
Its thanks to the two of you that i've been able to work so hard

1368
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:57,370
It's hard to say but...

1369
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:59,710
Really thanks for everything

1370
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,850
Sad, right
-Sad but it ended well, at least

1371
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,930
That's what happened

1372
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:12,750
So, you two really are a couple

1373
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:15,360
Congratulations

1374
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,520
Thank you

1375
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:20,980
Kuro-chan's love is even stronger now

1376
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:23,110
Kuro-chan is crying

1377
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:24,720
I've just realized this sort of thing happened

1378
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,990
I didn't even know these three had talked about such topics

1379
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:29,840
This is the first time you saw it?

1380
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,740
I feel that I have brought a lot of pressure to these 3 people

1381
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:34,710
That's true

1382
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,380
You have put pressure on all the people of Japan

1383
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,350
It's not just about putting pressure on these 3 people

1384
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:41,150
More than 3 people?

1385
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:42,720
It is these 3 people who suffer the most

1386
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:46,100
Then, let's talk about this directly

1387
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:46,760
Eh?

1388
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,760
Let's get these two out on stage too

1389
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:03,480
You fooled me!

1390
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,440
What a great actor.
-Strong

1391
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,390
These 2 people worked hard to the end

1392
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:09,990
It's hard, isn't it?

1393
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:13,020
The buffalo, at that time

1394
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:14,490
Buffalo

1395
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:15,450
Holding hands...

1396
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:17,450
Buffalo experience

1397
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:18,800
No, no, no

1398
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:23,620
A buffalo experience is being on all fours dragging a plow

1399
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:27,100
The time you rode in the buffalo cart?

1400
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,520
At that time, we were holding hands

1401
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,630
Indeed
-Very close

1402
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:33,200
I felt sick to my stomach

1403
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,940
I can't believe you just said that

1404
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:38,730
Richi likes me

1405
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:39,710
She likes me

1406
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:40,980
Miku really worked hard!

1407
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,570
Can you cry on command?

1408
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:43,260
Tears were shed at once

1409
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:47,050
As a child, I was a child actor for a while

1410
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:48,340
Make an effort and you can cry

1411
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:50,620
Thinking about Kuro-chan makes it easy to cry?

1412
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:51,270
No not at all

1413
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:52,750
What was on your mind when you cried?

1414
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,760
Thinking of something like the death of grandpa

1415
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,760
What dead grandpa?

1416
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,530
Thinking of your grandpa can make you cry the most?

1417
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:00,430
You had to think about grandpa a lot

1418
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:03,260
I put my grandfather's memories over here

1419
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:05,370
Scary!

1420
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:10,000
They all really want Richi to stay in the group, right?

1421
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,170
Really want her to stay

1422
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:14,980
Want to go on as 3 people

1423
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:18,510
She was able to capture Kuro-chan's heart so well

1424
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,490
That means you have the potential to be an idol, right?

1425
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:22,590
Indeed, can capture the fans' hearts too

1426
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:24,350
That's right, it's definitely possible

1427
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:26,020
High potential

1428
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:30,880
Now it's a 2-person team. What should they do, Kuro-chan?

1429
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:37,630
Well, I also think just 2 people is not enough

1430
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:39,570
So we can host some auditions

1431
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:42,840
No, don't do it without permission

1432
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,910
Why?

1433
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:45,340
What is it? What is it?

1434
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:49,780
Downtown, can't I advertise here?

1435
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:50,370
On this show

1436
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:51,810
How about it?

1437
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:52,840
That's kinda annoying

1438
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,250
Why? No its not, right?

1439
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:58,090
I didn't expect Matsumoto to be so reluctant

1440
01:07:58,090 --> 01:07:59,350
Please, please, please!

1441
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:02,190
RICHI, help me out
-Why are you asking Richi?

1442
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:03,460
This group has nothing to do with her

1443
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:06,660
It's true.
-Because she's my girlfriend

1444
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,200
Ok its fine then I guess

1445
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,670
There you go.
-Good

1446
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:18,370
Please apply for the auditions!

1447
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:20,070
There we go

1448
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:21,340
Okay, thanks

1449
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:24,080
I didn't get cold feet, I just said the usual thing

1450
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:24,750
We know

1451
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,110
No one said anything

1452
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:27,350
You didn't play dumb either

1453
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:28,820
No, I'm not playing dumb

1454
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:30,850
Because no one will laugh

1455
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:32,030
It hurts to hear you say that

1456
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:34,460
Wow, so boring

1457
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:35,970
Really unfunny

1458
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:36,790
Super unfunny

1459
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,260
No one laughed

1460
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:41,000
How do you feel about your unfunny boyfriend?

1461
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,030
That's too harsh to ask

1462
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:45,470
Unfunny boyfriend

1463
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:47,540
Use the hourglass to rewind time a bit

1464
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,950
Rewind the time to the point where it wasn't lame

1465
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:51,200
Rewind it quickly

1466
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,520
Safe. We've gone back

1467
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,950
It's not safe at all

1468
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:56,050
What a convenient necklace

1469
01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:03,350
Although originally it was supposed to be these three

1470
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:09,710
The group will soon appear on the CDTV Special New Year Live Live special

1471
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:10,720
Awesome!

1472
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,560
Gaining momentum quickly!

1473
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:15,680
Just two people?

1474
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:21,060
No, Richi's idol activities have also been extended

1475
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:24,460
She will be a member until that point

1476
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:26,340
Three people are needed
-Great!

1477
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:31,360
So, this is the end of Kuro-chan's love story

1478
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,690
Yes, thank you all

1479
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:35,350
Your love story ending means...

1480
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:38,120
Officially graduating from Wednesday Downtown

1481
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,410
Graduation?
-Yeah

1482
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:40,620
Why? Why?

1483
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,000
I'm not graduating, the relationship has nothing to do with it

1484
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:43,530
Because

1485
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:45,960
No one is interested in your happiness

1486
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,230
Matsumoto! How could you?

1487
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:49,400
As Matsumoto said

1488
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,930
Messing up my private life?

1489
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:54,770
Can't you mess up my private life?

1490
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:56,800
Don't you hate it? Being filmed by the camera all the time

1491
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,310
The cameras installed in your place have all been removed

1492
01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:00,370
No, no, no. Please put them back

1493
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:01,740
Definitely better with a camera

1494
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:03,530
It's not better, Richi will come round

1495
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:04,970
It's okay, it's okay

1496
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:06,270
It's okay to be seen, right~?

1497
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:10,750
It's not okay.
-Definitely don't want to be filmed

1498
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,920
Richi, lets have hot pot

1499
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:17,990
Here's to Richi and Kuro-chan's first dinner at home

1500
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,060
Let me see your mouth

1501
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:27,000
Richi, lets have hot pot

1502
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,570
It's off, look!

1503
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:30,710
Very impressive, right? Be careful

1504
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:33,010
It is a compatible umbrella

1505
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,580
Like

1506
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:42,220
Sucked in, sucked in!

1507
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,290
Get on with it

1508
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,890
It's done!

1509
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:52,490
So here's to RICHI and Kuro's first dinner at home
-Cheers!

1510
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:56,860
It's so hot, it's hard to put your mouth down, help me blow

1511
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,170
You ate it!

1512
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:06,870
It's delicious

1513
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:09,280
Let me see your mouth

1514
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,650
Open up a bit

1515
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:15,580
More, more, more

1516
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:16,750
I see it, I see it

1517
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:18,320
Nice, nice!

1518
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:24,390
Bedtime, bedtime!

1519
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,730
Couple's clothes now

1520
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:27,330
Yes, it's the same

1521
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:32,330
I've really needed a pair of good pajamas, now i've got them!

1522
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,000
The pajamas are so cute

1523
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,440
Try the hood

1524
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:38,470
So cute!

1525
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:41,980
Eh? Super cute, right?

1526
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:44,080
Your's also has ears

1527
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,820
Cute

1528
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,460
We should always be together!

1529
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,840
Richi, let's sleep

1530
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:02,680
So soft, so soft

1531
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:03,880
Sort~

1532
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:09,230
Smells so good!

1533
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:13,330
Are you wearing perfume?
-No

1534
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:21,790
You know, i'm not actually Kuro-chan, I'm Bear-chan

1535
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:25,050
One word makes a difference

1536
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:39,930
So happy
-So happy

1537
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:41,930
