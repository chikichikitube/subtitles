4
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,040
Let's hear our first request.

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:12,580
Okay, the first person is Saneyoshi Sakuya, a 9 year old third grade elementary school student from Tokyo.

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,580
Ok.

7
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:21,200
"Dear Detectives, good evening. I've had a pet dog for 2 years at my house. Her name is Kinako.

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,080
Good evening.

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,830
Ok.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,080
How cute.

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,020
She has a light brown color that reminds me of sweet kinako (roasted soybean flour), so I gave her that cute name.

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,250
Nice, isn't it?

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,500
There's a neighborhood Obaa-chan that when she goes out,

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,420
she walks in front of our house and gives Kinako a treat. She cares so much about her.

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,540
But there is one problem, that Obaa-chan keeps calling her Tarou-chan.

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,070
Even though she's Kinako?

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,070
What, what, what?

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,920
My mother told her, "Her name isn't Tarou-chan, she's Kinako"

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,610
but next day, she continued saying "Tarou-chan, Tarou-chan" again.

20
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,330
Since I gave her that unique name, I wish that Obaa-chan would learn and use the name Kinako.

21
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,460
I get a little sad every time she gets it wrong,

22
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,000
so I want help to make her remember it in a gentle manner." That's the request.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,940
That's kind of a cute request.

24
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:18,770
Yes, it's very cute. This a request from 9 year old Sakuya. She's a very gentle girl, huh?

25
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,500
Yes.

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,690
Let's see if we succeeded in making Obaa-chan remember the dog's name with that same gentleness.

27
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,640
Please.

28
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,620
Here we go.

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,620
Please

30
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,840
Ah. She's barking.

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,230
Here she is. Kina-chan.

32
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,430
She's very watchful.

33
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,430
It's alright.

34
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,560
Kinako-chan?

35
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,800
That's probably because she's hearing a new type of human voice. (Joking about his own lisp.)

36
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,550
Hello.

37
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,310
Ah, hello there!

38
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,940
Hello!

39
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,540
Hello!

40
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,410
Sakuya?

41
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,140
Y-yes...

42
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,450
Nice to meet you.

43
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,760
I'm pretty sure you are a good person.

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,490
Why am I feeling like you are so gentle?

45
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,800
Thanks for the request.

46
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,250
Ok.

47
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,700
Can we talk a little?

48
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,880
Sure.

49
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,420
The Obaa-chan in our neighborhood keeps calling Kinako, Tarou-chan.

50
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,230
Since she's not a boy, I want her to call her Kinako.

51
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,030
That Obaa-chan comes here everyday?

52
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,790
She comes here almost everyday.

53
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,480
So she gets it wrong almost daily?

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,490
That's right.

55
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,420
I took a video.

56
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,590
You recorded a video?

57
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,550
Yes.

58
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,770
That's great.

59
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,780
That camera looks gentle too.

60
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,960
Can I see the video of the "Tarou Obaa-chan"?

61
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,110
Good morning!

62
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,830
Tarou-chan! Tarou-chan!

63
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,270
She appears suddenly and is greeting "Tarou-chan".

64
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,150
Good, good, good.

65
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,560
Here she comes.

66
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,950
Tarou-chan!

67
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,090
Kinako is so excited.

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,090
Tarou-chan!

69
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,180
Oh. She's calling her Tarou-chan.

70
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,040
That's how it is.

71
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,910
She's calling her Tarou-chan.

72
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,590
You're so lively. Liveliness is very important!

73
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,260
Kinako is so excited for that food.

74
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,260
Here you go!

75
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,260
What if grandma is actually a grandpa?

76
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,240
What if we're the ones who are actually wrong?

77
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,040
That's not it, right?

78
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:32,360
Oh you already eat it? You're so fast. Here you go!

79
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,880
She's treating her like a son.

80
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,820
There's no more. No more.

81
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:46,220
"Ah, I want it!". You can't say that. I don't have any more.

82
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,050
Maybe she had a dog in the past.

83
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,350
Oh, and the dog's name...

84
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,000
Maybe it was Tarou.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,920
I see. That could be it.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,920
That's a possibility.

87
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,940
Maybe she sees her old, beloved "Tarou" in Kinako...

88
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,250
See you later!

89
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,870
She's so cute.

90
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,230
She's leaving like she doesn't want to.

91
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,800
Makes me want to call her Kinako-chan instead.

92
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,410
So, she really believes the dog's name is Tarou.

93
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,920
I'm always wondering if I should correct her or not.

94
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,920
I see.

95
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,440
I understand your situation now. Correcting her feels difficult.

96
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,120
She's got a good spirit, right?

97
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,560
Her aura, yeah?

98
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,470
That's why I've been wondering how I could correct her without being rude.

99
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,050
Oh Director, that's what I call "tender village problems".

100
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,680
Let's try the "Kinako challenge".

101
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,510
Kinako challenge?

102
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,160
The nonchalant "Kinako challenge"

103
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,200
We've written Kinako.

104
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Strategy: Casually put it in her line of sight.

105
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,600
Usually there's nothing in that place right?

106
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,560
Since it's raining, I wonder if she'll come.

107
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,560
Yeah, will she come?

108
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,530
She hasn't come today?

109
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,350
It's 10:30.

110
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,880
She hasn't come yet.

111
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,520
So she didn't "early morning Tarou" yet?

112
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,750
10:40 a.m.

113
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,480
Hey! Tarou-chan!

114
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,660
She's come.

115
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,350
Why are you not barking? Because it rained?

116
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,900
Rain!

117
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,240
Obaa-chan is teaching Kinako about rain.

118
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:31,840
It rained!

119
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,990
It's rained.

120
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,720
What's wrong? Why are you not barking?

121
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,580
She didn't notice the paper.

122
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,210
Oh wow, she's at the perfect angle right now!

123
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,840
She's in the "Kinako angle"!

124
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,950
Is it tasty?

125
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,920
Please see it.

126
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,890
Obaa-chan is watching Kinako instead of "Kinako".

127
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,630
I don't have any more.

128
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,350
Obaa-chan, where are you going?

129
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,160
Obaa-chan? That's a fail.

130
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,710
Just a little more.

131
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,600
Wait, huh?

132
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,550
Obaa-chan?

133
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,480
Tarou-chan! Bye bye!

134
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,480
She didn't see it.

135
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,800
Bye bye. I'm leaving.

136
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,280
Cute.

137
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,280
I'm off!

138
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,280
So cute.

139
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,730
Kinako Challenge: Failed

140
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,730
Damn...

141
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,000
I have a suggestion, how about name her Tarou?

142
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,160
No way.

143
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,530
But she's a female.

144
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,960
How many times a day she comes here?

145
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,060
Usually twice.

146
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,030
2 times?

147
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,030
That's right.

148
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,880
First in the morning and in the afternoon on the way back home a second time.

149
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,770
A second time?

150
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,760
The "Kinako Challenge" has 1 more chance.

151
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,780
So this is our last chance.

152
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,530
Sakuya, do you have any ideas?

153
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:09,600
How about put a mic in her collar and someone talk through that? To make it as if Kinako is speaking.

154
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,400
Make Kinako talk?

155
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,720
Huh? Put a mic in her collar and...

156
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,860
Make her say "I'm not Tarou, I'm Kinako".

157
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:23,440
Since Obaa-chan likes Kinako, I think she will remember her name that way.

158
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,160
Ohhh...

159
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,160
I get it.

160
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,560
Because Obaa-chan always talks to Kinako, right?

161
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,820
She does.

162
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,800
If Tarou speaks in my voice, Obaa-chan will think "This dog is cursed."

163
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:46,640
Kinako looks like she's feeling our nervousness. Like "something is going to change today".

164
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,220
3:50 p.m.

165
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,420
Here she comes!

166
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,830
Oh, what's happened? Why you are in that location?

167
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,300
"What's happened?"

168
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,640
What's happened?

169
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,610
Obaa-chan.

170
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,090
Huh?

171
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,340
Hello.

172
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,340
What's happened?

173
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,330
Just basking in the sun.

174
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,960
Obaa-chan, come here.

175
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,970
Huh?

176
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,740
Obaa-chan can you hear me?

177
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,470
Obaa-chan, listen to me.

178
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,760
Obaa-chan.

179
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,180
Tarou-chan.

180
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,720
Obaa-chan.

181
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,150
Tarou-chan.

182
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,290
Me?

183
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,040
Tarou-chan.

184
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,030
I'm not Tarou, actually.

185
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,930
What's happened? Huh? What is it?

186
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,440
What is it?

187
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,440
Can you listen to me please?

188
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,460
I'm a girl called Kinako.

189
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,070
Really? What's that?

190
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,210
I'm not Tarou.

191
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,240
Can you call me Kinako from now on?

192
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,380
Huh, what?

193
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,600
Can you call me Kinako from now on?

194
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,660
Chisako?

195
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,600
Is that it?

196
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,910
Kinako!

197
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,170
Kinako-chan!

198
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,320
Yes, Kinako!

199
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,940
Ok, you're Kinako. You weren't Tarou. Now I know.

200
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,660
Kinako-chan!

201
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,870
Thanks! Call me by that name ok?

202
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,190
Yes, I will call you Kinako from now on.

203
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,240
Obaa-chan forgets things very fast you know.

204
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,710
So please do your best to not forget, ok?

205
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,330
I got it, I got it.

206
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,640
I'll write it in my notebook.

207
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,830
Kinako-chan, right? Got it, got it. Kinako-chan.

208
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,070
Yep, it's Kinako. Kinako.

209
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,620
You're called Kinako. I see. I see, I've got it. Got it.

210
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,490
See you later ok? Bye bye.

211
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,220
Bye bye.

212
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,320
Bye bye.

213
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,840
See you tomorrow.

214
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,160
See you!

215
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,720
See you later.

216
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,820
Alright, alright.

217
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,290
I hear talking from somewhere but where is it coming from?

218
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,360
Obaa-chan.

219
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,550
Hello.

220
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,150
Hello.

221
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,310
Obaa-chan.

222
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,970
Obaa-chan.

223
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,160
What, what, what? What is it?

224
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,030
Hello.

225
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,930
What is it?

226
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,930
Nice to meet you.

227
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,650
Yes, yes.

228
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,800
The dog is always happy to receive treats from you.

229
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,140
Yes.

230
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,130
Yes.

231
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,480
Really? I'm doing this without permission so maybe I shouldn't be.

232
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:02,280
They're happy that you always say "Tarou, Tarou" and dote on him, but

233
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,370
since her name is actually Kinako. So that...

234
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,760
Who did I hear it was Tarou from?

235
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,610
Yeah, who told you it was that?

236
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,360
Have you had a dog before?

237
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,070
Yes, I had an Akita dog.

238
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,050
What was his name?

239
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,050
What was it?

240
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,280
Was it Tarou?

241
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,040
It wasn't Tarou.

242
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,120
It wasn't even Tarou!

243
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
It wasn't Tarou.

244
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,480
It wasn't Tarou I think.

245
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,150
"You think". That's not clear either.

246
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,490
Obaa-chan, you've got to learn the dog's name. Have you memorized it?

247
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,110
Yes, I've got it.

248
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,600
What's her name?

249
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,640
It wasn't something like Sakura-chan...

250
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,630
You forget so quickly, Obaa-chan.

251
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,270
The next day.

252
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,360
Good morning! Kinako-chan! Kinako-chan!

253
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,820
Kinako-chan! Good morning! Good morning!

254
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,420
Good morning!

255
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,420
Kinako challenge: Successful!

256
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,420
Kinako-chan, here you go.

257
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,670
So cute.

258
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,320
Adorable.

259
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,560
I know.

260
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,010
That Obaa-chan is so cute.

261
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:22,320
Obaa-chan is really a good person, as you could see, that's why Sakuya was so resistant to correct her.

262
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,020
In the end, Obaa-chan's daughter came to see her and they came back together.

263
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,950
When she was asked to write the dog's name, she still wrote Chisako.

264
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,090
We were able to correct her though.

265
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:35,810
Cute.

266
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,220
Thanks for the assignment.

267
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,640
Wonderful.
