1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,990
"Are their hearts connected?" No Smartphones Meetup!

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,860
The theme; "An Oasis in the City"

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,070
Using the taxi, they head to a location they think fits the theme

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,380
Maybe we'll meet at Ueno Zoo

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,980
Very nice, this really is an oasis in the city

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,020
I told you right? They're idiots!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,090
Nobody met up with the first hint

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,760
Next, "A large pedestrian bridge"

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,380
Hey!! Who is it?

10
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:48,130
With this prompt, Matsumoto and Endo met up!

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,440
And meanwhile...

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,440
Is that Yama-chan? He's not stopping at all!

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,040
Is that guy for real?

14
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,810
A near miss!

15
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,240
There's 4 bridges here!

16
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,580
How many do you think we have?!

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,590
These are there current locations. How will this end?

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,330
subbed by senor_wristband

19
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,330

I've setup these accounts :)

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,070
I don't care about your appointment

21
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,070
C'mon, don't waste time on purpose

22
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:34,780
1 hour and 30 minutes since the start. Since they're all within 2km of each other, there's a good chance they'll meet!

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,040
What theme will make them meet up?

24
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,960
Nadai Fujisoba location (chain store)

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,200
No clue

26
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,510
This one is really hard

27
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,400
There ... was there one here?

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,930
I've got no clue!!

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,870
I don't really go to Fujisoba that often...

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,440
This is so hard

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,960
The first one that came to mind ...

32
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,380
... Is that one there

33
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,600
It totally stands out

34
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,220
It really does

35
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,490
But, it can't be here of course

36
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,520
They would expect you to leave Ueno?

37
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,520
Yes, yes yes

38
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,800
With that, he leaves Ueno

39
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,030
He relies on his memories of Fujisoba

40
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,380
Hey, do you know if that one is a Fujisoba?

41
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,870
That place near Bancho,

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,620
What street was it...

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,620
NTV Road?

44
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,310
Yeah, on NTV Road,

45
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,330
And everyone should know NTV Road,

46
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,330
Exactly,

47
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,400
They come there to record every week

48
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,270
Can we head to Bancho?

49
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:51,120
He decides on the store that might in Chiyoda, in front of the NTV studio

50
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,800
However, there is one concern...

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,130
Was that a Fujisoba?

52
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:03,380
It might have been a Fujisoba .. I'm not sure

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,800
That's my one worry

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,090
What should we do?

55
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,130
There's none in Ueno right?

56
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,930
If you ask me just to name a store,

57
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,440
There's one in Ebisu, I think

58
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,950
That would be a good choice

59
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,580
If you consider Hamada, and Yamasaki ...

60
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,750
They bet that the others will head for the store closest to them

61
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,950
So they head to Ebisu, where Hamada and Yamasaki are

62
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,860
Meanwhile

63
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,200
There's one there isn't there?

64
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,700
Right there

65
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,250
Let's bet on that one

66
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,800
We're in Shibuya,

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,400
So then we've got to head there

68
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,050
The Fujisoba over there

69
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,750
Let's walk there

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,500
Matsumoto had the right idea,

71
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,150
However, there's one problem...

72
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,500
Near Ebisu station, there's 3 Fujisoba locations!

73
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,200
Their fate depends on the store they choose

74
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,000
And here in Tengenji, just 1 km from Ebisu

75
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,350
Those two, and Yamasaki are in Shibuya right?

76
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,100
He has the same idea

77
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,880
Where did he choose?

78
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,980
I only go there sometimes, but there's one in [!$%!@$]

79
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,850
Since Matsumoto and Endo are together, I bet one of them will suggest it

80
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,500
There's one near [$!@$!] right?

81
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,150
That's it then ain't it?!

82
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,950
The nearby 4 aim for each other,

83
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,170
Will these 4 be able to meet?

84
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,100
Wait! Sorry, but I still think,

85
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:59,700
We can't understand the thoughts of those idiots who didn't come to this massive intersection (in a previous challenge)

86
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,190
Like high school students taking a middle school exam ...

87
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,400
Let's just tolerate them once more

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,550
Let's just tolerate them once more. But if it gets too much...

89
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,400
We really need to tell them off

90
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,050
Tell them they need to stop messing about

91
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,800
If they're doing this as a joke, that's not good

92
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,000
And if they're not joking, that itself is a huge problem

93
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,440
Either case is bad

94
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,950
Meanwhile, the troublemaker Tanaka ...

95
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,780
That store...

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,500
Whether or not it is a Fujisoba...

97
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,200
I'm not sure

98
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,700
Just wait a second

99
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,600
Wait, I'm getting nervous

100
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:54,040
In that area there's Fujisoba, Yudetaro, Komoro Soba. Lots of chain soba stores like that.

101
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,400
If it turns out to not be a Fujisoba ... That's a big problem!

102
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,050
Well there's nothing else we can do. We just have to head there and see.

103
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,320
Meanwhile, Hosei in Ebisu...

104
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,900
Alright, come on. Somebody come here.

105
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,450
And then, appearing before him ...

106
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,850
Oh there's one

107
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,000
I didn't even notice it

108
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,650
There's one there too right? Sorry, that's the one I was thinking of

109
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:40,300
He goes out of his way to head to Ebisu station's south entrance, in Daikanyama.

110
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,850
There it is!

111
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,850
This one here

112
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,700
A Fujisoba

113
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:59,750
Will his choice of Daikanyama lead to a victory? Or defeat?

114
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,250
Meanwhile,

115
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,450
I want at least 3 of us here

116
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,710
Yes, that would be nice

117
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,150
Finally, Matsumoto and Endo arrive at Ebisu

118
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,800
It's gotta be here. Come on, please come!

119
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,300
Get off here?

120
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,660
Which Fujisoba did they both get off at?

121
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,600
I think we all found this one difficult. I bet nobody will meet.

122
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,050
Ah, there!

123
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,700
Alright alright alright

124
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,950
No way! No way!!!

125
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,300
Amazing!

126
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,150
I'm amazed

127
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,300
We took your location in to consideration. This one stands out the most

128
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:56,850
I did that too. Hamada-san is in Tengenji, I'm in Ebisu, and you two were in Shibuya

129
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,800
And then we went to find a nearby store,

130
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,100
You picked the obvious one

131
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,970
Exactly

132
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,300
This feels so good

133
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,350
Meanwhile, Hamada arrives

134
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,750
Before leaving, he was confident,

135
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:20,400
"Since Matsumoto and Endo are together, I bet one of them will suggest it"

136
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,650
That choice is revealed now!

137
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,250
Hamada-san, we can see it

138
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,990
Really?

139
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,600
I can see it, but there's nobody there ...

140
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,000
You're joking right?

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,330
Seriously?

142
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,100
They're not here?

143
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,550
That confidence ... Just where is this place?

144
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,450
"Since Matsumoto and Endo are together, I bet one of them will suggest it"

145
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,650
Right? There's one near Yoshimoto right?

146
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,050
That's it then ain't it?!

147
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,490
Because of that, he ignored Ebisu, and headed to Shinjiku

148
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,900
Then which Fujisoba did they go to?

149
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,700
Speaking of "which Fujisoba?" ... This man is still unsure if he's got the right place

150
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,300
The troublemaker, Tanaka

151
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,000
Right right right, there's one there right?

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Down the hill?

153
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,470
Yes, either at the bottom of the hill, or somewhere along here

154
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,970
20 or 30 metres, to the right

155
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,400
Please let it be it

156
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:39,270
He's put it all on the line, oh let it at least be a Fujisoba!

157
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,000
Here?

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,400
Yes! Here!

159
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,800
It's a Yudetaro Soba ...

160
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,600
Yudeta-

161
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,540
Yes! Here!

162
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,200
Yudeta-

163
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,270
I've gone and done it...

164
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,880
That's a Yudetaro isn't it?

165
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:02,420
Tanaka-san, you can't think of another place right?

166
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,420
I can't

167
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,200
So then let's at least get out of the car

168
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,600
Let's get off-

169
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,600
I don't wanna

170
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:16,930
He failed to follow the hint card, the very basis of this meet up challenge!

171
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,930
Oh man I've done it now

172
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,470
I've really done it now

173
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,400
It says it very clearly doesn't it? That's a Yudetaro alright

174
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,800
Oh man, I'm scared. Oh no!

175
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,730
I really don't like this, this is not good

176
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,200
And finally Time's Up!

177
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,800
I don't wanna...

178
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,220
Hello?

179
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,000
You know,

180
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,330
We've been waiting for a really long time

181
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,100
That's true. It is a bit congested now.

182
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,670
I just want to say,

183
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,800
Endo, Yamasaki and I have met up

184
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,200
Hosei-san is with them...

185
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,200
It's the Fujisoba at the intersection of Ebisu station

186
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,930
At the south entrance of Ebisu station

187
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,710
The Fujisoba in Ebsisu?

188
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,930
Hamada, where are you?

189
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,550
I am, in Shinjiku/

190
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,930
Shinjiku?

191
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,020
Right at the intersection of Meiji-dori ,

192
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,330
Where in Shinjiku?

193
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,590
It's near the (Yoshimoto) headquarters,

194
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,610
In that neighbourhood?

195
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,600
I see, I see

196
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,800
Then where is Tanaka?

197
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,930
I thought about where you guys would go, so I went towards the studio in Kojimachi-

198
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,000
Kojimachi?

199
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,530
He's even laughing out loud

200
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,870
What were you thinking?

201
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,070
I, I got the store wrong a bit, actually,

202
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,070
What do you mean?

203
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,710
You got the store wrong?

204
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,000
What did you mistake it for?

205
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,450
I went to a Yudetaro Soba...

206
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,530
Yudetaro? Oh yeah! There is one, near the studio in Bancho

207
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,460
This guy is a troublemaker

208
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,070
I genuinely almost smashed the phone

209
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,670
Yudetaro?

210
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:56,070
I see, we should have changed the card to Yudetaro then

211
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,470
You idiot

212
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,600
I am really sorry abut this...

213
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,870
See you

214
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,270
I'm sorry about that

215
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,730
Tanaka is amazing huh?

216
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,280
The Yudetaro in Kojimachi he said

217
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,200
2 hours and 20 minutes since the start,

218
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,330
With those 3 together, only Hamada and Tanaka are left

219
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,960
So, what's the next theme?

220
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,830
Concert Hall

221
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,930
A concert hall? Can we say the first one we thought of?

222
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,470
Budokan

223
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,470
Shibuya Public Hall

224
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,180
Where?

225
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,930
Budokan...

226
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,070
I think...

227
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,350
It's Shibuya Hall! Shibuya Hall!

228
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,070
I was thinking Yokohama Arena...

229
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,470
Yokohoma huh?

230
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,500
Let's not

231
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,870
Where did that come from?

232
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,920
Let's stop taking risks like that

233
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,530
For this one, there's gotta be just one choice right?

234
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,200
When you think of a concert ... It's gotta be the Budokan!

235
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,200
Am I wrong?

236
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,910
Hamada heads to Nippon Budokan

237
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,610
Matsumoto & Friends head to Shibuya Public Hall

238
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:21,180
With this, Tanaka has 2 correct choices to pick from

239
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,730
I've got a lot. A lot.

240
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,920
Shibuya Public Hall,

241
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,240
Hibiya Yaon (Open Air Concert Hall)

242
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,930
Nakano Sun Plaza,

243
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,930
But, let's go to [@!$!@]

244
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:42,070
Let's get inside, we'll think more afterwards. Let's end this.

245
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:49,800
Will they all meet up? Or remain scattered?

246
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,520
Matsumoto's group heads towards Shibuya Public Hall

247
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,070
It's close though, Shibuya Hall

248
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,140
They used to film "The Top 10" here right?

249
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,600
You know, I think Hamada,

250
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,070
I feel like he'll go to Budokan

251
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,200
Really? I guess Budokan does stand out

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,330
What other choices are there?

253
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,130
There's Nakano Sun Plaza,

254
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:27,270
If we don't meet up here, I'm definitely gonna miss my salon appointment...

255
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:34,060
Meanwhile, Hamada...

256
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:40,400
If it's just me going to Budokan, and Tanaka meets up with them, that would be the worst

257
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,280
I'm thinking maybe Tokyo Dome might be it...

258
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,740
But we have finally gotten back to the centre

259
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,800
Indeed, indeed

260
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,870
Just remember one of them said he's at a Yudetaro in Kojimachi

261
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,400
The theme; A Concert Hall

262
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,400
There are two correct answers for Tanaka to choose from,

263
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,760
Shibuya Public Hall? Or Nippon Budokan?

264
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,000
I am wondering about some places,

265
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,670
What places?

266
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,330
Maybe Yoyogi ... Yoyogi National Gymnasium,

267
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,930
Also, Shibuya Orchard Hall

268
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,330
It does seem like a classic answer

269
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,350
Yes, certainly

270
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,470
Also, I guess after all,

271
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,910
Shibuya Public Hall. 3 of them are in Ebisu,

272
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,330
You wanna aim for them?

273
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,600
Yes, let's meet them

274
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:35,250
Other than those ... A concert hall huh?

275
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:40,470
Well, considering the closest one to Kojimachi,

276
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,800
Budokan is the closest

277
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,330
I forgot about Budokan

278
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,830
It's famous for Rock concerts

279
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,800
Yeah true, I wasn't able to come up with Budokan

280
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,170
With this, Budokan became the right answer,

281
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,470
And Hamada, who is unaware of this ...

282
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,470
It could be that they go to Yoyogi,

283
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,870
And Tanaka and I meet up at Budokan

284
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,730
An awakening...

285
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,070
Right?

286
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,800
Meanwhile, Matsumoto & Friends arrive at Shibuya Public Hall

287
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,470
It has now been 3 hours since the start

288
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,540
Budokan is totally wrong

289
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,730
Yeah Budokan is out

290
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,950
It's been 40 minutes already

291
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,670
I think Yokohama Arena was a bad idea too

292
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,190
No, you're right, I don't know why I said that. Forgive me.

293
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,070
That is the worse idea,

294
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,670
Why did you say Yokohama?

295
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,800
Sorry, I could only think of that one...

296
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,670
But there's so many other places! Like Budokan, or Shibuya Hall-

297
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,870
Now that you say it, you're right

298
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,400
Sorry, can we move on now?

299
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,530
Wow, you're trying to avoid that conversation

300
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,130
You're apologising so much

301
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,200
I'm kind of hungry too, can we move on?

302
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,740
So annoying

303
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,070
Shall we grab lunch?

304
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,090
Hell no!

305
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,980
Just get lost already

306
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,600
Meanwhile,

307
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,320
They're not here. They would be standing somewhere obvious like that if they were.

308
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:27,200
A bad atmosphere at the deserted Budokan

309
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,330
Enough already!

310
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,200
That's enough

311
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,740
Meanwhile, Tanaka who still has a chance to meet up heads towards Shibuya

312
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,730
He had to choose from 3 concert halls,

313
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,870
There's also NHK Hall, isn't there?

314
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,730
Is NHK Hall different from Shibuya Public Hall?

315
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,730
They're close by, but different places

316
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,400
I'm a bit confused...

317
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,070
Out of nowhere, a 4th choice!

318
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:15,410
His 4th choice is just 400m from the others,

319
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:20,000
Will it be Shibuya Hall where Matsumoto's group is?

320
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,070
Where exactly did Tanaka get off?

321
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,730
I'm counting on this one, seriously

322
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:34,670
The fact he went to Yudetaro is so shocking...

323
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,130
He needs to face some punishment

324
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,070
I really want him to face some punishment

325
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,070
(TN: Boil = Yude)

326
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,070
Shall we boil him?

327
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,070
Here?

328
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,330
They're there! They're there!

329
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,820
See! They're there!

330
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,470
No way!

331
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,730
No way!

332
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,000
Sorry for the wait,

333
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,160
But this is great!

334
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,130
Thank you

335
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,800
We thought you wouldn't come here, so we were talking shit about you this whole time

336
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,020
Of course I came! When you think of a concert hall, it's gotta be Shibuya Public Hall

337
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,360
Right, they've got the theatre in there too

338
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,610
Yes, exactly. Also considering the distance.

339
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,890
Incidentally, where else did you think of?

340
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,890
Shibuya Orchard Hall

341
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,710
So close!

342
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,720
So close!

343
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,910
Your sketchy personality is showing!

344
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,790
Time's Up here

345
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:38,890
They report their locations on a group call

346
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,730
Over here, we've got 4 people

347
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,600
You're lying right?

348
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,440
We are waiting in front of Shibuya Public Hall

349
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,000
Where the hell did you get Shibuya Public Hall from?

350
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,740
It's the first place you should associate with a concert

351
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,130
No way, you associate concerts with Budokan!

352
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,480
There it is

353
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,560
No, listen. This is where all of the great artists had their live concerts

354
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,960
That's true for Shibuya Public Hall too

355
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,060
All they did there was "The Top Ten"!

356
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,470
I mean they did do that here,

357
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,960
Who cares about that

358
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,840
Piss off! I don't care about your salon appointment

359
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,640
Listen, there's 4 of us here

360
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,290
Alright

361
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,690
"The Top Ten"!

362
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,730
That's what they did there

363
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,730
(Machiaki = Masaaki Sasaki, who was in that show)

364
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,730
It was just Machiaki!

365
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,980
"Let's finish this!" -  What's the theme this time?

366
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,200
The last one right?

367
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,960
Aquarium

368
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,200
Let's say the first one we thought of

369
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,530
Ready, ste-

370
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,540
Wait!

371
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,330
There's too many to choose from

372
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,730
You know too many!

373
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,440
There are 5 aquariums within Tokyo,

374
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,740
Which will they choose?

375
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,930
It's gotta be that one,

376
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,580
Shinagawa!!

377
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,580
Shinagawa!!

378
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,580
Shinagawa!!

379
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,580
Sunshine!!

380
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,980
What did you say?

381
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,270
Sunshine...

382
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,010
It can't be Ikebukoru!

383
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,000
It's gotta be Shinagawa

384
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,890
I see

385
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,880
Thinking about the size

386
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,800
There's 2 of them in Shinagawa...

387
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,600
There's also Shinagawaw Prince Hotel Aquarium

388
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,380
The more popular one...

389
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,230
Which one?

390
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,400
I think Shinagawa Prince...

391
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,400
Ah, the Aqua Park?

392
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,530
That one is a mutiplex, so maybe he went a movie with his wife there

393
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,180
With his wife?

394
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,440
With his wife, or a different wife

395
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,910
Meanwhile, at Nippon Budokan

396
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,530
What did he come up with?

397
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,070
Maybe I'll go home...

398
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,180
There it is, Aqua Park!

399
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,230
Matsumoto's group arrives at Aqua Park Shinagawa

400
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,270
and Hamada?

401
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,420
You're joking...

402
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,510
What? No way!

403
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,930
He's not here!

404
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,440
There was no sign of Hamada there

405
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,710
Man it's gone dark now...

406
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,510
Then where is he heading to?

407
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,560
That tall bean pole (Tanaka) probably felt like this...

408
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,130
Every time...

409
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:29,240
If we have to do 1 more theme, I feel like we'll do 2 more themes,

410
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,470
He could be in Ikebukuro

411
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,000
He could have gone there

412
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,220
It's possible he went to an aquarium we could never come up with

413
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,820
Hamada finally arrives

414
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,020
Enough

415
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,690
I think today...It's not happening

416
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,890
Will they be able to meet up?!

417
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:00,310
If he went to Kasai or something, the next one will be impossible!

418
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,760
Just simply im-

419
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,460
Thank god!

420
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,130
Finally, congratulations!

421
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,180
Don't you tell me "congratulations", idiot!

422
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,760
You went to Yudetaro!

423
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,490
Yudetaro-

424
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,620
I don't want Yudetaro man to tell me congrats

425
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,620
But man, that is amazing you did that

426
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,580
I will never forget that

427
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,920
Please, it's so embarassing

428
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,420
Will you make it to your appointment?

429
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,180
I think so, If I go there
