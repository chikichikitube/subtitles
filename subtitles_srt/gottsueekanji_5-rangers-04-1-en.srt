1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
The Future Century
Squadron: The Five Rangai!

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,620
So yesterday...

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,400
Yeah.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,240
...I met him again.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,640
What? Your manager again?

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,940
Yeah...

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,680
Well, he called me so...

8
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,220
I keep telling you to break it off, don't I!

9
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,140
I know, I know! But...

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,600
Who is it?

11
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,520
Hello, hello, hello, good evening.

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,240
Long time, no see.

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,360
What's with you coming every Sunday?

14
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,360
So Ryoko!

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,600
I have a present just for you.

16
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,580
Hey, hey, hey.

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,580
This is my home.

18
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,580
This is my home.

19
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,900
Don't you think you're being a little rude?

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,920
So Ryoko.

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
This ir really cool.

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,920
Rolling Stones tickets!

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,100
No way!
Really!

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,800
Cool.

25
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,760
Third row!

26
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,480
They're calling you.

27
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,600
Third row!

28
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,000
Third row seats! Right in front of our eyes.

29
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,000
They're calling you!

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,320
I'll give this to you. Let's go together.

31
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:05,880
Ok!

32
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,880
I know, I know! Shut up!

33
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,880
Ok, like this.

34
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,200
Help!

35
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,560
Save me!

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,820
Stop!!!!

37
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,760
Falkor!

38
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,160
Dokin!

39
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,500
"R" Lady!

40
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,480
No Panties Shabu-Shabu!

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,540
Mori Building!

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,780
Our powers combined!

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,520
The Five Rangai!

44
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,960
Ok!

45
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,520
Go go!
- Escape!

46
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,160
Hurry out of here!

47
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,460
Go!

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,940
Get out of here!

49
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,920
Ok!
- Come on!

50
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,420
Hey. Line up.

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,560
Line up over there.

52
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,020
Ow, ow, ow.

53
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,200
Ouch.

54
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,440
Line up.

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,580
So when I tell you guys
to do what you want...

56
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,160
...this is the result.

57
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,960
This is it, right?

58
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,080
This is your guys idea of heroes, right?

59
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,840
What the hell are you?

60
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,840
"R" Lady.

61
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,800
Can you fight like this?

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,060
With a purse hanging from you shoulder?

63
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,920
Of course I can fight like this.

64
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,440
Hey.

65
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,340
Yes!

66
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,220
Don't wear that suit if you can't  move.

67
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,820
Actually, I thought I
could fight much better!

68
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,920
Can you please pass
that foot behind you?

69
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,360
Sorry!

70
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,480
Hey.

71
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,720
Hey!

72
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,380
Yes?

73
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,300
You're the closest out of all these idiots.

74
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,120
Hey.

75
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,740
Old man.

76
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,280
What the hell are you?

77
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,180
No Panties Shabu-Shabu!

78
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,600
Hey, look here.

79
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,880
Is there such a thing as a "No
Panties Shabu-Shabu" hero?

80
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,700
well...

81
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,700
The system, right?

82
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,780
So the idea is to satisfy the appetite
for food and sex at the same time.

83
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,580
I liked the idea...

84
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,940
...and you said to dress like you want.

85
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,860
So I choose No Panties
Shabu-Shabu with confidence.

86
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,440
I see.

87
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,320
You have no right to complain.
Fine, Ok.

88
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,800
Just what are you?

89
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,920
Sorry?

90
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,340
What is that? Mori Building?

91
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,320
Well...

92
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,060
I wanted to be a big man.

93
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,600
This isn't a hero, this is a monster.

94
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,380
I wanted to be big...

95
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,720
...and I wanted to be influential.

96
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Oh!

97
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,660
I see.

98
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,120
Sit down.

99
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,180
So I'm not angry at all today.

100
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,280
I told you guys to do whatever you want.

101
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,100
Right, right.
- Yes, you did.

102
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,660
Yeah, and so you guys showed me.

103
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,960
But I mean physically...

104
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,800
...are these heroes? I mean
if you line you guys up...

105
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,820
Would people think you are heroes?

106
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,600
They wouldn't, would they?

107
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,980
Looking at yourselves.

108
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,800
What do you think?

109
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,860
Looking at yourself, well
you chose what you liked...

110
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,780
But looking at the guy
next to you, would you say...

111
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,560
Excuse me.
- What is it?

112
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,740
Umm.

113
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,640
Something I really felt...
- Yeah, yeah.

114
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,520
Umm.

115
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,820
I mean, I'm guilty of it, too,
so I can't throw blame around.
- Right, right.

116
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,200
But actually I think there
is something wrong.
- Isn't there!

117
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,800
I feel.
Right, right.

118
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,060
Until last week, I honestly thought,
what is Mr. Skeleton talking about?

119
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,060
Ah, you thought that?

120
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,300
So I didn't use "Mr"
when addressing you.

121
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,500
I truly felt that in my heart.
- Oh, you did?

122
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,840
Well that's how you feel so...

123
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,380
But this is how I feel now.
- You see what I mean?

124
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,040
That's the way you should feel.

125
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,460
You're completely off!

126
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,200
Children can't talk about
No Panties Shabu-Shabu.

127
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,960
But, you see, my target
group is middle-aged men.

128
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,420
That's why I'm after.

129
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,420
Ah, that's what you're after?

130
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,760
I thought, "I'll save middle-aged men".
- I see, I see, Isee.

131
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,740
But children are usually
a hero's main group.

132
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,620
Oh. Ah. Oh
- You have to think like that.

133
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,260
I see, I see.

134
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,680
Wait.

135
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,900
You hadn't notice that?

136
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,900
No, really?
- Is that right?

137
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,560
That was the mistake?

138
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,560
Children are your main audience!

139
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,020
That's why I said he was the closest!

140
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,460
I have a weapon.
- He has a weapon, too!

141
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,080
Right, right.

142
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,280
So that is what you mean?

143
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,300
Of course that's what I mean!

144
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,820
So let's try again next week.

145
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,980
Ok. - Ok.
- Ok.

146
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,840
Next week, please.

147
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,880
From next week The Five Rangai.

148
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,100
That's best.
- So just like that...

149
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,280
Today is impossible.

150
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,460
You're not The Five Rangai.

151
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,600
Just looking at us, it's weird, isn't it?
- It's weird, it is.

152
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,780
You see it, right?
- Yes.

153
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,260
Falkor is ok, right?

154
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,540
I thought we just said it's weird?
- Ah, this is weird, too. - I see.

155
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,580
Excuse me.

156
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,600
If I get rid of the purse am I ok?
- The purse isn't the problem!

157
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,600
You just were asking, right?

158
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,500
Well, no.

159
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,500
Whether you have this or not. No.

160
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,500
We see. We completely understand.

161
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,160
You see now?

162
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,660
When we came in before and yelled
out "Our powers combined, The
Five Rangai!"... It felt a little wrong.

163
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,000
Didn't it?

164
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,000
You see what I mean?

165
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,260
I am telling you!
- Your skin felt weird, right?

166
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,380
That's right! If you understand
that now then fantastic.

167
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,900
Well then...
- Starting today a new...

168
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,700
Yes, Five Rangai.

169
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,480
Right!

170
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,880
Until next week.

171
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
Ok! Ok!
Ok!

172
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,700
Thank you!

173
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,080
Please eat this.

174
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,700
No, no.

175
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,100
Thank you.

176
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,480
Thank you! - Thanks!
- Thank you!

177
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,700
Let's try again next week.

178
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,200
Bye bye!

179
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,800
Let's learn from our mistakes.

180
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,580
We will!

181
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,220
Thank you!

182
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,840
Good work. Be careful getting home.

183
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,920
Ok?

184
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,060
Yes, thank you!

185
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,120
