00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,850
It was way too much.

3
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,470
He took things to a whole new level.

4
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,320
I seriously thought "you've got to
be kidding me, Matsumoto-san!"

5
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,820
I was like "damn you, Matsumoto-san!"

6
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,390
"Give me a break!"

7
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,520
He was laughing the whole
time, right? Like hehehe.

8
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,670
He was watching everything through
the monitor and having fun.

9
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,150
Just a rich guy entertaining himself.

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,000
Makes me want to shoot him.

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,550
Shall we?

12
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,410
However,

13
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,020
two of you have been eliminated.

14
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,290
Fujimon!

15
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,380
You moved too much.

16
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,940
No, you're supposed to move!

17
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,790
Kuro-chan is out!

18
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,980
Me?!

19
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,540
That's unexpected!

20
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,280
- Because of the drone.
- Yes, he moved from it.

21
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,820
The knife hit me between my eyebrows.

22
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,880
Tada!

23
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,500
So we need to pause
everything at "freeze", right?

24
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,470
- We need to get serious from here.
- Hey Yukai-san, where are you sitting?

25
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,320
- Oh, right, we have our own seats.
- Anywhere is fine.

26
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,440
I wanna sit across from Yukai-san.

27
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,550
I'm scared.

28
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,270
I'm so scared.

29
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,050
Why is Suzuki so scared?

30
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,330
Would you be scared?

31
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,780
- Isn't the circle smaller than last time?
- You're right, it is smaller.

32
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,360
- It's really small.
- Scary.

33
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,480
Judging from the size of the room,

34
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,990
I don't think they can use
crazy large gadgets and such.

35
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,930
I was wondering where they'll come from…

36
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,060
Alright then, time to get started.

37
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,110
Yeah, but still…

38
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,640
Shizu’s face is hilarious.

39
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,230
OK, let’s do this.

40
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,130
I can see why they're scared.

41
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,870
They're so close too.

42
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,350
Smack Yukai's foot.

43
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,750
Try it again. Do it twice,
like "smack smack."

44
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,860
Yukai is amazing.

45
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,740
OK, that’s enough. You can come back now.

46
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,650
What was that?!

47
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,590
That darn dude!

48
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,550
He wasn’t even close!

49
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,500
Sheesh, that really hurt.

50
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,380
What is this anyway?

51
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,420
- What a surprise!
- It’s like a bomb!

52
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,280
It’s all over my clothes.

53
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,080
I really wasn’t expecting the
watermelon to blow up like that.

54
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,120
The watermelon exploded!

55
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,120
None of us expected that.

56
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,880
It was like "bam!"

57
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,810
- I’m tired already.
- Me too.

58
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,730
That really wore me out.

59
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,950
Go ahead.

60
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,640
Straighten out.

61
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,280
Keep frozen, Bobby.

62
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,920
Ow!

63
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,470
That must have hurt.
Everyone is doing well, though.

64
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,280
Try tickling her ear.

65
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,290
Go in.

66
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,700
Wait, wait, that's enough.

67
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,150
She’s amazing.

68
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,100
Good, good. OK.

69
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:55,320
I think I can stay still. But I'm
really sensitive in some areas.

70
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,310
Sensitive, huh?

71
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,650
The right breast is more
sensitive than the left.

72
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,620
What is that? Stop it.

73
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,490
This is great.

74
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,470
Everyone is really tough.

75
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,880
Can you play with Non-chan's hair?

76
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,170
Put your fingers through it.

77
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,610
OK, go to Morohoshi next.

78
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,350
Can you stick a finger up his nose?

79
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,440
This is good, Morohoshi senses something.

80
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,200
He knows. He knows something
is up, and it’s gonna be bad.

81
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,750
He knows. He totally knows.

82
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,630
The finger...

83
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,420
Amazing.

84
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,800
What was that?

85
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,640
That damn thing slapped me! I got slapped!

86
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:08,080
That’s wrong! What was
that? No touching please!

87
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,410
What was that thing
trying to do with my hair?

88
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,790
It actually came after my right boob...

89
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,930
because I mentioned
earlier that it's sensitive.

90
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,220
Was it OK?

91
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,190
No, it was pretty bad.

92
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,990
That thing got in my
nose and slapped my face!

93
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:45,000
Their facial expressions
really showed in this round.

94
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,900
I had to move when it slapped me.

95
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,840
I’ve never felt a hand
that was so rock-hard.

96
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,980
- Did it hurt?
- Yes, it hurt!

97
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,140
Morohoshi-san, that
thing went up your nose?

98
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,250
It did.

99
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,360
It didn’t feel ticklish?

100
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,640
I managed to hold it back.

101
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,250
Amazing!

102
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,580
I thought it was kinda funny that

103
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,770
the machine was giving
you the middle finger and...

104
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,680
This is long. It really is.

105
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,290
I’m sure it's tough to wait this long.

106
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,480
What the heck?!

107
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,710
That was scary!

108
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,060
I've had enough!

109
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,530
That was scary. What was that?

110
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,450
- What was that about?
- What was that?

111
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,350
Can we get through this?

112
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,210
I'm going crazy.

113
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,690
This is mentally draining.

114
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,310
You know, it’s only natural for us humans

115
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,730
- to react and move based on our instincts.
- It's unhealthy not to.

116
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,540
- And why doesn't Macchan come out anymore?
- You're right.

117
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,220
What's he doing?

118
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,870
- Is he even watching anymore?
- Maybe not!

119
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,700
- It's mind games at this point.
- I wanna quit. I'm tired.

120
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,970
- There he is!
- I am watching!

121
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,300
What now?

122
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,730
You guys were doing well,
not reacting to that robot arm.

123
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,570
I mean, that finger was way too hard!

124
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,220
Oh, was it?

125
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,760
Yeah, it was the hardest
finger I’ve ever, uh...seen...

126
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,960
How many fingers have
you stuck up your nose?!

127
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,780
Morohoshi, your heart
rate is through the roof.

128
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,780
Did it go up?

129
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:53,250
Just yours went up by
nearly twice as much.

130
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,130
I’m not at my best today, that's all.

131
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,830
But, you know, this is good. Really
good. You guys are doing great.

132
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,840
Alright, let’s go!

133
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,290
No, I wanna quit!
I wanna quit!

134
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,550
This is scary!

135
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,900
I've had enough!

136
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,820
What's next? What's next?

137
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,530
Come and get us, damn it!

138
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,830
I wanna quit!

139
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,570
You’re the one with
the abnormal heart rate!

140
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,700
This is funny.

141
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,270
You know something bad is coming.

142
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,960
This is bad.

143
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,290
OK.

144
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,630
Let's go.

145
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,260
Bobby...

146
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,930
Bobby isn't taking this
well. Toughen up, Bobby!

147
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,260
OK, now what?

148
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,620
Oh, that’s how you’re gonna do it?

149
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,550
Wow, you’re being pretty rough there.

150
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,520
The fish cake with the
burdock root looks good.

151
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,960
You can pick that up.

152
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,490
Oh, it got the fish cake.

153
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,050
Give it to Yukai.

154
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:01,140
It’s locked on to Yukai,
it's locked on to Yukai.

155
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,470
I think Yukai is mentally
prepared for this. Right, Yukai?

156
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,160
Are you ready, Yukai?

157
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,520
Wow, he looks cool.
I can see the steam coming out.

158
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,880
Go on.

159
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,650
Isn’t it hot?!

160
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,740
It must be.

161
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,020
OK, put it back in the pot…

162
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,110
Let’s go for Non-chan then.

163
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,640
Something is stuck to its finger.

164
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,210
OK, go ahead.

165
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,290
Ah, good, good. Let’s give it to Non-chan.

166
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,210
Go for Non-chan.

167
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,480
That was scary.

168
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,960
- Was it hot?
- Of course!

169
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,750
- It was hot, right?
- Definitely.

170
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:23,210
Look at it! Even Dacho
didn’t have it boiling this much!

171
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:31,360
(Translator note: Dacho Club was a comedy trio. The
towel gang from GNT no-laughing batsus was based on them.)

172
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,770
I’ve never seen a hot
pot boiling that much.

173
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,360
I saw the steam and everything,
but that thing was really hot.

174
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,280
It was some seriously hot stew.

175
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,210
It really worried me. I
wasn’t sure how far they'd go.

176
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:44,780
- This really is mentally draining.
- It's really stressful. It really is.

177
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,550
Ah, this is so…

178
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,310
OK, here comes the next machine.

179
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,760
I feel bad. I feel bad for them…

180
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,570
Get pretty close.

181
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,530
Get closer to Bobby.

182
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,640
OK, I’m gonna release them.

183
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,980
Why me?! What was that?!

184
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,230
This is funny.

185
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,460
It's really funny.

186
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,800
- What IS that?!
- I dunno, but it stinks!

187
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,700
It stinks, stinks, stinks!

188
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,180
- Something stinks.
- This stinks!

189
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,300
Alright everyone, thanks for your time.

190
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,400
The second stage is now over!

191
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:31,800
I have decided who will be dropping out.

192
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,590
The first one is...

193
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,610
Shizu-chan!

194
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,260
Was I moving?

195
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:45,740
Shizu-chan, you lost points for enjoying
that nipple-tickling a bit too much.

196
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,650
And the other person...

197
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,700
This one was a hard decision.

198
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,210
It wasn’t easy, but in the end…

199
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,520
Iwao!

200
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,410
Come on, I got puked on!

201
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,480
There was the hot pot too.

202
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,860
It wasn’t just hot, that
hand pushed me to the side!

203
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,610
To be clear, it was a hard
decision. It was really tough.

204
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,960
Also, the losers will get a second chance.

205
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,600
OK, on to the next stage!

206
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,890
What the heck!

207
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:50,840
It stinks! How can you be so cruel?

208
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,530
I don't want to go through anything
worse than the puke thing, so...

209
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:04,650
I mean, if I'm going to get puked on, I can't
stop imagining what comes next.

210
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,380
You know, maybe something
toilet related might come out.

211
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,540
I couldn’t stop thinking.

212
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,470
It was really frustrating.

213
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:22,560
The watermelon explosion
really got to me. I hate the sound.

214
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,350
No matter how much I
hear it, I can't get used to it.

215
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,570
I'm also mad at myself for not keeping a
straight face through the nipple-tickling.

216
00:29:37,650 --> 00:30:02,900
