00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,550
(Aho = Idiot or Idiotic)

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,020
Before your father died...

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,620
...he must have given you the
design of the Megaton Missile.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,990
Don't pretend you
don't know about it.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,560
I don't know anything about it!

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,130
If you don't confess you will
be asking for pain, little boy.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,300
Do your worst! I'll never
give it to the likes of you!

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,100
Playing dumb, is it?

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,740
If that's the case...
then die!

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,640
Save me! Aho Aho Man!

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,910
Aho Aho Man?

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,190
You're really an idiot.

14
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,930
The one who says idiot is the idiot!

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,600
What'd you say?!

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,800
Aho Aho Man...

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,870
...is a super human that
was built by little Kentaro's
father, Professor Zaizen...

18
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,870
...the strongest in
history you might say.

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,810
Alright!

20
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,110
Aho Aho Man!

21
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,380
Use the "Aho Aho Hand" on them!

22
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,750
When Aho Aho Man attaches
the "Aho Aho Hand"...

23
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,620
...his punch increases in
strength 10,000 times and
can even blast through steel.

24
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,620
Alright!

25
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,530
Kick!

26
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,130
What the-?

27
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:22,730
Hey. Hey.

28
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,430
Kick!

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,760
Sorry.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,530
What is he doing?

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,500
What the hell are you doing?

32
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,430
Why're you using your legs?

33
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,340
You should punch.

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,670
Not kick.

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,770
Sorry.

36
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,610
Take 'em out!

37
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,340
Come on!

38
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,180
Punch!

39
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,510
Wait! Wait!

40
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,950
Sorry, sorry.

41
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,620
Why are using this hand?

42
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,650
Why are you sniffing it?!

43
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,190
Look at this hand!

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,290
What do you see?

45
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,230
Now look at that hand.

46
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,630
You got it?!

47
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,200
You gotta use that hand.

48
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:01,870
Ow.

49
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,870
What the hell are you doing?!

50
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,940
Just what the-

51
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,940
That's enough from you!

52
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,440
What do you think you're-

53
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,240
Punch!

54
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,270
Punch!

55
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,610
An awesome punch!

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,220
You really are a complete
idiot, aren't you?

57
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,890
