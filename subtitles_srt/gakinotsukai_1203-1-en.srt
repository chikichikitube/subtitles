TRANSLATED, TIMED AND TYPSETTED BY KAIZEN SUBS

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,300
The first edition of "I understand you the best, I think you like this kind of thing don't you?" competition!

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,690
Matsumoto-san.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,130
Yes?

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,760
The last time we did this as a five.

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,760
Yes, that's right.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,700
I think this segment is a good idea, but this sign sucks.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,900
"I understand you the best," it says.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,270
It's a bit disgusting.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,880
This is the sequel to the one aired earlier this year, "I think you like this kind of thing" competition.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,020
This is a project where the gaki members buy items that suits the guests interests.

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,460
This time, we have a special guest.

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,930
This guy is quite old. He's one year older than us.

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,630
Yeah.

15
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,670
By the way, fairly recently he's become a grandfather.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,970
He's become a grandfather.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,810
That's amazing.

18
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,710
Today's grandpa guest.

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,680
Well then, let's begin. Welcome!

20
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,060
You were knocking from behind the curtain.

21
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,290
I'm just saying, we're the same age.

22
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,690
Wrong!

23
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,160
We're all born in Showa 38 (1963)

24
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,400
I'm so freaking sick of this talk.

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,030
You know, I really like this corner.

26
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,070
It makes me happy how you guys care and try to understand things about me.

27
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,810
But you know, you were honestly the only one we thought about.

28
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,920
We didn't want to, but we couldn't help it.

29
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,990
A celebrity who is known for his fashion sense, Kimura Yuuichi.

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,030
The gaki members will each pick out a hat, a top and a book which will be presented to him.

31
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,130
Before the recording, the gaki members went shopping.

32
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,810
To search for a hat that Kimura might like, Endo went to Omotesandou. (A place in Tokyo)

33
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,580
In my opinion, Kimura-san is very fashionable,

34
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,950
so I think this'll be good for him.

35
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:23,820
If this was just sitting somewhere, I'd be like "Woah, Kimi-nii what's that you're wearing today?"

36
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:30,230
Meanwhile, Matsumoto went to a bookstore near Tokyo Station.

37
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,100
A book about flowers... He's probably not interested in things like this.

38
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,380
I've never heard Kimura talk about flowers before.

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,150
When talking about Kimura-san, I've thought of the ideal hat for him.

40
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,350
Tanaka, who is full of confidence goes to a specialist hat store to find a hat.

41
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,920
Umm...

42
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,230
When I think of the ideal hat for Kimura-san, I think of Borsalino (Italian-style) hats.

43
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,130
I'm not really sure which one.

44
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,470
Hamada goes to a select shop in Ueno.

45
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,170
Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.

46
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:21,780
I think everyone else will choose these types of hats.

47
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,390
See? Those are the hats he wears nowadays, though I'm not sure if he'll like this.

48
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,300
That's something he'll decide.

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,450
Do you have an image in mind?

50
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:36,290
Yeah I do, I think a baseball cap would be good.

51
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,820
Hamada's decided to go with a baseball cap, but just what did he choose?

52
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,950
How's this?

53
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:51,400
This hat has kind of an angry feel to it.

54
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:56,370
The place that Hosei went to was in Shibuya.

55
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,750
This is the place, it's perfect.

56
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,270
It's perfect, so perfect.

57
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,510
Oh man, this is the one for Kimura.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,600
Is this a bathrobe?

59
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,830
For the boxing ring?

60
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,950
In the same store, Housei also looks for caps.

61
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:32,670
Ah I've found it! This is it, oh sorry, this, it's this definitely.

62
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:38,050
I really like this man, I've decided, excuse me.

63
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,700
Everyone is completely serious about choosing their items.

64
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,800
That's because...

65
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,320
Kimura will be able to take the item he likes the most home.

66
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,870
As for the item that Kimura ranks last, the gaki member who chose that item will have to pay for it himself.

67
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,780
This is for real. You really have to pay and that's why I don't have the receipt.

68
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,850
That's enough of that.

69
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,570
I've seen this too many times.

70
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,520
First up, Endo with a hat that he thinks Kimura likes.

71
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,300
This is the item that I chose.

72
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,570
It took about one hour to pick this.

73
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,950
That long!?

74
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,570
The truth is I quite like hats as well.

75
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,920
I don't think a lot of people have seen me wearing a hat.

76
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,100
Oh this is leather?

77
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,470
Yes. My understanding of Kimura-san's fashion is it has a unique look.

78
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,320
It is a bit unique.

79
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,320
Yes that's right.

80
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,970
Leather huh? I don't really have anything leather right now. The shape is...

81
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,350
The shape, I think it's

82
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,160
Look at his reaction!

83
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,570
Kimura sweats a lot, and the leather might make him hot and sweaty due to the material.

84
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,920
I don't really want Kimura to wear this hat.

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,270
Oh, it really suits him though.

86
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,300
I look a bit older.

87
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,970
Wear it a bit higher to show off your forehead.

88
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,370
Oh higher?

89
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,090
Show a little bit of your hair at the front.

90
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,550
He looks like Toshio Sakata.

91
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,400
No no, not at all.

92
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:35,350
Next up Hamada. What is his pick for the hat he thinks Kimura likes?

93
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,970
You guys went for what Kimura is wearing recently, but I've gone for something he doesn't really wear anymore.

94
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,700
I haven't seen him in this style for a quite a while now.

95
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,870
Oh I see, I don't really wear caps.

96
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,700
Recently I haven't worn caps.

97
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,870
The colors are black and white.

98
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:02,300
Since you haven't worn this type of hat recently, why not take a trip back to the past?

99
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,320
Are you asking him to?

100
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,150
Yeah like a request.

101
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,020
Ah I can see it, it looks good.

102
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,970
The shape is not bad.

103
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,070
But then again... nah it's kinda wrong.

104
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,400
I don't understand what the image is here at the front.

105
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,950
Wait Sakata was wearing it as well.

106
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,570
Why him again!?

107
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,770
When I asked the person at the store, they said it was a snake.

108
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,120
A cobra.

109
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,670
Oh it's a cobra.

110
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,350
Ah I see.

111
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,100
You know, Kimura is scared of cobras.

112
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,150
That doesn't matter!

113
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,280
He can't handle reptiles.

114
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,250
Next is Tanaka, but there is some worry.

115
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,750
Uhm I....

116
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,550
Tanaka and Kimura are like water and oil.

117
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,450
What are you saying?

118
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,950
I don't think he understands me.

119
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,150
Don't worry, I have confidence in this.

120
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,420
This is huge! Oh, it's a CA4IA. (TL note: A high end store)

121
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,450
I'm confident.

122
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,370
Is that a Playstation?

123
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,520
Oh it's a Borsalino!

124
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,520
Yes!

125
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,750
That's famous.

126
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,870
Will he even wear it?

127
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,920
It's an Italian brand.

128
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,900
Oh it's because Kimura like the godfather.

129
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,920
Yes! Yes! That's right.

130
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,820
If you come last you have to pay for it though.

131
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,320
Every year, this...

132
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,920
This is supposed to be for private use you know?

133
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,970
Is it made out of straw?

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,400
Yes. That's right.

135
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,200
It's a summer hat.

136
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,920
It's huge! 61 cm?

137
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,250
Why the hell is it 61cm?

138
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,970
Please wear it.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,150
61cm is too loose.

140
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,120
You don't know anything.

141
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,100
The colors, I see.

142
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,850
It shows the design.

143
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,820
The curtains behind are the same color.

144
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,370
You can't really see it.

145
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,020
He looks like he doesn't have hair.

146
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,050
Next is Hosei. But, there is one problem.

147
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,000
Last time you were ranked last.

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,900
I'm sorry

149
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,150
Wait isn't this bag a bit weird?

150
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,950
Did you buy a sex toy?

151
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,120
Like lotion or something?

152
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,850
That's not fair! I haven't even shown him what I chose yet.

153
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,650
It starts from the bag itself.

154
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,720
No it's about the fashion sense, the actual present itself.

155
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,320
The price doesn't matter.

156
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,230
I think none of you understand what Kimura-san really likes. What he likes is rock.

157
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,120
He likes music.

158
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,520
You like the 80's right, Kimura-san?

159
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,850
This is something amazing.

160
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,900
You can see the rock in it.

161
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,870
See!? This is the one!

162
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,620
I want you to feel the rock in this.

163
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,700
I see. Well... I see.

164
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,150
It's hard to decide what to wear with this.

165
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,200
He can wear what he's wearing now.

166
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,970
I don't really like hats where the wings are small.

167
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,020
Yeah it's a bit small.

168
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,550
A bit. Yeah.

169
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,520
If you fold it out, it can be any size you want.

170
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,970
Next is Matsumoto who knows Kimura the best.

171
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,520
From my view, Kimura is a Daikanyama (Tokyo) type of person.

172
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,550
I see.

173
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,770
So that's where I looked for things.

174
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,670
See?

175
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:19,950
How is this?

176
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,600
Wait does Kimura-san like skull designs though?

177
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,400
Not really.

178
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,100
Right?! You don't like them!

179
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,740
Not really an image I have of Kimura-san.

180
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,750
IS THERE A PERSON THAT DOESN'T LIKE SKULL DESIGNS!?

181
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,900
Kimura-san doesn't like it.

182
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,740
WE'RE ALL SKULLS!

183
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,120
Wait, from the way it fits... The leopard design from before looked better.

184
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,600
Yes!

185
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,520
I'm not really sure,

186
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,970
but I have known him for a while now and I can tell you that he's not that happy.

187
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,230
Which one is the favourtie for Kimura san?

188
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,620
The best one is...

189
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,560
I knew it was going to be that one!

190
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,600
I told you this was good!

191
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,020
Recently, I don't have anymore caps.

192
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,090
For second place, he chose Tanaka's. And for third, Matsumoto's.

193
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,950
That's gotta be a lie Kimura-san!

194
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,460
So then, who will be chosen worst?

195
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,000
To be honest with you, when I first saw this hat I wanted to punch him in the ribs.

196
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,170
It was that bad?!

197
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,170
Which was the one that made you want to do that?

198
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,770
This one.

199
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,750
Really?

200
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,050
It looks ugly and it has bad color.

201
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,590
Use your freaking brain!

202
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,560
This is a joke right?

203
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,200
You're a freaking joke!

204
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,830
When you showed me the item, I knew that no matter how bad the rest were you were still going to be last.

205
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,200
Endo has to pay for his chosen item.

206
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,260
Next, tops that Kimura might like. First up, Tanaka.

207
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,500
Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.

208
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,060
Thank You. Oh!

209
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,900
It's all about the first reactions!

210
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,230
This is...

211
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,730
That's something Kimura of the past would wear.

212
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,700
I see, I see.

213
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,400
Different to his past, but something a bit playful.

214
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,700
The recent trend?

215
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,860
Yes! The recent trend.

216
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,700
Yes, something a bit playful...

217
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,060
He would wear this!

218
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,000
A unique type of fashion!

219
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,800
Ah! Kimura would definitely wear this!

220
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,660
Oh look at him taking his jacket off. He looks so freaking happy.

221
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,700
He wants to wear it so bad, look at his face!

222
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,960
It's too obvious.

223
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,660
He is so pumped!

224
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,900
Those tiny eyes!

225
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,900
Ahh I see, A swing top

226
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,760
The swing top fits tightly.

227
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,430
How is it Kimura-san?

228
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,500
Do you play golf?

229
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,530
No, apparently a swing top is like something you can do a golf swing with while wearing.

230
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,430
Really?

231
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,460
You can swing with the top on, hence the name.

232
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:01,930
Oh really?

233
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,400
Yes.

234
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,630
His face looks so pumped.

235
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:11,600
Next is Endo, can he rebound from before?

236
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,600
Well...

237
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,510
That's a good face.

238
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,170
He is getting pumped up.

239
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,800
He was wearing this type of shirt during an Okinawa movie shoot.

240
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,280
That kind of style.

241
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,050
You can wear it outside of Okinawa.

242
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,420
He was wearing this when we shot Downtown DX (TL Note: Another Downtown program) in Okinawa

243
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,800
With a star pattern.

244
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,850
What's the pattern?

245
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,740
It's maps of Africa.

246
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,770
This brand shows us Bhutan.

247
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,910
I really like maps.

248
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,220
Oh you like maps?

249
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,680
I really like maps.

250
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,340
This isn't too tight on your body.

251
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,310
Ah I see, I see.

252
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,970
He isn't too bothered or annoyed.

253
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,370
I see.

254
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,110
Ah this looks good!

255
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,510
He said it was good.

256
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,020
He just said it was good!

257
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,970
Next is Hamada, presenting Kimura with a top he thinks he likes.

258
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,880
Sorry, I think I went a bit far with the modern look.

259
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,770
That's not good.

260
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,020
That's not good.

261
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,620
I think we see this a lot from Kimura.

262
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,400
This is a vest!

263
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,570
He likes to wear this type.

264
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,970
Yeah, I can imagine it.

265
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,020
I really like vests.

266
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,880
Ah it's denim with tuxedo buttons.

267
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,940
It's not Hamada like at all.

268
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,140
Yeah he likes this type.

269
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,710
You got your buttons in the wrong place.

270
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,620
It looks good.

271
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,940
He's so pumped!

272
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,220
He gets pumped so easily.

273
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,800
So far, Kimura seems to be happy about his gifts.

274
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,840
Now Hosei's turn, can he continue the trend?

275
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,400
I though of exploring...

276
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,250
Look at his bag again!

277
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,600
Oi you! Stop messing around!

278
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,970
What is this!?

279
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:05,570
Did you buy adult toys!? Is there lotion inside that!?

280
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,940
I bought it at the same place.

281
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:16,050
But that same place had a lot of stuff that you really like.

282
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:22,080
I think it's a bit too young for me though. It's more for people in their 20's.

283
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,020
Yeah, you don't understand.

284
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,910
But you haven't aged.

285
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,970
Woah, what the hell is this? This is a joke right!?

286
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,650
Pajamas?

287
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,820
It's not pajamas.

288
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,680
It looks hot and like it'll generate heaps of static shock.

289
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,370
Looks too hot to wear.

290
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,820
It's so good though.

291
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,600
I swear I've seen this in disney before.

292
00:15:54,510 --> 00:16:00,410
The sleeves are out of place!

293
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,740
What the hell is this?

294
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,510
The length of the sleeves are perfect for Tsukitei Happou.

295
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,850
It's the kind that he likes.

296
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,850
Last up is Matsumoto.

297
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:20,720
I got this at Daikanyama. When I first saw it I thought it was the one,

298
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,520
but I still went to look for more. However I just had to come back for this one.

299
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:36,290
This is so swag!

300
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,970
That's for the younger Kimura.

301
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,360
Look at how swag this is.

302
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,410
This is really swag.

303
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,290
I see, I see.

304
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,420
He likes this type of colors the best.

305
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,000
See? Doesn't it look good?

306
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,960
I see.

307
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,520
I see. This one...

308
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,660
Isn't this good?

309
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,960
It looks like he has to go to the hospital.

310
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,240
Just what is his favorite top?

311
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,450
Thank you so much everyone.

312
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,960
This one.

313
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,960
Hell yeah!

314
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,050
Thank you.

315
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,010
I like the pattern and the color.

316
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,980
Don't you have one like this already?

317
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,640
I didnt have this blue type.

318
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:34,730
Second place was Matsumoto's Jacket. And third the Jacket Hamada brought.

319
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:39,570
And now, which one is the worst?

320
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,250
This one.

321
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,850
It wasn't surprising at all.

322
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:52,810
With an obvious result, Hosei has to pay.

323
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,800
The last item is a book. First up Hamada.

324
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:05,180
Well I had a pretty hard time looking for a book, but I did know that recently Kimura had moved houses.

325
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:17,090
I thought if Kimura was at home with some time to spare, and if he wants to do something. Like growing vegetables or something.

326
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:25,160
Because he had just moved houses, Hamada had bought a book on gardening.

327
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,660
Well his wife makes a lot of things.

328
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,990
No no that's wrong. The wife hates you.

329
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,520
That's not good.

330
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,530
Hosei bought a book for the Kyoto local Kimura.

331
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,690
Again?

332
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:49,980
Doesn't it piss you off? He carries the same freaking bag.

333
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,360
It's the same bag.

334
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,800
No no no.

335
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,940
Wait what, why would you even buy that for a local?

336
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,380
Look at Kimura-san. He's blushing.

337
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,350
You mean he's pumped up.

338
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,730
(TL note: Hosei said Kouchyou (blushing) instead of Kouyou (pumped up))

339
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,730
Don't use my lines and make mistakes!

340
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:12,730
Next is the book that Endo thinks Kimura likes.

341
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:19,980
Well before Kimura-san said "I really like maps" and I was surprised about it.

342
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,880
Oh,"Tokyo in the Edo period"

343
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,980
You can see how modern Tokyo and Tokyo in the Edo period compare to each other.

344
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,140
You can compare them!?

345
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,940
I'm also kind of interested as well.

346
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,870
That face!

347
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,500
Your so into it!

348
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:42,780
Endo's book contains a comparison between the old and new Tokyo maps.

349
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:51,130
For a person that enjoys maps and geography it's an absolute sensation.

350
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,530
It looks fun to read.

351
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,780
He says "it looks fun."

352
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,980
He said it.

353
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:05,150
How's Tanaka's book, who's done mediocre so far.

354
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,020
I don't think he likes unnecessary things so...

355
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,830
Ehhhh?!

356
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,460
He's surprised.

357
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,850
Wait is it good or bad?

358
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,790
Ah no no no no.

359
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,620
I've been saved!

360
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,960
Wait really? Is it bad?

361
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,880
I don't do this type of shopping.
(TL note: The book Tanaka got is a book about shopping online, over the phone and through TV)

362
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,980
Come back, there's no point continuing.

363
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,080
What really!?

364
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,580
Last Is Matsumoto's chosen book.

365
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,740
Before the final shooting, Matsumoto is...

366
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:54,250
Isn't this it? A photobook of OOOO

367
00:20:54,270 --> 00:21:01,170
I don't think Kimura will hate this. He'll read this often.

368
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:06,800
In the end, what kind of book did Matsumoto choose?

369
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,350
Lastly, Matsumoto's book. What did he choose for Kimura?

370
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:16,960
I knew that Kimura-san likes maps and Geography. So I thought Endo did a really good job.

371
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,850
So I thought about that fact, and that's why I went with this.

372
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:28,620
Well, it's a photobook.

373
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:37,490
This is a book which shows many photos taken from a helicopter bird's eye view. It enables the reader to see photos that aren't usually able to be seen often.

374
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,670
It's from a bird's eye view.

375
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,670
Woah this feels good.

376
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,570
How is it Endo? what do you mean it feels good?

377
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,430
Well it made me feel good when I looked at it.

378
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,790
Look the airplane's flying! It's from the top of the airplane.

379
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,770
Isn't this good?

380
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,770
It's good.

381
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,760
Isn't this good already?

382
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,970
If you want it this badly just rank it first and read it later.

383
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,930
Oh look its Universal Studios!

384
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,370
That's enough!

385
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,240
Even Haneda is here. Ginza too.

386
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,100
Hurry up you two.

387
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,990
Sakuragi-chou!

388
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,460
Stop making that face!

389
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,590
Hurry up!

390
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,540
Now the announcement! But...

391
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,300
Can I announce the last place first please? I want 2 people to pay for their books.

392
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,730
There are two last places?

393
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,970
Last are...

394
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:49,980
Kimura-san, there was another book called "Encyclopedia of Kyoto." If I had bought that what would have happened?

395
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,170
Well the point is I'm not interested in Kyoto.

396
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,180
He's not interested in Kyoto.

397
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:58,880
Look he's struggling. Everyone is struggling.

398
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,160
Even the cameraman is struggling.

399
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,120
Stop trying to make yourself look better.

400
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,730
It's difficult.

401
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:12,170
What will be Kimura's favorite book?

402
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,060
My favorite is...

403
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,220
this one.

404
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,940
Congratulations! So it was that one huh?

405
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:28,160
It was really interesting Endo, but I'm not that interested in history.

406
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,620
Yeah Kimura, doesn't really look at his past.

407
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,700
That's why he is Batsu 5.

408
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,400
I'm Batsu 4. (TL note: This is a reference to how many times Kimura has married.)

409
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,140
Hosei and Tanaka had to pay for their own items.

410
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,200
Who can you guess correctly then?

411
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,970
I can guess anyone.

412
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,120
I think you know too little.

413
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,920
Maybe Ohnuma-san?
(TL note: One of Gaki's producers)

414
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,050
I don't even want to guess Ohnuma-san's likes.

415
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,310
At least make it a celebrity.
