Here comes a loud voice

5

The first ever Gaki No Tsukai Ya Arahende Chiki Chiki!

6
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,520
Huh? That's not really...

7
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,320
I've always wanted to try this!

8
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,360
Absolutely Tasty Okonomiyaki!

9
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,830
Here we go!

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,130
Can you do that one more time?

11
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,700
He totally didn't put any effort into it!

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,870
They're gonna think you're on the verge of death!

13
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,210
It's been 5 years since the last one!

14
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,210
We haven't done it.

15
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,710
5 years!?

Ah, Really?

24
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,540
Really

25
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,780
We have quite the great theme today

26
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,850
It's Okonomiyaki!

27
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:50,030
Block

28
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:50,030
They must make Okonomiyaki and be judged on a scale of 1-10

29
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:50,030
Using ingredients that they think are absolutely delicious

30
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,680
Yep!

31
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,850
I wanted to complain about something earlier regarding Okonomiyaki

32
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,490
Alright

33
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,490
Okay

34
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,320
It's "Okonomiyaki" but they wouldn't let us do what we wanted

35
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:51,000
TL Note: The Okonomi means "preference"

36
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,060
Your "okonomi"

37
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,160
Even though we can't do what we really want, we have to cook

38
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,200
I get it now

39
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,170
So because of that, you know, like, it's

40
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,740
Say it

41
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,540
Please go ahead

42
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,500
It's impossible!!

43
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,670
Impossible!

44
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,540
It's totally off!

45
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,210
I just thought I'd let out

46
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,910
some of the anger I had towards this food

47
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,650
It's something you all want to do right?

48
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,050
You can do a lot of Okonomiyaki.

49
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,050
Of course I've been thinking about it!

50
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,980
So we're gonna pick a winner at the end?

51
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,020
Yep!

52
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,020
Yeah!

53
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,450
Is that so?

54
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,950
I think there's a punishment as well.

55
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,950
A punishment?

56
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,950
No way...

57
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,950
Punishment?

58
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,760
A punishment for this?

59
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,760
Punishment...

60
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,890
A Skinhead.

61
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,160
Skinhead!?

62
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,030
Skinhead

63
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,030
The one with the lowest score

64
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,160
Can I rethink my menu over?

65
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,030
That's a pretty heavy punishment!

66
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,030
You're right.

Boiled Vegetables  Pork Ribs  Curry Powder

Yellow

79
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,350
Yellow

80
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,640
I see!

81
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Huh?

82
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,680
It's curry.

83
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,610
Curry!?

84
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,120
That's a good idea!

85
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,320
It's not good huh?

86
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,380
It's not good huh?

87
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,950
I think it's smart!

88
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,020
What do you think of him playing it safe like this?

89
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,590
I'm not "playing it safe"

90
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,890
He's really playing it safe, right?

91
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,890
Is that so?

92
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,890
Then we have this

93
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,030
The vegetables

94
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,030
Looks like a lot of fun!

95
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,530
Housei really loves it huh?

96
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,530
He got really interested in it

97
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,600
If this tastes bad then he's out of the running!

98
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,670
I agree...

99
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,470
This is...

100
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,440
I have 2 dishes!

101
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,840
One of the two at the very least...

102
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,210
Wait...

103
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,140
I want to say "Look! It's delicious huh!?"

104
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,880
Yeah well...

105
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,810
So the next one

106
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,810
you challenged yourself, right?

107
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,580
I'm not sure if I challenged myself...

108
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,280
Really?

109
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,280
Please try to

110
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,150
In private he's

111
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,150
always challenging himself, though

112
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,190
When would I ever challenge myself in private

113
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,660
He always says "no, I can do better" in private

114
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,000
Brush on the oil

115
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,400
Oh yeah, I need to do that!

116
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,970
He forgot the oil until right before it's done

117
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,700
He's shaken up

118
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,370
He's shaken up

119
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,970
The oil, huh?

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,200
Yes

146
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,270
Cooking Step 2

147
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,270
Grilling on the stove

148
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,270
Info Box

149
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,300
We're all gonna use it

150
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,930
It's good stuff

151
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,270
So really anything we make should be good

152
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,270
Right

153
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,940
There's a disgusting amount of carrots in this

154
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,700
"A disgusting amount"

155
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,210
It's ok

156
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,440
Following this, He puts the bacon on the grill to cook

157
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,840
Cook it however you like it.

158
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,080
Alright, I'll cook it.

159
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,120
He couldn't even lay it on the grill!!

160
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,850
He couldn't even lay it on the grill!!

161
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,390
What was with that?

162
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,820
Did you see that?

163
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,550
Did you see it?

164
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,720
I saw it!

165
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,720
I saw it!

166
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,960
What was that!?

167
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,960
I sure saw it!

168
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,760
Right here!

169
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,760
You saw it!?

170
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,630
He's so bad at it

171
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,630
So bad

172
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,260
You're wrong!

173
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,160
If this was darts, it would have hit the pool cue resin

174
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,830
The pork stuck to my finger, that's all

175
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,600
It doesn't stick, so

176
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,600
This is scary

177
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Some funny stuff is happening

178
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:54,050
Cooking Step 3

179
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:54,050
Info Box

180
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:54,050
Once one side is
cooked, flip it over

181
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,870
Put the pork rib meat on top

182
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,510
and flip it over when the bottom is cooked

183
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,980
So the perfect dish is 10 points, right?

184
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,850
Usually, yes

185
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,850
Yes

186
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,110
I think

187
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,950
Just for this recipe taking away 4 points

188
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,950
is about right

189
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,290
Since he played it safe

190
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,890
A perfect score would still be a 6

191
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,550
I'm not "playing it safe"

192
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,760
Just using straight up curry

193
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,760
That's right

194
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,860
What the hell...

195
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,190
His personality is coming out

196
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,030
Huh?

197
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,190
He's not yelling at us

198
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,530
He always likes to play it safe

199
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,360
Really?

200
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,360
Really?

201
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,040
When we first started comedy

202
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,040
"We're going with Yoshimoto"  is what he told me

203
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,800
Is that the safe route?

204
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,110
I said Schouchiku was

205
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,110
the best for us

206
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,310
If we went with Shouchiku we wouldn't even exist

207
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,910
Flip it over to check if cooked,

208
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,250
then leave it to finish

209
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,580
So now I'll use this

210
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,090
Ah! Here we go!

211
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,090
Finally, here we go

212
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,250
Ah, right on top

213
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,290
Oh, he's using it like that

214
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,890
Like instead of sauce

215
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:45,660
Cooking Step 4

216
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:45,660
Info Box

217
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:45,660
Pour the curry on top of the cooked okonomiyaki

218
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,460
Exactly

219
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,130
Wait wait wait

220
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,300
So it's a curry sauce?

221
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,400
Of COURSE it's gonna be delicious

222
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,500
He isn't being adventurous at all

223
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,500
Not even a tiny bit adventurous

224
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,440
Curry Okonomiyaki

225
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,440
Hamada's First Dish

226
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,670
Hamada's first item

227
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,440
Curry Okonomiyaki! How does it taste?

228
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:55,910
But really

229
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,710
I am looking forward to it

230
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,180
Looking forward to it?

231
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,650
Of course he is!

232
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,550
I am

233
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,980
Not at...

234
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:02,980
Really?

235
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,880
This'll be exactly what we think it is

236
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,690
It's like

237
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,690
Mori Shinichi  singing "Ofukurosan"!

238
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,490
But isn't this kinda fun?

239
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,490
It is, right?

240
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,660
We get to eat the standard okonomiyaki

241
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,060
So do we eat it just like this?

242
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:22,170
Eat it how you like

243
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
If the curry isn't enough...

244
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,430
Itadakimasu

245
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,430
Itadakimasu

246
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,030
He said "eat it how you like"

247
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,130
That was awful

248
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,700
Isn't it scary?

249
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,570
Isn't it scary?

250
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,340
He said the one word he's not supposed to say

251
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,720
If there's not enough curry, just put more sauce on it

252
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,150
This is it

253
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,390
I mean,

254
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,320
it's good, but

255
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,020
really

256
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,990
it's good

257
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,460
Can I say something quick?

258
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,890
It's really really good!

259
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,930
Sorry to say

260
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,360
It's really really good

261
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,360
It's good, right?

262
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,330
Of course it is, BUT

263
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,030
It tastes good, but

264
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,300
I f we're talking about how challenging it was to create...

265
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:56,740
Right?

266
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,570
We have to think of that

267
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,300
That's what counts

268
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,540
Honestly I could eat 2!!

269
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,910
However...

270
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:02,910
Exactly

271
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,540
That's why it's hard

272
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,440
It's delicious

273
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,380
That's right

274
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,310
If it tastes good it tastes good

275
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,350
Alright, so

276
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,980
Ahhhh

277
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,950
How many points was my okonomiyaki?

278
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:14,990
You see,

279
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,820
In a way it's a 10

280
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,090
You're right

281
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,690
It could even become a product

282
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,690
Right

283
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:21,690
Right

284
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,760
A good product

285
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,830
A delicious one

286
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,830
It's a 10 out of 10

287
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,930
But since he didn't challenge himself how many points should it be

288
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,400
What do you think

289
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,840
5 points for me

290
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,110
What about Tanaka?

291
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,670
I'm thinking 3 points is right

292
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,410
You just said it was really really good!

293
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,250
It's good, but

294
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,180
It's only good because

295
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,180
the curry is delicious

296
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,180
Because the curry is good

297
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,220
That's it

298
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,550
These 3 points

299
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,490
are only there because of the curry.

300
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:54,830
Right

301
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,590
That's why

302
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,960
Tanaka is absolutely right

303
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,960
That's the reason

304
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,930
I was drawn in by the curry

305
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,930
The curry

306
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:01,730
I know that now

307
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,600
Because of the curry...

308
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,800
I know I was pulled in by the curry

309
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,740
Curry Okonomiyaki

310
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,340
Since he didn't challenge himself,

311
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,740
he lost some points, ending with a 4/10

312
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,610
The next item is

313
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,610
This!

314
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:21,490
Basic
Ingredients

315
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:21,490

Yellow

318
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,510
Huh?

319
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,380
He's challenging himself with this one

320
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,950
I can't imagine how it'll be

321
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,850
This is adventurous

322
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,750
You guys all like sanma, right?

323
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,620
I love it

324
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,620
I love it

325
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,620
I love it

326
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,620
It's delicious

327
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,890
Me too, so I really wanna eat this

328
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,060
Is it ok just like that?

329
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,400
The bones and everything?

330
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,930
I see, for calcium

331
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,600
Make the sanma into a minced paste

332
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,600
Cooking Step 1

333
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,600
Info Box

334
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,560
It's good for you

335
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,930
The whole thing?

336
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,630
Even the head

337
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm using the whole thing

338
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,570
So even the internal organs

339
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,210
Yea, the black stuff and everything

340
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:40,870
Everything?

341
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,870
Absolutely everything

342
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,540
That's kinda...

343
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,540
It's salt grilled, right?

344
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,150
That's right

345
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,520
I'll spoon all of this out

346
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,320
At least

347
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,590
It's an adventurous recipe

348
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,290
Right?

349
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,590
That's true

350
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,820
Now there's just this okonomiyaki batter

351
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:07,730

Mix the Minced Paste and Batter Together

354
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,000
It's already coming together

355
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,700
The whole fish

356
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,700
is mixing in well

357
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,430
It really is

358
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,500
What is this gonna taste like?

359
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,570
Put the oil on the pan already!!

360
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,570
I'm doing it right now, ok?

361
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,040
Oil the pan, already!

362
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,040
I'm doing it right now

363
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
He can't learn

364
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,650
You can't say it right before I'm about to

365
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,010
you said it a little too early

366
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,010
No no no

367
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,680
No no no no

368
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,080
You have to do it before that

369
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,080
I see, I see

370
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,120
It'll be fine if I do it now

371
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,120
He really just did it again

372
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,920
Yes he did

373
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,690
He did

374
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,320
See, look

375
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,360
Looks good, right?

He's not using any other ingredients

380
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,230
I'm kinda looking forward to this one

381
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,230
Yea

382
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,200
What'll it taste like

383
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,200
Exactly

384
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,200
Right?

385
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:46,500

add soy sauce for flavor, and it's almost done

390
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,140
Huh? And then...

391
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,540
This is that smell

392
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,010
That smell?

393
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,180
Uh, kamaboko?

394
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,380

You're putting that on while it's grilling, huh

398
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,380
Shouldn't you do that over here?

399
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,850
This is warmed up too, so

400
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,120
It'll get too hot

401
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,120
This

402
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,780
Huh?

403
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,780
This is warmed up too

404
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,790
Is it okay to do it like that?

405
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,520
I have to do it here to get you guys excited

406
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,320
"Excited"?

407
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,090
How's it look?

408
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,000

Okonomiyaki using an entire sanma

416
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,340
How will it taste?

417
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,940
It actually looks like

418
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,410
fish cake when it's like this

419
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,680
Oh yea, it does

420
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,210
Oh, I see

421
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,710
It has the kamaboko, right?

422
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,650
That's why

What the f### is this

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,990
This isn't right

428
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,230
What IS this

429
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,860
It's crunchy, and

430
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,800
the texture of the bones and stuff is the worst

431
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,570
It tastes awful

432
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,940
You really wanted to mess with us, huh

433
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,110
What is this

434
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,380
I feel bad after eating this

435
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,380
Unpleasant

436
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,380
It's unpleasant

437
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,450
I hate this

438
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,450
Hate it?

439
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,980
I hate it too

440
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,480
Honestly

441
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,020
I never wanna eat this again

442
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,990
Me neither

443
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,160
It's cat food

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,320
Cat food

445
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,030
Cats will love this

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,860
1 point

447
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,860
Me too

448
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,160
What's wrong with you?

449
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,000
No no, it's a 1

450
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,970
I'd give it a 1

451
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,770
What gives it the 1 point?

452
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,840
Because it was warm

453
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,600
It was warm?

454
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,570
Yes

455
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,540
That's because it's okonomiyaki, though!

456
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,540
What's wrong with you!

457
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,210
Because he cooked it

458
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,240
Everyone's is warm

459
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,240
It's warm so 1 point

460
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,440
I gave it 1 point because

461
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,910
in middle school we were good friends

462
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,960
Sanma and Grated Daikon Okonomiyaki

463
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,950
The taste and texture was bad

464
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,960
so the rating is 1 point

465
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,930
Absolutely Tasty Okonomiyaki!

00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:57,940
Yellow

473
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,160
It's Mapo Tofu

474
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,000
Looks good

475
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,770
It does

476
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,940
Really, I'm trusting you

477
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,940
So I'll just put this right in

478
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,370
Just putting it straight in

479
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,140
Already

480
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,510

Straight away,

485
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,480
mix the mapo tofu and batter and cook

486
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,020
It's really simple, just like this

487
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,750
Very very simple

488
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,990
For me it's just, I love mapo tofu

489
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,060
Have you always loved it?

490
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,060
Really?

491
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,930
You really didn't know?

492
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,390
No idea

493
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:27,430
In Osaka

494
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,430
I know a really great place to get it

495
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,370
Osaka, huh

496
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,500
Let's go together, Hou-san

497
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,440
I'm good

498
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,400
He doesn't know one in Tokyo

499
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,400
What about Tokyo?

500
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,640
You should know one in Tokyo then

501
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,910
Tokyo...      Nope

502
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:48,250
Cook Both Sides, and Flip

503
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:48,250

505
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,080
Now, after cooking both sides

506
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,910
flip it over, and it's done!

507
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,220
It's really soft since it's tofu

508
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,250
But... This might be pretty good

509
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:54,230
Endou's First Dish

510
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:54,230
Mapo Tofu Okonomiyaki

511
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,760
Endou's first dish, Mapo Tofu Okonomiyaki

512
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,230
How will it taste?

513
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,160
Let's eat

514
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,160
Itadakimasu

515
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,160
Itadakimasu

516
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,460
The tofu is surprisingly unchanged

517
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,830
Here we go

518
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,640
How is it?

519
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,770
It's alright

520
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,110
It's not bad but, it lacks flavor

521
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,550
There's not enough oomph

522
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,550
It's just alright

523
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,410
Unfortunately

524
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,450
It's too bad

525
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,380
I see

526
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,550
It's really unfortunate

527
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,550
Something's missing

528
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,450
So how many points does it get?

529
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,250
Can I say it?

530
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:21,790
Please

531
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,390
6 Points

532
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,060
Oh, Thank you

533
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,720
I also give it a 6

534
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,460
Thank you

535
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,430
Is it really even a 6?

536
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,960
I personally wanted a little bit more from it, so

537
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,170
5 Points

538
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,800
5 points, huh

539
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,400
Hamada-san?

540
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,600
5 Points

541
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,170
Oh, really?

542
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,140
That was a pleasant surprise

543
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,970
Very pleasant

544
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,840
I thought he'd give me a 2 or 3

545
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:51,280
After all he's the only one who ate all of it

546
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,210
You even ate all of it for me

547
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,280
After saying it was just a 5

548
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:57,290
Mapo Tofu Okonomiyaki

549
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
After Hamada ate every last bite

550
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,290
The highest score so far, 5 points!

551
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,720
Now my second dish

552
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,730
It's Protein Okonomiyaki

553
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,430
Wait, I don't wanna eat this

554
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,900
It doesn't look the least bit appetizing

555
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,570
Basic
Ingredients

556
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,570
Protein Chicken Tenderloin Broccoli

557
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,570
Yellow

558
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,570
Yellow

559
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,900
I don't want this!

560
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,470
The first impression is...

561
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,100
If this turns out good

562
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,810
It'll be revolutionary

563
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,810
True

564
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,810
In the fitness industry

565
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,310
this could be it

566
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,140
Then you two can eat it all

567
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,250
No no no

568
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,980
You don't look like you'd hate that

569
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,950
If it was good

570
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,150
Yea, he looks like he'd like it

571
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,850
The fact that you could get so much protein would be great

572
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,850
Exactly!

573
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,850
Really?

574
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,390
That's why I'm using it

575
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,720
It doesn't look like it'll have flavor or texture

576
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,720
Right

577
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,720
It'll have texture

578
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,390
Yea, it's lacking something

579
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,390
Ok, first of all

580
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,000
Without flour, just using this

581
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,130
Without using flour

582
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,360
Correct

583
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,900
He can't just use flour

584
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,230
Right

585
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,830
That wouldn't be good would it?

586
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,830
No, it wouldn't

587
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:47,240
Instead of using flour, protein will be the base

588
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,700
Seriously?

589
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:47,970
There we go

590
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,310
This is kinda gross

591
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,310
4 cups of it

592
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,140
What is this...

593
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,380
Put in 4 cups

594
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,480
Matsumoto-san probably already knows, but

595
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,010
Chicken Tenderloin

596
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,350
Chicken tenderloin, you definitely have to eat chicken

597
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,380
Eat lots of chicken tenderloin

598
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,350
Eat chicken tenderloin

599
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,290
Broccoli is good, too

600
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,290
It makes you feel full after as well

601
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,820
Endou, just

602
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,760
Go to Matsumoto's house and make it there

603
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,790
I agree

604
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,230
Right?

605
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:07,760
Yes

606
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,960
What is this?

607
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,600
This is soy milk

608
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,470
Soy milk is good for you too

609
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,530
Soy milk?

610
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,470
I see I see

611
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,600
It's important

612
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,100
It is important

613
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,640
And then,

614
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,370
He's not the least bit interested

615
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,680
Now the egg

616
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,680
Next is egg

617
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,410
You got a strange assistant, there

618
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,170
A strange assistant

619
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,310
Actually, the egg white alone might be good for this

620
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,310
The truth is yes

621
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,410
You're very well versed, that's actually true

622
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,650
Now we're a protein show

623
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,650
A protein show

624
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:42,990
Cooking Step 1

625
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:42,990
Info Box

626
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:42,990
Mix the Ingredients Together

627
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:42,990
Protein Chicken Tenderloin Broccoli Soy Milk Egg

628
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:39,520
Whenever you try to lose weight, you never really feel full, so

629
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,930
If this turns it good, it'll be a great innovation

630
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,330
They don't care at all

631
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,430
What are you eating over there?

632
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,430
Gum

633
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,370
You a big leaguer, or something?

634
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,710
Okay, here I go

635
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,410
This is the nail in the coffin for them, Endou

636
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,480
Right

637
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,210
Like Kinni-kun and Kasuga

638
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:06,120
Nakayama
Kinni-kun

639
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:06,120
Toshiaki Kasuga

640
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,910
That's right

641
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,120
That's a narrow target, huh

642
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,120
It really is

643
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,790
After Cooking One Side, Flip it Over

644
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,790
Cooking Step 2

645
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,790
Info Box

646
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,420
The perfect diet Okonomiyaki

647
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,560
But will it be delicious?

648
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,760
Doesn't it look pretty good?

649
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,090
It does

650
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,860
It looks, and smells, like garbage

651
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,860
Come on now

652
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,830
Look how well-cooked!

653
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,370
It looks nice and crispy

654
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,370
Smells awful!!

655
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,370
It smells

656
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,570
It doesn't smell bad at all!

657
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,570
It smells really bad

658
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,570
This awful smell...

659
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,440
You know in your heart it smells awful

660
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,410
It doesn't at all

661
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,840
It does you liar!

662
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,780
Does it?

663
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,780
It smells awful

664
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,910
If I were to describe to smell to the viewers

665
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,790
Burnt skin is the fragrance

666
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:46,760
Endou's
Second Dish

667
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:46,760
Protein Okonomiyaki

668
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,960
Finally, after brushing on some protein mixed with water

669
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,760
it's ready to eat!

670
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,590
Alright

671
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,890
Alright, this is a taste

672
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,360
Here's a taste of it

673
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,160
Itadakimasu

674
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,700
Itadakimasu

675
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,700
Itadakimasu

676
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,700
Itadakimasu

677
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,630
It's hard

678
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,630
It's true

679
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,900
Is it the chicken?

680
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,900
It's stiff as a board

681
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,500
What is this?

682
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,540
I thought this part would be softer but it's the hardest part

683
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,640
It's really hard

684
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,640
What is this?

685
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,810
Uwah. It's tough...

686
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,410
It's so dry

687
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,780
What the hell is this?

688
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,580
Gross

689
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,580
It's rough

690
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,150
This is just stupid

691
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,050
It's not even food

692
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,560
It's no good

693
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,900
We can all just give this a 1, right?

694
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,700
Well

695
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,700
Yes

696
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,930
It really gets all in between your gums

697
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,600
I can't get it off of my gums

698
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,770
This is a crazy result

699
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,770
This was a mistake

700
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,270
That it's so dry

701
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,980
There's not enough oil

702
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,250
Oh yea, maybe it's the oil

703
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,310
It's really hard to swallow

704
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,310
Now I see

705
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,820
It's trying to become my gums

706
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,850
In general it's just...

707
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,490
As soon as I took a bite it started trying

708
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,460
Screaming "UWAAAAAH" as it turned into gums

709
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,700
Is that so?

710
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,700
It really sticks

711
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,760
This was no good

712
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:04,740
Protein Okonomiyaki

713
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,370
With its pointless adventurousness,

714
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,740
It get's the lowest score, a single skull!

715
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:11,040
Curry

716
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:11,040
Endou Shouzou

717
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:11,040
Hamada Masatoshi

718
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:11,040
Mapo Tofu

719
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:11,040
Protein

720
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:11,040
Sanma

721
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:11,040
The Absolutely Tasty Okonomiyaki Challenge!

722
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,010
Here's the scores up to this point

723
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,040
Up next is Tanaka's dishes!

724
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,940
As for me...

725
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
I'll be using this.

726
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,580
Basic
Ingredients

727
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,580
Salmon
Shimeji and Enoki Mushrooms

728
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,580
Yellow

729
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,580
Yellow

730
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,110
These

731
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,110
You didn't cook the sanma!

732
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:18,680
Hold your horses

733
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,650
It's salmon

734
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,690
I'll cook it with foil

735
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,990
Aluminum Foil-Cooked Okonomiyaki

736
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,660
It's gonna be good

737
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,660
That's what it is?

738
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,260
You said yaki twice

739
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,990
First I'll put it all in raw and wrap it up

740
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,800
and then steam it

741
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,230
Steamed Okonomiyaki, you see

742
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,830
Sealing in the flavor

743
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,240
withing the foil

744
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,140
Is that gonna be good?

745
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,140
Steamed Okonomiyaki

746
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,510
Steamed Okonomiyaki

747
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,510
So you're not grilling it

748
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,570
Right, no grilling

749
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,940
I'm steaming it

750
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,750
Isn't it innovative?

751
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,580
You are coming out of the gate with something new

752
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,580
Right

753
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,180
Steaming it

754
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,660
Cooking Step 1

755

Info Box

756
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,660
Spread the Batter on the Aluminum Foil

757
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,650
The concept has kinda changed now

758
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,020
A little bit

759
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,490
So that's how, huh

760
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,660
He's an idea man

761
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,420
Idea man

762
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,230
That's our Tanaka

763
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:15,610
Cooking Step 2

764
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:15,610
Info Box

765
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:15,610
Lay the Ingredients on Top, and Wrap the Foil

766
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,760
Put the salmon and mushrooms on top,

767
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,230
and add flavor with soy sauce and butter

768
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,370
Then wrap it all in the foil

769
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,700
This quickly becomes like this

770
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,610
Keeping it all in

771
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,610
That's right, folding the sides

772
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,280
This is interesting

773
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,810
It is, right?

774
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,140
Is this still okonomiyaki?

775
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,140
It's still okonomiyaki

776
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:26,120
Cooking Step 3

777
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:26,120
Info Box

778
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:26,120
Place It on the Grill, and Steam-Cook

779
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,110
And now,

780
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,310
And you don't need any oil, right?

781
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,310
right on top

782
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,780
You don't need any oil, so

783
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,920
Now we wait 20 minutes

784
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,650
That's so long!!

785
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,650
I'm not waiting!!

786
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,920
Just 20 minutes

787
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,320
I don't wanna wait

788
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,330
It's a 30 minute TV show

789
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,560
Wait, I know

790
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,760
While it's cooking,

791
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,170
I'll prepare the next dish

792
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,130
And now, the second dish

793
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,170
is this right here

794
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,470
Perfect for the season

795
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:52,310
Basic
Ingredients

796
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:52,310
Chilled
Chinese Noodles

797
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:52,310
Yellow

798
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:52,310
Yellow

799
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,140
Chilled noodles

800
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,610
The perfect summer dish, Chilled Noodles

801
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,170
Yes

802
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,310
Some people might think I'm playing it safe with this, but

803
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,110
Of course

804
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,950
I'll specially prepare this with the chilled noodles in mind

805
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,450
So I'm not just playing it safe

806
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,220
I think this is a good idea, Tanaka

807
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,690
It's good, right?

808
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,990
Right?

809
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,890
Really challenging yourself

810
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,190
I am

811
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:06,760
I'll mix this

812
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,660
Mixing it all, huh

813
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,190
Mixing it all together

814
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:15,570
Cooking Step 1

815
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:15,570
Info Box

816
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:15,570
Mix the Chilled Noodles and Batter Together

817
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,560
This isn't Okonomiyaki, Tanaka

818
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,700
No no no no no

819
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,860
It's of course not finished yet

820
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,570
Just keep watching

821
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,940
OK, now

822
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,140
The oil already

823
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,500
The oil already

824
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,300
Yes sir

825
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,080
Whoever forgets to put the oil on next

826
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,080
will be fined 500,000 yen, got it?

827
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,910
Seriously, though

828
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,780
Alright, now I'll pour this on the grill

829
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:41,690
Cooking Step 2

830
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:41,690

831
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:41,690
Spread on the Grill and Cook

832
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,450
I hope it's not acidic

833
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,690
That will be the decider

834
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,020
Alright, it's good like this

835
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,830
Because tomatoes add acidity, so

836
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,430
So I'm cooking this one right now

837
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,670
but when it's done,

838
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,670
Since it's chilled noodles

839
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,000
I'd like to cool it in a fridge

840
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,770
Now

841
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,870
How long is that gonna take?

842
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,840
2 Hours

843
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,740
2 hours?!

844
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,110
Are you stupid?

845
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,610
Cooking Step 3

846
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,610

Info Box

848
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,370
Of course he'd call you stupid

849
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,280
Look,

850
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,610
You're taking up too much time

851
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,580
I actually came early

852
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,210
Oh good

853
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,210
I came and made one already

854
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,150
Good thing you did

855
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,320
I cooked and chilled one already, so

856
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,050
Right, here it is

857
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,090
It's already...

858
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,750
Is it cold?

859
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,290
Yeah it is

860
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:12,860
Ah, It's cold!

861
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:18,830
Chilled Chinese Noodle Okonomiyaki

862
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:18,830
Tanaka's First Dish

863
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,430
Perfect for the summer season,

864
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,830
Chilled Chinese Noodle Okonomiyaki! How will it taste?

865
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,530
It's already completely chilled

866
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,530
Actually, Tanaka

867
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,400
I'm all for it, now

868
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,400
Oh really?

869
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,740
Me too

870
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,740
Shouldn't it be pretty good?

871
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,940
Right?

872
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,440
Since it's cold, it doesn't have a smell either

873
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,780
To start,

874
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,210
Try it just as it is

875
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,010
Really?

876
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,010
Yea

877
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,550
Some sauce

878
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,280
That's where it'll go wrong

879
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,520
is already inside, so

880
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,220
Please eat it as it is!

881
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,050
Chilled Okonomiyaki

882
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,390
See...

883
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,390
Since eating it hot is...

884
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,130
It's too tough

885
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,130
the standard

886
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,130
This is no good

887
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,830
No good

888
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,300
Stupid Bad

889
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,470
Absolutely no taste

890
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,470
This is awful

891
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,170
It's just unpleasant

892
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,610
No taste

893
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,610
Seriously? Is it that bad?

894
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,210
There's no taste

895
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,210
I'm telling you, it's bad

896
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,810
Isn't it probably because it's cold?

897
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,810
That's the problem

898
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,610
Right?

899
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:11,050
This is one step away from Raw Garbage

900
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,850
If my mom gave me this for lunch during summer vacation

901
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,660
I'd smash her glasses, I think

902
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,130
Chilled Chinese Noodle Okonomiyaki

903
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,330
Chilling it caused it to backfire,

904
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,130
and with no flavor, it received 2 points!

905
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,800
After this!

906
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,800
Tanaka's Foil-Cooked Okonomiyaki!

907
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,000
Tanaka's own dish

908
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,800
How will it turn out?

909
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,210
Foil-Cooked Okonomiyaki

910
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,210
Tanaka's Second Dish

911
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,600
Tanaka's own dish, foil-cooked okonomiyaki

912
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,210
How will it turn out?

913
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,370
It's steamed okonomiyaki

914
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,370
Steamed, huh

915
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,370
Hmmm

916
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,880
Thank you

917
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,880
The warm area

918
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,880
"Not grilled, but steamed"

919
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,780
Here it is!

920
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,980
So it's not grilled at all

921
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,710
Take a look at this

922
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,680
So it's not crispy, either

923
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,680
Correct

924
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,720
Look!

925
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,020
It actually cooked

926
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,660
It smells really good

927
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,950
It is a nice smell

928
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,660
It smells really good

929
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,020
You're right

930
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,890
I got way too much salmon

931
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,630
I got most of it

932
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,930
Can we already it eat?

933
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,730
As you like

934
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,370
Green onions

935
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,400
He said As you like even after last time!!

936
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,600
I had to

937
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,600
Of course he would

938
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,600
Of course

939
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,270
Try adding some ponzu

940
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,210
We're using ponzu?

941
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,210
Yes

942
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,010
Add some ponzu

943
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:11,640
Right now?

944
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,780
Right away?

945
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,780
Well

946
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,040
We should try it without, right?

947
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,380
Alright, try it as it is first

948
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,380
I already used it

949
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,820
He's beaten up

950
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,520
I already used it, too

951
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,520
It's fine

952
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,250
Just try it as it is

953
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,160
I found a bone

954
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,990
It should be packed with flavor

955
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,990
Itadakimasu

956
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,230
Disgusting...

957
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,840
First time someone used the bucket

958
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,670
The first bucket of the day

959
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,810
Isn't it still uncooked?

960
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,880
It feels like

961
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,910
I'm eating straight up flour

962
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,850
It's coarse

963
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,750
Seriously?

964
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,350
I'll try adding some of this

965
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,550
As you like

966
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,550
Excuse me

967
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,990
It's getting worse
and worse for him

968
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:57,620
Green On Screen Box

969
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,560
"As you like" Said Twice

970
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,260
That'll be 1,000,000 Yen, two 500,000 fines

971
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,500
"As you like" Said Twice

972
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,500
Didn't Put the Oil On

973
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,130
And you forgot the oil earlier so 1,500,000 Yen

974
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,230
Fine

975
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,230
¥1,000,000

976
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,230
¥1,500,000

977
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,230
¥500,000

978
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,700
You better have it by next week

979
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,530
Skull, skull

980
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,800
This gets a skull

981
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,610
Next week as a skinhead you're gonna

982
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,610
have to bring 1,500,000 Yen  with you

983
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,570
Yea

984
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,740
There's no way I can

985
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,740
Seriously

986
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,740
No way, huh?

987
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,740
There's no way

988
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,730
NEXT WEEK

989
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,730
Next week!

990
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,800
The Absolutely Tasty Okonomiyaki Challenge, Part 2!

991
00:23:36,390 --> 00:24:03,690
Next Week Absolutely Tasty Okonomiyaki! Final Part

992
00:23:36,390 --> 00:24:09,730
This video was brought to you by Tofu Panda Fansubs

993
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,830
Housei will introduce his pickled ingredients

994
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,240
So good!

995
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,000
What happened!

996
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,840
However, Tanaka thinks...

997
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,740
Isn't there a bit too much *****

998
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,950
And then, Matsumoto comes up with a new dish!

999
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,850
Will this be edible?

1000
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,050
We'll find out if it's edible

1001
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,690
Don't miss it!

1002
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,590
If my mom called me for lunch during summer vacation

1003
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,520
and gave me this

1004
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,730
I think I'd smash her glasses
