1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,600
Ooooh.....delicious!

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:10,980
Continuing from last week, with special guest Umemiya Tatsuo,
Sushzanmai challenge finale.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,580
Delicious!

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:19,000
The rule: They can advance if they finish the Tuna Set.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,800
They win 100,000 yen if they make it past all 31 stores.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,500
But it ends if one person gives up,
and they must pay for all food eaten so far.

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,860
I want to eat so much!

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,140
I'll make it to 31 today.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,740
Fired up by Yamasaki's passion for winning,
the five have no problem advancing.

10
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,120
But at the 10th store, Yamasaki's confession:

11
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,370
I'm already feeling full.

12
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,000
Just let me take a little break.

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,000
Break?

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,720
I'll still take part of course, but,

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,590
What the hell are you saying?!

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,590
Will they be able to finish?!
Finally, the finale!

17
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:12,690

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,160
After Yamasaki's confession, the bus heads to the 11th store.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,160
Nishikicho

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,160
Tsukishima

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,900
Can you show the total?

22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,640
After the 10th store, this is how you all are doing.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,300
Hmm?

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,100
Hosei-san and I

25
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,280
I'm eating so much!

26
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,750
20 is the highest.

27
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,150
After all that talk, you guys are stuffing me!

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,290
It doesn't change.

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,290
Yeah.

30
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,060
What do you mean by "Stuffing" you?

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,200
Everyone is eating at the same rate,

32
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,200
you're not being stuffed.

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,040
Who, what are you talking about

34
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:55,010
Yama-chan, being dead serious, how are you feeling right now?

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,010
Dead serious?

36
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,310
Probably,

37
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,900
Five

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,020
Five?

39
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,020
Five

40
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:13,440
Everyone, Yama-chan can only do five more stores.

41
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,500
Yama-chan, excuse me, let's put that aside a second,

42
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,740
What if at this store, we said "Yama-chan can have the Akami?"

43
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,770
Seven.

44
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,400
You're not eating at all!

45
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,000
Seven, he says.

46
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,300
While Yamasaki confesses his weakness,

47
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,360
they reach the 11th store in Tsukishima.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,560
So please go ahead and decide.

49
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,600
Since nobody wants to choose the fatty Sushi, a new rule is introduced.

50
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:57,000
Everyone chooses one Sushi from the five available here,
and if nobody matches, they eat what they chose.

51
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,540
But, if there is a match, there is an extra piece of that sushi.

52
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,040
I'll go for this.

53
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,240
I see, going for that at this point.

54
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,660
Everyone have you chosen? Here we go.

55
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,320
Alright!

56
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,750
2nd time Cocorico-san have matched.

57
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,940
Don't choose chu-toro!

58
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,930
Hosei-san, unexpectedly, Aburi-toro.

59
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,000
Exactly! Yeah!

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Extra Chu-toro.

61
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,780
Fatty specialty Aburi-toro, Sushizanmai's Tuna Set is ready.

62
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,140
OK, thank you let's do this.

63
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,600
So everyone eat what you need to.

64
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Our choice right?

65
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
The Chu-toro.

66
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Itadakimasu!

67
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,140
So, the Otoro is left,

68
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,060
I'll get both of those.

69
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,600
And Tanaka-san?

70
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,600
The Otoro for Yama-chan-

71
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,600
I'll go for this.

72
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,380
TN: Hosei cheats and eats the smaller roll instead.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,380
He ate it quickly.

74
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,660
Already in his mouth.

75
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,000
Tanaka-san gets left with the heavy stuff

76
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,740
OK, finished!

77
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,740
We're going so fast!

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,740
OK everyone, we're heading to Tsukiji.

79
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,700
Finally Tsukiji.

80
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,200
How's everyone's stomachs doing?

81
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,040
Mine, like, became alright.

82
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,120
You can help out now?

83
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,990
You're feeling better?

84
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,120
Yup.

85
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,350
If you got your excitement back, how far can you go?

86
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,380
Currently it's limitless.

87
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,800
The guy who said it was 5 stores earlier, now it's limitless?

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,800
Yes.

89
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,820
I guess, it was building up.

90
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,100
Cause you guys were stuffing me.

91
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,460
We're eating the same.

92
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,960
Everyone, we've arrived.

93
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,340
So everyone,

94
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,920
we're finally at Tsukji.

95
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Everyone, look at that billboard

96
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,730
Right under the billboard, there's a map,

97
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,680
Those are stores right?

98
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,520
Those stores, we're gonna go to all of those

99
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,680
Amazing!

100
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,640
So everyone let's head this way.

101
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,550
There are nine stores nearby in this area.

102
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,680
If they can make it past here, the prize money will be in reach!

103
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,720
First off, the 12th store, Sushizanmai Honjin.

104
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
So everyone, first off,

105
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,900
make your choices.

106
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,750
Going for this.

107
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,360
This one, if I go for this one,

108
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,540
OK, here we go!

109
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,760
Ready, set.....go!

110
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,840
The Chu-toro matched!

111
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,880
What are you doing?!

112
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,300
Cocorico-san's third match.

113
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,000
Up until now, the duo Cocorico has matched three times.

114
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,280
And Yamasaki has matched Umemiya an unexpected five times.

115
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,300
This right?

116
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,410
Otoro for Hamada-san right?

117
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,100
Ah, tasty!

118
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,500
Hamada-san ... oh he got the Tekka-maki.

119
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
What about the last two?

120
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,930
You're having the Aburi?

121
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,490
Amazing!

122
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,860
Tatsuo-nii is having the Aburi, look Yama-chan.

123
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,780
Let's take a break.

124
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,650
No, we gotta keep going.

125
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,320
Everyone had theirs.

126
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
I can help you out

127
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,220
Let him do it himself.

128
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,160
Thank you so much.

129
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,600
You're supposed to tell him, "no, I can handle it myself."

130
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,600
But the Senpai wants to eat.

131
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,960
Finished!

132
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,180
You said you were hungry!

133
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,800
Still in the Tsukiji area,
close to the head store, Okunoin.

134
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,320
This is it here?

135
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,160
A good distance.

136
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,420
OK, I gotta decide between these.

137
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,100
Yeah you have to think about the other's choices.

138
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,560
Yeah.

139
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,000
Balance is important.

140
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,000
It is.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,720
Place them in the middle, have you decided?

142
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,820
Here we go - ready, set...flip!

143
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,000
Otoro and Akami matches!

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You idiots!

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,720
This is the third time Hamada-san and Hosei-san have matched on Akami

146
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,320
Please!

147
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,140
Again you chose that.

148
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,140
Why did you pick Akami now?

149
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,140
That's my line!

150
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,540
Sorry for the wait.

151
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,640
(Excited Crosstalk)

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,620
Uwahh there's so many.

153
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,020
It's delicious!

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,400
Tekka, Tekka, Tekka,
Endo-san and Hamada-san, oh and Hosei-san.

155
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,910
Yama-chan, take the negitoro.

156
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:44,060
If anyone can eat another one.

157
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,720
I've got such a big one here

158
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,740
Yes we can see-

159
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,740
Ahhhhhhh!

160
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,240
Wait someone, take this!

161
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,640
C'mon, you can handle that tiny Tekka.

162
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,560
Seriously?

163
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,930
Yamasaki somehow manages his three pieces.

164
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,760
They head for the next store.

165
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,060
Right now.

166
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,980
Everyone, we've arrived.

167
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,880
It's this Shinkan store here.

168
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,880
Eh? Next door?

169
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,300
Are they attached?

170
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,840
Shinkan is here.

171
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,840
Is this attached?

172
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,000
Just 10 metres away, they reach the 14th store, Shinkan.

173
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,940
That last meal packed a punch, I'm just saying.

174
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,760
Everyone's feeling it, everyone is.

175
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,760
Endo is barely eating.

176
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,760
I'm at the top of the scoreboard!

177
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,760
Nah you haven't eaten.

178
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,740
I ate so much.

179
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,880
Right? Endo hasn't eaten.

180
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,080
Then fine I'll eat here.

181
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,080
Okay do that.

182
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,820
Are you ready? Have you chosen?

183
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,240
Here we go.  Ready, set... flip!

184
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,360
Three aburi-toro!

185
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,760
You guys are idiots.

186
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,760
YOU GOT THE AKAMI AGAIN!

187
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,390
You have to eat two extra again, as a penalty.

188
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,720
Please wait.

189
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,720
This and those.

190
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:10,460
Please, you will make your junior cry with such a request.

191
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,460
Please dig in!

192
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,400
The Aburi...

193
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,400
This is the Otoro right.

194
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,280
There's so much volume.

195
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,520
I'm going for the rolls again.

196
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,100
Please, allow me a roll as well.

197
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,540
Tatsu-nii, you can have the roll too.

198
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,600
Only Hosei-san left.

199
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,700
Hamada-san, I promise, for now,

200
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,460
I won't chose Akami again in the future.

201
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,950
This time, can I just eat ginger?

202
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,950
Are you an idiot?

203
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:57,960
Just take it, and hurry up eat the Otoro too,
No time for breaks.

204
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,080
Then, promise me something please.

205
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,080
What the hell?

206
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:10,630
If I eat this, the next two times, help me out.

207
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,230
Can I just eat the Tekka?

208
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,770
A single Tekka each time.

209
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,540
But everyone-

210
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,540
Then screw it! It's impossible!

211
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,060
Stuffing me.

212
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,060
Hurry up and eat it man!

213
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,600
But, please help me out.

214
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,960
Help? I'll have to consider the situation.

215
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,930
C'mon, someone please say they'll save me.

216
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:36,160
Just that will put my mind at ease.

217
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,130
Then, I'll save you.

218
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,100
For real?

219
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,050
I'll help you.

220
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:42,950
Hurry up.

221
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
For real right?

222
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
OKAY.

223
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,700
Finished!

224
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:00,300
And finally, the Sushizanmai Head Store, the 15th one today.

225
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,500
Yama-chan, the next store is the headquarters.

226
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,190
If you drink a lot of Sake here, you'll be in good shape.

227
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,580
How about some Head Store commerative sake?

228
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:20,280
If you guys will rescue me, I'll think about it.

229
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,280
What do you mean rescue?

230
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,800
There it is!

231
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,800
The president?

232
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,400
The president was waiting for us.

233
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,360
Wow!

234
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,000
What do you guys think?

235
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,990
Butcher Show

236
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,990
It's huge!

237
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,390
It's very big indeed.

238
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:50,440
The guy cutting is Sushizanmai's president, Kimura-shachou.

239
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:50,440
Kiyoshi Kimura - President

240
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,320
Probaly 200kg.

241
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,180
Ah that's how it is.

242
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,180
They're sawing this way.

243
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,840
We chose the best Tuna the vendor had.

244
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,840
There's a lot of fat, especially here there's a lot.

245
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,780
Shall we go?

246
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,670
The president came out for us.

247
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,390
Welcome!

248
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,490
Thank you very much!

249
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,140
Sushizanmai Head Store.

250
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,780
We're here!

251
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,400
We finally made it here.

252
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,580
We're here.

253
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,320
Everyone, choose please.

254
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,300
Have you chosen? Hosei-san?

255
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,420
OK, then let's go
1 ... 2 GO

256
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,960
Akami, Chutoro, both matched.

257
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,360
Why do I gotta match with Hamada-san?

258
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,900
Look at the fresh Akami.

259
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,000
Going into the Sushi is of course, the Tuna the president just butchered.

260
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,960
So everyone, to mark this occasion...

261
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,260
Well done! Kampai!

262
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,000
Here everyone refreshes themselves with some alcohol.

263
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,080
So quick.

264
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Tekka right away.

265
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,750
Shozo?

266
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,540
The head store's Otoro, it doesn't get better.

267
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,540
Exactly, it's a luxury.

268
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:05,460
As Endo enjoys his rich Otoro, the 15th store is cleared!

269
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,520
But then!

270
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,920
Alright everyone, a special treat,

271
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,920
A special service for you!

272
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,970
The president's special service!

273
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,900
TN:  From the Tuna's jaw, Kamatoro is exceptionally fatty

274
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,480
It's kamatoro!

275
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,820
Wait...

276
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,200
Wait-hold on-

277
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,640
Does the president understand what we're doing here?

278
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,290
If we can't finish, the next store is cut.

279
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,290
We can't do that!

280
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,340
You can have one each

281
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,260
Thank you very much, president.

282
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,520
We don't get to eat this often.

283
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,540
Yes, very rare.

284
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,450
Hmmpg MMm yum

285
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,760
Everyone manages to finish the president's kamatoro.

286
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,180
Next the 16th store, Sushizanmai Tsukiji Rotary Sushi.

287
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,800
And there's another store just 10 metres away.

288
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,320
You've got to be kidding me.

289
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,260
Let's go.

290
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,360
Not stopping to catch a breath,
The cards they chose?

291
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,520
Akami, ootoro, aburi, negitoro...

292
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,520
...akami!

293
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,800
How many times?!

294
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,800
Damn it, Yama-chan!

295
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Can't you think of anything else?

296
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,000
Hosei-san and Hamda-san matched.

297
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,500
With everyone struggling, they eat their chosen Sushi.

298
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,820
Only one left, Yamasaki.

299
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,820
Hosei-san still hasn't eaten his Akami.

300
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,820
In fact, he hasn't poured his soy sauce yet.

301
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,440
Shozo, make him hurry up, we gotta get to the next store.

302
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,440
There's not much time.

303
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,690
Sorry, but we're all trying our best.

304
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,030
If we don't get past this, No listen,

305
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,030
You didn't help me out.

306
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,700
I will help you.

307
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,080
I'll save you next time.

308
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,540
You will definitely help me next time?

309
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,000
I wil definitely help you

310
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,520
Did you hear that?

311
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,400
It depends on whether or not you can believe him.

312
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,400
At the next place, I will give Hosei-san one thing I cannot finish.

313
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,430
Please actually help me.

314
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,600
I will definitely do that, definitely.

315
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,700
For sure?

316
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,600
Then I'll eat this.

317
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,360
The things this man does are so different from what he says.

318
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,880
Finshed! Thank you very much! Next store!

319
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,880
This store here.

320
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Hosei-san, we're going!

321
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,240
The 17th store, Sushizanmi Chuoko Bekkan.

322
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,380
It's Bekkan!

323
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,880
Let's go!

324
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,500
Everyone has heavy steps.

325
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,500
Hosei-san!

326
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,260
Yama-chan, what's your status?

327
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,770
Just impossible now.

328
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,770
What do you mean?

329
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,180
Do you give up?

330
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,180
Not a give up, but,

331
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,920
Here, Vacuum

332
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,840
Cause this is the halfway point, right?

333
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:42,580
A chance of two seperate cards, if you get the Vaccum, Fujiwara will eat all the tuna.

334
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,880
However, the other card,

335
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,640
A loss.

336
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:48,640
Loss -> Everyone Eats Together

337
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
It's not unconditional?

338
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,060
Who said it's not?

339
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,060
That is not on.

340
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,020
Cause there's a chance to win here.

341
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,670
Yama-chan, do you want to take it?

342
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,920
Yama-chan will try the vacuum challenge.

343
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,920
Choose well.

344
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,840
Shall I go?

345
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,560
Sorry,

346
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,740
This is the most important part.
The performance.

347
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,100
Just slam the card on the table.

348
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,880
A failure!

349
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,380
No vacuum chance for you!

350
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,160
So everyone, choose your card.

351
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,920
No retries?

352
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,540
Look at Hosei-san.

353
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,010
He looks like Hanagata from "Kyojin no Hoshi."

354
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,170
The Tuna on his head...

355
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,300
The bangs.
The tuna is like his bangs.

356
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,660
Yama-chan, choose.

357
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,440
How many did I eat?

358
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,460
Everyone ate a lot!

359
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,860
Housei-san-

360
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,860
I ate THIRTY ONE!

361
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,200
31 pieces is the same as 31 stores.

362
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,200
11 stores.

363
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,260
Everyone's amount is around the same.

364
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,240
It's the same.

365
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,280
Here we go..........ready, flip.

366
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,720
Akami matched!

367
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,120
Hosei-san this is unacceptable.

368
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,260
How many times is this?

369
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,260
I'm eating so much.

370
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,060
Everyone is eating.

371
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:28,590
Endo didn't eat.

372
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,590
I just saved you Hosei-san, one store back.

373
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,720
You did.

374
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,920
I believed he was gonna help me here.

375
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,620
He said he definitely would.

376
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,500
I mean next episode.

377
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,380
During the next series.

378
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,520
I'm still fine with that.

379
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,520
Alright, here we go.

380
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,640
Hosei-san, could you take your Akami?

381
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You see it right there, right?

382
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,360
Everyone is finished.

383
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,620
Oh, he's going for it!  That was speedy.

384
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,140
Good, keep up that tempo.

385
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,240
Yama-chan, finish this, and use the vacuum chance again.

386
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,830
I'm in agony.

387
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
We're also suffering.

388
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,620
We really are.

389
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,120
Well done, finished!
Next store!

390
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,060
Your footsteps are heavy!

391
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,180
This is really tough.

392
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,600
With heavier footsteps than the other four, Yamasaki....

393
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,540
"I'm so hungry!"

394
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:52,770
"I'll make it to the 31st store"

395
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,460
A different Yamasaki,

396
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,920
is present now.

397
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,600
I don't wanna see the store.

398
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,600
The next store, Rotary Sushizanmai Tsukiji 2nd Store.

399
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,180
Time for Sushi again.

400
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,140
Let's go.

401
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,180
Yama-chan, use the card again.

402
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,420
Yes again.

403
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,720
Should I?

404
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,760
It's up to you, Yama-chan.

405
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,260
So Hosei-san?

406
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,940
Yama-chan, please pull the "vacuum" card.

407
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,120
Grab it please.

408
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,000
Please, the vacuum.

409
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,190
Ready, Hosei-san?

410
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,080
Go ahead!

411
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,120
How unfortunate!

412
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,450
I give up.

413
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,450
It's over!  He said it!

414
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:17,020
Yamasaki pays everyone's bill!

415
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:23,340
So the total is: 33,989 yen, Hosei-san.

416
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,280
Unfortunatley, whoever gives up must pay.

417
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,720
He isn't speaking a single word.

418
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,100
He understands the situation.

419
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,560
You can pay right?
