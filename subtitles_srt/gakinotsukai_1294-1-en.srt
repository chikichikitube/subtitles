TODAY, A CERTAIN MAN'S SPECIAL SEGMENT

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,650
Good morning.

5
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,650
Wait a minute.

6
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,020
Nobody told me we would start outside.

7
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Nobody told me we would start outside.

8
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,290
I'm only wearing two layers.

9
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,130
You're lightly dressed.

10
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,130
Very lightly.

11
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,660
There's only a slight breeze, but...

12
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,630
Endo isn't here, right?

13
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,060
Endo isn't here, right?

14
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,200
Yeah, well, he wasn't here in the first place.

15
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,200

No, no.

22
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,000
He's here but...

23
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,870
Since last year and the year before that, he's been gone since then.

24
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,070
Since last year and the year before that, he's been gone since then.

25
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,010
You weren't here for a while either.

26
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,010
I was!

27
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,360
I'm here.

28
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,940
All this time, the 3 of us have been waiting around.

29
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,740
All five of us are here today so...

30
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,740
Maybe he forgot.

31
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,750
Endo wanted to be Mori Shinichi once again.

32
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,180
Endo wanted to be Mori Shinichi once again.

33
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,750
Oh no, we don't need that.

34
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,320
He's really pushing it too far.

35
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,390
He's really pushing it too far.

36
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,250
It had a short span.

37
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,250
He's pushing it so far that

38
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:41,820
Mori-san is going to get fed up with this!

39
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,890
Mori-san is going to get fed up with this!

40
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,420
Well actually, most of them are already dead.

41
00:00:44,260 --> 00:01:10,350
Last Year's Broadcast

42
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,230
Well actually, most of them are already dead.

43
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:48,790
Pushing it forward Mori Shinichi Segment

44
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:56,000
Pushing it forward Mori Shinichi Segment

45
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Since last year, Endo really liked it and

46
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,260
has continued pushing it forward, the Mori Shinichi Segment

47
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,670
Starred in the popular talk show Uchi Iku!?

48
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,700
Last time, he starred in the popular talk show "Uchi Iku!?"

49
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:10,350
What will he do this time...?

50
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,060
What will he do this time...?

51
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,900
This time, he wants to have a

52
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,730
dinner show as Mori Shinichi.

53
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,700
Mori-san has probably done dinner shows before,

54
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:21,230
Endo's Attempt

55
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:21,230
Fake Mori Shinichi will do a Dinner Show

57
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,460
we should just let the real one handle it.

58
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,230
Yes, that would be good, however,

59
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,460
We managed to do it at such an amazing hotel!

60
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,370
We managed to do it at such an amazing hotel!

61
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,400
Everything is ready to go.

62
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,370
I know what this is.

63
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,200
This is some sort of tie-up with the hotel,

64
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,200
that's why we started recording outside...

65
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,770
Tonight, the Dinner Show of Dreams Begins!

66
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:38,880
Tonight, the Dinner Show of Dreams Begins!

67
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,400
And so, tonight, Mori Shinichi will take us to the world of dreams.

The guests are already in.

85
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,460
By the way,

86
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,930
I actually don't have much

87
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,930
experience with dinner shows.

88
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,630
A while ago, I went to Seiko-chan's Dinner Show

89
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,970
A while ago, I went to Seiko-chan's Dinner Show

90
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
A while ago?

91
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,400
Ah, over there.

92
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,300
So it's like this?

93
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,310
It's great, right? There's food too...

94
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,180
You're right.

95
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,580
Doesn't the show normally start after eating?

96
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,420
It's not while you're eating.

97
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,020
There's a lot of guests...

98
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,690
They all look like madams.

99
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,460
They're all very fancy.

100
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,890
All I see is women.

101
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,890
They're all women.

102
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,420
Then it was limited to women.

103
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,860
Everyone, we thank you for your patience.

104
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,930
Everyone, we thank you for your patience.

112
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,400
Hey, old man.

113
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,500
One more.

114
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,310
Looks like this part is a play.

115
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,060
I think you're drinking too much again.

116
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,760
As usual, you run a gloomy place.

117
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,960
You say that, but aren't you the one coming here every night?

118
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,390
Port Town Blues

119
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,500
I stand straight and look across the strait

120
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,100
Today too, the steam whistle sounds in the distance

121
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,840
Give back to me the night I gave you

122
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:32,460
At the port, the port of Hakodate, it rains

123
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,230
Wait a minute, he's not singing.

124
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,230
He's just lip syncing.

125
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,530
He showed up rather early.

126
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,930
Mayai comin'?

127
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,930
Welcome, of course!

128
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,900
What did he say?

129
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,040
I couldn't quite catch that.

130
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,400
He's putting too much force on his face.

131
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,640
He can't pronounce things correctly.

132
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,830
I don't need anything right now.

133
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,500
As you wish. Hey, mister.

134
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,300
You don't look like you're from these parts. Are you a traveler?

135
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,520
Yes, I'm in the middle of a journey,

136
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,030
for a number of reasons.

137
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,860
Is that so?

138
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,160
In order to repent for your sins, you left your beloved daughter behind and decided to travel alone...

139
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
or something like that, right?

140
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,060
What? You're gonna ignore me?

141
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,700
Somebody!

142
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,600
Somebody help me!

143
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,600
What's wrong, young lady?

144
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,700
What is it?

145
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,860
Hey!

146
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,230
I knew you'd come here!

147
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,630
Get over here!

148
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,460
Hey miss, we're really bored.

149
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,230
Come play with us.

150
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,230
No, please stop!

151
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,360
Hey, you!

152
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,660
Stop that right now!

153
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,200
Shut up!

154
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,830
Hey, guys! Let's get her out of here.

155
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,330
Sdop!

156
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,670
Huh?

157
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,130
Shin-chan!

158
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,810
It's hard to make out what he says.

159
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,240
Can't you see this young lady doesn't like you?

160
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,230
Please let go of her.

161
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,300
I don't know where you came from but,

162
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,060
if you don't want to get hurt, shut-

163
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,230
No way.

164
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,960
I didn't want to get involved but,

165
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,960
pretending to be just a bystander...

166
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,060
will stray a person from the path of righteousness.

167
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,630
He missed.

168
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,460
Hurry up and

169
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,730
get lost!

170
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't get ahead of yourself!

171
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,510
Amazing.

172
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,250
Everyone knows, the timing.

173
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,650
Everyone knows, the timing.

174
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,160
Here they come.

175
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,230
Kill him!

176
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,230
Yeah!

177
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,400
But...

178
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,200
His face stopped looking like Mori Shinichi.

179
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,000
His face stopped looking like Mori Shinichi.

180
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,410
Wait, he didn't hit him.

181
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,410
Wait, he didn't hit him.

182
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,460
Argh!

183
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,500
His face is too much.

184
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,470
He's way too strong.

185
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,750
There's no feeling of danger at all.

186
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,450
There's no feeling of danger at all.

187
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,450
I agree.

188
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,830
Could it be? Father?

189
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,120
What?

190
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,700
That sword looks exactly like the one my father used.

191
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,560
That kind of twist?

192
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,000
It's you, isn't it, father?

193
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,160
I do not...

194
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
have a daughter.

195
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,330
What are you saying!? Didn't you say you left your daughter behind to go on a journey!?

196
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,730
Father, it's me, Koyuki!

197
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,960
I went on a journey to find you.

198
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,960
Father...

199
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,960
Let's live together again.

200
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,400
Koyuki-san, I will...

201
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,830
continue my journey until I repent my sins.

202
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:28,930
However, if she found it in herself to forgive me one day, then...

203
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,330
I want my live together...

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,600
They're taking a lot of pictures.

205
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,260
with my daughter.

206
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,470
It's that kind of moment.

207
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,170
I guess it's fine to take pictures.

208
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Traveler...

209
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,160
Could you at least tell me where you're heading?

210
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,580
Erimo...

211
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,920
The Cape of Erimo is where I'm headed.

212
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,350
The Cape of Erimo is where I'm headed.

213
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:04,160
Cape Erimo

214
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,530
Hm?

215
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,970
doing this in the second half?

216
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,970
Shouldn't he be

217
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,970
Yeah, I thought he would.

218
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,970
It wasn't just a play?

219
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,060
He's gonna sing now.

220
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,340
Everyone has their own penlights.

221
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,530
They knew beforehand.

222
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,530
Right.

223
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:32,360
At the northern towns they've begun using their stoves

224
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,620
This is when he actually looks like him.

225
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,030
He gets very close.

226
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:38,530
to burn away their sorrows, it seems

227
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,390
But,

228
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,530
if you listen to the real one it sounds completely different.

229
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:49,370
While worrying about meaningless things

230
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,340
His face is gradually starting to lose form.

231
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,070
His face is gradually starting to lose form.

232
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:55,380
we end up growing old and frail

233
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:01,390
All those months and years spent in silence

234
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,600
Very nice fan service.

235
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,800
Eh?

236
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:09,530
Let's gather all and warm them up.

237
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,030
It's amazing.

238
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,590
This is starting to feel like Taishu Engeki*

239
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:13,260
*A type of theater performance, there's a dance portion in the show and fans usually approach the performers to give them gifts such as money.

240
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:22,310
Spring in Erimo is just spring with nothing else.

241
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,810
He has loads of money.

242
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,760
What the hell...

243
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
He has too much money.

244
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,730
Lots of money.

245
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,730
Whoa, that's cool.

246
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:43,560
Even if we dislike the way we live, we continue living

247
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,660
Shin-chan...

248
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,170
So let's just keep smiling silently

249
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,000
Whoa, very nice.

250
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,110
Holding up your guard while only talking

251
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:03,250
Ah, what a coward it makes one look

252
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,960
He's lip syncing again.

253
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:15,830
Spring in Erimo is just spring with nothing else.

254
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,060
Hello, good afternoon.

255
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,060
Good afternoon!

256
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,180
I'm Mori Shinichi.

257
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,850
I'm Mori Shinichi.

258
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,850
No he's not!

259
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,850
That's wrong.

260
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,230
You're not.

261
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,550
He straight-up said it.

262
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,590
He straight-up lied.

263
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,590
He straight-up lied.

264
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,800
I made my debut back in

265
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,000
the year 1965.

266
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,330
Showa 40.

267
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,430
And this year, it's been exactly

268
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,430
51 years since my debut.

269
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,470
51 years is just right, don't you think?

270
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,000
51 years is just right, don't you think?

271
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,180
They're loving him.

272
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,500
In the corporate world, it would mean I'm a section chief.

273
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,550
Except, instead of drinking milk, it would be sake.

274
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,520
Except, instead of drinking milk, it would be sake.

275
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,690
Except, instead of drinking milk, it would be sake.

276
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,630
They're making me laugh.

277
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,130
The people around us are making it funny.

278
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,960
However,

279
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,460
it's really taken

280
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,330
a long time to get here.

281
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,230
You did your best!

282
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,410
No, no...

283
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,340
It took a long time, but...

284
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,840
From now on, without losing my "ki" (spirit),

285
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,350
From now on, without losing my "ki" (spirit),

286
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,050
I will try to do my best.

287
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,050
That's because.

288
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,480
If I lost a "ki" (tree), I'd become Hayashi ("woods").

289
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,090
If I lost a "ki" (tree), I'd become Hayashi ("woods").

290
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,830
Lose one more "ki", and it's just "Moku" (wood).

291
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,900
Okay, that was pretty good.

292
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,460
Lose one more "ki", and it's just "Moku" (wood).

293
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,330
Good afternoon, I'm Moku Shinichi.

294
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,770
Good afternoon, I'm Moku Shinichi.

295
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm kidding.

296
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,530
He's kidding.

297
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,830
Tonight, please support me.

298
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,070
Now then.

299
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,980
Everyone, there's someone I want you to meet.

300
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,680
Everyone, there's someone I want you to meet.

301
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,150
Everyone, there's someone I want you to meet.

302
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,820
It's my son, please welcome him!

303
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,560
Good afternoon!

304
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,490
This is my son, however...

305
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,090
His name is Umi Wataru.

306
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,730
His name is Umi Wataru.

307
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,330
Hey, introduce yourself.

308
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,000
Umi Wataru...

309
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Is everyone ready?

310
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,500
He's really excited.

311
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,500
Here we go!

312
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,140
It's wide and big.

313
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:39,600
The Pacific Ocean~

314
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,240
The Pacific Ocean~

315
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,910
It's fierce and relentless.

316
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,110
The Sea of Japan~

317
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,640
The Sea of Japan~

318
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:44,980
Umi Umi Umi Umi...

319
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,340
Umi Umi Umi Umi...

320
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:45,680
Umi Umi Umi Umi...

321
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,110
Umi Umi Umi Umi...

322
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,340
Umi Wataru~

323
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,180
Umi Wataru~

324
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,380
The World of Enka's Prince of the Stormy Seas

325
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:50,880
I'm Umi Wataru.

326
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,250
I'm Umi Wataru.

327
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:51,680
I'm Umi Wataru.

328
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,020
I'm Umi Wataru.

329
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,990
I'm Umi Wataru.

330
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,900
Pleased to be here!

331
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,430
Thank you, thank you.

332
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,460
Why are you getting more cheering than me?

333
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,090
Also, stop looking down on people like that.

334
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,960
Also, stop looking down on people like that.

335
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,500
It's only because I'm taller than you Mori-sensei.

336
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
It's only because I'm taller than you Mori-sensei.

337
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,570
Anyway,

338
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,910
at first glance, he might look like he messes around.

339
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,880
But he's actually a very reliable man.

340
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,610
But he's actually a very reliable man.

341
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,110
Without real heart, you can't sing enka.

342
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,950
Without real heart, you can't sing enka.

343
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,250
That's why I'm guiding him to become an enka singer.

344
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,920
That's why I'm guiding him to become an enka singer.

345
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,890
As my successor.

346
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,490
He messed up with that pause.

347
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,730
If you want, go ahead

348
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,330
and sing to us.

349
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,330
I will, thank you.

350
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:52,440
Wataru's Banbara Beat

351
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,160
No, no, no, no.

352
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,510
Looks like this is gonna be lip syncing too.

353
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm pretty sure.

354
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:09,730
Ban Ban Ban Bara Ban Ban Ban (Wataru)

355
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,260
Why are they showing us this?

356
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,970
The western sky is shining bright

357
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:23,210
The eastern sky is shining too

358
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:32,580
Winter's starry night sky is what those with dreams

359
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:32,580
(Breaks out in a completely different song)

360
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,010
What the hell?

361
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,700
What the hell...

362
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:44,900
Look up to see

363
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
How?

364
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,960
Is this a medley?

365
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I don't think it's a medley.

366
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,790
That surprised me.

367
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,930
Only one song.

368
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,430
It just suddenly changed, right?

369
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,030
Thank you.

370
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,400
Umi Wataru...

371
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,480
Looks like the first part might be over.

372
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,310
Looks like the first part might be over.

373
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,530
So the first half is over?

374
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,450
I really just want to go home.

375
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,790
Yeah, since the very beginning.

376
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,030
The Dinner Show's Second Half Begins

377
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,030
The Dinner Show's Second Half Begins

378
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,860
Mori Shinichi's Dinner Show's second half begins.

379
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,700
Everyone, good afternoon.

380
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,830
Good afternoon.

381
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,100
From here on,

382
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,430
I, Tarajima Towako, will be your host.

383
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,140
No, don't know her.

384
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,430
She looks like she's real.

385
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:33,040
Let's get the fun started

386
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,040
with a special talk corner segment.

387
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,230
She sounds like a real host.

388
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,230
I agree.

389
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,930
It's Mori Shinichi, welcome.

390
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,160
Mori-san, thank you for being here.

391
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,330
He just casually walks out.

392
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,330
Well...

393
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,330
I've known Towako for a long time, about 30 years, right?

394
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,860
I've known Towako for a long time, about 30 years, right?

395
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
That's right.

396
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,530
She's just his woman.

397
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,370
At this year's dinner show,

398
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,110
I've been looking forward so much

399
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,110
to this meeting with Shinichi-san...

400
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,580
Last night, I couldn't sleep at all.

401
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,580
Oh, really?

402
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,010
Did you really not sleep at all?

403
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,140
No,

404
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,410
I slept about 8 hours.

405
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
You did sleep.

406
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,220
Now then, at last,

407
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,390
it's time to begin our Q&A corner.

408
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Everyone, please

409
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,730
if any of you have a question, go ahead and

410
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
raise your hand!

411
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,340
A lot of guests raised their hands.

412
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:35,840
First, the lady with the red scarf, please.

413
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,460
Hello,

414
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,440
um...

415
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,240
Last year, the rugby player Goromaru had a pose

416
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,280
Last year, the rugby player Goromaru had a pose

417
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,880
Last year, the rugby player Goromaru had a pose

418
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,880
that was really popular.

419
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,520
Mori-san, just like Goromaru,

420
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,920
On that stage,

421
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,920
I wanted to ask if you could show us your routine.

422
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,400
I would love if you could show us.

423
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Uh...my routine?

424
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,360
Yes, please.

425
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,860
Mori-san is a real big shot so he must have his own routine.

426
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,270
Just like when we did it,

427
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:11,410
he probably doesn't know

428
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,410
what they're gonna ask him.

429
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,300
My routine then...

430
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,030
This is all ad-lib.

431
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
I usually...

432
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,280
I do everything starting with my left.

433
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,950
I do everything starting with my left.

434
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,730
Well then,

435
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,720
Could you show us what

436
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,720
"starting with your left" looks like?

437
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,960
Show you!?

438
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,460
Yes.

439
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,160
Alright, uh...

440
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,730
Show you!?

441
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,200
Show the left thing!?

442
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Um...

443
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,800
He's not Mori-san anymore.

444
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
It would be...

445
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,800
Show it?

446
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,260
Something like...

447
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,970
With the left side.

448
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,140
Everything with my left side, I'm telling you.

449
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,760
It doesn't make sense.

450
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,160
While eating, I'm right-handed so as I'm about to eat...

451
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,930
I begin first with my left.

452
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,730
Since it's my routine, I start with the left.

453
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,260
After that, I continue with my right.

454
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,490
I do everything starting with the left side.

455
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,760
I do everything starting with the left side.

456
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,830
I want to see that.

457
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,530
What did you think, everyone?

458
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,000
This is Mori Shinichi's routine,

459
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,660
doing everything starting with the left side.

460
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,040
Now then,

461
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,680
let's have Mori-san go back to what he knows and

462
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,140
and have him sing...

463
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,510
that song that everyone loves.

464
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,500
If you please.

465
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:39,900
Winter's Riviera

466
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:49,610
8th Grade - School Field Trip

467
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,540
It's a slideshow.

468
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,610
Is that picture for real?

469
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,110
Why from the 8th grade?

470
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,180
8th Grade - School Field Trip

471
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:02,390
9th Grade - At the graduation ceremony

472
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,460
9th grade...

473
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,520
That's obviously fake.

474
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,720
He hasn't changed at all.

475
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,160
Age 20 - Coming-of-age ceremony at the public hall.

476
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,670
Why does he look so thin?

477
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:20,000
Age 20 - Coming-of-age ceremony at the public hall.

478
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,670
Why does he look so thin?

479
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,780
Age 21 - Getting his driver's license

480
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,780
He's in front of a Civic!!

481
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:40,390
Age 22 - Driving Trip - At Lake Akan

482
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,320
It was an important moment.

483
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,390
After just one year.

484
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,700
They're at age 22 but they haven't shown his debut.

485
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,700
Are they aware of that?

486
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:54,270
Age 23 - Driving Trip - At Kurobe Gorge

487
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,770
They were important.

488
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,270
There were many driving trips.

489
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,030
He drived a lot.

490
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,070
Yeah, it's all driving trips.

491
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,120
For real.

492
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,880
Age 23 - Driving Trip - At Kurobe Gorge

493
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:12,020
Age 24 - Driving Trip - At Gassan Ski Resort

494
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,060
Another driving trip...

495
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,360
They're all driving trips.

496
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,100
It actually doesn't look weird.

497
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,770
Whose pictures are these anyway?

498
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:29,940
Age 25 - At the office entrance.

499
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,260
No, no.

500
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,570
Enough with his 20s!

501
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,610
Enough with his 20s!

502
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,660
Yeah.

503
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,310
It's only about his 20s.

504
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:44,620
Age 26 - At the training with the office's baseball team

505
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,660
26 years old.

506
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,100
Why did they only show that?

507
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,960
When one is having so much fun,

508
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,800
time goes by very quickly.

509
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,840
It seems it's already time to say goodbye.

510
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,810
To finish, there's one more song, but before that...

511
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,310
There's one more person I want to introduce.

512
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,880
There's one more person I want to introduce.

513
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,980
She's my cherished treasure.

514
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,730
Come.

515
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,630
They're mixing up people from different agencies.

516
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,130
Hello, nice to meet you.

517
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,930
My name is Kosakura Barbara Harumi.

518
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,500
I'm very happy to be here with everyone today.

519
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,940
Barbara is my cherished girl.

520
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,810
Her grandma was Hawaiian so

521
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,810
that makes her half-Hawaiian.

522
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,010
Mori-sensei,

523
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,140
it wouldn't be half, it'd be quarter.

524
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,580
it wouldn't be half, it'd be quarter.

525
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,610
Whatever it is, quarter, water...

526
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,080
Whatever it is, quarter, water...

527
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,780
Whatever it is, quarter, water...

528
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,000
Well, anyway, she's nice isn't she...

529
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,590
This will be the last one

530
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,060
Together with Barbara and...

531
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,020
everyone, please stand up.

532
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,290
I want to sing that song.

533
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,730
Mother Firefly

534
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,970
I want to sing that song.

535
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,060
Mother Firefly

536
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:16,810
Mother Firefly

537
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,140
Why is Barbara singing too?

538
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,960
Look.

539
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,840
Umi Wataru is here too.

540
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,180
It's the Mori family.

541
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,200
It's a mix from different agencies.

542
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:30,090
When the sea calls out, a man's heart burns

543
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:36,200
He turns to drink to mask the fear

544
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,370
So, that was everything in the slideshow?

545
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,330
Yeah, looks like that was it.

546
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,700
It was only his 20s.

547
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,330
That's right.

548
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:42,470
Seeing dreams of fortune, he seeks a ship

549
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,000
Normally, you start with your birth.

550
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It started when he was 12 years old.

551
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yes, when he was around 12.

552
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:48,710
"The reckless and foolish son"

553
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:55,250
Leaving nothing but harsh words

554
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,660
Holding a vigil at the shore

555
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:06,400
The mother prays for her son's safe return

556
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:17,240
At cape of Erimo, that wavering light is-

557
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:29,620
the mother firefly

558
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,360
Everyone, we thank you very much.

559
00:23:36,690 --> 00:24:09,690
This video was brought to you by Tofu Panda Fansubs

560
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,230
He really likes it.

561
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,230
He's getting all sorts of people involved.

562
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,660
It just happened.

563
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,660
Getting them involved.

564
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,100
I wish this would get riskier.

565
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,100
You want him to get angry?

566
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,100
I wish he would.

567
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,860
You want to anger him?

568
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,300
I think xxxxx will.

569
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,600
Yeah, xxxxx would.
