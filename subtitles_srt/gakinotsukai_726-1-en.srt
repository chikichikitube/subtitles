00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,290
It's something we always wanted to try right?

11
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,370
That's right

12
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:19,790
Right?

13
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,650
What is it?

14
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,100
We have tried it

15
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,510
4th time right?

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,680
Cooking is about a bride's challenge

17
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,090
But that is delicious, in the end no one complained at all

18
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,150
That's not right

19
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,480

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,840

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,480
During the taiyaki challenge i made the wiener taiyaki

And i say "here it go everyone"

23

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,210
I've done it, i've done it

26
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,840
First is Tanaka, his first ingredient is ..

27
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,590
First ingredient

28
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:03,610
Yea

29
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,210
First ingredient

30
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,440
Here it is

31
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,130
What the..

32
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:06,630
What the heck is this?

33
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,470
Italian style?

34
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,060
That's right

35
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,950
Cheese

36
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,960
Wine

37
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,960
and Wine

38
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,560
The combination between Cheese and Wine is perfect right?

39
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,130
Yeah

40
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,140
That is when being eaten separately

41
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,140
That's right

42
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,350
What are you going to do with the wine?

43
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,740
That's a big piece

44
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,320
That's huge!

45
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,730
Everything will taste like cheese

46
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,310
What's next?

47
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,150
I will put in these shredded cheese too

48
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,260
Into that?

49
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,570
I will put it now

50
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,930
With this dish

51
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,810
You are not mistaken?

52
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,290
This is the normal egg

53
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,070
For chawanmushi right?

54
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,030
The normal mixture

55
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,070
Egg and ..

56
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,650
Taste broth

57
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,310
That's all?

58
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,640
That's all huh?

59
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,150
Wine and cheese makes a good combination

60
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,370
You get the concept wrong

61
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's drink the wine now

62
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,140
Firstly the setting must be right

63
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,050
I thought you get the concept wrong

64
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,510
The wine is red wine

65
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,840
Absolutely it's red wine

66
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,430
Why?

67
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,900
Because it's just cheese

68
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,320
This thing have amazing colors

69
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,590
It looks evil

70
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,680
Definitely tasty

71
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,800
Next is the second ingredient

72
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,330
Again with the Italian Style

73
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,180
Cappuccino Chawanmushi

74
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,070
The making process is adding warm milk and coffee.  The cinnamon is for?

75
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,230
You are not putting the cinnamon?

76
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,030
This is for after everything is done

77
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,510
Next is Endo, what ingredients will he use?

78
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,000
Your turn now

79
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,210
You are going with nonsense again right?

80
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,000
It's Frisk

81
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,140
Why do you keep bringing this

82
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,980
Are you waiting for commercial offer?

83
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,610
That's right

84
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,380
It is actually my dream

85
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,080
You are really waiting for the offer?

86
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,990
Well... if they offer me ..

87
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,120
If you do this there will not be any offer!

88
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,240
This is ..

89
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,460
This is not just mine but.. how am i going to say ..

90
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,100
It is also the dream of the staff

91
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,670
What the heck

92
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,490
They want to do this

93
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,670
I've always wanted to try

94
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,260
Of all the things to try, only frisk will fail

95
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,370
That's right

96
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,830
Normally i put 50..

97
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,940
He's right, it's 50 ..

98
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,010
This time, one portion i will put 200

99
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:14,950
What the heck

100
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,170
That is bad

101
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,160
Why the heck 200

102
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,060
Endo liking Frisk this much is amazing

103
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,700
Second ingredient is Carbonara chawanmushi

104
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,800
Endo did it

105
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,570
That's a lot

106
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,090
You put a lot

107
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,220
Why the comment just now

108
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,890
This looks cool

109
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,360
It's Yamazaki turn and his ingredients are

110
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,100
What's this? Umaibo?

111
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,420
Umaibo and it is corn soup flavor

112
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,220
Umaibo have different flavor

113
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,210
There are different flavors like okonomiyaki but this is the best

114
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,490
Corn soup

115
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,120
It's cheap

116
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,620
It has the dessert's look

117
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,950
I break this into half

118
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,230
Next i pour this in

119
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:05,810
Simple

120
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,400
Fast

121
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,560
It's simple

122
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,700
Men's cooking

123
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,090
Yamazaki second ingredient is ..

124
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,230
Cream soda

125
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,260

Right, i see, i see , Cream soda

127
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Wait a minute

Just now, that is not polite

129
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's not right

130
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
Ain't it always like this?

131
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,240
It's not like that

132
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,420
Just now?

133
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,680
Mixing up the egg

134
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,110
The whisking process is so fun

135
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,680
While you are whisking put my expression into the scene

136
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,810
This one

137
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,110

138
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,290
Is it open?

139
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,550
This is not tolerable

140
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,230
How can this guy do it?

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,130
Oh, it's open

142
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,690
Here it is

143
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,290
Well it's Yamazaki so i wish to be angry

144
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,760

145
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,690
Wondering how it taste like

146
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,270
Next is Hamada turn, what kind of chawanmushi?

I am making something delicious

148

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,360
This guy is always cheating

151
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:23,920
It's luxurious

152
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,350
Hamada is rich

153
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,240
That's right

154
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,640
It's not true

155
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:26,980
See

156
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,640
Woah, it's luxurious

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,660
Since primary school, this guy has been cheating

160
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,610
Since young?

161
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,040
Since young he is

162
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,680
That prawn is such a waste

163
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,780
Now, this prawn is not a waste

164
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,870
I want to eat it just like this

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,480
Stink, it really stink

197
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,130
The meat too?

198
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,610
The meat too

199
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,540
Then more

200
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,130
The egg mixture

201
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,570
The egg too

202
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,680
I see

203
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,860
Look at the color

204
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,830
What color is this

205
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,510
What?

206
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,570
Terrible

207
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,570
The color is like Mold bread

208
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,830
Everyone say it stink

209
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,650
Odor removal nuts

210
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,230
I see, i see

211
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,110
Odor removal nuts

212
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,110
This stinkiness is okay

213
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,060
Originally stink is tasty

214
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,800
Who is it?

215
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,210
Kawabadayasi nari crime

216
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,220
You watch those?

217
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,420
In the end everyone die

218
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,480
When they say they die

219
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,540
Stink is tasty

220
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,940
One more

221
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,310
Hai

222
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,020
It's Montblanc

223
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,760
Let's eat this while we wait

224
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,730
That's right

225
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,920
The size is perfect

226
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,210
The size is perfect right?

227
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,810
The nuts looks like something evil

228
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,700
I see

229
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,550
Look at this

230
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,100
Amazing

231
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,420
When you want to bath

232
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,920
You go into the bathtub

233
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,380
It looks like the **** floating

234
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,420
It's good right?

235
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,240
I know the fun reason

236
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,010
I have another version

237
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,170
Show us

238
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,430
After so much trouble

239
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,690
During the pizza series, i used the pig face

240
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,020
That's right, that's right

241
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,220
Now it's not face

242
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,200
The hand ....

243
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,590
This is cute

244
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,860
If it's like this we can't eat it

245
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,930
This is fine right?

246
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,510
You wish for pet like this right?

247
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,320
It looks like shoulder

248
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,480
Disgusting

249
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,100
I'm not joking

250
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,260
You are not Joking?

251
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,190
Joking

252
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,930
Is this what you want?

253
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,010
Of course i want to do it

254
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,350
Cool, it goes like this

255
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,440
Finally is tasting time

256
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,140
Here is Tanaka's

257
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,950
YES!

258
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,990
Ero-Kappa

259
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,000
Who is the ero

260
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,010
First is Tanaka's Wine+Cheese

261
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,010
However, how does it taste?

262
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,270
Open

263
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,760
It doesn't come out well

264
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,420
It stink

265
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,420
It smells like Sake Lees

266
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,530
He is right

267
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,230
The middle one is Tanaka's

268
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,610
No,no this is Hamada's

269
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,640
Why the heck

270
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,900
Why the heck it's me

271
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
I heard today is your birthday

272
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,900
Idiot, my birthday has long passed

273
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,040
Treat that as a belated gift

274
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,390
Tanaka-han

275
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,290
Tanaka!

276
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,910
He hate DownTown a lot

277
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,890
Tanaka-han

278
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,880
Itadakimas

279
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,190
Wine+Cheese

280
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,470
Bad

281
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,770
Impossible

282
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,840
Absolutely impossible

283
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,820
This is extremely bad

284
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,580
Top 5 fail

285
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,350
This is horrible

286
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,040
Bad

287
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,300
It feels like..

288
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,300
*I am not sure if I'm right*

289
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,300
*Watching Choju from Warrior 1

290
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,250
It feels like this

291
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,580
This is bad

292
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,540
This is bad

293
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,520
*Skull and Crossbone*

294
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,520
I am thinking of *Dokuro

295
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,560
Dokuro is fine right?

296
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,630
Betrayal's appearance, Wine+Cheese achieve Dokuro mark

297
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,340
Second is Cappucino chawanmushi, will it turn out nicely?

298
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,440
It looks good

299
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,500
This looks good

300
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,060
Dessert-like

301
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,100
That's right

302
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Then cream

303
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,350
Normally, cream always compliment...

304
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,420
Cappucino right?

305
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,880
Put it on top, a lot

306
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,560
You are first?

307
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,320
Senior must have first

308
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,860
You are the first fast one right?

309
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,540
Then Tanaka, this one

310
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,350
Then put the Cinnamon in it

311
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,090
I see

312
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,560
This is good

313
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,030
Itadakimas

314
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,860
Looks good

315
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,190
Coffee Jelly

316
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,440
What is this?

317
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,180
It taste bland

318
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,730
This doesn't taste horrible

319
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,770
I don't get the energy

320
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,620
The first one, is out-dated

321
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,260
Now it is branded coffee

322
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,780
No impact

323
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,060
Cappucino Chawanmushi, for the betrayal get a 2 point

324
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,880
Next is Endo, before the dangerous Frisk, Carbonara Chawanmushi

325
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,630
First, the appearance

326
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,070
This kind of feeling

327
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:35,340
I am not sure why the spaghetti still retain it's looks

328
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,850
It looks tough

329
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,790
Itadakimas

330
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,800
Carbonara

331
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,530
Come on, please

332
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,070
Please

333
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:43,790
What is this?

334
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,720
No taste

335
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,660
It's bland

336
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,440
Among the previous one

337
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,250
It's acceptable

338
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,290
But Tanaka's being horrible

339
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,730
This is still.. edible?

340
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,250
4.. 4 is it?

341
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:00,990
3 or 4

342
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,030
Okay, 2

343
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,340
It deserves that          Yeah

344
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,340
4 please at the worst

345
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,410
At least he is save from Dokuro mark

346
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,530
Doesn't have the proper taste, Carbonara Chawanmushi scores a mere 4

347
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,300
Finally, the dangerously full mark-minded Frisk Chawanmushi

348
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,720
Ah, the appearance

349
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,450
The appearance is..

350
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,510
It looks normal

351
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,580
It's here

352
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,360
Nostalgic fear

353
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,840
Blinking eye

354
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,420
The feeling is back

355
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,940
Or course, 200 frisk per serving

356
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,010
Each person 200?

357
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,000
Each person 200

358
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,720
Steak?

359
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,260
Itadakimas

360
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,160
It feels like drinking mint

361
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,530
I did not eat anything strange, but why, this "stress"

362
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,740
Everything melted

363
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,950
No remains left

364
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,910
No remains

365
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,900
It goes blub, blub

366
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,590
For real?

367
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:12,090
When being steamed, the frisk go 'bam'

368
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,010
Try the deeper part here, this

369
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,440
Hot

370
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,940
Now is not the matter of hot or not

371
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,080
It's HOT!!

372
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,880
Looks like the previous one is warm

373
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,100
Cat-Tongue = Sensitive to hot food

374
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,100
Why did i try it with someone who have *cat-tongue

375
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,610
It is hot

376
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,610
We don't need that answer

377
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,880
50 old men entering your mouth

378
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,920
50 warm old men

379
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,570
This cannot make it, Sorry

380
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,170
As expected, the Frisk receive a Dokuro mark

381
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,480
Next is Yamazaki, first impression looks tasty, Umaibo Chawanmushi

382
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,560
It is not expensive

383
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,990
This, here

384
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:00,970
Looks like Tempura

385
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,740
Looks nice, the smell also nice

386
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,020
The smell is seriously nice

387
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,540
Itadakimas

388
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,600
I think this is success

389
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,480
I did it, see

390
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,530
Tasty

391
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,080
This is good

392
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,320
This is good

393
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,850
This can be recommended

394
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,450
This full mark ..

395
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,130
Exceeding full mark 1

396
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,450
Which 1?

397
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,290
Full mark

398
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,360
Definitely not full mark

399
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,350
It is too lenient

400
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,270
Everyone praise it tasty, why i cannot get full mark?

401
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,090
We are just saying

402
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,470
If it come first

403
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,100
Well... 7 then

404
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,500
7

405
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,450
I think 6

406
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,400
Hm,hm

407
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,310
6 then

408
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,600
6 then

409
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,360
Wuah it changed

410
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,070
Everyone say 7 until you say 6 and everyone follow

411
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:55,730
7,7

412
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,060
5 is also near 6

413
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,560
5 then

414
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,180
What the hell, No way, 7

415
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,240
This round using very cheap ingredient, unexpectedly score 7 mark

416
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,730
Next is cream soda, how does it taste like?

417
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,750
I did it

418
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,430
I did it !

419
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,230
No no, the color

420
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,680
No no, this is not good

421
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,310
No, i did it

422
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,690
Why you say "I did it" when you see this?

423
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,640
I don't know

424
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,170
I did it

425
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,170
I did it this time

426
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,480
Let's do it

427
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,490
Itadakimas

428
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,710
What's this?

429
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,050
It's coming out

430
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:38,690
What is it?

431
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,540
Taste bad

432
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,620
This is bad

433
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,720
Inside this and that material mixed in

434
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,570
This is evil

435
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,030
The evil Cream soda Chawanmushi obviously receive Dokuro mark

436
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,240
Next is Hamada's first dish, Tom Yam Chawanmushi

437
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,230
Looks tasty!

438
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,880
This looks very good

439
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,870
Is this for real?

440
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,250
Yes yes

441
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,040
The first look

442
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,000
This is a good chawanmushi

443
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,470
Itadakimas

444
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,750
You put into your mouth while it's hot?

445
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,160
It's bad but tasty

446
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,350
The taste in mouth is amazing

447
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,160
Bad

448
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,410
This is the taste of Tom Yam

449
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,250
This can be sold to restaurant

450
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,750
The price of copyright is 500,000 Yen

451
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,690
This can make it

452
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,690
Delicious very delicious

453
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,540
It taste good?

454
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,900
This doesn't taste good?

455
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,030
Not delicious?

456
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,600
This is totally edible

457
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,010
This deserve 8 mark?

458
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,600
If 8 ....

459
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,440
4

460
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,740
I also think of 4

461
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,740
I think so too

462
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,740
What the heck

463
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,670
What the hell, Then 8 just for this

464
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,350
8.. then 8

465
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,800
If in store, this can sell well

466
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,810
This is good

467
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,990
This is good, edible

468
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,130
Huh? What the hell

469
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,600
You just contradict yourself

470
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,150
I make a huge mistake

471
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,310
Delete the first comment i make

472
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,440
Tom Yam Chawanmushi, scores a splendid 8 mark

473
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,000
The next dish, not much expectation natto+kimchi chawanmushi

474
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,690
What is this!

475
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,150
Scary, this is scary

476
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,150
Sewage water

477
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,290
Knock it off already

478
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,820
Tough

479
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,090
Amazing amount inside

480
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,350
Well, this is Kimchi+Natto

481
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,830
This is good

482
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,770
I think i like this

483
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,910
After tasting, this is not bad

484
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,670
This is not bad

485
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,480
This one too

486
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,890
Most favorite

487
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,290
Extremely the top

488
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,260
For real?

489
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,260
If the one who eat this is animal, that is the strange part.

490
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,920
What mark are you giving?

491
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,190
This is

492
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,160
2~~~~

493
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,450
Effort 2

494
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,230
1 & 2 is close

495
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,920
I don't understand "Effort 2"

496
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,930
This is the score of your favorite?

497
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,810
Then this is 8 and Tom Yam 6

498
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,860
Wh- Why?

499
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,570
Everyone have the same reaction as Tom Yam so surely it's 8

500
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,360
If this get 9 because of Natto, nobody can believe it

501
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,000
Then this is 8

502
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,440
Tom Yam 8 too

503
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,370
Not like that

504
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,370
Seems like 8 is limit

505
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,260
This is 8 too

506
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,200
Reason is B'Q

507
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,080
Idol *********

508
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,160
Natoo+Kimchi achieve a miraculous 8 mark

509
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,950
Last is Matsumoto, his first dish is Squid Ink Chawanmushi

510
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,340
This is bad!

511
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,470
Matsumoto's First dish, Squid Ink Chawanmushi

512
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,890
This is bad

513
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,790
This is not bad

514
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,270
This is definitely defect

515
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,270
It didn't solidify too

516
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,270
Spiritual flow

517
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,270
It definitely like that

518
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,180
This is soup

519
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,820
Itadakimas

520
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,300
It's here

521
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:46,990
This is

522
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,600
Amazing right? Itadakimas

523
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:57,810
The inside is still not properly cooked

524
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,810
When you say that

525
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,190
Obviously the first 2 and 3 mouth you can eat

526
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,250
I don't know why

527
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,050
Wait, the wife

528
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,340
The wife!

529
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,870
I think it is well made

530
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,680
It is worth it to put expensive thing in

531
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,970
Salt

532
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,370
Just a little

533
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,750
I understand this one do not deserve 9 mark

534
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,060
Obviously not 9

535
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,150
Not under this circumstances

536
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,320
Carbonara taste is slightly better?

537
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,380
Better than Dokuro

538
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,310
Because it's edible

539
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:45,630
What? what? The point is 10 full point, i get what point?

540
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,630
On.. 1 point?

541
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,440
Not that

542
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,430
Squid Ink Chawanmushi, because of last minute debate, 1 point

543
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,720
Finally it's Matsumoto's 2nd ingredient Montblanc Chawanmushi

544
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,760
Only the nuts is intact

545
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:05,720
He is right

546
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,430
There is no change

547
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,530
Here it is

548
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,070
Delicious

549
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,100
Normal

550
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,070
Delicious

551
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,830
Delicious~~

552
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,870
Taste like Mother's kindness

553
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,570
Similar to picture book

554
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,520
Let's go to sleep

555
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,730
Delicious

556
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,690
Delicious ~~

557
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,290
Like someone rubbing your chest

558
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,290
So kind

559
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,100
If only that happen

560
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,800
It's a new dessert

561
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,330
Kid will be very happy

562
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:44,950
5 point

563
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,740
Yes

564
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,800
Full mark is okay

565
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,790
Too tasty

566
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,590
Ain't 5 point okay?

567
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,170
Really tasty

568
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,900
I'm sorry, let's stop

569
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,070
This is wrong

570
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,110
5 point is from?

571
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,590
Let's finalize the point

572
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,590
What the hell, it cannot be

573
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,440
Laugh you idiot!

574
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,190
I think full mark is okay

575
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,190
10 is okay, right

576
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,030
10

577
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,850
Give full mark?

578
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,290
Okay then

579
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,660
Montblance Chawanmushi receives full mark

580
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,030

583
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,360
Last is Matsumoto's pig hand Chawanmushi

584
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,990
Open!

585
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,730
Wonderful ain't it?

586
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,250
Extremely swollen

587
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,190
This cannot be

588
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,570
No way

589
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,890
Whose hand is it?

590
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,690
Wait a while everyone, the spoon put here

591
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,270
It's like this?

592
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,080
I understand

593
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,560
The hand is okay to be big

594
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,160
That hand is not allowed

595
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,370
Then just take a little

596
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,370
Itadakimas

597
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,420
Why nobody is touching it?

598
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,710
Is it  because you don't want to touch another hand?

599
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,810
How is this?~~

600
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,660
Why you keep saying don't touch

601
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,610
Is because there is a hand?

602
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,540
I did it, i did it
