00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,450
Today's presenter is...

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,910
It's Tamura Kenji!

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,230
Nah, you're messing around aren't you?

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,230
Yes?

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,710
What do you mean "messing around"?

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,930
It sucks when you make a joke and it's not funny.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,610
What do you think Uchida-san?

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,610
What do you think of my hair Uchida-san?

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,850
It's like uhm...

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,690
You look like a mafia boss.

11
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,510
You're joking right?! You can't be serious!

12
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,670
That'll get you assassinated!

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,930
For your summer holidays...

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,970
...Matsumoto, what did you do?

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,010
I went to Hawaii.

16
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,970
How lovely!

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,190
I have money, so yeah...

18
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,750
It's not good to say that!

19
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,950
Your likability will go down!

20
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:03,030
This time we have the perfect theory for summer holidays at the beach.

21
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,190
People buried in the sand at the beach have no choice but to accept being questioned for an interview.

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,630
Are you preaching?

23
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,270
They can't just run away!

24
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,930
We have done many interviews with random people in the city.

25
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,590
But people often say "I have work", or "I'm in a hurry" and refuse.

26
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,490
These people have all the time in the world.

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,820
They can't move!

28
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,070
They can't even use their hands.

29
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,350
They're completely restrained.

30
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,150
After this, we conduct our investigation at the beach.

31
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,250
Today we investigate the theory: People buried in the sand at the beach have no choice but to accept being interviewed.

32
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,830
We find ourselves in Shonan, with many people coming to enjoy the beach.

33
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,290
Just as we get started...

34
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,170
...we find the first buried person of the day.

35
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,520
Staff: Do you have some time right now?

36
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,520
Yup, no problem.

37
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,750
As expected, he accepted the interview.

38
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,930
Staff: Who are you with today?

39
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,000
Umm...we kind of became friends out of nowhere.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,100
You're saying it's a group date.

41
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,100
It's not a group date.

42
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,740
Staff: Did you pick them up?

43
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,740
They picked me up.

44
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,370
It was a reverse pick up.

45
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,110
It was not a reverse pick-up!

46
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,430
Right?

47
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,670
Next is this slightly scary-looking group.

48
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,370
Will they accept our interview?

49
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,950
Staff: Do you have a bit of time right now?

50
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,950
Yes.

51
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,890
Staff: An interview is ok?

52
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,890
Yes.

53
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,070
These guys also accepted our interview without any issues.

54
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,730
Staff: We were actually looking for people being buried.

55
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,670
There are a few over there.

56
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,000
But if we were to compare, ours is at a higher level.

57
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,270
For some reason there is a rivalry with the neighbors.

58
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,990
So naturally we went over to talk to the other group.

59
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:07,480
Staff: By the way, there's a guy being buried right next to you.

60
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,890
Considering the number of people we have, I think we're winning.

61
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,670
Staff: So are you thinking about them a little bit?

62
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,670
Yes.

63
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,690
This group's competitive spirit was also sparked.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,750
Staff: They're starting to compete.

65
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,230
As a result of both side's attacks...

66
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,330
...the burials have escalated on both sides.

67
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,530
And then...

68
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,990
Staff: Can we have a moment?

69
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,400
You made it out alive!

70
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,590
Staff: Which one do you like?

71
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,860
I mean, one of them is pretty flat.

72
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,430
The other one is big.

73
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,430
Staff: The one in white?

74
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,970
If I were to choose one...

75
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,970
What's going on?

76
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,410
The bigger one.

77
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,440
The one in white.

78
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,310
Staff: Are you a virgin?

79
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,310
I am a virgin.

80
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,110
What's that all about?!

81
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,970
So off-topic!

82
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,760
Looking beyond the virgin, there was a suspicious mountain of sand.

83
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,380
Staff: Excuse me...

84
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,030
Staff: Do you have a bit of time?

85
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,030
Yes.

86
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,090
Staff: You were looking over here, right?

87
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,090
I was looking, yeah.

88
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,600
Staff: Did you bury him after seeing us?

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,600
Yes.

90
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,140
They were just a few attention-seeking high schoolers.

91
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,740
So we ignored them.

92
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,270
Behind them, after seeing the TV crew...

93
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,730
...this group quickly starts digging.

94
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,410
Many people at the beach just want to be on TV.

95
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,470
We came aross some high-quality burials.

96
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,630
Could it be that they buried him vertically?

97
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,710
Staff: Do you have a minute?

98
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,710
Yes, no problem.

99
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,210
This guy said ok too.

100
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,280
Furthermore...

101
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,690
Staff: Do you have a minute?

102
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,690
Ah...um... well... sure.

103
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,780
Staff: You have some time right now?

104
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,850
Not a problem.

105
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,560
Staff: Do you have a minute?

106
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,560
Sure.

107
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,750
Every interview we did was ok.

108
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,090
It's a couple.

109
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,090
Wait, the girlfriend is...
what is she doing?!

110
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,090
She's only touching
him there!

111
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,890
Next...

112
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,990
What was that cut
just now?!

113
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,780
Staff: Excuse me...

114
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,780
Staff: Do you have a bit of time right now?

115
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,780
Sure.

116
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,650
Staff: What country are you from?

117
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,650
We came from Vietnam.

118
00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:00,760
Staff: In Vietnam, do you bury people in the beach like this?

119
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,030
Yes, it's quite common.

120
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,760
Staff: Right here...

121
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,490
Staff: ...the waves are looking quite dangerous. Aren't you scared?

122
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,010
It's not dangerous, everything is ok.

123
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,270
I think it's ok.

124
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,710
Japan is safe, it's ok.

125
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,530
Japan is safe, so being buried next to the ocean is no problem.

126
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,530
Next...

127
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,480
Staff: Excuse me.

128
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,720
Staff: Do you have a minute?

129
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,720
Yes...no problem.

130
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,360
Staff: How old are you?

131
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,860
I'm 20.

132
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,530
Staff: Are you a student?

133
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,290
I'm a student.

134
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,290
Friend: He's Aomori.

135
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,130
I'm from Aomori Prefecture.

136
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,630
Staff: What are your thoughts on this beach in Tokyo?

137
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,430
It's amazing.

138
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,000
Aomori does't compare to this.

139
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,840
Staff: Do you have a message for your parents in Aomori?

140
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,640
Dad and mom - are you doing well?

141
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,610
I have been doing very well.

142
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,930
I have been doing very well.

143
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:10,210
We've found the trickiest burial of the day.

144
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,210
Staff: Excuse me.

145
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,440
Staff: We're with Wednesday Downtown.

146
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,100
Staff: Do you have a minute?

147
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,770
He can't hear you.

148
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,870
Staff: EXCUSE ME...

149
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,770
Staff: CAN WE HAVE A BIT OF YOUR TIME?

150
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,990
No...I'm in pain.

151
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,450
Staff: It's not "I'm in pain", can we have a bit of your time?

152
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,790
My eyes hurt.

153
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:39,530
In conclusion, people buried in sand at the beach will accept an interview if their ears aren't covered.

154
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,830
Ah, so that's how it is.
