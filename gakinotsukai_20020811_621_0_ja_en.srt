1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
As you can see, the Matsumoto family's schedule is as follows.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Currently, they are finishing their work on the materials.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Next, they will be taught the lyrics by the anime song Teyou.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
After enjoying Teyou's singing voice, the Matsumoto family will now perform their own song.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'll write it down.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I heard it.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He is doing his best.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
He is pulling.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hitoshi Ren-chai!

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Nantou Bando Gakushou!

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
O-Kan Densha!

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Nanninannou Ura-chan!

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Dadadadadada!

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And the last one is...

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
O-Kan Densai!

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Who are you?

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm your...

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
O-Kan.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
O-Kan who was born.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Chaka-chan.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Welcome!

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Thank you!

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yoyoyo-chan!

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Matsumoto Ren-chan!

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Ah, that's a good song.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The hero song is a bit embarrassing.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's okay if you're embarrassed after singing, but

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
while you're singing,

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You should be high-pitched.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And then, mom, a little more.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Like this.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's fine, but before that, for example,

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
one of the words,

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
like this,

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm not going to give birth!

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Ah, I see.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Don't say anything to me, PUNCH!

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Um, then,

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
you should decide at the end.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ren-jai, don't say anything to me, PUNCH!

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's right.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And then, most of the time,

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Don't say anything to me, PUNCH!

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And, um,

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Otakeme is, um,

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Um, um,

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Dad! Dad!

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Um,

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Please cut the rope.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
In this way,

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes, yes.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:07,640
Cut the rope to the

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Masumoto Ren-jai,

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's coming in, it's coming in a lot now.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's right. That's good.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're used to it.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm used to it.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You can't get in.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Where are you going?

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Where are you going?

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Are you talking?

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sure you'll be able to sing.

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you sing too much, you won't be able to sing in the real thing.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I can sing a lot.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
All of them are crazy.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All of them are crazy.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
There are many characters.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
4 characters, 4 characters, all of them are crazy.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's terrible.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Super cute!

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That's right.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's like a strong natural power.

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's not physical strength.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's a potential power.

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What is it?

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm not a baby!

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's not a baby.

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's 12.30pm. It's time for dinner.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's about time for the small-sized dishes.

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This is my wife.

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh my!

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is my wife.

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What's this?

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What is this?

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Why don't you look at it once and close it?

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What is this?

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What is this?

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Hiroshi?

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's a year.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hiroshi is not my own.

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's a year.

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No, it's Hiroshi.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hiroshi is a year old.

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's why I opened it once and closed it.

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The mother of Matsumoto-san has already eaten for today.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I thought you would eat it, Koshikun.

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm not good at cooking.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Are you okay?

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm okay.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You're a rotten person.

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm okay.

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm a rough person.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But the fried chicken is delicious.

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The rice is delicious.

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
There was no rice at all.

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It was only when I was young.

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I was surprised.

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It was only when I was young.

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There was only Shiji-ken.

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It was only when I was young.

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's still good.

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's still good.

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What are you talking about?

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's a bit nostalgic.

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's nostalgic, right?

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You've never seen it, right?

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's a girl's game.

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No, it's a good game.

121
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's not a game. Why did you do it?

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's been 30 years.

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Karaage is also delicious.

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Karaage is delicious.

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's a lie!

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No way!

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm gonna put this on!

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Nobody's listening!

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He's a pervert!

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll show you!

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll show you!

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're lying!

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's a lie!

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's a lie!

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's the only thing delicious!

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's the only thing delicious!

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It looks like a pancake, right?

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's like ketchup, right?

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's like a potato starch.

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's spicy, but it's delicious.

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But it was delicious, right?

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's delicious.

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Do you hate it?

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's delicious.

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's like a sandwich.

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's like a tempura.

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's like this.

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's just the appearance.

149
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Why do you use aluminum foil?

150
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Because it's oil, I use this.

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So I don't use it after that.

152
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't care about the presentation.

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't care about that.

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Really?

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's delicious.

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's delicious.

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This is a very unique taste.

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I've eaten this before.

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's not very crunchy.

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's not very crunchy.

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But it's nostalgic.

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Is it nostalgic?

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Please write it down.

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This is very nostalgic.

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's cold in here.

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What do you want to say to this person?

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't really want to say anything.

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't know what to say.

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Do you want to kiss?

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I like this.

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This is a kiss.

172
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't want to kiss you.

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What about you, En-chan?

175
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I was born in the year of the rat.

176
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You look like Shojiro-san.

177
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You look like your grandfather.

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
My grandfather?

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Shojiro?

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He was born in the year of the rat.

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No, no.

182
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He died at the age of 74.

183
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
On June 8th.

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I loved him very much.

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But I don't know his name.

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I respect his father.

187
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I was in a hurry.

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Me too.

189
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You had a tattoo.

190
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes.

191
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Why?

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I didn't say that until the end.

193
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You had a tattoo and got a knife thrown at you.

194
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I did my best.

195
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You, I,

196
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I was in a hurry on the day of the festival but on the day of the festival, you were in a hurry.

197
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What's the matter with you?

198
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What's the matter with you?

199
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
After relaxing in the break time, they finally start the action show.

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm not sure if this is the second pose.

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What's going on?

202
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I haven't seen it yet, but I'm about to enter.

203
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Help me!

205
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Wait!

206
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Oh, scary, scary, scary.

207
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm the boss!

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm the boss!

209
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's too much!

210
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Despite all the problems, the Matsumoto family managed to complete the action show.

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Finally, they will perform a dance that combines the two songs.

212
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
How long have we been doing this?

213
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
About 2 minutes and 20 seconds.

214
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
4 minutes.

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Excuse me, there's only one minute left.

216
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
How about this?

217
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This is a circle.

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But, there is no magic that can be done in one minute.

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This, this, this, this.

220
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Everyone.

221
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I thought I could show you everything.

222
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Then, show me.

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Show me.

224
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's a good thing.

225
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's a good thing.

226
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's a good thing.

227
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's a good thing.

228
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's a good thing.

229
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's a good thing.

230
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm still not used to it.

231
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This is a hammer.

232
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
This is a magic hammer.

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why are you doing magic when you are an old lady?

234
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What are you doing?

235
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm being watched for an hour.

236
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
At 2 am, Oton and Okan are taking a break and it's time for the three brothers.

237
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm not going to talk to you for a long time.

238
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What are you saying?

239
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm not going to talk to you.

240
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm not going to talk to you.

241
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm Keisuke Kowarikensuke's girlfriend.

242
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What are you talking about?

243
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Keisuke's girlfriend.

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm glad you played such a punishment game.

245
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yugo is a morning girl.

246
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's a punishment game.

247
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
After a while, Matsumoto and Onee take a break.

248
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But, Ani is still passionate.

249
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's amazing.

250
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's a little bit of a change.

251
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's a little bit different.

252
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Meanwhile, at the live broadcast, the staff is working towards the real Matsumoto Renjai.

253
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And finally, the time is 30 minutes before the actual broadcast.

254
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
3.55 am, 30 minutes before the actual broadcast.

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The Matsumoto family, who changed their clothes, heads to the live broadcast.

256
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you for your hard work.

257
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't have to be in a hurry, so I can say whatever I want to say.

258
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't have anything to say.

259
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And the rehearsal before the live broadcast begins.

260
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
However...

261
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oton has forgotten his lines and movements.

262
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He is in a state of unease.

263
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Morning 1, go!

264
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oton Ninja!

265
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm ready!

267
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
All preparations are done, and only the live show remains.

268
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Even Matsumoto Ikka, who has not been able to smile enough, is not able to hide his nervousness and his expression is stiff.

269
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Will the live show, which is only once, succeed?

270
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't believe in it.

271
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I don't have a 1% chance of success.

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
My dad is working hard.

273
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I thought it was about time.

274
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's a hard win.

275
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm getting excited.

276
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And then...

277
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:26,000
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

278
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Wow! It's so fun! Summer vacation!

279
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Where should we go?

280
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Should we go to the mountains?

281
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I wonder if I can help you.

282
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'll try to hold you a little longer.

283
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Someone help me!

284
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Help me!

285
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Stop!

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The first one is...

287
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Hitoshi Renjai!

288
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Sugahara Renjai!

289
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Hitomi Renjai!

290
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Sakahiro Renjai!

291
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm a super bot.

292
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm a super bot.

293
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
All five of you are Matsumoto Rangers!

294
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What's this?

295
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,560
� adolescence

296
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,100
Go Takeshi!!!!!!!!

297
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,080
Risa-chan...

298
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,080
What is that?

299
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,080
What is that?

300
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,080
What is that?

301
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
That's strange.

302
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,080
That's right.

303
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,080
Amazing.

304
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,080
κεpen�뤼

305
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,080
What is this?

306
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,080
I hate broadcasting!

307
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,080
What is this?

308
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,080
I can't remember the lyrics.

309
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
Stop it!

310
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
I can't remember the lyrics.

311
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,080
I'm scared.

312
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,080
It's not scary at all.

313
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
It's scary.

314
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,080
It's scary.

315
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:49,080
The two of us are at the same hall.

316
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
I don't know if there's one more.

317
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
I only know one.

318
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,080
At that point, I'm a little confused.

319
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,080
What happened?

320
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,080
This is...

321
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
Wow!

322
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,080
That's right.

323
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
I don't know what you're doing.

324
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,080
The winner is...

325
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
...

326
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
...

327
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
Not yet.

328
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
Tanjiro!

329
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
Yay!

330
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,080
I was surprised.

331
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
Naomi!

332
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
I'm not a good actor.

333
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
Shin!

334
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
I'm not good at acting.

335
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
I'm not good at acting.

336
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
Orange!

337
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,080
I'm not going to do it.

338
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
This is really...

339
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
This is really...

340
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
I'm a good cook.

341
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,080
I'm a good cook.

342
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
How was it?

343
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,080
I'm a good cook.

344
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
This is strange.

345
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,080
I'm doing it. It was hard.

346
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
I did my best.

347
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
Please come in. Thank you.

348
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,080
Please come in. Thank you.

349
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Please come in. Thank you.

350
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
Please come in. Thank you.

351
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
I'm sorry.

352
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,080
I'm sorry.

354
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,080
It's okay to be poor.

356
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
Everyone, take care of your family.

357
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,080
Bye bye!

358
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
I'm sorry.

359
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
I'm sorry.

360
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,080
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,080
I'm sorry.

362
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,080
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Thank you for your hard work.

364
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,080
Thank you very much.

365
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,080
Thank you very much.

366
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,080
Thank you.

367
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,080
That's good.

368
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
That's good.

369
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,080
You got in.

370
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
Yes.

371
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,080
You got in cleanly.

372
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
Yes.

373
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,080
With this...

374
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
Sorry, I'm late.

375
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,080
That's good.

376
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
It's okay.

377
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:23,080
While overcoming many hardships, he worked hard with his family to create the Matsumoto Batsugei.

378
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,080
The brothers and sisters who sing for their younger brother.

379
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,080
The father and mother who work hard for their son.

380
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,080
Stop it, stop it. You're giving up too fast.

381
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,080
You're giving up too fast.

382
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:41,080
And the Matsumoto family became one.

383
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,080
Okay.

384
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
No, no, no, no, no.

385
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
It's over.

386
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,080
Right?

387
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
Yes.

388
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,080
You know, I had a sleepover once.

389
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,080
When I woke up, I couldn't do anything.

390
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
You couldn't do anything?

391
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,080
I think he pushed it with a thin part of the tip of the pencil.

392
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
Is it a phenomenon?

393
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,080
Reset it! Reset it!

394
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
It's just 0, 0, 0, 0.

395
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,080
It's just 0, 0, 0, 0.

396
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,080
If you don't talk to your father...

397
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,080
I did talk to him.

398
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,080
It's like Kanaage is a bit sick.

399
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,080
It's not a good thing.

400
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
He's too much.

401
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
So, I'll run away to the alcohol.

402
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Even the bell...

403
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
Even the bell...

404
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,080
Even the bell that fell on my feet can't be found.

405
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
It's not a small thing.

406
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,080
Then what else can you find?
