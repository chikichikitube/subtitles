1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The history of the club activities of the kids.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first club.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The high speed spinning spinning club.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The small and small club.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And tonight...

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The fourth club activity.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,540
The

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,540
I've done many things, but I was only a second seat.

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,040
What?

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,540
I was only a second seat.

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,540
Second seat? What do you mean?

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,540
I was doing stupid things to do this Hikizurare Club.

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,540
Hikidome Club?

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,540
Furufuru Club?

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,540
That's right.

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,540
Kocho Bashi Club?

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,540
I've done a lot of things.

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,540
But I really wanted to do this Hikizurare Club.

19
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,540
Is this your real name?

20
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,540
This is my real name.

21
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,540
What do you mean?

22
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,540
It's simple.

23
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,540
There's a car with a bar.

24
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,540
You hold it in your hand and never let go of it.

25
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,540
It's a very simple story.

26
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,540
Let's measure the time.

27
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,540
Think of the bar as a TV show's regular.

28
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,540
I see.

29
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,540
You're right.

30
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,540
Well, Yama-chan, you're doing your best.

31
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,540
He's getting too close.

32
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,540
How many regular ones do you have?

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,540
I have two regular ones.

34
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,540
He said, I have two.

35
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,540
He said, I have two.

36
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,540
So, who are we going to fight today?

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,540
Let's get started!

38
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,540
Let's go!

39
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,540
Here's our opponent!

40
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,540
Who is it?

41
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,540
It's me!

42
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,540
This is...

43
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,540
Stop it!

44
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,540
You're too fast!

45
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,540
I'm sorry, but I'm not good at this.

46
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,540
Hurry up!

47
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,540
The last one is the opponent, Watanabe Entertainment!

48
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:01,540
We are Watanabe! Watanabe! Watanabe Entertainment!

49
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,540
You should have said that earlier!

50
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,540
You're doing well.

51
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,540
Can you do it?

52
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,540
Thank you!

53
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,540
I was able to do a live show

54
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,540
I thought I shouldn't be late

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,540
I gathered young people

56
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,540
Why did Michael and Fuuka come?

57
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,540
Wait a minute

58
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,540
I'm the one who should be the one to say it

59
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,540
Michael!

60
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,540
Yes!

61
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,540
Michael

62
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,540
What about Red?

63
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,540
I don't have Red

64
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,540
No, you don't

65
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,540
I'm curious about the red one.

66
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,540
The red one is really good.

67
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,540
You're really good.

68
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,540
I'll tell you this.

69
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,540
I've been clinging to this entertainment industry for 12 years.

70
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,540
So last month, I let go of that hand.

71
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,540
Please.

72
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,540
What?

73
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,540
I'm not going to let go of it.

74
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,540
Don't pay attention to the pen.

75
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,540
What's going on now?

76
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,540
I'm so hot.

77
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,540
My stomach is hot.

78
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,540
Let me explain the rules.

79
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,540
The first person to play will decide the order of the team, and will be dragged off in a 1 to 1.

80
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,540
Each person will have to count the time until their hands are released, and will decide the winner in that total amount of time.

81
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,540
Lastly, there is a team match where five people will be dragged off.

82
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,540
The chance of winning is...

83
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,540
Let's decide the strategy first.

84
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,540
Let's decide on each one.

85
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,540
Our team is...

86
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,540
This guy is amazing.

87
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,540
Who?

88
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,540
Yamane!

89
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,540
Really?

90
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,540
He's the best!

91
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,540
He's really powerful.

92
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,540
He's really powerful.

93
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,540
How many do you have?

94
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,540
32-30.

95
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,540
That's a lot!

96
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,540
That's a lot!

97
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,540
That's a lot!

98
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,540
What should we do?

99
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,540
When I do this, I always do it first.

100
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,540
You've decided, right?

101
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,540
After that, you can change it.

102
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,540
I'm already burning with drama.

103
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,540
If you do it here, there will be no connection.

104
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,540
I'm a little angry with Mr. Tachihiro.

105
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:29,360
The battle of the attention of the

106
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Let's start the first round!

107
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Let's go!

108
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Go, Endo!

109
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
Three!

110
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Go!

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,360
Ready...

112
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Wait a minute!

113
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Oh no!

114
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
Oh no!

115
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
He's fast!

116
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Oh no!

117
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Endo missed!

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Endo is going to get it!

119
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
He's fast!

120
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Endo is fast!

121
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
Yamane is fast too!

122
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Hey, are you okay?

123
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Endo!

124
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Endo!

125
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Hey, it's broken!

126
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
It's true!

127
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
It's broken!

128
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
It's broken!

129
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
No!

130
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Yori-san.

131
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,360
I won't say anything bad.

132
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
What?

133
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
I should have withdrawn.

134
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
I withdrew.

135
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
I withdrew.

136
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,360
I'm ready to ride a bicycle.

137
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
That's the spirit.

138
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
I withdrew.

139
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
It's so fast!

140
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,360
This is the curve.

141
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,360
The curve is so fast.

142
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Yes, it is.

143
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
He won!

144
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
It was good.

145
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
He is so good.

146
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
He won.

147
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,360
Everyone is doing the same thing.

148
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
That's right.

149
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
The feeling is amazing.

150
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
It's amazing.

151
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
It's really fast.

152
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
It's fast.

153
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,360
I feel like I'm going to do it.

154
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Let's do it.

155
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,360
Everyone is doing their best.

156
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Have you decided?

157
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
We have decided.

158
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,360
We are going to do it.

159
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Really?

160
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Fukawa.

161
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Please.

162
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
Fukawa.

163
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
I have to cut here.

164
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,360
I have to drink it.

165
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
What should we do?

166
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
I'm a little scared.

167
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
Do you want to go, Hamada?

168
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
I'll go.

169
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
I'll go.

170
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,360
Let's go.

171
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,360
Good luck, Hamada.

172
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
I had a different image.

173
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,360
I'm sorry, but isn't that Hosei?

174
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,360
The first one is Masatoshi Hamada from the Gaki team.

175
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,360
The second one is Ryo Fukawa from the Watanabe team.

176
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,360
I'm a little nervous about the standby.

177
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,360
He's really fat.

178
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
I'm scared.

179
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Are you ready?

180
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
10 laps.

181
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Ready.

182
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
I'm going to speed up a bit.

183
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
You just won!

184
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Seriously?

185
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
You lost by 1 or 2 seconds.

186
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Hamada-san!

187
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
Hamada-san!

188
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Hamada-san!

189
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
What is this?

190
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
What? What?

191
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
The curve...

192
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
I was thrown out of the corner.

193
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,360
I'm scared.

194
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
I'm sorry.

195
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
I lost in 1 second.

196
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,360
I was almost at the same time.

197
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
I lost in 1 second.

198
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,360
I was caught by Hamada-san.

199
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,360
You won't fall if you don't stand up.

200
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
You pulled me a little, didn't you?

201
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Who pulled you?

202
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
I was pulled back a little.

203
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,360
All kinds of comedians have been pulled back so far.

204
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,360
The final match is the double Tanaka match between Kokoriko Tanaka and An Girls Tanaka.

205
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
Now, the double Tanaka.

206
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
I won't lose in the inside.

207
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,360
I'm going to show you who's the best at the C-BDog.

208
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
That's right.

209
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,360
When we join the same youth club, we will be like this.

210
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Too slow.

211
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Too slow.

212
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
I'm counting on you!

213
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
Ready.

214
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
Go!

215
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
Go!

216
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
This is bad.

217
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
No, no, no. It's making a strange sound.

218
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
Tanaka, go!

219
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Tanaka!

220
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Don't give up!

221
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,360
Where did Tanaka go?

222
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,360
That was Tanaka again.

223
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,360
That was a bit too early.

224
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
What happened, Tanaka?

225
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
I got hit by a car over there, so it hurts.

226
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,360
What happened? I'm scared!

227
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,360
You should stop the outside.

228
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
The weeds are amazing.

229
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
The weeds are amazing outside!

230
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,360
The weeds are coming out!

231
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
It's scary!

232
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
It's outside!

233
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
It's good to be outside!

234
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
It's good to be outside!

235
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
I tried my best!

236
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
What was that?

237
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
What was that?

238
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
What was that?

239
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,360
The moment you talked, the balance changed.

240
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Ah, I was out of balance.

241
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
You were out of balance.

242
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,360
You're a poor guy!

243
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,360
You're really excited!

244
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,360
The junior team is the one who will be the leader of the 9 second round.

245
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Will they be able to turn the tables?

246
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
They can do it, right?

247
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,360
Well, even if you say it, it's 9 seconds.

248
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Hey, you!

249
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Who are you?

250
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
Next is...

251
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
Michael!

252
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Yamasaki and Michael!

253
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
I don't want to see Michael!

254
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,360
The special match is Yamasaki vs Michael.

255
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,360
During this match, the two's evolution will be questioned.

256
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
Who is that?

257
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
It's Professor Injiki.

258
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,360
It's also Mr. Ito Shiro.

259
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Are you okay?

260
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
I'll do my best.

261
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
I'll do my best.

262
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,360
If you end up losing, I'll have you think about it.

263
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,360
If I win, please change the regular.

264
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,360
You guys are talking about such a big thing.

265
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
I thought it was a lego!

266
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
I thought it was lego!

267
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
I'll go get it!

268
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
Go!

269
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Let's go!

270
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Please!

271
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
Ready!

272
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
Go!

273
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
9 seconds left!

274
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Go!

275
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Go!

276
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
There's still a lot left.

277
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
But you're doing your best.

278
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
Good luck!

279
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Good luck!

280
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
Michael, good luck!

281
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
He's still silent.

282
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
What are you saying?

283
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
He's not saying anything.

284
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
This is it.

285
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
Michael!

286
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
This is a bit fast.

287
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
Michael's a bit slow.

288
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
Here it comes!

289
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
Good, good, good.

290
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
You lost, but you're still a ball.

291
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
I don't even want to go.

292
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
I won, I won.

293
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
Good, you're out.

294
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Nagasaki, stand up.

295
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Stand up and run over here.

296
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
What's wrong with you?

297
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Run, you!

298
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
What did you do?

299
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,360
I wish you could show us a little more.

300
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
That's right.

301
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Michael won perfectly.

302
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
Yes.

303
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
You did it.

304
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Good job.

305
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Good job.

306
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Yes.

307
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Well, look at this.

308
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
What?

309
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Here.

310
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
What?

311
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
The sword is strange.

312
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Well, it's amazing if you have a sword.

313
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
That's right.

314
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
It's not good.

315
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
It's not good.

316
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
It's a sword.

317
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
It's not good.

318
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,360
You didn't do your best at all!

319
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,360
I did my best! I'm the winner after all!

320
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
Well, well, well...

321
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,360
I'm not even close to Hamada-san!

322
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
The distance is...

323
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,360
Right?

324
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
Right?

325
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Before the final match, Watanabe's team is 10 seconds ahead.

326
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,360
The match is left to the grand prize.

327
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,360
That's right! That's right!

328
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
10 seconds!

329
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
10 seconds!

330
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
I lost.

331
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
No, no, this is the final match.

332
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,360
Ouripts are still the свобод!

333
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,360
You went through, Gol-Gol!

334
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Next is Wataru and you!

335
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Seeing his face must hurt!

336
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
It certainly hurts!

337
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
We'll be playing the same Matsumoto game!

338
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,360
Hi, Matsumoto Ganryu?

339
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:24,800
You might get a

340
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,800
The team that won the battle with Watanabe's 10 second lead is the new Matsumoto team.

341
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Will they win?

342
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Look at this.

343
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,800
There's no Shiro, but he's taking this dog with him.

344
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Dog? It's not a dog.

345
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
It's a human.

346
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,800
I don't feel like I can win.

347
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
I don't feel like I can win.

348
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Stand by.

349
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Please do your best in the battle.

350
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Go for it, Goro-san.

351
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
You're really fat.

352
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Let's go!

353
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Ready...

354
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Go!

355
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
The first one!

356
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
It's still fine.

357
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
It's hot!

358
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Ouch!

359
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,800
The first curve is coming

360
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,800
It's coming

361
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
It's coming

362
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,800
It's accelerating

363
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Matsumoto is also scared

364
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Matsumoto is really scared

365
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,800
It's a long distance race

366
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
It's coming

367
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
It's dangerous

368
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
This is amazing!

369
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
This is great!

370
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
How was it?

371
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
You did it!

372
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I beat him!

373
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
You beat him!

374
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
You beat him!

375
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Amazing!

376
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
You did it!

377
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
It's your first win!

378
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
You should take this off.

379
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Golgo!

380
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I did it!

381
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
I got it, I got it.

382
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Golgo!

383
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Why? Why?

384
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Two rocks were in my mouth.

385
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
That's not good.

386
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
One of them swallowed it.

387
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Really?

388
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
It hit my mouth.

389
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,800
But I can still breathe.

390
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
How many seconds?

391
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Ah, but you lost 4 seconds.

392
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
I lost!

393
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
After this, it's finally a team battle.

394
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
The final battle will be decided by...

395
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
In the group battle, all 5 teams will be dragged away.

396
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,800
The remaining time will be added to the individual battle's total time.

397
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
The winner will be decided.

398
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
However, 4 people will be separated from their loved ones.

399
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
The remaining person will be dragged away.

400
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,800
First up is the 4 second lead team, Watanabe.

401
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Here, we'll reveal the results of the first round.

402
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Now, in the group battle, the first team is the Nabe team!

403
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Watanabe! Watanabe! Watanabe! Watanabe!

404
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Team up!

405
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Alright!

406
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Cut!

407
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
He's using his useless strength.

408
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Who's going to be in the middle?

409
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
It's a good balance.

410
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I see.

411
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,800
We have to make it a double.

412
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
I see.

413
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
It's a bit like a mudokan.

414
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Are you ready?

415
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Yes!

416
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Let's go!

417
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
Let's do this!

418
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Ready...

419
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Come on!

420
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Come on!

421
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Push your chest!

422
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
You can do it!

423
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Hang in there!

424
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
It's beautiful.

425
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
It's amazing.

426
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
It's vivid.

427
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Taro!

428
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Taro!

429
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Oh, he's coming!

430
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
He's running!

431
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Who is it?

432
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
Tanaka!

433
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
He's still running!

434
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,800
But there are four of them, and he's still good!

435
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Look out!

436
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Tanaka!

437
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Who is it?

438
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Who is it?

439
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
The last Golgo.

440
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,800
You were close.

441
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
You did your best.

442
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,800
This is how it feels.

443
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,800
One by one, they fall.

444
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
The balance is broken.

445
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
I see.

446
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
I see.

447
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
What's wrong?

448
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
What's wrong?

449
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Are you okay, Tanaka?

450
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
I'm okay.

451
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
The field is wider now.

452
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,800
There's a lot of grass.

453
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
It's weeds.

454
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
It's like a body bath.

455
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,800
So, as you can see, the results of the Watanabe team are as follows.

456
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,800
The Gaki team wins if they can get past 1 minute and 1 second.

457
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,260
The man in the middle, you and I will read it together.

458
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,120
Well, I know it well, but I haven't read it for two weeks.

459
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,220
I'll definitely read it for two weeks.

460
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,100
The minimum.

461
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
How many times?

462
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,100
How many times?

463
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,800
The most beautiful thing is that all five of us read it together.

464
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,200
How many times?

465
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,240
I don't like it.

466
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,000
Like a Dutchman.

467
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,800
I don't like it.

468
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Why not?

469
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Please.

470
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,600
What?

471
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
What should I say?

472
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,200
How many times?

473
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Like Dutch.

474
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Sorry.

475
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Let's do it.

476
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Let's go.

477
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Let's go!

478
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
I knew it would be like this.

479
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Let's go!

480
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,200
It's like a downfall.

481
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
It's the final round.

482
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
We'll do our best.

483
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
It's the final round.

484
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
I don't understand the meaning.

485
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Will the Gaku team turn the tables?

486
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Finally, they will challenge the last battle

487
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Now, whether you cry or laugh, this is the last battle

488
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Yaki no Sky Team

489
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,200
According to the calculation, if you don't go more than 2 laps, you can't win

490
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
That's right, there is a 1 minute difference

491
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
It's hard because it's the second time

492
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
It's a little hard in this era

493
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
It's thick, right?

494
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
It's thick

495
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
It's scary

496
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
It feels like it's being shaken

497
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
It's like a finger

498
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Then, please

499
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
It's the water from the river.

500
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Let go of me!

501
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Let go of me!

502
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Who is this?

503
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
Let go of me!

504
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
He's coming from here.

505
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
It's like he's coming from the mountain.

506
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
If you let go of someone, it's hard to deal with it.

507
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
And then, boom, boom, boom.

508
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Let go! Let go!

509
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Speed up!

510
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
100 km per hour!

511
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Wow, that's strong!

512
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
What?

513
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
What?

514
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
What?

515
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
The balance is off!

516
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
What?

517
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Look!

518
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Watch out! Watch out!

519
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
It hurts!

520
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Two people!

521
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
They're pushing!

522
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
They're pushing!

523
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Two more!

524
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Two more!

525
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Wow, it's so hard!

526
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
It's so subtle!

527
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Who's the winner?

528
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Time!

529
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Is Mr. Hanabata the third one?

530
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
I did it!

531
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Mr. Matsumoto is the last one.

532
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
It's so subtle!

533
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
This is a bit strange.

534
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Wow!

535
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
It's hard!

536
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
This is a bit scary.

537
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
I can't do it.

538
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
If I quit now, it would be like I'm thinking about something like TV.

539
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,200
I definitely didn't quit, but it was really impossible.

540
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Let's see the results!

541
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Gajiska team 1 minute 2 seconds!

542
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Nabeburo team 4 minutes 29 seconds.

543
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Gajiska team 4 minutes...

544
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
30 seconds!

545
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Team victory!

546
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,200
We lost, but oh my god!

547
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,200
Endo, don't lose!

548
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
We won!

549
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
This is crazy.

550
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,200
If you're crazy, you're a real kid.

551
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,500
It's not foreign ha ha ha ha
