Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.61,0:01:36.12,Masatoshi,,0,0,0,,But this is from your driving instructor
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.12,0:01:38.08,Masatoshi,,0,0,0,,You were doing 40 km/h tops!!
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.66,0:01:41.29,Hitoshi,,0,0,0,,Well, the instructor was stunned at my speed for sure
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.79,0:01:43.71,Masatoshi,,0,0,0,,But you're not to exceed 40 km/h during your class
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.71,0:01:45.58,Masatoshi,,0,0,0,,I mean, I failed once because of that
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.58,0:01:49.46,Masatoshi,,0,0,0,,I only went up to 42 or 43 km/h
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.80,0:01:50.71,Hitoshi,,0,0,0,,But you went over
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.71,0:01:51.92,Masatoshi,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I did

Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.22,0:01:58.10,Masatoshi,,0,0,0,,We're talking about a mere 40 km/h!!
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.10,0:01:59.43,Masatoshi,,0,0,0,,We are far from being skilled!!
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.56,0:02:00.89,Hitoshi,,0,0,0,,What do you mean?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.93,0:02:01.68,Hitoshi,,0,0,0,,This one time,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.68,0:02:03.31,Hitoshi,,0,0,0,,I was too poor to put any gas in my tank
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.31,0:02:05.02,Hitoshi,,0,0,0,,And I had maybe this much gas left
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.10,0:02:07.77,Hitoshi,,0,0,0,,But I managed to get home safely that night
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.02,0:02:11.00,Masatoshi,,0,0,0,,How the hell does that relate to anything we're talking about ?!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.00,0:02:13.00,Hitoshi,,0,0,0,,Those racers don't think about the gas in their tanks
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.08,0:02:14.48,Masatoshi,,0,0,0,,They do, too
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.48,0:02:16.82,Masatoshi,,0,0,0,,They need to make a pit stop to refuel and stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.18,0:02:17.58,Hitoshi,,0,0,0,,But are they paying??
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.54,0:02:19.34,Masatoshi,,0,0,0,,Why do they have to ?!!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.44,0:02:21.54,Masatoshi,,0,0,0,,That's their freakin' job!!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.90,0:02:24.41,Masatoshi,,0,0,0,,You expect them to pay out of pocket?!!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.68,0:02:28.98,Hitoshi,,0,0,0,,♪ And that'd make a whole lot of differeeeence ♪
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.94,0:02:32.41,Masatoshi,,0,0,0,,You're not making any sense!
