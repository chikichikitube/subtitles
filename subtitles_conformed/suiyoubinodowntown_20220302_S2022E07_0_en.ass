Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.65,0:02:58.76,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,Everyone laughed because the expression itself was funny
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.40,0:03:00.98,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,It adds another layer of meaning
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.89,0:03:02.23,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,But when everyone was laughing, only Iwahashi-san

Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.46,0:03:04.98,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,Is it that accurate?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.96,0:03:10.14,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,And indeed, he had become the same as Sakurai

Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.15,0:03:29.65,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,Hamaya (his partner) thought he had said it
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.19,0:03:30.58,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,What happened?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.65,0:03:34.09,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,He thought "Seeing the Sakurai-looking face caused the analogy to just come to me"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.09,0:03:36.19,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,He thought he'd done a really good job
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.87,0:03:37.68,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,I'm scared, what is this?  \N-Scary, scary
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.68,0:03:38.83,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.19,0:03:40.57,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,I don't really know why, but when I heard him say that,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.57,0:03:45.30,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,I thought "No, no, no, wasn't it me that said it?"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.93,0:03:46.53,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,That's what everyone was thinking
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.31,0:03:47.44,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,After hearing the line "He's become like Sakurai"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.44,0:03:49.87,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,I was also thinking "He's become like Sakurai"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.14,0:03:50.14,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,An amazing phenomenon
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.87,0:03:52.94,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,Because it fit so well
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.14,0:03:55.58,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,So I thought I had said it too
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.88,0:03:56.95,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,Scary!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.12,0:03:58.55,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,What an amazing phenomenon
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.55,0:04:02.42,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,But after watching the broadcast, I told Hamaya:

Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.22,0:04:07.83,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,"Oh yeah... it was Iwahashi"
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.39,0:04:08.56,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,I see, I guess it's possible
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.83,0:04:11.00,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,I said "I'm really suprised it was Iwahashi..."
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.81,0:04:14.41,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,Can such a thing happen? \N-Impressive
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.53,0:04:17.55,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,Next is the comment that Morita was most impressed by
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.20,0:04:22.97,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,About a year ago, on Wednesday Downtown
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.97,0:04:29.15,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,There was a theory called "The first B in BKB is 80% Super"
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.15,0:04:31.32,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,It involved me going out on location
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.32,0:04:36.92,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,In the studio part of the theory, Matsumoto said something
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.12,0:04:42.33,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,It made me think "Ah! As expected of Matsumoto Hitoshi!"
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.22,0:04:42.66,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,I don't remember at all
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.72,0:04:47.33,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,Morita was impressed by the following quote from Matsumoto
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.73,0:04:47.55,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,I remember  \N-Really?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.53,0:04:50.44,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,The theory is...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.67,0:04:54.09,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,BKB- Ah, sorry  \N-No problem, please
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.09,0:04:56.51,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,Hamada-san, is it okay?  \N-Of course, it's yours, after all
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.51,0:04:57.54,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,Is that so? I'm sorry
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.54,0:05:00.48,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,The last dumpling?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.56,0:05:03.72,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,Can I eat this?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.72,0:05:05.18,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,That's the one
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.47,0:05:06.01,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,This was really awesome
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.02,0:05:08.72,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,That's it!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.56,0:05:09.44,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,I can understand this one
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.29,0:05:14.11,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,The tone is very good
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.72,0:05:15.36,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,First of all, the speed at which he says "the last dumpling?"
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.36,0:05:19.00,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,Such a quick retort
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.15,0:05:17.04,wipe_Wed,,0,0,0,,It's too fast
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.00,0:05:24.19,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,There's also the conciseness of the phrase that makes it so much more effective
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.19,0:05:25.77,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,This is essentially, to put it mildly
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.04,0:05:28.27,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,A bundle of politeness (over-politeness)
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.27,0:05:31.66,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,But if you just said "a bundle of politeness" straight
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.66,0:05:35.10,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,It could be a little confusing
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.10,0:05:37.88,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,Instead, he just said "the last dumpling?"
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.88,0:05:41.69,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,In such a concise sentence, a perfect interpretation is offered
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.69,0:05:46.16,normal_Wed,,0,0,0,,And included "dumplings", as everyone knows the phrase "dumplings are always in abundance"
