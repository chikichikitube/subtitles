Comment: 0,0:11:35.10,0:11:38.34,Mori Shinichi Endo,,0,0,0,,{\blur6.818}Joke on the last name Mori (森), which means forest and is made up of three "tree"/"wood" kanji (木). 木 has the same pronunciation ("ki") as 気, which means "spirit"/"mind"/"heart" which he uses in the phrase "ki wo nukazu" (without losing heart/spirit when doing something). Take one more off and it becomes Hayashi (林), which means "woods".　Leave one and it leaves 木 which also has the reading "Moku".
