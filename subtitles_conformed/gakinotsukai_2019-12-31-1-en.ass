Dialogue: 0,2:34:32.99,2:34:39.57,Translator's Note,,0,0,0,,T/N: In Japanese, "smart person" is phrased as, "one with a good head". However, another interpretation would be, "one with 'E' at the start" because the word for "good" is pronounced just like the letter "E" and "head" can be interpreted as "the start".

Dialogue: 0,2:34:39.57,2:34:43.94,Translator's Note,,0,0,0,,T/N: Hamada struggled because Japanese is a phonetic language, meaning that each letter/syllable is only pronounced in one way. So the "E" in "Endo" is always an "eh" sound, never an "ii" sound. "Romaji" means the romanization of the Japanese language.
