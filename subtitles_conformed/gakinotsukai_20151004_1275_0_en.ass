Comment: 0,0:06:16.50,0:06:16.50,Mori Shinichi Endo,,0,0,0,,Endo states that he (Mori) came to Tokyo via group employment, while the caption states that he came to Osaka. Upon light investigation, it seems he did come to Osaka first, changing jobs over 17 times, but did eventually debut in Tokyo at least by his 20s (in the 1970s). The term Endo uses to describe this is a bit ambiguous though, since he doesn't name the city, just says "he moved to the capital". He's likely just saying that he moved to Osaka after junior high, then came to Tokyo in his 20s as the real Mori Shinichi did, but got some locations/years wrong.

Nothing similar that would make sense comes to mind, so the translation below is based on context more than the words themselves, and should probably be edited again later.
Comment: 0,0:12:34.36,0:12:34.87,Mori Shinichi Endo,,0,0,0,,'Reach' in this instance is something akin to meaning 'one away from winning', sort of like the concept of a 'match point' in tennis. At least that's the typical usage of 'reach' in competitions, but for Mahjong specifically it may have a different meaning.
