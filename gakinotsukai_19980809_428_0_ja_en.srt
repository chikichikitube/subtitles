I would be very happy if you really did.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,620
I Yangji was trying to show the energetic talent of peette

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,620
But I want you to understand the feeling of a taxi driver.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,620
Yes.

12
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,620
Let's do it together until the end.

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,300
Happy Birthday

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,920
Oh! Coolly.

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,520
Hey brat!

He is a black 我是I am a cone-eater dry.

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,220
But WHAT?

18
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,220
What's going on?

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,220
In a little while, the tickets will be sold out.

20
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,220
What?

21
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,220
Think about the fans' feelings at the concert.

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,220
Yes, I understand.

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,220
Who are you?

24
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,220
I'm the producer of Okama.

25
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,220
Recording is going smoothly.

26
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,220
The guys have also started to get on the boat.

27
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,220
The water is shaking, the boat is shaking.

28
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,220
He is a taxi driver.

29
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,220
There is no one waiting.

30
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,220
I can't wait

31
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,220
It's cool

32
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,220
It's cool

33
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,220
No.2, No.3, No.1

34
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,220
No.2 is cool

35
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,220
Close the door, close the door

36
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,220
OK, let's go to the next one

37
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,220
Shall we go to the next one?

38
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,220
Takeo

39
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,220
Yes

40
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,220
Can you make the part between No.1 and No.2 cool?

41
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,220
Cool?

42
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,220
Yes

43
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,220
You use the word, right?

44
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,220
What will you do?

45
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,220
No, it's OK

46
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,220
You don't have to use it!

47
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:28,220
The recording is in the middle of the song, and the members are arranging the song one by one

48
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,220
You're going to sing right away?

49
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,220
I'm going to close my eyes and go to sleep.

50
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,220
You're going to close your eyes and go to sleep?

51
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,220
I'm going to close my eyes and go to sleep.

52
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,220
That's good.

53
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,220
Let's try it again from the beginning.

54
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:13,220
I'm going to be a good singer

55
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,220
I'm going to be a good singer

56
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,220
This is impossible

57
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,220
Hatake, you can say that your guitar is pretty good

58
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,220
Like this?

59
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,220
Let's do it again.

60
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,220
The next word is,

61
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,220
Super tire.

62
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,220
The car never stops.

63
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,720
The taxi drivers are slowly turning their colors

64
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,720
Back alright

65
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
What is this?

66
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
I'll hold your hand

67
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,720
I'm the driver

68
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,720
It's alright, it's alright

69
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Cool!

70
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
It took a long time to finish

71
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,720
That's the good part

72
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
It was good

73
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,720
Between the 2nd and 3rd, each person has a different level of motivation.

74
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,720
There's the drum solo, and the group dance, and the formation.

75
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,720
I want you to make this song 15 minutes long.

76
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
That was one chorus, not one minute.

77
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
The recording is finally coming to an end.

78
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,720
Taxi Driver, Salam Q Version, complete!

79
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:31,520
Yuichi Shisou's

80
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:43,020
Tachibana Hayashino's

81
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,020
It will appear right now.

82
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,020
It will appear right now.

83
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
It will appear right now.

84
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,020
OK!

85
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,020
Good!

86
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,020
Good!

87
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,020
The next is Taxi Driver's final version.

88
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,020
Go Kai!

89
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,020
I'm a taxi driver

90
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,020
I don't have a car

91
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,020
I don't have a bus

92
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,020
I'm a taxi driver

93
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,020
I don't have a car

94
00:07:53,020 --> 00:08:01,020
I put my ear, I put my heart, I'm a mysterious driver

95
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:08,020
Ah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

96
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:19,020
Masha orai, mak preparation orai

97
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,020
It's a long one, Deba.

98
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,020
Well, um...

99
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,020
Wait a minute.

100
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,020
I don't know what this is supposed to be about.

101
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,020
Well, you see...

102
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,020
I've seen it on the players' airwaves.

103
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,020
It's the first time for everyone to see it live.

104
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,020
Ah, is that true?

105
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,020
It's like, wow, a live pose!

106
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,020
That's how it is.

107
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,020
And, the song was long!

108
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,020
That's also true.

109
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,020
Thank you very much.

110
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,020
Do they not listen to you every time?

111
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,020
They listen to me every 10 seconds.

112
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,020
They listen to you the most.

113
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,020
I don't know, but they listen to me all the time.

114
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,020
I sing at concerts.

115
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,020
And you sing Heihei.

116
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,020
The guitar is interesting.

117
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,560
Sweetie,土産!

118
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,580
At last!

119
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,540
======

120
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,180
I felt really sad after I think about the series.
