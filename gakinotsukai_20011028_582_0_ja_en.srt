1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I want to go to my wife.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You should go.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's in English.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you don't change your pants, you should change your clothes.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I thought you were going to change your clothes.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What time is it now?

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's 3 o'clock.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's terrible.

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In terms of time, it's about 2 hours.

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's about 2 and a half hours.

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's better than just saying that.

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Good morning.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Good morning.

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Good morning.

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Your wife is changing.

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What's wrong with you today?

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What's wrong with me?

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The hot and spicy Ankake match!

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is the Morimon match

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's go!

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's a tie!

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's not easy.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What is this?

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Dangerous! Dangerous!

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's dangerous!

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Dangerous! Dangerous!

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That was really strong.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's hot! It's hot! It's hot!

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's really hot in Japan.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's really hot.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The stage is too small.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No, it's not the stage.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's the ring.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You're making a big deal out of this.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Wait a minute!

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You're making a big deal out of this.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm serious.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's not true.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
How many times have you done this?

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I think I've done this about 5 or 6 times.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But it's like, I wonder if it's okay.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But this is a popular corner.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's a famous corner for the famous writer.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's definitely like this.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
My wife and I will definitely get excited.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What?

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's definitely more exciting than my wife.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
There's no doubt about that.

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Do you think it will be a good story?

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Of course.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
To be honest, Yamazaki VS Moriman is about to be...

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's like a comedy.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's not a comedy.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But it's a bit sad.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's not something a wife would do with her child involved.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I think you can get more numbers from that.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If you can get numbers, it's good.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, I can't.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hey, Mr. Tsubasa.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What is it?

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't have any special memories of you.

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mr. Tsubasa.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm just kidding.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,840
Well, this video was made with the support from the sponsored at Collector promisingacked masks ordinary, white Muslim mosque in the city of Hikacchula

65
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,600
This show is presented by the sponsor you are looking for

66
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Nothing can be forced to happen?

67
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,600
From now on, it's time for the official death match between Itao vs Yome.

68
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,600
The tension is low.

69
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,600
From the bottom of hell, you can hear his footsteps.

70
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Who are you talking about?

71
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
The blue Grim Reaper of the Naniwa.

72
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
ITAO!

73
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Ah, the red hair.

74
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
It's not red hair.

75
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Let's stop with the red hair.

76
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
It's my own hair.

77
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Red hair.

78
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,600
A wife who is a comedian.

79
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
A wife of hell.

80
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,600
A woman who is a reverse-savage in South America.

81
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
What's a reverse-savage?

82
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
The bride is here!

83
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
No, no, this feeling...

84
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
It's all on me.

85
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Shut up!

86
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
What is it?

87
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Why is Yamada here?

88
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
There are so many girls here.

89
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
It's Judge Yamada.

90
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
You're a judge.

91
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,600
What kind of connection is there between us?

92
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,600
I forgot to say this, but I have someone I want to introduce.

93
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
What is it?

94
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Thank you.

95
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,600
I think I've been on American TV before this program.

96
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
That was a great, a great popular kid.

97
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,600
And I heard that the president of the goods is selling well.

98
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
No, no, no. You're making it up.

99
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
I want to say something.

100
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
No, no, no. You're just saying it.

101
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,600
I'm grateful to meet Takenotsukai. Africa will make big money.

102
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:33,600
It's an honor to meet Takenotsukai members. Today, I brought the goods of my company which is a big hit in Africa.

103
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Oh.

104
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Look at this.

105
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Wow.

106
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
It's just a sticker.

107
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I'm not going to do it anymore.

108
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm not going to do it anymore.

109
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Why? I don't care.

110
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Can I say something?

111
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,600
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

112
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Where is it?

113
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
It's here.

114
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
It's here.

115
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
It's not here.

116
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
It's not here.

117
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
I'm making money.

118
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
No, no.

119
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
No, no.

120
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
It's not like that.

121
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
It's a little different here.

122
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
It's different.

123
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
I'm really old.

124
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
I'm really old.

125
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
I'm really old.

126
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
I'm really old.

127
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
It's like, you're rich!

128
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Africa will make big money.

129
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
They're making a lot of money in Africa.

130
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
You're good at manzai.

131
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
What?

132
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
You're good at manzai.

133
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
What?

134
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
You're good at manzai.

135
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
What?

136
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
You're good at manzai.

137
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Let's start with the first match.

138
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
The first match is this.

139
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
The winner is...

140
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,600
The one who can't give up on the internet.

141
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,600
The one who can't give up on the internet.

142
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
I've done this before.

143
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
It's 100 degrees.

144
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
It's hot.

145
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,600
I'll show you.

146
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
This is really hot.

147
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
It's really hot.

148
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,600
It's too hot.

149
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
It's fast.

150
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
You just put it in.

151
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
The steam is not coming out at all.

152
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Oh, it's a shrimp.

153
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
What are you saying?

154
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Yamamoto, what are you saying?

155
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
You're making a mistake.

156
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
The first one.

157
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
What the hell is this?

158
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Everyone has a fear of getting heatstroke, so I'll give you a poncho.

159
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Does it fly that much?

160
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,600
It's dangerous if you put it in a box.

161
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
It's dangerous if you put it in a box.

162
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
It's dangerous if you put it in a box.

163
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
It's dangerous if you put it in a box.

164
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,600
There are different kinds.

165
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
It's been denied.

166
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,600
But I can't wear this when I'm in Yamasaki.

167
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,600
One, two, three, four, five, six, five, six, it's 3,000 yen, Mr. Suga.

168
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
What?

169
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
3,000 yen.

170
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
But, it's Evo-chan.

171
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
But, I've already passed it through three times.

172
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Yes, it's already a wrinkle, right?

173
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Ah, if my neck is torn.

174
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
It's torn.

175
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
It's already torn.

176
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
It's already torn.

177
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
It's already torn.

178
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
It's still there, right?

179
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Excuse me.

180
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Excuse me.

181
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
It's no good.

182
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
No, is it?

183
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
No, it's already, look, it's already early.

184
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
It's still hot.

185
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
It's still hot.

186
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
The temperature of the hot water will drop.

187
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
I see.

188
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Excuse me.

189
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
It's too early.

190
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
It's too early to take money.

191
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Thank you for your patience.

192
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Now, let's start the game.

193
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
The hot water match.

194
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,600
It's hot!

195
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
It's hot.

196
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,600
It's hot.

197
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
It's hot.

198
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
It's hot.

199
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Drink water.

200
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Drink water.

201
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,600
It's not stuck.

202
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
It's a good thing.

203
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

204
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Ouch, ouch.

205
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
It hurts.

206
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
What is this?

207
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
The next match is this.

208
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Is it over?

209
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
It's OK.

210
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
If you don't get the water on your face, it's not good.

211
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Drink this.

212
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Poisoning blowfish match.

213
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
This is dangerous.

214
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
I quit.

215
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,600
I use real poison.

216
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,600
If you get poisoned, it will be a disaster.

217
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,600
If you drink this, you will be fine.

218
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
You will be fine?

219
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Yes.

220
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Please drink it.

221
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
The hot water didn't come at all.

222
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
That's good.

223
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Take and Sen.

224
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
But insurance is like that.

225
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Ah.

226
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
If there is an accident, insurance will be included.

227
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Well, well.

228
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
I don't like lemon.

229
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Lemon is a little...

230
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
It's my own water.

231
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Well, well.

232
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
It's a good thing to drink it.

233
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Excuse me, it's 6,000 yen.

234
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
It's 6,000 yen.

235
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Then, this is...

236
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
You should have said this before you drank.

237
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
If I had said this before I drank, it would have been something like,

238
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
something that's a waste.

239
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Something that would have been something that the Kansai people would have hated.

240
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
You should have said this before you drank.

241
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,600
I don't need vitamin C.

242
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,600
I don't need vitamin C.

243
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,600
I don't think vitamin C is that expensive.

244
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Now, let's begin.

245
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:40,400
Poisonous

246
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,400
It's always stuck.

247
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
It's so long.

248
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Eh?

249
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:56,400
It's a

250
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
If you wipe it once, it won't stick.

251
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
It's a continuous one.

252
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,400
It's a

253
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,400
What is this?

254
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
I don't know.

255
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
The board is broken.

256
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,400
You got stabbed, right?

257
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Sorry.

258
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
The next battle is this.

259
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Are you okay?

260
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Poison, poison.

261
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Poisonous snake battle.

262
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
The battle of the six soldiers, start!

263
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
That was dangerous.

264
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Is there a trap?

265
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,360
When we finish getting ready...

266
00:12:50,360 --> 00:13:10,700
the

267
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:10,680
the

268
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:09,440
the

269
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,480
the

270
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,040
the

271
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:09,940
the

272
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,040
the

273
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:18,040
I'm coming.

274
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:25,040
I'm coming.

275
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,040
From Hama-san.

276
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Itama-kachi.

277
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,040
And the next is this.

278
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,040
I don't know what this is.

279
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
K-1 match.

280
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
This is...

281
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
This is...

282
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
This is the real deal.

283
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
For this,

284
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
you're trying to...

285
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
You're trying to...

286
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
You're trying to...

287
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Then, K-1 match, start!

288
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,040
You're wearing a ring suit.

289
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
What's going on?

290
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Hey! What's wrong? Hey!

291
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
Sorry!

292
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
What's your name?

293
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
I'm dead.

294
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Why?

295
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Why?

296
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
Why?

297
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Wait a minute.

298
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
No, no.

299
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
What?

300
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
That's the problem, right?

301
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,040
The TV is so extreme that it's like this.

302
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
What's wrong with that?

303
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,040
I was made a gear for the entertainment world.

304
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
What?

305
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
I said I wasn't dead.

306
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,040
Anyway, this is the one I was preparing.

307
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
What did you prepare?

308
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
It's over until the end of the month.

309
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Wow, that's a lot of money.

310
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
280,000 yen.

311
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,040
1.0 million yen for the lion.

312
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
And another 1.5 million yen.

313
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,040
And another 1.3 million yen for the fox.

314
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
That's all the money we have.

315
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,040
Yatta-kun, you can go.

316
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
Yes.

317
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
We've also sent out the money.

318
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
Please do this for us.

319
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
You can marry her.

320
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
What is this?

321
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
It's a song, so it's a good idea to consider it.

322
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
Yes, it's a good idea to consider it.

323
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,040
But the wife is the one who should consider it.

324
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
You can consider it.

325
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
Yes.

326
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,040
Then, please do the rest.

327
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
Halloween.

328
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,040
Halloween.

329
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,040
Your mother is dead.

330
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,040
I'm sorry, but I'm waiting for a good reply.

331
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,040
A good reply?

332
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
Please.

333
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,040
What are you going to do, madam?

334
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
You're not dead, are you?

335
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
Why would I die?

336
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,040
I wouldn't die.

337
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
I'm not dead.

338
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
What is this?

339
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,040
I moved.

340
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
You moved.

341
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,040
I laughed.

342
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
Hey Yamada, you're not dead, right?

343
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
Good evening, Yamada

344
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,040
Good evening, Hamada's medicine box

345
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Weihai

346
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Weihai

347
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,040
Weihai

348
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,040
Weihai

349
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Weihai

350
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,040
I'm sorry!

351
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
I'm sorry!

352
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
I'm sorry!

353
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
What did you say?

354
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,040
I don't think you're a lively audience.

355
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
Well, it's not bad.

356
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,040
I don't like you guys at all.

357
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
But you shouldn't say that every day.

358
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
But that's right.

359
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:11,040
I'm sure you're lying that you'll be able to meet everyone again.

360
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Because you don't remember.

361
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,040
I don't want to hear such lies.

362
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
I'm sorry.

363
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Well, I know you're alive and well.

364
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,040
I'm not alive and well.

365
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
I'm alive and well.

366
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,040
I know you're in a good mood because you're alive and well.

367
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,040
But if you pretend to be alive, I'll beat you up.

368
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
This guy is an idiot.

369
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Right? I am...

370
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
You are an idiot!

371
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,040
You don't get carried away by a three-shot.

372
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,040
But when you came out, you had a smug face.

373
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Smug face.

374
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
No, it's normal.

375
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,040
Look at my three shots.

376
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
I feel like that.

377
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,040
Ah, but think about it.

378
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
Think about it.

379
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
It's been 20 years.

380
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
What?

381
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Combination.

382
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Ah, yes, yes.

383
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
Right?

384
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,040
It's been 20 years!

385
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,040
This book is in the 18th issue.

386
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
If you think about it,

387
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,040
the people of downtown Matsumoto have already passed the age of one year.

388
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Ah, that's right.

389
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Eh!?

390
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Why do you have such a strong impression?

391
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,040
Is there anyone in their 20s?

392
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,040
Anyone in their 20s, please raise your hand quickly.

393
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,040
The year these people were born, we were already in a combination.

394
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
20 years!

395
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
If you take 3 years, it's 17 years!

396
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
That's a lot!

397
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
It's a huge thing!

398
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
I know that!

399
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
What?

400
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Just by looking at your face today...

401
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,040
Ah, the look of a dork?

402
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
The look of a dork...

403
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Ah, today...

404
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,040
I want to brag about my hair...

405
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Well, I'll brag about it a little bit...

406
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:59,040
After a shocking encounter, I have a question for Matsumoto-san who has built up his image of a human being called Matsumoto Hitoshi.

407
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:05,040
What kind of appearance does a little devil, who you have only met twice in your life, have?

408
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,040
When did you meet him?

409
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
You surprised me.

410
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
You've said it twice.

411
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Even though I said a little devil, it's not that he looks small.

412
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
He's about the same as usual.

413
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Actually, the clothes are a bit small.

414
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,040
Why do you not understand that?

415
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,040
It's pretty tight.

416
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,040
The chucks also open quickly.

417
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
What is a chuck?

418
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,040
The chuck is usually up to here.

419
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
The sleeves?

420
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
The sleeves.

421
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,040
It goes up to here.

422
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
When I was talking, it came up quickly.

423
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
It's like a dumpling here.

424
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:49,040
I saw a guy who made a hole here and passed his fingers through.

425
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:55,360
He was like a

426
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,360
In the back, his back was visible.

427
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
What does he do?

428
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
He is a little devil.

429
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,360
Originally, he started from a little devil.

430
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
Before becoming a devil?

431
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,360
Yes, yes.

432
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,360
And then you want to become a demon as soon as possible.

433
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
So it's not a big deal to be strong.

434
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
That's right.

435
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
So you have to work hard from now on.

436
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
But I'm still in training.

437
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
So I'm wearing a bathrobe.

438
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,360
A bathrobe?

439
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
It's a bathrobe.

440
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,360
It says, Takeuchi.

441
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,360
You're wearing your own, right?

442
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,360
I can't get my own used.

443
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,360
When I become a person, I'll measure it and wear it.

444
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,360
It's like a uniform.

445
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

446
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
That's called a ax.

447
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,360
Where did you see it?

448
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
Behind the fridge.

449
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,360
You didn't get hurt, did you?

450
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,360
Behind the fridge?

451
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,360
There must be a reason why you were behind the fridge.

452
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,360
If you were a demon a year ago, you would have done something crazy.

453
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
When you find it?

454
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,360
When a car comes, a huge rock...

455
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
...and it goes BAM!

456
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
And the rock goes BAM!

457
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,360
And then he goes,

458
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,360
Laughing like this.

459
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,360
This is the devil in front of you.

460
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
You found him in the refrigerator, right?

461
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
Did he do something to you?

462
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
I know him.

463
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
He's a little devil.

464
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
I haven't got a license yet.

465
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
What did he do to you?

466
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
You see,

467
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
He goes,

468
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
I heard a sound like this.

469
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:39,360
I thought it was the sound of changing the refrigerator.

470
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,360
I thought it was the sound of changing the refrigerator.

471
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,360
It's noisy.

472
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,360
I looked at it and it was doing it.

473
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,360
I heard it with my mouth.

474
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,360
I heard it with my mouth.

475
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
I thought it was strange.

476
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
I said, come here! Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

477
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
What? You caught me?

478
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Yes, yes, yes.

479
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

480
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
I said, help me!

481
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,360
No, I'm not scared.

482
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
You said, boom, boom, boom.

483
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
I said, I can't sleep!

484
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,360
Yes.

485
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,360
I said, I can't sleep!

486
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
And then...

487
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
What's funny, you guys!

488
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,360
But I can't sleep. It's strange that I can't sleep.

489
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,360
I see.

490
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
Because I'm a demon.

491
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,360
Yes.

492
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,360
Where did you stop?

493
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,360
Around the temple.

494
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
You should have stopped there.

495
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,360
Right?

496
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,360
I was about to find it in the back of the refrigerator.

497
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,360
I thought it was a little dangerous.

498
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,360
You thought so?

499
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,360
I thought so.

500
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,360
Ah, I see.

501
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,360
Then, next week, stop me.

502
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Certainly, when I was around the refrigerator, I felt that it was becoming a little bit of a joke.

503
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
Ah, is that so?

504
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
Yes.

505
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
Why didn't you stop there?

506
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
You couldn't stop it.

507
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:24,360
I wanted to do the boom behind the fridge.

508
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:30,360
To be honest, I thought I could take it a little more.

509
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,360
But I didn't think I could.

510
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,360
The return was a little weak.

511
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,360
I thought it was weak.

512
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,360
I thought it was weak.

513
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,360
I thought I was going to get a pimple on my face.

514
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,360
I was thinking, I can't say it, I can't say it!

515
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,360
But then, something was wrong.

516
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,360
I was thinking, what should I say?

517
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,360
I can't think of anything!

518
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
I can't even open my eyes!

519
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,360
I'm thinking now!

520
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,360
I can't think of anything!

521
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
I'm thinking of something else!

522
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,360
Let me go!

523
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
Nothing!

524
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,360
