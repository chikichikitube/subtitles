1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Next time, we will be at the popular camp at the Gaginosu Skyline!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's nice here

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's nice here

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Is the camp popular?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It is

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What are you going to do?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm going to try camping

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Do you have any experience?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, here

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Liar!

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You again?

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
India is popular

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Call Hiroshi

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No, no, no, no.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There are members, too.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll pull them.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
When we play games, we have a meeting.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We act like we know the difference.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I can't trust you.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're waiting for us, aren't you?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm waiting for the new director.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Who are you?

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
When you think of camping, tent

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's all work together

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
First, let's build the tent

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I've never done this before

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But it's okay

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There's a piece of paper inside

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You just have to put it on

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's already shaped

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's fast

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You put this on

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You put it on?

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Ready, set, go

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's like this

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You pull the orange one with this and put it here and fix it.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is also fixed.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's easy.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Enos-san, there.

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Do you need this?

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But it's very dark. Do you need it?

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No, no, no. I need it.

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You can't fix it.

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But I need it. Pull it and make it double.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Is this okay?

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't come too much.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Is this okay?

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's only a bell.

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll take it.

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Amagawa-san, yes.

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Sorry for the sudden visit.

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Are you recording?

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh, you're here.

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes, I'm recording a camp.

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm around here.

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Oh, really?

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes.

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm in Tokyo only when I'm working.

60
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The world is difficult now, so I'm here.

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I usually come here.

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, I see.

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I happened to be at a campsite.

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Really?

65
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes.

66
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What is it?

67
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What is it?

68
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't know.

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Full tension, 5 people.

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What?

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What's wrong?

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What are you doing?

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's Gyagawa-ken.

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Gagaken

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Gagaken?

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't you know?

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Gagaken?

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Hollywood celebrities like Paris Hilton and Madonna are in it

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Gagaken

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Son Goku who makes a mistake in the balance

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You guys, take this!

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Ka...me...ha!

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Oh no, I got the wrong balance.

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
A small one came out.

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
A small one came out.

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
A small one came out!

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's a good thing.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
A small one came out!

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Sorry, I'm still not finished with the tent.

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This is a bit...

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hamada-san, then this one.

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Ah, this one...

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Wait, wait, wait.

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yamashita-kun, you're in danger.

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
A primary school student's song of change.

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Pee and poo, one letter difference

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The butt and the glasses are three different characters

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's right.

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Why are you laughing?

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Sing, sing.

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Maybe the sound of the can-can.

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Ah, look.

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Here, here.

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Chaka-chan, Gin-chan, Gin-chan, Gin-den-den.

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Every time, I tell a stupid story.

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,880
I heard that a

108
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,880
Shut up!

109
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
I'm going to finish this!

110
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
I got it, I got it

111
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
He's stepping on it

112
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
He's stepping on it himself

113
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Hey, change it to this one

114
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
It's okay, it's not a camera

115
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,880
3 seconds before the he, he, he

116
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,880
3, 2, 1

117
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Mistake!

118
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,880
Ah ah ah ah ah!

119
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,880
What's wrong with him?

120
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,880
He's crying!

121
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,880
He's crying!

122
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,880
The baby is crying!

123
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,880
I have to help him!

124
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,880
He's crying!

125
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,880
He's crying!

126
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,880
No, no...

127
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,880
He's laughing

128
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,880
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have recorded this

129
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,880
I'm sorry

130
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,880
I'm sorry

131
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,880
Let's go!

132
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,880
It's my first time.

133
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,880
I won! I won!

134
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,880
I got it!

135
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
Yagawa-ken...

136
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,880
It's my first time.

137
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,880
I don't know what to do.

138
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,880
I don't know what to do.

139
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,880
What should I do if I can do this?

140
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,880
I think you should light a fire.

141
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
Really?

142
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,880
I'll do it.

143
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,880
Cool.

144
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,080
When you come in, you can see the camp site, right?

145
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,020
That's right.

146
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,520
Camp site is good.

147
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,520
I've never seen anything like that before.

148
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,520
It's easy.

149
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
It's easy.

150
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,920
I changed my image a bit.

151
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
I wonder if it's a circle.

152
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
Is there a fire?

153
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,120
But it's nice.

154
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
OK.

155
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
It's on fire.

156
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Oh, wow.

157
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Wow.

158
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Is it this easy?

159
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,920
It's easy to make a fire like this.

160
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
That's right.

161
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
If you sit down,

162
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
Sit down.

163
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
It depends on the type.

164
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,920
I want to make a fire by myself.

165
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,920
I want to make a bigger fire.

166
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
I think it's just right.

167
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,920
I will talk with my ears.

168
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
The fire is a little scary.

169
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,180
I'm gonna kill you!

170
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,420
Fine.

171
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,520
Alright all right.

172
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,580
Wait, wait, wait, wait, it's coming I'll get the Hell Fang!

173
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,560
Fine.

174
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,020
One, One, One, One, One!

175
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,260
It's coming I'll get the Hell Fang!

176
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:07,900
Alright.

177
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,000
It's coming.

178
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,620
You're right.

179
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,040
Alright, stop it, stop.

180
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,860
That's dangerous!

181
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,400
Why do you go over there is so scary.

182
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,360
What a foolish applauding of form in the back.

183
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,720
This is the snow here, not the ninja?

184
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,160
Well, it doesn't matter what, it's dangerous here.

185
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,160
So, I told them not to go.

186
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
I got it.

187
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Sorry.

188
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,160
I think the fire is a little strong.

189
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,160
We are filming.

190
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
I know that.

191
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
This is a pass.

192
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,160
It's a usual walking course.

193
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,160
If you don't take them for a walk once a day, they get stressed.

194
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
It's different.

195
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,160
Yes, it's different.

196
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,160
It's a little scary, but it's a pain.

197
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Change the mood!

198
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Push! Push! Push!

199
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,160
The wave of the picture of the North Sea.

200
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
It's scary.

201
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
It's going to fall.

202
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
It's coming.

203
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
I got it.

204
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,160
Let's get excited! Let's get excited! Let's get excited!

205
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
Takata, Takata, hey!

206
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
Be quiet! Hey, hey, hey!

207
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Hey, hey, hey!

208
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Take it! Take it!

209
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Hello, world!

210
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,160
He's so energetic.

211
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Gagawa Ken.

212
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,160
Yes, he is still young.

213
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
I got it, I got it.

214
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
It's OK, it's OK.

215
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
I'm sorry.

216
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,160
The siren sound is very responsive.

217
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Hey, come here. I'll return it to you.

218
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,160
Sorry to bother you.

219
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
The first shot is delicious.

220
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,160
I understand.

221
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Young people are very energetic.

222
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
I want to do it when I'm beaten.

223
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
I'm a young man.

224
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
What are you trying to do?

225
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,160
It's hard to take care of a person.

226
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,160
Would you like to eat something?

227
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,160
I want to eat it

228
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Do you have ingredients?

229
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Yes, we have

230
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Really?

231
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
This is a great food for camping

232
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
Wow, it's great

233
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
It's a barbecue

234
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Ta-da

235
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,160
Wow

236
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Really?

237
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Next, they enjoy camping with a barbecue

238
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
Is this seasoned butter burning?

239
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
Yes

240
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
Salt and pepper

241
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
There's some

242
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
There's some

243
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Before eating

244
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
Yes, the seasoning

245
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:43,180
No no no no no!

246
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,880
one, two

247
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,880
1, 2, all of you, slurp!

248
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
I don't know...

249
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,880
Um, I'm currently...

250
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,880
I'm wearing panties, right?

251
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,880
The cloth is not very good.

252
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,880
The cloth is not very good.

253
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,880
The needle is not very good.

254
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Can I check if you are wearing panties?

255
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
No, no, no.

256
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Thank you very much.

257
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,880
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

258
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,880
I'm cold! Panty dance! I'm cold! Panty dance! Panty! Panty! Panty!

259
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
I'm all wet!

260
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,880
The first time meeting, rice paper butterfly!

261
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,880
I'm the type to sweat my pants.

262
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,880
I'm Baichon!

263
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,880
Let's start the show!

264
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,880
Yes, Tamayo's Baichon!

265
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Yes, Manze!

266
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Chuchuru Chuchuru Manze!

267
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Chuchuru Chuchuru Manze!

268
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Manze is...

269
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Yabai! Yabai! Yabai!

270
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
Yabai! Yabai! Yabai!

271
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Yabai! Yabai! Yabai!

272
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
Once you sing it, it's long.

273
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
It's long, right?

274
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,060
What are you talking about.

275
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,480
I got it.

276
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,900
sleepy everything

277
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,300
ones here

278
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,060
The next relationship.

279
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,420
We need to get along.

280
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,160
It needs to be unusual.

281
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,140
Where are you going?

282
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,200
I understand.

283
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,360
Hey.

284
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,500
They are behaving himself.

285
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,660
Everyone.

286
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,240
There are families, right?

287
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,620
If you have children,

288
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,620
Don't forget this!

289
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,620
Tamayo's place is a school zone!

290
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,620
Tamayo's place is a school zone!

291
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,620
What's that?

292
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,620
The suspicious person can't enter!

293
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,620
The mess is long!

294
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,620
It's dangerous to go near the fire!

295
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,620
My legs are burning!

296
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,620
I'm sorry!

297
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,620
Tamayo's butt is a fire!

298
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,620
Yes, yes, yes!

299
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,620
Someone!

300
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,620
I can't use the gun.

301
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,620
You're wrong!

302
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,620
I got it.

303
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,620
Calm down.

304
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,620
Sorry.

305
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,620
Sorry for the inconvenience.

306
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,620
I can't move.

307
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,620
Hey, Tamao.

308
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,620
Minus 4.

309
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,620
It's okay.

310
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,620
You're doing this on purpose

311
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,620
I'm sorry

312
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,620
Chin

313
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,620
Chapchae

314
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,620
Chapchae

315
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,620
Let's go

316
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,620
Chin

317
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,620
Chin-jao-ro-su

318
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,620
Yes, stir-fry the peppers and the chins and then stir-fry them

319
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,620
Stir-fry the peppers and the chins and then stir-fry them

320
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,620
This is a terrible prayer.

321
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,620
This is a bad joke.

322
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,620
That's what it meant?

323
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,620
It's best to pour water.

324
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,620
I can't stop. I'm sorry.

325
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,620
Let's go.

326
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,620
I'm sorry.

327
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,620
That's what I'm talking about.

328
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,620
It's amazing.

329
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,620
That's right.

330
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,620
You're buying a lot.

331
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,620
That's right.

332
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,620
Do you need water?

333
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,620
Certainly, it is for digestion.

334
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,620
It would be helpful if there was a little behind.

335
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,620
I'll get some water.

336
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,620
Do you need it?

337
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,620
Certainly, it would be helpful if there was a little behind.

338
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,620
It's okay, it's okay.

339
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,620
I'm going to go.

340
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,620
Everyone, please divide your roles.

341
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,620
I'm going.

342
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,620
I'm doing it here.

343
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,620
Is there anything else to do?

344
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,620
Yes, there is a little bit of this.

345
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,620
Well, that's the beauty of camping.

346
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,620
You have to take care of it.

347
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,620
Yes.

348
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,620
All of these are from the same place.

349
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,620
It's a log.

350
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,620
It's amazing.

351
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,620
He is very worried about the water

352
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,620
What is the situation?

353
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,620
Endo, who went to collect water, does not come back

354
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,620
He is very worried about the water

355
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,620
The water is right there, right?

356
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,620
Yes

357
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,620
He should have come back

358
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,620
Yes

359
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,620
Is it there?

360
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,620
Yes

361
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,620
Because it is there

362
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,620
Where did he go from?

363
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,620
He went to the river

364
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,620
He does not drink the water of the river

365
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,620
He should be able to go immediately

366
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,620
I can smell something.

367
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,620
Huh?

368
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,620
You don't say anything.

369
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,620
The chimney?

370
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
What's wrong with the chimney?

371
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,620
The chimney is saying it's going to collect water.

372
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,620
It used to say that it was a big accident.

373
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,620
Oh, that's just right.

374
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,620
The Giga dog I'm taking right now also has a rescue dog.

375
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,620
Let's find it.

376
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,620
Can you find it?

377
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,620
There's something that smells like chimney.

378
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,620
Hey, hey, hey!

379
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,620
Hey, where are you going?

380
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,620
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

381
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,620
Hey, hey, hey.

382
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,620
He's quiet.

383
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,620
He's quiet.

384
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,620
I see. I smell something.

385
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,620
I'm grateful that you're looking for him, but...

386
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,620
I'm filming here.

387
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,620
That's right.

388
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,620
Miki-tei!

389
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,620
No, that's not it.

390
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,620
That's not it.

391
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,620
He's not the one looking for him.

392
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,620
It's a different place.

393
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,620
It's amazing.

394
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:13,720
No, it's a

395
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,720
It's dangerous.

396
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
I'm worried.

397
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
Mickey is different.

398
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,720
That's right.

399
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,720
It's different.

400
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,720
I went to the other side.

401
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,720
You smell it, you're outside the neighborhood.

402
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
You're just shouting.

403
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
Is it okay?

404
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
Don't smell it.

405
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
It's not that place.

406
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,720
It's far away.

407
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
It's close.

408
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,720
It's close.

409
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
It's close.

410
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Maybe it's drowning.

411
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
You're smart.

412
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
He's smart.

413
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,720
I think he's different from the one he was before.

414
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
He's very persistent.

415
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Miki-san!

416
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
He won't be able to speak tomorrow.

417
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
He's already flying.

418
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
He's already flying.

419
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,720
That's probably true.

420
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
Miki-san! Miki-san! Miki-san!

421
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
What's with that way of saying it?

422
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
Bring him here! Bring him here!

423
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,720
What? Really?

424
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
Did you get it?

425
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,720
Miki-san!

426
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
I got it! I got it!

427
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
I found it!

428
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
You found it?

429
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
I found it!

430
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
What if I go?

431
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
What? What?

432
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
I got it! I got it!

433
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
I got it!

434
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
It's dangerous if we all go there!

435
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
That's right!

436
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Oh, it's true!

437
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Endo, are you okay?

438
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
I got it! I got it!

439
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
Ouch!

440
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
Did you get hurt?

441
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
I think my leg got hurt

442
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Thank you

443
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
That was a relief

444
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
You are very smart

445
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
I'm glad I didn't get hurt

446
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
Excuse me

447
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
That's the whiskey

448
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,720
The river is dangerous, so be careful

449
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Thank you

450
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Thank you

451
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
It's quiet when the mission is over

452
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
It's not coming out.

453
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
It's not coming out.

454
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
It's empty.

455
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
It's going to take a little longer.

456
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Move your body before you eat.

457
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
Let your stomach empty.

458
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Would you like to eat?

459
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
I'm going to eat badminton.

460
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
I've been preparing for badminton.

461
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,720
Would you like to play badminton?

462
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
I'm not good at sports.

463
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
If you think about it, something will happen.

464
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
How do I do it?

465
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Are you going to play it when it's over?

466
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
What should I do?

467
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
I'll do this and you do this.

468
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
I see.

469
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
How many times do you do it?

470
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
It's not easy.

471
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
Yes, yes.

472
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Who's next?

473
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Who's next?

474
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
I'll do it again.

475
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,720
One, two, three.

476
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
I did it!

477
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
It's quite difficult.

478
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Six, seven.

479
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:23,720
10, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15.

480
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Hey!

481
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Hey, what?

482
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
He is taking them.

483
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,720
There is one.

484
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,720
Wow!

485
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
Hey? Can we go?

486
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
I've never seen it.

487
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
Oh, really?

488
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
I've never seen a sword fight.

489
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,720
I'm a professional.

490
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,720
You mean you bought that much?

491
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,720
That's right.

492
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
It's a bargain.

493
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,720
There was.

494
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
There was. I'm doing a location.

495
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,720
I'm doing a location.

496
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,720
I know.

497
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,720
But this is a place where anyone can do anything.

498
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
I don't think it matters.

499
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
But I can hear your voice.

500
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,720
There is a gathering of Gaggers once a month.

501
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,720
They come from far away.

502
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,720
So we thought we should play here today.

503
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Oh, Mr.Kanishi.

504
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Oh, I see.

505
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
It means that it's great.

506
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Double slap on the earlobes.

507
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Double slap on the earlobes.

508
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,720
You only do Gaggers around the face.

509
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
He's wearing it.

510
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
Ears!

511
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
Ears! Double stop!

512
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
What does that mean?

513
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Ears double stop.

514
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Straighten your lip.

515
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
It's because he's biting.

516
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,720
Oh, that's a bit of a resistance.

517
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,720
There's something about it.

518
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
Oh, that's a bit of a resistance.

519
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,720
It's a bit scary.

520
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
His character is rough.

521
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,720
Only this guy wears it.

522
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Hey!

523
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
You're really getting on my nerves!

524
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,720
Hey!

525
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Listen to me!

526
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
You're used to the board, aren't you?

527
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
You're really getting on my nerves!

528
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Your earlobes!

529
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,720
Your earlobes!

530
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Stop turning your face!

531
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,720
We don't know the rules, nor the rules of the game.

532
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,720
You're turning your earlobes to someone else!

533
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,720
It's a Jyagawa prefecture...

534
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,720
If you take it off, it won't come off.

535
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
It will come off.

536
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,720
That's amazing.

537
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,720
Please take it off.

538
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,720
What should we do?

539
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,720
It won't be a good location.

540
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,720
That's right.

541
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,720
Let's go.

542
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
Let's go to the top of the mountain.

543
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
I can't do it.

544
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,720
In the case of Itago, that's the only way.

545
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
I'll give it to Matsumoto-san.

546
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Matsumoto-san, it's hard to talk to him like this.

547
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
It won't be a good location.

548
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Oh, no, Oba-chan.

549
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Shido, come here.

550
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,720
I want to continue the location.

551
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Oh, that's fine.

552
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,720
That's not what I meant.

553
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
No, it isn't.

554
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,720
That's what I meant.

555
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt.

556
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Stop it!

557
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Hey, hey, hey!

558
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,720
I got it!

559
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
I got it!

560
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
Gagacon...

561
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
It's definitely a Kamehameha.

562
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,720
What about a comedy comedy?

563
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
I definitely did it.

564
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
