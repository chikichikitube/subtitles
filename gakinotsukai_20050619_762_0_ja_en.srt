1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hmm...

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's cramped.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's cramped, right?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You're sitting down.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But, Mr. Kokiuchi's lyrics are...

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Mr. Kokiuchi's lyrics are impossible.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's fine, though.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's cramped.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Good morning!

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Good morning!

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Oh, you're here!

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Long time no see.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Good morning!

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I was doing a recording in the neighborhood, so I came to say hello.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All of them?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I was busy earlier

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You won the R1

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The flower of light

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The R1 Grand Prix that will decide the best in Japan for the ping-pong player

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Out of the 1239 people that entered this year, the old man won

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Look at that, he's got something on his nose

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I've seen it

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've seen it

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I want to see it

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You can't do that now, can you?

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You can't do that now, can you?

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No, I can.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Really?

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No, it's a sign.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Sign?

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's not how you use it.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's in there.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's in there.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's a lot.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's always there.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's a sign.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's always there.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Do you want to see it?

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm going to do this.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He's an interesting guy.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll do it for you.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I see.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I like it.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You can clean it.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You can clean it?

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's like a paper.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's a mental thing.

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can't see it.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Wow.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Wow.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Wow.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Wow.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's amazing!

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's the same as before!

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's amazing!

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You can do it like this.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Wow, this is amazing!

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is a wonderful technique!

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This is the Noodle Rope.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Noodle Rope!

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Wow, amazing!

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Wow, amazing!

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's moving!

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can't get it.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Is it the basic Udon?

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The basic is Udon.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But can you get the general ones?

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I think I can get the general ones.

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But I can't get the ones sold in the supermarket.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I think I can.

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I want to see it.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I want to see it.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Can I go to the supermarket?

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Can you buy it for me?

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I want to try many things.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I have time.

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You have time?

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I've been told to go around this area.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You can go around as much as you want.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You have no time at all.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Really?

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's okay.

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's right.

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's go.

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's hurry.

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes.

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Super.

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Super is here.

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's right.

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsors of the following episodes.

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Ah, but this is not bad.

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's good.

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's not bad.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I want you to try the sashimi.

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This is not bad.

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's not bad.

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is a bit of a surprise.

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Kimchi.

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This is a surprise.

102
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This is a big surprise.

103
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We can't think of something like this is impossible.

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's try it.

105
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's try it.

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There's this much. You can put this much in.

107
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh, you can do it?

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This is a nice toy.

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I can do this.

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The staff members are doing it well.

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is easy.

112
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh, you can do this?

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Really?

114
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, I can do it.

115
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You can do it.

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's not a fake.

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I can do it.

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The result is...

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yay!

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Thank you for waiting!

121
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It was pretty tough.

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We won a lot.

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We didn't even have to change the color.

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Should we just take it out?

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, yeah.

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't really care about the packaging.

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Ah, this should be fine.

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is also a safe bet.

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Safe bet.

130
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You can take the root.

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,500
Eh?

132
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,000
It's bitter.

133
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's bitter?

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's bitter!

135
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's bitter!

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Ah, I see.

137
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Leave it to the old man.

138
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's so annoying.

139
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Can I use the Kiyomend?

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Ah, Kiyomend.

141
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Eh?

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll do it.

143
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I want to do it.

144
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I want to do it even more.

145
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I want to do it.

146
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
How can I do it?

147
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I want to cut it.

148
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But it's a knife.

149
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Ah, I can't cut it straight away.

150
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I see.

151
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How was it?

152
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's so good!

153
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
How was it?

154
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's so good!

155
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It was so good!

156
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's do it from here.

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Even though it's not like you can't eat it.

158
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm so hungry.

159
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It was so good.

160
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You can eat it smoothly.

161
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I can do it easily.

162
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What is this?

163
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This is too thin.

164
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's too thin.

165
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's too thin.

166
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
This is impossible.

167
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This?

168
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,560
There are many kinds of

169
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,000
things.

170
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Ah, here?

171
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Ah, that's good.

172
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's not a slug.

173
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's a raccoon.

174
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I want to do it too.

175
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You have to do it with the energy.

176
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, you're going to use a ball?

177
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If it's too thin, it will be...

178
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It will be a shabby ball.

179
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Water?

180
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Why are you doing that?

181
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's like a spear.

182
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, it's going.

183
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Oh.

184
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh!

185
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You look a little scared.

186
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes, yes.

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What's wrong?

188
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What's wrong?

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What's wrong?

190
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Where did you go?

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There's a letter of return on your face.

192
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's you!

193
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What's a return?

194
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's this.

195
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This?

196
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Oh, this is it.

197
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is a return.

198
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Is this a return?

199
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's a return.

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Really.

201
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If it's the other way around...

202
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, it's the other way around.

203
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes.

204
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll try to turn it over.

205
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh, this is good.

206
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Ah!

207
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's the scary face.

208
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's scary.

209
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Wow, wow, wow.

210
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh, it's good.

211
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's not reaching.

212
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The length is...

213
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This is bad.

214
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's just right.

215
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Get out, get out.

216
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Ah, this...

217
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's right!

218
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That's right!

219
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You're too close!

220
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I can't do this!

221
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You can do this!

222
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You can do this!

223
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Ah, Zenmai!

224
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's not right.

225
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You have to look at it from the nose.

226
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Ah, that's right!

227
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Ah, this is also bamboo.

228
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Bamboo is also...

229
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Ah, it's coming!

230
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's coming!

231
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I can see it from here.

232
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can see it from here.

233
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I can see it.

234
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's in my throat.

235
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Did you fall down?

236
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't bite me!

237
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It hurts!

238
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It hurts so much!

239
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Every time...

240
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't fail in many ways!

241
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Don't fail in many ways!

242
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm eating it!

243
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't want to eat it!

244
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't want to eat it!

245
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That was great!

246
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It was really good.

247
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's good.

248
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This is the technique.

249
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The angle is really...

250
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's a great technique.

251
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He's moving in such detail.

252
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He's actually working.

253
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What are you doing?

254
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This is bad.

255
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Are you going to eat this?

256
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Are you going to eat this?

257
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's so good!

258
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Amazing!

259
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm going to eat it all!

260
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's so easy!

261
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This is a squid!

262
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It looks like a squid!

263
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll succeed!

264
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll eat it all!

265
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
This is good!

266
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This is good!

267
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This is good!

268
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Please!

269
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh!

270
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The finish is...

271
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's been 90 years!

272
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You can do it for 90 years!

273
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's too smooth!

274
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's not going to stop!

275
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The finish is all smooth!

276
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Smooth!

277
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Slowly!

278
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You're doing it too fast!

279
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It won't stop!

280
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's too smooth!

281
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It won't stop!

282
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This is good!

283
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's a BGM!

284
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This is the success pattern

285
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
In Japan, we call it the Dabaku Daisetsu

286
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What's this?

287
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's a toy that you put on your head

288
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This is completely...

289
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's easy to do

290
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
If you cut here, you cut here

291
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's very fast

292
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Isn't this easy too?

293
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This is udon, right?

294
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes, it is.

295
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Wow, it smells so strong.

296
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's coming out.

297
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's coming out.

298
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's coming out.

299
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's coming out.

300
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Is it a bitan?

301
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Eh? You're lying, right?

302
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Amazing!

303
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Amazing!

304
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Amazing!

305
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This is too easy.

306
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Did you sell it at the supermarket?

307
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I sold it at the supermarket.

308
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I think it's possible.

309
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Really?

310
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's possible.

311
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's not too thin.

312
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I didn't know that.

313
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You connect the one that came out.

314
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I see.

315
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If I'm not good at this, I'll be free-passed for the rest of my life.

316
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Free-passed anywhere.

317
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
This is dangerous.

318
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Oh, I see.

319
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This is easy.

320
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Easy?

321
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
How can I say this?

322
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is great!

323
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This is really...

324
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This is a free pass!

325
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is a free pass!

326
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This is great!

327
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
This is great!

328
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Ladies and gentlemen

329
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Good evening!

330
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll do it.

331
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
There are many people.

332
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes.

333
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
There are many.

334
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But, you know, you lost 2 games of soccer, but you're still in good shape, right?

335
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I didn't lose.

336
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh, really?

337
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm still playing.

338
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
If you say so, it's a little funny.

339
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Are you a little worried?

340
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm not worried. I'm not interested.

341
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I wonder.

342
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm not interested at all.

343
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm not interested either.

344
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But aren't you worried?

345
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What do you mean?

346
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's like, I'm going to talk to Matsumoto Eide soon.

347
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's what I think.

348
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Why do people get so enthusiastic?

349
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's only at times like that.

350
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I don't usually say that.

351
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You don't see it, do you?

352
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's funny because there are no people.

353
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's like high school soccer.

354
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
In the daytime,

355
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's a little creepy.

356
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's creepy.

357
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If I say too much, it's like, no, I can't.

358
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Why? Don't you want to say it?

359
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You want me to say it?

360
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Which one?

361
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't understand Japanese

362
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, I'm sure you all don't know

363
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I was looking at the dressing room

364
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
There were three balls this time

365
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Why did you put three balls?

366
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I was just looking at the dressing room

367
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I heard that you always say,

368
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Aue Aue, when it comes to soccer.

369
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Aue Aue.

370
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You always say that.

371
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Aue!

372
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Why?

373
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You don't say that in other sports.

374
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Why do you always say that in soccer?

375
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Like, the iron country.

376
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Why?

377
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The iron country?

378
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's not like that.

379
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Whether it's baseball or volleyball,

380
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
you do it in other countries.

381
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You don't say that often.

382
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You say that a lot in soccer.

383
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yes, yes.

384
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Why is your mental state so weak?

385
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You want to go home immediately.

386
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't know that.

387
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Everyone says that.

388
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Everyone is like a worm.

389
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I still don't know the answer.

390
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Why is that?

391
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's just a way of saying it.

392
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,300
I say it so often. The soccer players say it a lot.

393
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,000
No, no, no.

394
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Only me?

395
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm the...

396
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Aoi?

397
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't want to say that.

398
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,000
I heard about how you change your mood.

399
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What do you mean?

400
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,500
I thought I'd tell you.

401
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,500
I change my mood?

402
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,000
Well, it's a bit expensive.

403
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,500
Yes, yes.

404
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,000
You know, there's that thing, right?

405
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,500
You do it with people who think, right?

406
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes, yes.

407
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
There is an object there.

408
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,300
The one between me and you.

409
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,700
Ah, there is, there is.

410
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
That object is...

411
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,100
How much does it cost?

412
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,100
That object.

413
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,300
Mine is...

414
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,100
585,000 yen.

415
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,000
Yes, yes, yes.

416
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,100
It's quite expensive, though it's a styrofoam.

417
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,000
That's right.

418
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,500
And Hamada's is 485,000 yen.

419
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,500
When I asked where this difference of 100,000 yen came from,

420
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,200
it was a bit hard to say.

421
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
No, no, it's because he's famous.

422
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,200
If he's famous, Hamada-san's face will be more prominent.

423
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Ah, so it's a work of making it.

424
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
It's okay if you don't dig so deep.

425
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
It will take 10 years.

426
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Ah, that's interesting.

427
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
It will take a lot of time.

428
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
It's like that.

429
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
It's like a good thing.

430
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
I see.

431
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
I don't have any feelings for you.

432
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
That's why.

433
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Ah, I see. That's why it changed.

434
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
I see.

435
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,200
I thought I'd tell you that.

436
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Thank you very much.

437
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Now!

438
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Shall we announce the correct answer?

439
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
What?

440
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
The correct answer...

441
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,200
This is a question for Matsumoto, the hero of the entertainment world.

442
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,200
I heard that you have seen the Ultraman from the rebellious period.

443
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,200
What kind of behavior did you do?

444
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
It was really amazing.

445
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
What?

446
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,200
First, I broke the door.

447
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
What?

448
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
I didn't go home for three minutes.

449
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Oh, I see.

450
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
It was like it had nothing to do with me.

451
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
I said,

452
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Alright!

453
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Scary!

454
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Alright!

455
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
It was scary.

456
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
It was scary.

457
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,200
That's not what you want from me, is it?

458
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
No, no, it's not that...

459
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,200
I was wondering what kind of way you were acting in the rebellious period.

460
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Ah, I was acting really bad.

461
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
For example, how?

462
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Eh?

463
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
What kind of way?

464
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
What kind of way do you mean?

465
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
No, no, that's not it.

466
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
You've seen the rebellious period drama, haven't you?

467
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Of course.

468
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
You haven't? Which one?

469
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
I haven't.

470
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
You didn't say that before!

471
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
I'm asking because I have it!

472
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
You haven't, have you?

473
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
I haven't, I haven't.

474
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
I'm just imagining it.

475
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Apologize.

476
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
I should apologize?

477
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Sorry.

478
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Matsumoto-san, when you went to play with your brother in the forest, you found a candy store. Is that true?

479
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Don't lie, Matsumoto.

480
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Hurry up and show me the soccer.

481
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
I have that kind of feeling.

482
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
This is true.

483
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
But!

484
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:41,200
If you imagine a house of sweets that often appears in movies or movies, that's a big mistake.

485
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,200
In reality, it's not that gorgeous.

486
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,200
It's a little lower budget.

487
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
It costs that much?

488
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Yes.

489
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
How is it?

490
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Basically, it's all covered with miso.

491
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
It's all over the place.

492
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
When it's over, it's like a house of sweets.

493
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
It's like a house of miso.

494
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
It's like the miso of the Miso Dengaku.

495
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
It's like,

496
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
What is this, Nii-chan?

497
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
This is a bit too much!

498
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
This is not the way it should be!

499
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,200
It's like Japanese style.

500
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
The window is also...

501
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
What is it made of?

502
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
It's like a niko-gori.

503
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
It's soft and fluffy.

504
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
It's quite thick.

505
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
There are many small shrimps in it.

506
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Oh, big brother!

507
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
What are you looking at?

508
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
I can't see anything because it's so thick.

509
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Most of the shrimps are moving.

510
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
It's not shrimp, big brother.

511
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
It's sweet.

512
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Well, it's sweet.

513
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,200
The door knob is like a poop of a turban shell.

514
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Oh, I see.

515
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
It's deep green and it's like a burr.

516
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Oh, it's disgusting, big brother.

517
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
It's sweet.

518
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
It's not sweet.

519
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
It's not sweet.

520
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Well, well, well, we stayed for one night.

521
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
You can't stay?

522
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Well, it's my house, so I can't stay.

523
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Really? So you had a bed?

524
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
I had a bed.

525
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
What did you make of the bed?

526
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
What?

527
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
What did you make of the bed?

528
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
That was made of wood.

529
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
What?

530
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
You can't eat all the curtains!

531
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
It's a pain in the ass.

532
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,200
The curtain was Yuba.

533
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
I can understand that.

534
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
I told him not to say that.

535
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
Who said that?

536
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Who said that?

537
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
You.

538
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
You said that?

539
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Because it's my house.

540
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
So there are people living there.

541
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Who?

542
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
People with a lot of guts.

543
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
They always stay there.

544
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Nii-chan, you're so sweet.

545
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
That sweetness is different!

546
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,200
If Hamada-san died first, what would you put in the coffin?

547
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,200
What would you put in the coffin?

548
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,200
I would put in things I like.

549
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,200
I want to do many things for you.

550
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
You like yakisoba, right?

551
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
I like yakisoba. Don't say that.

552
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,200
I'm not a person who likes it.

553
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
I'm dirty.

554
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
You're dirty.

555
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Why do you care about it?

556
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
And then you put the fried noodles in.

557
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
And then you put ginger in here.

558
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
You put in the ginger.

559
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
That's good.

560
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
It's normal.

561
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,200
And then you put in a lot of erotic DVDs.

562
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,200
There's no place for you to put them in.

563
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
There's a lot of them!

564
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,200
If you move them, there's still more down there.

565
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Don't blow it!

566
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Half of the ball is out!

567
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Do it after I put it in!

568
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
What are you doing?

569
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
I put it in earlier so I can't catch it.

570
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
You can't do that with one or two.

571
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,200
But I don't know which is my favorite.

572
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
That's fine.

573
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Well, that's that.

574
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
I think about that.

575
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
And that hamburger.

576
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Yes.

577
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,700
Yes, yes.

578
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,700
If there's a fried egg on a hamburger steak, it'll be a great show.

579
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
If there's a fried egg on a hamburger steak...

580
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
You can't get excited!

581
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
You can't get excited!

582
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
You're saying too much.

583
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
I'll put it on the steak.

584
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
What?

585
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
I'll put the fried egg on the steak.

586
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
On the triangle piece.

587
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,200
I'll make a triangle with white meat.

588
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
And the middle one is yellow, boom!

589
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
I'll do that for you.

590
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
And when you close the last one,

591
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
If it's stuck,

592
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
You'll be like, ahhh!

593
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Don't get it dirty!

594
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
At the very end!

595
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
I think that's good.

596
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Everyone will cry and say,

597
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Please watch it.

598
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
You can't see it from here!

599
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
It's covered in yolk!

600
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,200
When you bake it, the yolk will look good!

601
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
We'll do it again this year!

602
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,200
In the last sushi battle, these three people were punished.

603
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
And this time...

604
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
The battle with the Bilibili outlet!

605
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,200
From the 100 outlets, the one who was affected by the power of fear is...

606
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
Hanashite!

607
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,200
DVD, 3 consecutive releases!

608
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,800
That hot spring that you must not laugh at, and the trip of a night trip,

609
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,400
The movie, Yuugawara, will be released on DVD soon!

610
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,200
The second half of the movie will be completely recorded!

611
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,700
The fifth volume will be released on June 29th!

612
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,200
