1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Suddenly, a visitor appears at Ichido's place, relaxed and ready for the show.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Damn it.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Damn it.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Good morning.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Good morning.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We're here to get a gala.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What is it?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
24 hours.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
24 hours?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes, the punishment game.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The one before?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What did you do?

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I've been doing it all along.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What?

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What?

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm here.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What?

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You were doing the Thai kick?

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes, I was.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Itao has appeared again.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This time, he's doing the Thai kick himself,

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
after the 24 hour punishment game.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,700
Is it really Itao who made everyone fall into a

25
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,700
And his real purpose is...

26
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,700
That's a lie, it's not like that

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,700
The costume is different

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,700
The material is different

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,700
It's shiny

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,700
The tension is different from the actual performance

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,700
The way it looks is different

32
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,700
It's not that safe

33
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,700
I'll show you the kick.

34
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,700
I'm sorry for the kick.

35
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,700
I kicked about 7 times.

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,700
I've been doing this all the time.

37
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,700
You're going to pop now.

38
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,700
But...

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,700
The gyal is...

40
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,700
It's okay to pay for it.

41
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Pay for it?

42
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,700
Yes.

43
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,700
This time...

44
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,700
I'm just saying it.

45
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,700
Let's do it for 10,000 yen.

46
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Then, 10,000 yen.

47
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,700
10,000 yen...

48
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,700
I'll pay 10,000 yen.

49
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,700
And then, three of us.

50
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
30,000 yen for three people.

51
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,700
What do you mean by three people?

52
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,700
My wife and children...

53
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Hey! Hey! Come in!

54
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,700
You're kidding me!

55
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,700
It's definitely not true!

56
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,700
It's definitely not true!

57
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,700
It's not true!

58
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,700
It's not true!

59
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,700
Hey, wait a minute!

60
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,700
It's so small!

61
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,700
It's so small!

62
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,700
It's so small!

63
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,700
Did you do it?

64
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,700
I did it, right?

65
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,700
You're not involved, right?

66
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,700
Yes.

67
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,700
I'm not involved.

68
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,700
You're not involved, right?

69
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,700
But actually, I did it.

70
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,700
Let's show the evidence.

71
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,700
There is.

72
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,700
There is evidence.

73
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,700
What is this?

74
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,700
Look at this.

75
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,700
This is the game of life.

76
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,700
You did play with this, right?

77
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,700
I did, but...

78
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,700
This is the one.

79
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,700
You prepared this for me?

80
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,700
No matter what he says, he doesn't back down.

81
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,700
It can't be helped, the producer, Sugai, has to pay for the character he has been asking for.

82
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,700
I don't have to say it, but I think it's a bit too much.

83
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,700
This is really...

84
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,700
It's not normal.

85
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,700
But...

86
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,700
Normally, this kind of thing will never be able to be passed.

87
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,700
If this kind of thing were to be passed, I wouldn't be able to stay silent.

88
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,700
You're looking at it with a big smile.

89
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,700
You do a lot of things.

90
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,700
I don't think I can do it like this.

91
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,700
And also, that thing...

92
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,700
You did something with the Kiki.

93
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,700
Yes, yes.

94
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Kiki tobacco, Kiki coffee.

95
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,700
This is curry.

96
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,700
This is curry.

97
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,700
I did that too.

98
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,700
Your wife.

99
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,700
Kiki coffee.

100
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,700
I brought the video so can you see it?

101
00:03:51,700 --> 00:04:03,700
The prize money is 200,000 yen. Itaoka Kiki Coffee Competition.

102
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,700
Can my wife guess correctly?

103
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,700
The coffee she will guess is this one.

104
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,700
Let's try it.

105
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,700
Let's start.

106
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,700
Please, the fourth one.

107
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,700
I'm going to take a picture.

108
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,700
Please remember the taste.

109
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,700
Did you remember?

110
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,700
Now, can you guess the fourth one?

111
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,700
Please take a picture.

112
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,700
Now, let's start the coffee machine.

113
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,700
I'm not sure.

114
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,700
I'm not sure.

115
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,700
I drank milk and coffee.

116
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,200
Congratulations on the correct answer!

117
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,700
You have won 200,000 yen!

118
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,700
Yay!

119
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,700
Yes.

120
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,700
It's a fun show.

121
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,700
It's a fun show.

122
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,700
So, you've come to get the prize money.

123
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,700
Huh?

124
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,700
I think it's that one.

125
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
First, there are many things I have to say.

126
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,700
That's right.

127
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,700
Umm...

128
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,700
What should we start with?

129
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,700
Kiki Coffee isn't a successful company.

130
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,700
It's more successful than that.

131
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,700
Why?

132
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,700
Because it's Brazilian.

133
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,700
I can't accept that my wife is Brazilian.

134
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,700
To be honest, what is your purpose?

135
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,700
You're making a connection with our company.

136
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
There are many other things too.

137
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
There are.

138
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,700
There are.

139
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,700
There are many other things too.

140
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,700
If you go to such a place, you'll be treated like a ***.

141
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,700
It's a strange place.

142
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:13,700
Moreover, Itao started to do the trial of the show, Itao's Wife, with a sexy excuse.

143
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,700
Sexy!

144
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,700
Itao can't control his excitement.

145
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,700
That night, the Itao couple were either in love or not in love.

146
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,700
How was it?

147
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,700
It was fun, right?

148
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,700
And, since she's such an interesting woman,

149
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,700
I thought she'd become a regular.

150
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,700
That's how far I've come.

151
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,700
What's a regular?

152
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,700
No, the kid's wife.

153
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
The wife?

154
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
Yes.

155
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,700
Even though she can't show her face?

156
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,700
That's right.

157
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,700
Even though she can't show her face.

158
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,700
Well, you see,

159
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,700
this Kokoriko Yamazaki...

160
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,700
What?

161
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,700
Yamazaki has been on TV for the second time.

162
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,700
He's been on TV for the second time.

163
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,700
It's about time.

164
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,700
You mean you're going to change your wife and Yamazaki?

165
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,700
I think so.

166
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,700
That's not true.

167
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,700
Well, Yamazaki's potential is pretty low.

168
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,700
It's low but...

169
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Please stop.

170
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,700
Please say it properly.

171
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,700
But I think that opinion is...

172
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,700
What is it?

173
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,700
That's not good.

174
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,700
I was doing something.

175
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
What?

176
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,700
Something with dolls.

177
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
Dolls?

178
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,700
Chucky?

179
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,700
Chucky?

180
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:49,700
I think it's fun. But it's more fun to do it with my wife.

181
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,700
That's not good.

182
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,700
That's not good.

183
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,700
Then, Yamagaki, you're a comedian with a long life.

184
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,700
So, even if it's just for fun, I can do it.

185
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,700
It's okay.

186
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,700
I'll show you a little bit of Yamagaki.

187
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,700
Yes, yes.

188
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,700
I'm told that I'm losing to the newbie.

189
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,700
I'll show you a little bit.

190
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,700
Please watch it from now on.

191
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
Okay.

192
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,700
I'll do it. I'm very motivated.

193
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,700
Are you motivated?

194
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
I'm motivated.

195
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
What?

196
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700
What?

197
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
What?

198
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,700
What?

199
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,700
What?

200
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,700
What?

201
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,700
What?

202
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,700
What?

203
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,700
What is this?

204
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,700
What?

205
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,700
I just realized that he's forcing his teeth.

206
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,700
That's not true.

207
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,700
Using the regular way of using the toilet, Yamazaki and the wife of the chef are experiencing a close-up experience.

208
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,700
Happy birthday to you!

209
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,700
This program is brought to you by the sponsors you see.

210
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,700
Wadou-san, are you ready for Yamazaki?

211
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,700
Yes, I am.

212
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,700
This is a long time ago.

213
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,700
He tried to make another boom in the world.

214
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,700
To be honest, that was a failure.

215
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,700
It was a failure, but it was more fun than a wife.

216
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,700
Let's go.

217
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,700
Please, Yamazaki's Chucky.

218
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,700
I'm ready!

219
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,700
Wow!

220
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
I'm ready!

221
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,700
I'm coming!

222
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
That's good.

223
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
She's ready.

224
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,700
I'm ready!

225
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
I'm ready!

226
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,700
I'm ready!

227
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:53,700
I am a sadistic person!

228
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Make captain!

229
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,700
Help me!

230
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,700
Give you!

231
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,700
I did it.

232
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,700
Hey, you...

233
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,700
What's with that face?

234
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,700
What?

235
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,700
Can you be quiet?

236
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
I can't do it, but it was good, right?

237
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
It was good.

238
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,700
I was shaking my hand before opening the curtains.

239
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,700
That was funny.

240
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,700
You can't do it, can you?

241
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,700
Yamazaki is not funny at all.

242
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,700
My face is funny.

243
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,700
Really?

244
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
It's the first time I've seen it.

245
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,700
I've seen it.

246
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,700
You haven't seen it.

247
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
Let's see it.

248
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,700
My wife's.

249
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,700
Yamazaki is not funny at all.

250
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,700
I heard that earlier.

251
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,700
Next is Itao's wife Chucky.

252
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,700
So, Itao's wife...

253
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Leave it to me.

254
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,700
Leave it to me, I know Itao.

255
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,700
I did it right away.

256
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,700
At home?

257
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,700
I said it was more fun, and I did it right away.

258
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,700
Itao's wife Chucky, go ahead!

259
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:13,440
I don't hide anymore

260
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,300
you must crazy

261
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,300
This is amazing!

262
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,300
What should I do?

263
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Wait a minute!

264
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,300
What should I do?

265
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
Wait a minute!

266
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,300
It's a regular.

267
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,300
But, Yamazaki has been...

268
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,300
Since the second time...

269
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,300
That's the only thing I can say.

270
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
That's the only thing I can say.

271
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,300
Yamazaki, leave it to me.

272
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
That's right. It's long.

273
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
It's long, so the reason is...

274
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,300
That's a great reason, but...

275
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,300
It's not that I don't think it's funny.

276
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Well, I'm fine with it, right?

277
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,300
Well, it's not really good.

278
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Itao gave up his regular replacement with Yamazaki.

279
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,300
But his intention was directed towards Endo.

280
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Endo?

281
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,300
Yes.

282
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,300
Yes, me too.

283
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,300
What were you doing?

284
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,300
If I had to say it on this show, I was doing high tension.

285
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Ah, I see.

286
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,300
This is...

287
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
I did this.

288
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,300
That was a bit strong.

289
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,300
My wife is probably more interesting.

290
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
As far as I can see, I think she's interesting.

291
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,300
Right? You want to see her, right?

292
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
Can you do high tension?

293
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,300
Of course.

294
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,300
Really?

295
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,300
If you can do it, I'm totally fine with it.

296
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,300
There are things that only men can do.

297
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,300
That's right.

298
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Are you okay?

299
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,300
Shirakobeku.

300
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
What are you talking about?

301
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
Shirakobeku?

302
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
What?

303
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,300
What's wrong with Shirakobeku?

304
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,300
I think you got the wrong input.

305
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,300
That's right.

306
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,300
After the regular day of the kids, Endo and Itao's wives are having a competition.

307
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,300
Endo, I want you to do your best.

308
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,300
I'm getting a little crazy.

309
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
It's okay.

310
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,300
It's okay.

311
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,300
It's okay.

312
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
You're the one who's going to be told off.

313
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,300
No, no, no. It's fine.

314
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,300
It wasn't fine.

315
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
Now, show us your smile!

316
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
Look at that body.

317
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
That body is just right.

318
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,300
That movement is just right.

319
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
You've gotten a little better.

320
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,300
This is it.

321
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,300
I know the rhythm of Samba.

322
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,300
I want to go to Ghost Town.

323
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,300
That's right.

324
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,300
That's right.

325
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,300
That's right.

326
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,300
What are you doing?

327
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
That was good.

328
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
You're not laughing at all.

329
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,300
What?

330
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,300
You're not laughing at all.

331
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,300
Endo is not funny at all.

332
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,300
Endo is disgusting.

333
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
You're not laughing at all.

334
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,300
You're not laughing at all.

335
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Endo is not funny at all.

336
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,300
Endo is disgusting.

337
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,300
Well, it's just a trick.

338
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,300
If you're not happy, just say it.

339
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,300
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

340
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,300
Is that okay?

341
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,300
It's not okay!

342
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,300
It's really okay!

343
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,300
There's no way I'm going to lose!

344
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
No, you should just sit down.

345
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
You're the senior.

346
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,300
What's with that?

347
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,300
Next up is the wife's high tension.

348
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,300
Can the amateur's girlfriend do it?

349
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,300
Please give me the high tension of your wife!

350
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,300
Can you do the samba rhythm?

351
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,300
I want to go to the booth

352
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,300
I'm back

353
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,300
But this is...

354
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,300
You've already got it

355
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
What should I do?

356
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,300
What do you think, Endo?

357
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,300
Honestly, I lost to him in 6-4.

358
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,300
I understand.

359
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,300
Then, as promised, let's change it.

360
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,300
Endo-san.

361
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,300
Wait a minute.

362
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,300
I can do many things.

363
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,300
If I just follow the current method, 6-4...

364
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Honestly, it's 8-2.

365
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,300
It's 8-2, honestly.

366
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,300
You can ignore it.

367
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,300
Really?

368
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,300
There will be a time when Senpai will do strange things.

369
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,300
Wait a minute.

370
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,300
It's good, right?

371
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,300
There are many other things.

372
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,300
Yes, yes, yes.

373
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
It's not just that.

374
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,300
It's just that.

375
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,300
It's good.

376
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,300
Sorry, but there is a high tension next time.

377
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,300
The company is being included in the schedule.

378
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
If you can go to the end now.

379
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,300
That's right.

380
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:38,300
Then, well, the partner of Endo, Tanaka, you did something, right?

381
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,300
Tanaka?

382
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:46,300
Well, recently, I've been doing a mixed-sacrifice with Hoero.

383
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,300
This is...

384
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,300
A mixed-sacrifice.

385
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,300
You can do a mixed-sacrifice with that.

386
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,300
I see. Then, well, it's a combination of the two.

387
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,300
Then, Tanaka and my wife will fight.

388
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
Why are you fighting with an amateur's wife?

389
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,300
That's right!

390
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,300
I don't understand why you're fighting.

391
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
Why are you losing so easily?

392
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,300
With the help of the regular of Gakinosuke,

393
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,300
Tanaka and Itao's wives are going to fight with Matsuda Yusaku's G-PAN.

394
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,300
Let's go!

395
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
Tanaka's G-PAN, please!

396
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,300
Go ahead!

397
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
Go ahead!

398
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,300
Who's there again?

399
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,300
Nice.

400
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,300
How are you?

401
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,300
I'm good.

402
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,300
How are you?

403
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,300
Good.

404
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,300
Ready!

405
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,300
Thank you!

406
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,300
Now, from here.

407
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,300
It's a little hot.

408
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,300
What the hell is this?

409
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,300
Nice.

410
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,300
What the hell is this?

411
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,300
I told you.

412
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,300
I told you.

413
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,300
I'm not saying that.

414
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,300
Arrangement.

415
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,300
Arrangement.

416
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
It's really similar.

417
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
That's the name.

418
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
I don't want to die.

419
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,300
I don't want to die.

420
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,300
Amazing.

421
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,300
It's good.

422
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,300
I don't want to die.

423
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
I don't want to die.

424
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,300
It's good.

425
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,300
It's good.

426
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,300
Arrangement.

427
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,300
This is the best.

428
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Yes!

429
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,300
Yes!

430
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,300
This is definitely a good one.

431
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,300
I think it's a perfect one.

432
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,300
I don't know why, but I'm already surprised.

433
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,300
It's okay, right?

434
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,300
I was a little surprised.

435
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,300
I was a little surprised.

436
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,300
This is amazing.

437
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
This is impossible.

438
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
I see.

439
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Tanaka is totally funny.

440
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
Tanaka is young and hairy.

441
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
What does that have to do with anything?

442
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,300
What does that have to do with anything?

443
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
My video is completely funny.

444
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,300
What?

445
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,300
What do you mean by that?

446
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,300
Tanaka is not funny at all.

447
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,300
I said I understand.

448
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
Young and hairy.

449
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
I can't say that I don't understand.

450
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Will he be able to overcome Tanaka?

451
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,300
Please give me the G-PAN.

452
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Then, give me the G.

453
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,300
Give me the G.

454
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
It's important. Give me the G.

455
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,300
Give me the G.

456
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:55,300
What is this?

457
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:03,300
I don't want to die.

458
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,300
What is this?

459
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,300
I don't want to die.

460
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,300
I'm sorry.

461
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,300
I'm sorry!

462
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,300
That was amazing.

463
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,300
How was it?

464
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,300
It was very similar.

465
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,300
It was similar.

466
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,300
But it was heavy.

467
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
Well, that's right.

468
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,300
The use of the makiwaki is interesting.

469
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,300
It's interesting or not, it's similar.

470
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,300
If you say it's interesting...

471
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,300
It's not like you're imitating.

472
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,300
That's right.

473
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,300
It's interesting.

474
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
You're funny.

475
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
Hey.

476
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,300
Hey!

477
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,300
Wait a minute.

478
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,300
Isn't that a true story?

479
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,300
What?

480
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,300
Hey, are you okay?

481
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,300
I'm not okay.

482
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:15,300
Hey, someone, an ambulance!

483
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,300
It's not an ambulance.

484
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,300
That's right.

485
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,300
Hey, Mr. Itagawa.

486
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,300
Why are you a foreigner?

487
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
Are you okay?

488
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:31,560
I'm a

489
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,560
It's not the time to be laughing.

490
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
Are you okay?

491
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
The breath of the cow.

492
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
The breath of the cow.

493
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Hey!

494
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Hey!

495
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
Are you okay?

496
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
You're so messy.

497
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,560
You're so messy.

498
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,560
No, it's not like that.

499
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,560
This is a big problem.

500
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,560
No, no, no.

501
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,560
This is it.

502
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,560
Three shots in the chest.

503
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,560
It was pierced.

504
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Oh, it's a bra.

505
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,560
There's no way that's real.

506
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,560
But it's actually like this.

507
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
Is it going to die?

508
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
It's already in a coma.

509
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
Is it a shrink?

510
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,560
The owner is Yamada.

511
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,560
What?

512
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,560
What a perfect timing!

513
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,560
I'm in a pack of popcorn!

514
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,560
Is that the guy?

515
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Hey...

516
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,560
Hey, wake up!

517
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
You're not going to help me, are you?

518
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
What?

519
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

520
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,560
Is that all you can say?

521
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

522
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Is that all you can say?

523
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

524
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
What?

525
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,560
It's not shaking.

526
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,560
It's not dead.

527
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
It's gone in a flash.

528
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,560
It's not dead, but it's a little strange.

529
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,560
Oh, something amazing is coming up.

530
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,560
Hey, are you okay?

531
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
Hey!

532
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,560
Teacher, are you okay?

533
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,560
Tonight is Yamada.

534
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
I understand.

535
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,560
Hey!

536
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,560
Hey!

537
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Yamada!

538
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
Shikase!

539
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,560
What?

540
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
What?

541
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
What?

542
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Of course, it's late.

543
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Oh no, Yamada!

544
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
He's dead!

545
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
He's dead, right?

546
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
He's dead.

547
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,560
I can't read!

548
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,560
I can't read.

549
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,560
I don't like when you say that.

550
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
I'm sorry.

551
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
Please leave.

552
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
What?

553
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Please leave your family alone.

554
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,560
I don't have any other family.

555
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
I'm sorry.

556
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
Is he dead?

557
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,560
Today is Yamada's...

558
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
He's not dead yet.

559
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,560
He's not dead yet.

560
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,560
I'm fine!

561
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,560
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
