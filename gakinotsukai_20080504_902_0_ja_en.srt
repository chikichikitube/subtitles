1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Before recording the children's story, Ichido gets excited with the travel story.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's a travel story. Let's go on a trip.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But he is not there.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey, hey, hey, damn it!

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're surprised, right?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No, I'm more surprised.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Gorilla?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's not a gorilla.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's Hamada-san.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's Hamada-san.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No, it's not. I'm more surprised.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There are Kappa.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What are you up to?

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Kappa.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Kappa, there are Kappa.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Close.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Kappa at this time.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That is also false.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There are Kappa.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Which one?

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Everyone.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Some say

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Kappa Kappa.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Who says that?

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Everyone.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I told you so.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I didn't go there to see it.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I didn't go there to see it.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Don't you think so?

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There are some, right?

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, there are some, like a witness group.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm telling you seriously, but you're laughing at me.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There are some, right?

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There is a park, Takinoharu Park.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I want you to go there more than you go.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Right?

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
There are some, right?

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's far away, but it's a park.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's close by.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There's a waterfall.

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You can see it right away.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You can see the location right away.

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's amazing if there are people.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There's time.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Let's go.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There are too many people.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's going to be a big deal.

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's the worst if you can't go.

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's right.

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Well then...

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's go.

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How about you, Tanaka?

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll go after I'm ready.

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Really?

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hurry up.

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Take it all!

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I want to go!

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hey!

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm going to take this.

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hey!

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The unidentified creature that has been passed down from the ancient times of Japan, the kappa.

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Kappa. There are many groups of witnesses, but none of them have seen him.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
However, when Kappa appeared, Kyuseki suddenly appeared and caught him.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It seems to be there.

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It seems to be there more than before.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Look, look, look.

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is it.

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
This is the one with the waterfall.

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, it's true.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh, it's true. The waterfall.

71
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, it's not there.

72
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's not there?

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Well, it's here, but it's not there.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No, no, there's no one here.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But, well, well.

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's a good thing.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, oh!

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Look!

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Who could it be?

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Look!

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's a kappa.

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's a kappa.

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's here.

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's huge!

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's huge!

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Ah, it's wet.

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're a big scoop!

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is amazing!

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't say that!

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm surprised.

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I can't believe it.

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It was about 180 degrees.

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And the coke was so small.

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It was so small.

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It was different from what we imagined.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's coming out.

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's back in the soup.

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's amazing.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's amazing.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's amazing.

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's amazing.

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Really?

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's amazing.

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why don't you go?

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I went but I didn't ask for the exact location.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's near the park with the waterfall.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Really?

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's amazing.

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Is it a kappa?

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
How big do you think the cup is?

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
About 1 meter in size.

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's not good.

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's 180...

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
180...

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's really big.

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's about that big.

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Wow!

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Sorry, I was just joking.

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's right.

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's good.

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I forgot to take a picture.

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You didn't take one?

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Really? You didn't take one?

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I didn't take one.

126
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I didn't take one.

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I forgot to take a picture!

128
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What?

129
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is it a picture of a hippo?

130
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm not taking it.

131
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If you take it now, it'll be too late to publish it in the papers.

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I took it. I took it.

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This is a big scoop.

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I forgot to take a picture!

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm not taking a picture.

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm not saying I bought it, but...

137
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Do you want to eat cucumbers?

138
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't say you like it.

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm being told.

140
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,500
We'll have to get cucumbers ready and take them with us.

141
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,200
We'll have to get them ready and take pictures.

142
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Let's go.

143
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,500
Let's go.

144
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,000
Let's go.

145
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,900
Let's go.

146
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,700
Let's go.

147
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,700
No, wait, I...

148
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,900
I'll go after I eat.

149
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,900
You're not going to eat?

150
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,200
Let's go.

151
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,700
You're so mean.

152
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,300
I'll chase after you.

153
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,400
In order to capture the picture,

154
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,900
we headed to the jungle park in the city again.

155
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,900
The next day

156
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,900
I think he's going to come out

157
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,900
I want to see him

158
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,900
I want to see him for about 6 days

159
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,900
The flash is a little dim

160
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,900
That's right

161
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,900
It's better than before

162
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,900
Come out

163
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,900
Kappa!

164
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,900
Here, here.

165
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,900
It's not different from before.

166
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,900
It was a different position before.

167
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
Right?

168
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,900
Maybe it'll come out somewhere else.

169
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,900
If we wait here...

170
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,900
It's coming out!

171
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,900
It's coming out!

172
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,900
It's coming out!

173
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,900
Kappa has appeared before us again.

174
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,900
It's coming really close.

175
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,900
Okay, okay, take it.

176
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,900
Take it, you!

177
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,900
It's coming!

178
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,900
Hey!

179
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,900
Ummm it is close!

180
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,660
Do antic this end.

181
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,840
Oh, he is throwing cucumber immediately.

182
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,040
connecting

183
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,160
Oh! He accessing into theütfen of cucumber!

184
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,640
Fuious!

185
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,840
I think so.

186
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,640
Throw it!

187
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,840
Throw it!

188
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,640
There's not much.

189
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,040
Oh, there it is!

190
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,640
Hey!

191
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,340
It's reacting!

192
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,040
It's reacting!

193
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:22,940
Kappa...

194
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,640
Hey, Kappa!

195
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,040
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!

196
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Turn around!

197
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,840
It's eating it.

198
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Is it eating it?

199
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,540
Yeah.

200
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,540
It's hard to tell.

201
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,940
Is it really eating it?

202
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,640
Hey!

203
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,040
Kappa!

204
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,840
Hey!

205
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,240
Come here! Come here! Come here!

206
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,840
Come closer!

207
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,540
What did you throw?

208
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,640
Hey!

209
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
Oh, it's broken!

210
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Did you take a picture?

211
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
I did.

212
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
I took a picture with my mom.

213
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
It's a bit...

214
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
It's a bit...

215
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
But it's a bit...

216
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
But it's taken.

217
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,640
I think we can bring this to the press.

218
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
I wonder if they'll buy it for us.

219
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
Right?

220
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
This is really expensive.

221
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
It's really expensive.

222
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
This is amazing.

223
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,640
You ate the cucumber, right?

224
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
I did.

225
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
I'm glad.

226
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
The picture is perfect.

227
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
I'm glad.

228
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
This is...

229
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
What is this?

230
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
It's amazing.

231
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,940
Get off!

232
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,460
You all think it was me right?

233
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,280
No way!

234
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,740
Kevin, look

235
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,500
Look at this!

236
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,000
Oneipeyarn ages after reading about gachapon

237
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,460
It�ts no kidding

238
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,120
It's huge isn't it?

239
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,720
It is really large

240
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,300
Your facial expression is bigger now

241
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,680
I get it

242
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,280
It's the size of the capabilities a cucumber has

243
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
I knew it!

244
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
I knew it!

245
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Show us a bit more.

246
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,280
The face of a god.

247
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
Show us again.

248
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,280
This is the Kappa.

249
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,280
It's hard to tell what Kappa is.

250
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,280
It's hard to tell.

251
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,280
It's the limit.

252
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
It's really close.

253
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
But the face is...

254
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Turn your face this way.

255
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Wow, these two...

256
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
The two are the same.

257
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,280
It's hard to tell.

258
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,280
The face is...

259
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,280
The hands are like a soldier's.

260
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Really?

261
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,280
This is one of them.

262
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
It's harder to tell.

263
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,280
It's not like a single one.

264
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
It's not powerful.

265
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,280
I thought it was a kappa.

266
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,280
So I thought it was a kappa.

267
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
But if someone who doesn't know anything shows me this...

268
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,280
It's not like a copper.

269
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
That's right.

270
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Let's go again.

271
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Let's go and get it again.

272
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Again?

273
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,280
It's the same thing.

274
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,280
But if we get more, it's a big scoop.

275
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Oh, really?

276
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
What's wrong?

277
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,280
I'm really nervous.

278
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,280
I'm going to go see it. I don't know if it's going to be 3 or 4.

279
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,280
His face is...

280
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
His face is bad.

281
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,280
And his hair is all wet.

282
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
It's all wet.

283
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
I'm happy.

284
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
I'm sorry.

285
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,280
What's wrong?

286
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
It's dirty.

287
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,280
It's dirty.

288
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
It's already Monday.

289
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,280
I'm going to go see it.

290
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
I'll chase him right away.

291
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
Let's go then.

292
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Let's go.

293
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,280
Let's go quickly.

294
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
It's already dark.

295
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
That's right.

296
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
What is it?

297
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,280
I'm going to be photographed.

298
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,280
Will there be any friends in Kappa?

299
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
We are in Mitabi Park.

300
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,280
He's pretty tight.

301
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
That's right.

302
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
He's been saying that he's going to make it.

303
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,280
It's a little bit creepy to be stuck in the middle of the road.

304
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,280
Can such a good dream come true?

305
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Yeah.

306
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,280
This is strange.

307
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
I wish there were some people.

308
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
What is it?

309
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
I see.

310
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
Where was it?

311
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
It's over there.

312
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Here it comes.

313
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Here it comes.

314
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
Is there anyone?

315
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Hey, Kappa!

316
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Hey, Kappa!

317
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,280
You're not here?

318
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
Kappa!

319
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
You're not here?

320
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,280
The waterfall isn't flowing either.

321
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
The waterfall is stopped.

322
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Ah, it's coming out!

323
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,280
It's coming.

324
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,280
Oh, it's coming out.

325
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,280
It's coming out.

326
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,280
It's coming out.

327
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
Mom, Kappa.

328
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,280
What's your family?

329
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,280
What's the original one?

330
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
The one in front of us.

331
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
What is it?

332
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
Kyo-tan!

333
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
Are you drinking alcohol?

334
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
Yes, I am.

335
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
It's a cherry blossom.

336
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
A cherry blossom?

337
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
It's a cheap house.

338
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Do you want to hear what I have to say?

339
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,280
I can't hear you.

340
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Come down here.

341
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
What?

342
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
I can hear you.

343
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
Hey, come down here.

344
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,280
There's a big one down there.

345
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
More, more, more.

346
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Hey, you two, come down here.

347
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Come here!

348
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
I want to have sex with you!

349
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Come here!

350
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,280
I'm not angry!

351
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Then, can't you talk?

352
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
You're so...

353
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,280
I'm asking you to come here, so you know about human beings, right?

354
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Do you know about human beings?

355
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,280
If you're like this...

356
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Hey, call her!

357
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
Come here!

358
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Come here!

359
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
It's coming.

360
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
It's scary.

361
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,280
It's scary when it comes.

362
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,280
It's scary when it comes.

363
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Hey, come here.

364
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Hey!

365
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
It's scary.

366
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Wait.

367
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Don't move.

368
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Can you eat this?

369
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,280
Are you crying?

370
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,280
Cry?

371
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,280
You cry?

372
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
I don't know.

373
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,280
OK.

374
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,280
Can you cry louder?

375
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
Cry from your stomach.

376
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
One more time.

377
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Did you get it?

378
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Look at me.

379
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Say it louder.

380
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Bring the cucumber here.

381
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,280
What? Cucumber?

382
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
He's eating it.

383
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,280
He's a big fan of it.

384
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
He's eating it.

385
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
Can you introduce him to us?

386
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,280
What kind of relationship?

387
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
I don't know how to explain it.

388
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,280
What kind of relationship?

389
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
Do you understand?

390
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,280
What kind of relationship?

391
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Nakama

392
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
Na

393
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
Ka-ma

394
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Ma

395
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,280
Ma

396
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Na

397
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,280
Na

398
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,280
Ka-ma

399
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,280
Nakama

400
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
It's a picture

401
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Please introduce me

402
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
Nakama

403
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Matsumoto

404
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Say it

405
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,780
Ma-Ts-Moto.

406
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,280
Matsumoto Nakama.

407
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,780
Hamada.

408
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,280
Aikata, Konbi.

409
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Combi! Combi!

410
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,280
What is Combi?

411
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Hamada, Matsumoto, Combi!

412
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Combi!

413
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
Endo!

414
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Endo!

415
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,280
Eh?

416
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Eh?

417
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,280
Do!

418
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,280
Do!

419
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
Endo!

420
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
Aikata!

421
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
Aikata!

422
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,280
Taa!

423
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Nakama!

424
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Nakama!

425
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,280
Nakama!

426
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Matsumoto!

427
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
Konbi!

428
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,280
Konbi!

429
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,280
Hey!

430
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,280
The two of them are gone!

431
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,280
What are those two doing?

432
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
That's amazing!

433
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,280
Let's go get some more!

434
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,280
That's amazing!

435
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,280
That's amazing!

436
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,280
You want to see a snowman, right?

437
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,280
A snowman, huh?

438
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,280
It's summer, so you have to have something.

439
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
I have a question for Matsumoto-san.

440
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,280
There are a lot of pigeons in the park, but you don't get to see them in the park.

441
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,280
Where do the pigeons die?

442
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,280
Well, first of all, I don't know why you ask me that.

443
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
No, no, no.

444
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,280
You can ask that kind of person.

445
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,280
No, no, no. You know everything.

446
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
He's a college student.

447
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
18 years old.

448
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,280
That's right.

449
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,280
But even if he's a college student, he's honest.

450
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
That's right.

451
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
I'll tell you.

452
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,280
Basically, a pigeon doesn't die.

453
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,280
I don't really understand the basics.

454
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
You don't die?

455
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Basically, a pigeon doesn't die.

456
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
It does get dizzy sometimes.

457
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
Like,

458
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,280
I'm dizzy, you know.

459
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
I'm going to die.

460
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
But,

461
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
But, basically, it doesn't die.

462
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
Basically, it doesn't die.

463
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Yes, yes, yes.

464
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
That's what I heard.

465
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,280
But there are some who are dead inside.

466
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,280
But basically they are not dead.

467
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
So there are no new pigeons.

468
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Pigeons.

469
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,280
The pigeons we have been watching since we were children are always those pigeons.

470
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,280
But sometimes they are dead.

471
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
No way!

472
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
They are dead.

473
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,280
Like, oh, the pigeons are dead.

474
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
Normally pigeons don't die.

475
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,280
They are just saying, oh, oh, oh.

476
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,280
But I don't think there's anything that won't die.

477
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,280
Well, there is a theory.

478
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
A theory?

479
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,280
Like, how is it? I won't die, right?

480
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,280
That's what the story goes.

481
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,280
This is a question for Matsumoto-san, who is said to understand the feelings of animals better than Mutsugoro-san.

482
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,780
Yes.

483
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,280
Like humans, do dogs and cats have do-em too?

484
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
Of course they do.

485
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Oh, really?

486
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,780
Yes.

487
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
So why can't you say that?

488
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
Because, well...

489
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
They're trying to see me poop.

490
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,280
They're not trying to see you!

491
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
They're just pooping normally!

492
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
But, you know...

493
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
But, you know...

494
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,280
You can't make them not see you next to the dog house.

495
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,280
That's why they can't be seen by others.

496
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,280
They cry and say they want to take them somewhere.

497
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,280
They take them to the outside world and live there.

498
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,280
They are surrounded by people.

499
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,280
They think, wow, everyone is watching.

500
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,280
I don't know if they think or not.

501
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,280
They are all surrounded.

502
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
They are connected.

503
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,280
I don't think they are.

504
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,280
They are connected.

505
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,280
I don't have any intention.

506
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
I don't have any intention.

507
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
I hate you.

508
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
It's impossible.

509
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Excuse me, can I ask you something?

510
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
What?

511
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,280
What is tuna for Katsuo?

512
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
I don't know either.

513
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
I want to ask you all.

514
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
This is...

515
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,280
It's difficult...

516
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,280
I know it.

517
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,280
I want to explain it to everyone in one word.

518
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,280
I want to make it as easy as possible.

519
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,280
It's difficult.

520
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
So...

521
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,280
It's okay if you're there.

522
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,280
It's better if you're there.

523
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,280
But it's also an obstacle.

524
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,280
But I want to coexist.

525
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,280
But when it comes to sashimi, I think I won't lose.

526
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
Well, the taste is different.

527
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
The taste is different.

528
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Then, it doesn't matter what it is.

529
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,280
I am me.

530
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,280
But after all, it's better to be together.

531
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Because it all comes to me.

532
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,280
How long does it take for it to come to me?

533
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
For example, if you cook tuna.

534
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
It comes to me like this.

535
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
It all comes to me.

536
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:40,280
When you were served at the bar, you were thinking about that?

537
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Of course, that's also true.

538
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:48,280
When you were served at the bar, everyone would come, if it was just me.

539
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Who were you talking about?

540
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Tuna.

541
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Yes.

542
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,280
And, the one who was served by Hamachi was...

543
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
Katsuo.

544
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
I'm not sure.

545
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Katsuo is better.

546
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Katsuo is jealous.

547
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,280
It's hard to be alone.

548
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,280
I don't want Katsuo to go, but she goes.

549
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,280
I know the good of it.

550
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,280
But I'm not going to give up.

551
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,280
I can't say it's a mistake, but I think all the customers have their own way of living.

552
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
I wonder.

553
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,280
I don't know, but I think about it.

554
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
Let's say you're a tuna.

555
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Yes.

556
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,280
Let's say you're a tuna.

557
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
Close your eyes and say,

558
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
What do you think?

559
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,280
What do you think?

560
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,280
What do you think?

561
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,280
So, when I become a tuna...

562
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Wait a minute.

563
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,280
Let's all become tuna, including you.

564
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Everyone, right?

565
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
No, let's all become katsuo.

566
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
Katsuo, yes, katsuo is fine.

567
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
Where is the tuna?

568
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
For me, tuna...

569
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
After all, tuna becomes me.

570
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,280
That's right.

571
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
And I think about katsuo.

572
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
No, after all, tuna...

573
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,280
Stop it!

574
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
Yeah!
