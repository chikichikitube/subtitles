1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's play the original game of Gaining High 1

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The second half

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The second half of the game

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The Gaining High 1 challenge is a game that the Gaining High 1 members usually play in the theater or in the dressing room

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm going to sing

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Amazing

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm not!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The second half of the game is even more exciting!

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The first half...ah, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I think I'm going to fall.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's okay, it's okay.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's a very strong game.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I understand.

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Please welcome, Zun Zero Gain!

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Who is it?

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Who is it?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hello!

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thank you for coming!

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thank you for coming!

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Who is it?

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I think I've met him once at NGK.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't know him that well.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, really?

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Nice to meet you.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're not a big fan of Otaku, right?

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Nice to meet you.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We've only met once.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We don't know each other.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Nice to meet you.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Nice to meet you.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I hope you recover soon.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You've never met Otaku, right?

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I have.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I have.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Mel-sons! What is the original game they thought of that is good at making jokes?

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Originally, we thought of Wada Manju.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Wada Manju?

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Manju, yes.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Wada Manju?

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes, Wada Manju.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Wada Manju thought of it.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's a game that's really popular among young comedians.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Please explain it.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The game we thought of is this.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
3 words, no talking!

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes, just like that

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We'll have you talk using words other than 3 words

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If you can't get into the rhythm, you're out

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There are many words other than 3 words

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Using the rhythm and talking using other than 3 words

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Of course, even if you say words that are negative, you'll lose

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
A match?

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes, 1 on 1.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Everyone will be watching but...

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Who will be playing against you?

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Dokumanju.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Ah, I see.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's Wada Manju.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Wada Manju.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's Dokumanju.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Then, who will be playing against you?

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Matsumoto-san, excuse me.

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Wada Manju and...

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Wada Manju is strong, right?

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,240
Wada Manju is a game of

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I've never met anyone like him before, so I want to play against someone I won't see again.

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why do you say that?

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Why?

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's do it again.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Let's do it again.

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's decide the winner by rock-paper-scissors.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm scared.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The face of the manju is the face of the manju.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's right.

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You're so kind.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
If you write the absolute result, you'll be in trouble.

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I won't.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm not in trouble.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's the basics.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's the basics.

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's going to collapse soon.

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No, not that.

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Matsumoto-san goes first.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let's start with the first letter.

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll go first.

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Here I go.

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Ka!

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Ka!

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Kangaroo!

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ruby!

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, no.

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Sorry.

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Sorry.

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This guy is a piece of shit!

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This guy!

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You're still not done yet?

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't want to see this!

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You've got to take this!

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Take this!

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Take this!

104
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hey, Mr. Hamada!

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This guy is dangerous!

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He's going to take this!

107
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Take it!

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I've been thinking about this guy since last night.

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I thought I would take it tomorrow.

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're still not done yet?

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Wada Manju.

112
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Which one should I start with?

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm already tired of you.

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Then let's start with Wada Manju.

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Wada Manju will go first.

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Here I go!

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What's with that...

118
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
...that way of talking?

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I didn't say anything.

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What's with that?

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I didn't say anything.

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You hate me, right?

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I like you.

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You really hate me?

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't hate you.

126
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Really?

127
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
How much do you like me?

128
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I've been watching your shows.

129
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What?

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I really like you.

131
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's a generation.

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're a bit too old for this.

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What's wrong?

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What's wrong?

135
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I didn't plan this.

136
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I just wanted to play a game.

137
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Ah, sorry, sorry.

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's not it.

139
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's not it.

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Sorry, sorry.

141
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's not it.

143
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I didn't ask.

144
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I didn't ask if I could kick.

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Sorry, sorry.

146
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So, from Hamada-san.

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thank you.

148
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay.

149
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Ki.

150
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Kisu.

151
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Sumi

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Ni

153
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Nitsukansu

154
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What?

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Nitsukansu

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You said it before

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Nitsukansu

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Su

159
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Suri

160
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Rinpasein...ah, Unkatsu

161
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What the hell?

162
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,460
I troubled you.

163
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,920
Not me.

164
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,920
We would never do that!

165
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
Let's do it!

166
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
We did it!

167
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
Matsumoto, you should do it!

168
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
Stop it!

169
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,920
We have no choice but to win

170
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
Let's start from Matsumoto

171
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
Let's start

172
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,920
Ma

173
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Matsumoto

174
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
Tonakai

175
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
Ika

176
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Ok, next.

177
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Kejirami.

178
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
Mirin.

179
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
You should do it properly.

180
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
This is a difficult one.

181
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
You should do it properly.

182
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
You should drink three letters.

183
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
You are motivated.

184
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,920
You are motivated.

185
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
You are motivated to fight.

186
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
I just want you to enjoy it.

187
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
It's a battle field.

188
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Go home!

189
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Go home!

190
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
What are you going to do?

191
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
Thank you very much!

192
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
That was quick!

193
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Now, the next artist, please come in!

194
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Hello, nice to meet you.

195
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Thank you for coming

196
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
Next is the question question

197
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,920
What is the original game that they suggest?

198
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Thinking of the original game is a hobby

199
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Today's game is this

200
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
One letter game

201
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Please take care of us.

202
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,920
It's a game that everyone plays.

203
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,920
If I say, Ki,

204
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
For example, I say, No,

205
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Ki, No,

206
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Then Hose says, U,

207
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Matsumoto says, Wa,

208
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Everyone says one letter at a time and makes a sentence.

209
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
I see.

210
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
Ki, then Ki,

211
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Ki, Tsu, Ne,

212
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
What word comes from Ki?

213
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
I wonder if it will continue.

214
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
How long will it last?

215
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
It will continue forever.

216
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
I see.

217
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
It's not over in the middle.

218
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
It will continue.

219
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,920
If you don't understand the meaning, it's over.

220
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,920
I see.

221
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,920
The connection of the sentences is strange.

222
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
There is a tempo, right?

223
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Yes, it's a good tempo.

224
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,920
After it's over, I'll count 3 seconds.

225
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,920
So even if you can't say it, you're out.

226
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
That's what it means.

227
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
I hope I can say it.

228
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,920
One by one, they will say a word and make a sentence.

229
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,920
If the sentence is broken, you're out.

230
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Let's get started.

231
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
I'll go first.

232
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Yes.

233
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,420
Ah!

234
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,920
Tomorrow,

235
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Please,

236
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,920
Take care of me.

237
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Even if you say so.

238
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
Even if you say so.

239
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Kodomo a...

240
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Ashi...

241
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
Ashi...

242
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Ta...mo...

243
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Pa...ta...ma...ni...wa...o...te...

244
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,920
Wait, you're not doing it right!

245
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,920
It's not good, it's not good.

246
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,920
It's not good.

247
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,920
I don't remember the last part, so I thought it was okay.

248
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
I don't remember.

249
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Show me what you just did.

250
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
Everyone was good, right?

251
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,920
I think it was my fault.

252
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,920
It's still...

253
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
Let's watch it again.

254
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,920
I look forward to tomorrow.

255
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Please say it

256
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,920
Te mo?

257
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Ne?

258
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Ne ko?

259
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Ne?

260
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Ah, so it's ne and ko?

261
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Ne ko?

262
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
I see

263
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,920
So it's ne and kin

264
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,920
I thought it was ne and kin and it started with ko so I thought it was a child

265
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
But I kind of got it

266
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Okay, I got it

267
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
It's that tempo right?

268
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Please do it at that tempo.

269
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Let's go.

270
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
I'm starting.

271
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
A

272
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920

SO

279
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
NO

283
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
2

284
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
1

285
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
What?

286
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
TACHI?

287
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
I want to do it properly.

288
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,560
Ruru.

289
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,560
Tachi-uru?

290
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,560
Tachi-uru?

291
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
Tachi-uru is a hand.

292
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,560
Tachi-uru is a hand.

293
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
A hand?

294
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
2

295
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Tachi-uru is no longer good.

296
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,560
3

297
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
2

298
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
1

299
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
It's too difficult.

300
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
What is Tachi-uru?

301
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,560
You can say anything.

302
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Tachi.

303
00:11:51,560 --> 00:12:00,560
I want to eat the Tachiu.

304
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,560
I thought so too.

305
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,560
And Endo was rolling around.

306
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,560
I thought so.

307
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
Really.

308
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,560
Everyone thought about Tachiu.

309
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
I thought so.

310
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
I was really surprised.

311
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
You were really surprised.

312
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
You were really surprised.

313
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
I was really surprised.

314
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
I was really surprised.

315
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
Now, the second comedian, please.

316
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
This is Aikawa Takizawa.

317
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
Thank you!

318
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,560
It's been a while

319
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
It's been a while

320
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
Thank you

321
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
I was doing well

322
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
Me too

323
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,560
Me too

324
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Thank you

325
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
I always watch your show on TV

326
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
Me too

327
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
I brought a game

328
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
I brought a game

329
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
This is the game I brought

330
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
Look this way, A-chan Rock-paper-scissors

331
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
Rock, paper, scissors!

332
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
What? What is A-chan?

333
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
You are so stupid!

334
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
If you do that, you will be like that.

335
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,560
Look this way, A-chan, rock, paper, scissors.

336
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Not that way.

337
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
I will explain the rules first.

338
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Rock, paper, scissors.

339
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
Win or lose, A-chan pose.

340
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
If you lose in rock, paper, scissors,

341
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
If you do the same pose as the winner, you lose.

342
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
First, A-chan pose.

343
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
There is a joke.

344
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Please take a look.

345
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Aikichi Yazawa who guides the way.

346
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
Is it a hospital?

347
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
It's a hospital in Kokomatsu, isn't it?

348
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
There is a traffic light.

349
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,560
The traffic light is turning right all the time.

350
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
I see.

351
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,560
Get on.

352
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Ha ha.

353
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
This is one pose.

354
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
There are three poses in total.

355
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
This is a little difficult.

356
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
This is the first pose.

357
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,560
First, make your face like a girl.

358
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Second, turn your fingers.

359
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:23,560
Third, this.

360
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,560
This is the pose.

361
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Can you do it with me?

362
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
This?

363
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
This one?

364
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
No, this one.

365
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Stretch your back a little.

366
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
And this face.

367
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
Oh, yes.

368
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
Then, these three.

369
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Okay.

370
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Are you ready?

371
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Yes.

372
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
Let's start with the first one.

373
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,560
The first one is a rock-paper-scissors.

374
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,560
Rock-paper-scissors.

375
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,560
Look over there.

376
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,560
Hey, wait.

377
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
No, no, no.

378
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
Do it later.

379
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,560
Do it later.

380
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,560
You have to do it later.

381
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,560
At the same time.

382
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,560
Together.

383
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,560
Matsumoto, are you ready?

384
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,360
Can I do it too?

385
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,860
You do all of it, huh?

386
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,660
I want to do it with a guy who's sweating oil like this.

387
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,660
Please don't hate me.

388
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,860
Do it with a positive attitude.

389
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
I'm a first-timer, so please do it.

390
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,860
Really.

391
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,860
Then the first one should say,

392
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,860
Look this way.

393
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,860
Look this way, A-chan.

394
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,860
Look this way, A-chan.

395
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,860
Look this way, A-chan.

396
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,860
Yes.

397
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,860
Look this way, A-chan.

398
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,860
That's right.

399
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,060
Rock, paper, scissors.

400
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,060
Aiko-desho.

401
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,360
Aiko-desho.

402
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,360
Look this way, A-chan

403
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,760
Oh, that's good

404
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
At first, it's a rock-paper-scissors

405
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
Look this way, A-chan

406
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
At first, it's a rock-paper-scissors

407
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Look this way, A-chan

408
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,760
Ah, I just got it

409
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
You won

410
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
I won

411
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
I won

412
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
That was funny

413
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,760
It was funny, right?

414
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Thank you, thank you

415
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Now, Matsumoto-san, everyone.

416
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,260
Yes.

417
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,260
This is the last one.

418
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,760
Well, this is the reason why we started this project.

419
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,760
We have a new member.

420
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
Oh, yes.

421
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
Please welcome!

422
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Good morning, good morning. I'm Roxy.

423
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Roxy, you're here.

424
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
Congratulations.

425
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Thank you.

426
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
Can I say something?

427
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,760
I don't know the game you played last time.

428
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,760
Oh, you didn't play it.

429
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,760
You did the full cut, right?

430
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,760
What did you do?

431
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,760
To be honest, I can't explain it.

432
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
Really?

433
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,760
I don't know what you did.

434
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,760
Did you measure it?

435
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,760
I got to choose the item I liked,

436
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,760
and I had to pick the item,

437
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,760
and I played something like Shurikugensta.

438
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
You did?

439
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,760
I played a game where you had to guess the amount of water in the cup.

440
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,760
We played a game called, Can you continue to cry?

441
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
I don't remember that.

442
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,760
Really?

443
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Today?

444
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,760
Today, we have this.

445
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Today, we have this.

446
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
Ta-da!

447
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,760
It's a choice game.

448
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,760
Like last time, we didn't choose.

449
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,760
And it's a choice game.

450
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
Last time?

451
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Last time?

452
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
What?

453
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
I don't understand the explanation.

454
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Last time, we didn't do it.

455
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
We did it.

456
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,760
We have a special version of that game

457
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
It's a choice game

458
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
The name is interesting though

459
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
It's a choice game

460
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,760
It's a choice game in Katakana

461
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
I understand

462
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
It's a choice game

463
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Please give us 3 minutes

464
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Please start at the same time

465
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
The choice game you will play is this

466
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
The choice game we will play

467
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Please look

468
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,760
We have prepared a lot of trees this time.

469
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,760
The way you hold the tree is completely different.

470
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,760
We have prepared all kinds of trees this time.

471
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
Not all kinds of trees.

472
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,760
I think there are more.

473
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,760
Please choose three trees you like from these.

474
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,760
It's crazy.

475
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
Please choose.

476
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,760
I want you to choose three.

477
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Please choose your favorite trees.

478
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
What is this? This is strange.

479
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,760
It's a miracle.

480
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
So, these three.

481
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
Three.

482
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,760
You can choose three.

483
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Three is fine?

484
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Then, Mr.Mizu, please sit down.

485
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Please.

486
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,760
Choose this?

487
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Then, the game we will play is this.

488
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Wood and soil.

489
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Oh, sorry. I made a mistake.

490
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Wood and soil.

491
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,760
This is the game we will play this time.

492
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,760
Wood and soil.

493
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,760
I don't know what I did wrong.

494
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,260
No.

495
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,260
It's important.

496
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,260
I made a mistake.

497
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:51,760
Really?

498
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,260
Yes.

499
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,760
It's a soil game with wood.

500
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,260
A soil game with wood?

501
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:01,260
It's a game where you make soil with the wood you got.

502
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,760
What?

503
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,260
Then, you have 3 minutes.

504
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,260
Wait a minute.

505
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:04,760
What?

506
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,260
There's no explanation.

507
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,760
What does it mean to make soil?

508
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,260
Please make soil with three pieces of wood.

509
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,260
Oh, I see.

510
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,260
Correct! That's what I'm talking about!

511
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,260
You can't say it out loud!

512
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,260
What the hell is that?

513
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,260
You can't say it out loud!

514
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,260
Please make a soil with wood!

515
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,260
It's a soil made of wood!

516
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,260
You can't say it out loud!

517
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,260
Let's say it out loud!

518
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,260
I'll make a soil!

519
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,260
The person who makes a soil with a cleaner wood wins!

520
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,260
But I already chose it, so I don't know.

521
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:46,260
And you guys will be able to see the amazing, unique, and artistic, and delicate...

522
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,260
Wait, wait, wait!

523
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,260
It's a bit too fast!

524
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,260
3 minutes!

525
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,260
Please start at the same time!

526
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,260
I don't get it!

527
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,260
Let's start!

528
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,260
Hidekochi, start!

529
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,260
He's doing this?

530
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,260
Please do your best!

531
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,260
The choice is important.

532
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,260
This is really decided by choice.

533
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,260
If there is a stand-up style,

534
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,260
Tanaka-san, you did it with such a choice.

535
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,260
This is a little...

536
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,260
It's a little...

537
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,260
The second one below.

538
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,260
The second one below.

539
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:27,260
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

540
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,260
It's over.

541
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,260
First of all, let's start with Tanaka-san.

542
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,260
I'm sorry.

543
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,260
Here you are.

544
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,260
What?

545
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,260
Too bad!

546
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,260
You said you couldn't get a nail.

547
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,260
Really?

548
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,260
You were so nervous.

549
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,260
It was a bad choice.

550
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,260
Next time, please give us a good choice.

551
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,260
Thank you.

552
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
What's next?

553
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,260
Matsumoto-san.

554
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Matsumoto-san.

555
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,260
This is the first one.

556
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,260
Please.

557
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,260
Wonderful.

558
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,260
The number.

559
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,260
It was simple and easy.

560
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,260
It was the fastest.

561
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,260
It was the best choice.

562
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,260
The balance is a little thick.

563
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,260
The hole in the hole is also good.

564
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,260
If you have a dojo, you can swim and do it.

565
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,260
I think it's good, so please wait for the results.

566
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
Thank you.

567
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,260
Please be good soil.

568
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,260
Hosei and Endo successfully made the soil with wood.

569
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,260
The last one is Hamada.

570
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,260
Finally, Hamada, please.

571
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,260
I'm sorry, this one doesn't go up.

572
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,260
I have to put it in here.

573
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,260
I have to put it in here.

574
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,260
The second one below.

575
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,260
It was like this.

576
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,260
I have to put it in here.

577
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,260
So, why did you choose such a thick one?

578
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,260
It's like this.

579
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,140
It's a more

580
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,140
This is a good one.

581
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,140
This is not good.

582
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,140
This is a bad one.

583
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,140
This is a bad one.

584
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,140
Shio Para 2018

585
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:12,140
The bus that is familiar in the series of the child's user, you shouldn't laugh, is also going through a salt stop this year.

586
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,140
Can you stand the laughter of the victims?

587
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,140
We are waiting for you.

588
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,140
I'm sorry!

589
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,140
Let's announce the results.

590
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,140
Everyone, please look at the soil.

591
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,140
Please raise your hands.

592
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,140
This time, it's out.

593
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,140
Soil, soil, no, soil, no.

594
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,140
This time, we got three soils.

595
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,140
That's all.

596
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,140
It was Okura. Thank you very much.

597
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,140
Who got the land?

598
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,140
Who won?

599
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,140
I got 3 lands

600
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,140
Who got it?

601
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,140
I did

602
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,140
I got 6 lands

603
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,140
You got 2 lands?

604
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,140
If possible, I wanted 5 lands

605
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,140
I see

606
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,140
I'm sorry

607
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:11,140
I don't know if Yagaki-san said it in Kanji

608
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,140
But that was already decided from the beginning, right?

609
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:19,140
I wanted you to imagine it.

610
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,140
That's right.

611
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,140
I got a message from Mr. Kosei.

612
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,140
I imagined it, but that's all I have.

613
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:28,140
I wanted to see you guys worried about what to do.

614
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,140
Oh, really?

615
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,140
I'm sorry.

616
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,140
I'm the bad guy?

617
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Well...

618
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,140
Head.

619
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,140
Head?

620
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,140
That's...

621
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,140
You're a Russian love.

622
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,140
No, that's not it.

623
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,140
If you get fired...

624
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,140
I'm not fired.

625
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,140
But I don't know what will happen this time.

626
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,140
Again?

627
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,140
I think it will be fun.

628
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,140
Before that, everyone was excited.

629
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,140
Look this way and choose between Yazawa and me.

630
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,140
I'm 16 years old forever.

631
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,540
AHAHAHA
