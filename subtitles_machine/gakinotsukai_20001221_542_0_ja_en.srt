1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
On the night of the show, that man came to downtown to tell us that an unexpected visitor had arrived.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Excuse me.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Excuse me.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Could you tell us what you're looking forward to?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Could you tell us what you're looking forward to?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Please tell us.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Actually,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
a man came to downtown to tell us something.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Could you stay there for a moment?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Thank you.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Good morning.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Good morning.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Thank you for coming.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Thank you.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Last month,

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
the chief director of this show, who is said to have been a big fan of him, Toshihide Saito had a date with Jaguar whom he admires.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
At that time,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Heipo tried to make Jaguar his girlfriend.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
However,

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Jaguar, who is more skillful than him, had to go home.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I told you to wait.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Why is she here?

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Good morning.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What's the matter?

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I had a date with Saito.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I had a date with Saito.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, I see.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well,

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I feel like I'm stalking him.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Who is it?

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Is it Saito?

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I think so.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's not good.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Is that so?

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Well,

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
after the shoot,

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I accidentally exchanged my cell phone number.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So,

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
he kept calling me.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
At that time,

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I saw a black shadow.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
A black and small shadow.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I think it's small.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, I see.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What should I do?

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's call the police.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's right.

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's call the police.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But,

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I think it's better to ask him.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's right.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't like it.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't like it.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But,

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't like it.

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What do you mean?

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Do you like me?

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Do you like me?

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Well,

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I had a date with him.

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't like his appearance.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But,

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I think he is kind.

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I think he is kind.

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But,

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
if I have a stalking affair with him,

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I feel like I'm jealous of him.

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I see.

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So,

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I like strong men.

71
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I see.

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't like weak men.

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't like weak men.

74
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Thank you.

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Good morning.

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He's here.

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Good morning.

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Good timing.

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Good morning.

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Good morning.

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Heipo.

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes.

83
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Did you call Jaguar?

84
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes.

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I had a phone call with him.

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I had a phone call with him.

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So, I asked him to call me.

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's good.

89
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Did you go near his house?

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well,

91
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I thought he liked me.

92
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Did you have a stalking affair with him?

93
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You don't usually tell him your phone number, do you?

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No, no, no.

95
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No, no, no.

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Why did you give me a light wave?

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But,

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Jaguar,

99
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't think he doesn't like you.

100
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Really?

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
His attitude.

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
His attitude?

103
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He's like a stalker.

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Jaguar says that Heipo is not manly.

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's not true.

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He's quite manly.

107
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't care what you say.

108
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Jaguar likes strong men.

109
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes, he does.

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm able to protect him.

111
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes, yes, yes.

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
For example, there are many strange men.

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If Jaguar attacks them, I help him.

114
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's natural.

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's natural.

116
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's natural.

117
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He's so weak.

118
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What are you talking about?

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You know he's manly.

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't know.

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why do you say like that?

122
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's not manly.

123
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's not manly.

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
For example, Jaguar was a wrestler.

125
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
How about this?

126
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You two team up and fight with your opponent.

127
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's not true.

128
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I can do it.

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let's do it.

130
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I can do it.

131
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's fast.

132
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Leave it to me.

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Really?

134
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Really.

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll do it today.

136
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
For Ai.

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
For Jaguar.

138
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If you can protect him.

139
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'll definitely protect him.

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's right.

141
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll protect him.

142
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm not a sweet guy.

143
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's okay.

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It hurts.

145
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It hurts.

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm a lion.

147
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's okay.

148
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What is this?

149
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm a lion.

150
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Jaguar is a lion.

151
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What?

152
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're like a father.

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The next episode

154
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

155
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Finally, Heipo and Jaguar's tag match will begin.

156
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's starting.

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Is Toh's opponent, Heipo, okay?

158
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't think so.

159
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't think so.

160
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I have a chance to win.

161
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Heipo is confident and says he'll fight.

162
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But Ichido is worried about him.

163
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Will Heipo be okay?

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What are you doing?

165
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You don't have any strength.

166
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't have any strength.

167
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I just ate something that went through my throat.

168
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's coming up soon.

169
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Are you okay?

170
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's okay to stop.

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm a man among men.

172
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's a question of whether you can show your manliness.

173
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I think I can.

174
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I was born as a man.

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I have to protect women.

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I have to be a man before I become a director.

177
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're a man.

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes, I'm a man.

179
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,000
After this, Heipo talks about what a woman can do and the true strength of a man.

180
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Everyone listens to different Heipo.

181
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
A man can stand up to any woman he likes.

182
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Do you understand?

183
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Is that so?

184
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It seems so.

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's Heipo's opinion.

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It seems so.

187
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The alarm clock called love woke up my sleeping master.

188
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You're talking like a poet.

189
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
After that, Heipo continued to talk about what a man should be like.

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And...

191
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Today's main event, Heipo and Jaguar's love tag match.

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's a 60-minute one-on-one match.

193
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:39,000
From the red corner, Heipo and Jaguar enter to prove their love.

194
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll sing for my children.

195
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm Heipo.

196
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Next, from the blue corner, two mysterious wrestlers, Maskman Brothers enter.

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Is this okay?

198
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He seems to be strong.

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's open.

200
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He's strong.

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Really?

202
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Is this okay?

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,500
Let's go!

204
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
The first challenge!

205
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Go!

206
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Go, HENKO!

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,500
Kill him!

208
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
He's telling you to kill him!

209
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,000
What's wrong?

210
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What's wrong?

211
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
HENKO, show us something cool!

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What are you doing?

213
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,500
Hey!

214
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
What are you doing?

215
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
What are you doing?

216
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,000
Help me!

217
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Help me!

218
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
HENKO!

219
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Help me!

220
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Help me!

221
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What are you doing?

222
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What are you doing?

223
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If a man doesn't ask a woman for help,

224
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,500
he has to risk his life to protect her.

225
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:53,000
Eh?

226
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
HENKO!

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
HENKO!

228
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Let's go!

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
HENKO, let's go!

230
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
HENKO, let's go!

231
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Let's go!

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Touch me!

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What are you doing?

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's go!

235
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Let's go!

236
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,500
What are you doing?

237
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
You can do it!

238
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Help me!

239
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Help me!

240
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
What are you doing?

241
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Don't mess with me!

242
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Don't mess with me!

243
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Heipo!

244
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Chaga-san, you're in trouble.

245
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Don't mess with me!

246
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Don't mess with me!

247
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
Heipo, go!

248
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Don't mess with me!

249
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
What are you doing?

250
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Heipo, grab his neck!

251
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,500
The character for man is the character for power.

252
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
It's not a man without power.

253
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Don't you know that?

254
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Heipo, grab his back!

255
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Heipo, grab his back!

256
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Heipo, grab his back!

257
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Heipo, touch his back!

258
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Heipo, touch his back!

259
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Heipo, get it!

260
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Go!

261
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Do it!

262
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Do it!

263
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Do it!

264
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
You're not helping Chaga!

265
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Heipo!

266
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Ah!

267
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Now!

268
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Now!

269
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Give back the A-line ball!

270
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
That's a new one!

271
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Give it back!

272
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Give it back!

273
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Give it back!

274
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Give it back!

275
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
What are you doing?

276
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
That's bad!

277
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Go! Take it!

278
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
What are you doing?

279
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
What are you doing?

280
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,500
What are you doing?

281
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Go! Go!

282
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
It's coming!

283
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
What are you doing?

284
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Give me the A-line ball!

285
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,500
What are you doing?

286
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Men are usually good-for-nothings.

287
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Even if you're a loser,

288
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,500
if you shine a golden light

289
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
when you're in trouble,

290
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
that's good enough.

291
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
What are you doing?

292
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Give it back!

293
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Give it back!

294
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Give it back!

295
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Give it back!

296
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Give it back!

297
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Give it back!

298
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Give it back!

299
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Give it back!

300
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Give it back!

301
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Give it back!

302
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Give it back!

303
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
Give it back!

304
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
Help!

305
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Give it back!

306
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Turn it more!

307
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Turn it more!

308
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Turn the back side more!

309
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Help!

310
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Turn the back side more!

311
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
That's scary!

312
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
That's bad!

313
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
A-line ball!

314
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
A-line ball!

315
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Now's the chance!

316
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,500
A-line ball!

317
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,500
Chance!

318
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
Chance!

319
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
You only have one chance!

320
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
A-line ball!

321
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
What was that?

322
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
A-line ball!

323
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
A-line ball!

324
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Are you okay?

325
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,500
Aren't you supposed to protect me?

326
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
I love you!

327
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
I love you!

328
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
I love you!

329
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
I love you!

330
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
I love you!

331
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I love you!

332
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
I love you!

333
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,500
I love you!

334
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
I love you!

335
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
What's wrong with him?

336
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
I'm sorry!

337
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
You're going home?

338
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I'm sorry I'm sorry!

339
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Let's go!

340
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
He's mad.

341
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
What is it?

342
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
You're strong!

343
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Strong?

344
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
I'm strong?

345
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
What's your reason for it?

346
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
I ate too much.

347
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
You ate too much!

348
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Hey, hey, it's already over!

349
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Don't fall in love with me!

350
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:04,500
I'm Hamada's, I'm Hamada's, I'm Hamada's earring!

351
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,500
I'm going to be the wind!

352
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
I saw something interesting yesterday.

353
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
What did you see?

354
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
It's hard to watch.

355
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,500
I was driving around Meiji-dori, Shibuya.

356
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
A fire truck came.

357
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,500
It came like this.

358
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,500
I think the fire truck was in front of the big camera.

359
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,500
I wanted to make a U-turn around there.

360
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,500
It's big, so I can't make a U-turn.

361
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,500
A young fire truck came down.

362
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,500
From top to bottom, it was silver.

363
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
It was a big fire truck.

364
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,500
The fire truck came down and I couldn't make a U-turn, so I had to back up.

365
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
But I was in a hurry because it was a fire.

366
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
I had to do it quickly.

367
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,500
I backed up and went like this.

368
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
I was left behind.

369
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
No way!

370
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I don't know what to do with that young fire truck.

371
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,500
What are you doing?

372
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
I can't watch it forever.

373
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,500
I went, but I felt sorry for it.

374
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,500
No matter how much I think about it, it was chasing me.

375
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,500
That was a game of Senna-Mitsuho.

376
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,500
I was left behind in that outfit.

377
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,500
It was because there was a fire truck.

378
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,500
I thought it would be fun, so I went.

379
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
You knew the scene.

380
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
I knew the scene.

381
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
You came later.

382
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Please forgive me.

383
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,500
I think it was because of that.

384
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,500
I did it.

385
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
How was it?

386
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,500
How was this winter?

387
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
This winter?

388
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
It's delicious.

389
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,500
I know Shionoo.

390
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Do you know him?

391
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Yes, I know him.

392
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,500
He's a bit like this.

393
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,500
I heard you can't watch TV.

394
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
My TV?

395
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
No, a man's TV.

396
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,500
It's like this.

397
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
That's ridiculous.

398
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
There was a big guy.

399
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
I said, look, look.

400
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,500
He said, no, I'm fine.

401
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
I was watching.

402
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Everyone was chasing him.

403
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
He said, it's okay.

404
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,500
He ran away like this.

405
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Really?

406
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
It's not like that.

407
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
I went to Disneyland.

408
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
It's amazing.

409
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Have you been there recently?

410
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
I haven't.

411
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,500
It's fun.

412
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
It's fun.

413
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Did you go there?

414
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Honey.

415
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
It's called Honey Hunt.

416
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Honey Hunt?

417
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
It's called Honey Hunt.

418
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
It's Pooh's.

419
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,500
It's so much fun.

420
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,500
It's so much fun.

421
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:21,500
I love honey.

422
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,500
That's right.

423
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
I don't think so.

424
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
It's fun.

425
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,500
It's better to have kids.

426
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
They'll be happy.

427
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,500
It's like this.

428
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
I'm shaking a little.

429
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,500
It's a lot of fun.

430
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,500
You're shaking a lot.

431
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,500
You said you had a fan for 380,000 yen in your house.

432
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
I said that.

433
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Rumor has it that you have a kotatsu for 380,000 yen.

434
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
What kind of kotatsu is it?

435
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Do you want to hear this?

436
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
I want to hear that.

437
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
I've never seen a kotatsu for 380,000 yen.

438
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,500
What do you think it is?

439
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Is it that?

440
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Is that the feature of the heater?

441
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Final answer?

442
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Final answer?

443
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
No!

444
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Really?

445
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Ouch!

446
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,500
100,000 yen.

447
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,500
I don't usually buy a kotatsu for 380,000 yen.

448
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
I don't buy it.

449
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,500
I have a kotatsu for 380,000 yen.

450
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Where is it?

451
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
I don't have one or two.

452
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
I have a few.

453
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Please tell me the feature.

454
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
What?

455
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Feature?

456
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
What?

457
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,500
First of all, the kotatsu futon.

458
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,500
You can see the legs, right?

459
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Wait a minute.

460
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
It's sexy.

461
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
It's not enough.

462
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:09,500
You can buy a kotatsu for 380,000 yen.

463
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Why?

464
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Why?

465
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:19,500
When I want to play the trumpet, I scream.

466
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,500
I scream at the green futon on the back.

467
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
It's an old kotatsu.

468
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,500
It's green on the back.

469
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Trump is a king.

470
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:39,500
If I don't say anything, I scream.

471
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
I scream at the old man.

472
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,500
You look like you grew up in the wild.

473
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:54,500
How do you grow up if you raise a giraffe like a human child?

474
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:00,500
If you grow up to a certain extent, you will realize.

475
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
What is good?

476
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,500
I'm a giraffe.

477
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
What do you do if you find out?

478
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,500
If I find out, I pretend not to be a giraffe.

479
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
What do you do?

480
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,500
What is wrong with the decision?

481
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,500
It's like this.

482
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,500
The child next door is like this.

483
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
I try to do something about it first.

484
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:35,500
I always tell my friends to do this.

485
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,500
The moment this is separated, it's like this.

486
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,500
I can do something about it.

487
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,500
The problem is this.

488
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
It's definitely different.

489
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:57,500
When I take a picture with everyone in class, I feel like I'm taking a break even though I'm wearing it.

490
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Is it a problem of wearing it?

491
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,500
Is everyone accepting it?

492
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Let's accept it somehow.

493
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,500
I think the language barrier will be solved.

494
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Will it be solved?

495
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Yes.

496
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,500
Just a giraffe on the trash.

497
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,500
No matter what you say.

498
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
But only this wall.

499
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
It's difficult.

500
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,500
I have to do something about it.

501
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Can't you solve it?

502
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,500
It will be solved by making an effort.

503
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
I don't know how to do that.

504
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,500
But it's basically impossible to make a long neck short.

505
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,500
But I can't do that.

506
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,500
So I think about it.

507
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,500
I think about wearing it.

508
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
What do you mean?

509
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,500
I'm going to roll it.

510
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
The neck?

511
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
The neck.

512
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
I'm going to roll it.

513
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I'm going to completely roll it.

514
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,500
If I roll it again, I can make a big roll.

515
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
I know.

516
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
I'm going to make a few more of them.

517
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:10,500
The neck will be very short, but the weakness of this will be a little sideways.

518
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,500
That's a little creepy.

519
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
It's creepy.

520
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,500
If I think about it, I'm going to put a vertical line in this long neck.

521
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,500
And then I'm going to do it.

522
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,500
It's like konjac.

523
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:35,500
And the weakness of this is that it's facing the other side.

524
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
That's pitiful.

525
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
I can't help it.

526
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
What?

527
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
I can't help it.

528
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,500
And if that's solved, there's this.

529
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
I can't help it.

530
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,500
I'll say it when I feel like I have to stand up.

531
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,500
What do you mean?

532
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Someone.

533
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
When you feel like you have to stand up?

534
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
It's like this.

535
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,500
I'm going to do it like this.

536
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Basically, you're a teacher.

537
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
I can't help it.

538
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
I can't help it even if I'm a teacher.

539
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,500
I can't help it if I have a lot of friends.

540
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500
I know.

541
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
I can't help it.

542
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
It's pitiful.

543
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,500
I can't help it.

544
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Don't be depressed.

545
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,500
You don't have to be depressed.

546
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
It's pitiful.

547
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,500
It's pitiful if you look at it silently.

548
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
I can't help it.

549
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,500
What are you trying to do?

550
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
I can't help it.

551
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
What are you trying to do?

552
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Can't you reverse it?

553
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,500
I can't help it.

554
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Do you want to do it like this?

555
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,500
What are you doing?

556
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
What are you doing?

557
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
I'm swinging it.

558
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
Do you want to do it like this?

559
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
There's a hook here.

560
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:00,500
I'm going to hang this on the hook here.

561
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Put your face up here.

562
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,500
No one's coming.

563
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:13,500
If you cut it here, it'll blow up.
