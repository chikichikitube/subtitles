1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We're going to do a little boy's play.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Sarai-

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't know what's going on.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's my first time doing this.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Thank you very much.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Thank you very much.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This kid is the best.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The yellow is glittering in my eyes.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The staff's t-shirt is cool.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thank you very much.

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thank you very much.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Good evening.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Good evening.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's already started.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sleepy.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
All of a sudden?

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's already started.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If I get tired on the way, I think I'll eat gum and change to the wind.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's finally starting.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's a 24-hour TV show, but it's actually a 25-hour show.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you put in the rehearsal, it'll be about 32 hours.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's nice to sing in a big way.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm going to cry.

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm going to cry.

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm going to cry.

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Thank you very much.

27
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Thank you very much.

28
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Thank you very much.

29
00:04:32,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Thank you very much.

30
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Thank you very much.

31
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Thank you very much.

32
00:05:41,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Thank you very much.

33
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Thank you very much.

34
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Thank you very much.

35
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Did you sleep?

36
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm a little sleepy.

37
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Why?

38
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Who? Your friend?

39
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Who?

40
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Your friend?

41
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm a little sleepy.

42
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
My friend, take only half of it.

43
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't think there's any more.

44
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Thank you very much.

45
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thank you very much.

46
00:07:42,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I just went to Osaka.

47
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm going to cry.

48
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Thank you very much.

49
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you very much.

50
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Thank you very much.

51
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Thank you very much.

52
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Thank you very much.

53
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Thank you very much.

54
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Thank you very much.

55
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Thank you very much.

56
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Thank you very much.

57
00:10:47,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Thank you very much.

58
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Thank you very much.

59
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Thank you very much.

60
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Thank you very much.

61
00:11:46,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Thank you very much.

62
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Those who are watching this TV, you can think of the previous story, but this is yesterday's today, right?

63
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Normally, we rest. Normally, we rest.

64
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Nittere, too.

65
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It was Okada-san.

66
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's true.

67
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Well, there is a musical instrument tomorrow, but let's stop it.

68
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Let's stop it.

69
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's like a famous scene.

70
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's like a famous scene of a musical instrument until now.

71
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Please!

72
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's like an end-of-life story.

73
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Hey!

74
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Normally, we do it.

75
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We do, we do, we do.

76
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Then, I'll be waiting for you tomorrow.

77
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No, but, Hamada-kun.

78
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What?

79
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You are a touching father, aren't you?

80
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Well, I usually do it with a needle and a needle, but in the end, it's just the face on the outside, and the inside is a gentle voice.

81
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Really? What are you talking about?

82
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What are you doing?

83
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's not coming out.

84
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That's right.

85
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
When I was reading the text, it was coming out.

86
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No, it's not that it's coming out.

87
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Well, I didn't have anything, did I?

88
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You were like a sparkling thing.

89
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Hey!

90
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Ah! Don't lie to me!

91
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Ah!

92
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You were a dirty person.

93
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What are you talking about? You were crying.

94
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What are you talking about?

95
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You were crying.

96
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Ah!

97
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Don't lie to me!

98
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Well, you can put it in the editing room while I'm talking.

99
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This 24-hour crying scene.

100
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Let's take a look.

101
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Why?

102
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
A Cambodian child is chasing a paper airplane.

103
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Right?

104
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What are you talking about?

105
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Ah!

106
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Finally, I found love.

107
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What are you talking about?

108
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I didn't want to see you.

109
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I probably knew you were crying.

110
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I was doing this, but I thought I should take a look at it.

111
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
When I looked at it, you were wearing it.

112
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's not coming out.

113
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Really?

114
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What are you talking about?

115
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's why Fax is wearing it.

116
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I was impressed when Fax was wearing it and Mr. Kusada was calling him.

117
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's called downtown tears.

118
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
At that time, I was surprised.

119
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What?

120
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Hitoshi?

121
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Hitoshi wasn't crying.

122
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You're asking yourself.

123
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Hitoshi was crying?

124
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hitoshi wasn't crying.

125
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Hitoshi wasn't crying.

126
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But it's related to downtown tears.

127
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Ah!

128
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Masatoshi.

129
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Masatoshi.

130
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
There were a lot of moving VTRs.

131
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Tokumitsu and Mr. Kusada and me.

132
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's okay to sit down and rest.

133
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But I was looking at the monitor.

134
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You were the only one who said,

135
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Tenmusu!

136
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Two minutes ago, you said,

137
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Ah!

138
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Even if you didn't watch the VTRs, you said,

139
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Tenmusu!

140
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You were crying in the end.

141
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's okay to eat something in between.

142
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's because you're going to fall.

143
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's right.

144
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You were sleeping.

145
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
In the back.

146
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Don't say bad things about people.

147
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
When everyone stood up and said,

148
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You were like this in the back.

149
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Ah!

150
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Tenmusu!

151
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
How many times did you come before?

152
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I just went into energy while watching the VTR.

153
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't know anything about other programs.

154
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Really?

155
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's true.

156
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Why?

157
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Didn't you take a break once?

158
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
One hour.

159
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
About an hour.

160
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
When I went to the broadcast.

161
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's right.

162
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
There was about an hour at that time.

163
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I took a shower here.

164
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That's right.

165
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I can't.

166
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I have to change my pants.

167
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Did you poop in your pants?

168
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't want to poop in my pants.

169
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Are you stupid?

170
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You woke up 24 hours ago.

171
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You were wearing your pants like that.

172
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
How many people did you poop in your pants?

173
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I can't.

174
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I can't.

175
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I didn't poop once that day.

176
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Why didn't you poop?

177
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Toku-san said,

178
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I can't poop at all.

179
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm hungry.

180
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I feel bad.

181
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Did you poop in the meantime?

182
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I pooped twice.

183
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What?

184
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Is that so?

185
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's right.

186
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't know if it's because of that.

187
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I didn't poop.

188
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I took a shower.

189
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I sat on the chair.

190
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What do you call it?

191
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I had my eyes closed.

192
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You pooped a lot.

193
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You pooped so much that the ectoplasm came out.

194
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Why?

195
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The white one.

196
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I pooped.

197
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I closed my eyes.

198
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I looked back from the opening quietly.

199
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Liar!

200
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Godne-chan called me again.

201
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
After that?

202
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Alien called me yesterday.

203
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I was doing it.

204
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Alien called me.

205
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's right.

206
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's true.

207
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I was in the middle of it.

208
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Good evening.

209
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I had a question.

210
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Why do you call an ant an ant and make it poop?

211
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's just an ant.

212
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's okay to be an ant.

213
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Do you have an attachment to ants?

214
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Even if you have an attachment, why are you pooping?

215
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't have an attachment to ants.

216
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Is that so?

217
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Didn't you poop when you were walking?

218
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Why are you walking?

219
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You didn't poop, did you?

220
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I didn't.

221
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You're just walking an ant.

222
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I didn't do that.

223
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
When you were a kid, you played with ants and pooped.

224
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I've never done that.

225
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You did when you were a kid.

226
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I feel sorry for you.

227
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There was a sparrow in front of my house.

228
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The sparrow caught the sparrow and hurt its leg.

229
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The sparrow was able to fly for a few days at home.

230
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The sparrow returned the sparrow to the sparrow.

231
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You're noisy.

232
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm a bad guy.

233
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I think you two are famous entertainers.

234
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I have a question.

235
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
There is a drug called FINISH.

236
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Why are you laughing?

237
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Are you really a singer?

238
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm a singer.

239
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Please tell me what you're singing with your name.

240
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That's true.

241
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I don't know what you're singing.

242
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
My name is Koganezawa-kun.

243
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Why don't you have to be Koganezawa-kun for the promotion of FINISH?

244
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Why don't you have to be Koganezawa-kun?

245
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Why are you Koganezawa-kun?

246
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's a business that uses the throat.

247
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's a business that uses the throat.

248
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's not an excuse for anyone.

249
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I want to know how old you are and what you're singing.

250
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That's right.

251
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Do you have a trust relationship with Machan and Amachan?

252
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
My school teacher said that if you trust each other, you should be able to say the shortcomings of each other.

253
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
In a sense, the fact that you can say that much means that you have a trust relationship.

254
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Is that so?

255
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That's what it means.

256
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Is that so?

257
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:27,000
In that sense, you can say it because you trust each other, and the person who says it will not be angry.

258
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Is that so?

259
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Do you have such a broad mind?

260
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I don't know that.

261
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You won't know until you try it.

262
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't think I have 10 shortcomings.

263
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
For example, let's do it one by one.

264
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,000
My lips are thick and disgusting.

265
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Wait a minute.

266
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That's a shortcoming.

267
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That's a shortcoming.

268
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Do you have such a thing?

269
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:10,000
My lips are thick and disgusting.

270
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I've been with you for more than 10 years, and I've had a lot of feelings for you.

271
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What kind of shortcomings do you have?

272
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That's a shortcoming.

273
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You have to say it.

274
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I don't like this part.

275
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Are you angry?

276
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's not true.

277
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You won't know until you say it.

278
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Your lips are disgusting.

279
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't like this part.

280
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What is this?

281
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's disgusting.

282
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's disgusting compared to Akira.

283
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What is this?

284
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
That's a shortcoming.
