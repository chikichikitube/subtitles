1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The opening is not interesting.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Next time, we will go to the supermarket again!

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Once upon a time, on a Sunday, there was a supermarket.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Some stupid staff was doing it.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we decided to do it again.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The rule is simple.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In two minutes, we will run around the supermarket.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We will put more and more cinnamon.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In the end, the person who puts the highest amount of cinnamon wins.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
How many of the same things are not allowed?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Up to five.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You can put up to five things.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Wait a minute.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's not funny.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There is a champion game.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
In the champion game, there are four questions.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
For example, if you think the answer is cheese, you go to the cheese store.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You go to the cheese store and look for it.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There is a question written on the back.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There are four questions, so you look for it and go around.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In the end, there is a million yen on the back.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Wait a minute.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's not funny.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In the champion game, there are four questions.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
In the champion game, there are four questions.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's go to the champion game.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You are slow.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There are only two minutes left.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's run around and come back here.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's go.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Are you ready?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Is it okay to do such a thing?

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Run around and come back here.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If you run out of battery, you can't run.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
30 seconds have passed.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I can't run anymore.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Is it okay to do this?

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I can't run anymore.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Thank you very much.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
One minute has passed.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Do you use that?

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Are you going to the swimming pool?

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Are you going to the pool?

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
30 seconds have passed.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
30 seconds have passed.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I can't run anymore.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I can't run anymore.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I was defeated.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I can't run anymore.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I can't run anymore.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
OK.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I didn't do anything.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Good luck.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
OK.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can't run anymore.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I can't run anymore.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I can't run anymore.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
2 melons.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
OK.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I was defeated.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The time has passed.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
OK.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
10 minutes have passed.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
10 minutes have passed.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
10 minutes have passed.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
OK.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
30 seconds have passed.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
30 seconds have passed.

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I can't run anymore.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I want to win.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I can't do it.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
10 seconds left.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
9, 8, 7, 6, 5 seconds left.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
5 seconds left.

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
3, 2, 1.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I can't do it.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yamazaki can't do it at all.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yamazaki is a little angry.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Announcement of the results.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Both teams did their best.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The results are everything.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's announce it.

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Koma-chan's team has a total of 68,544 yen.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Mach-chan's team has a total of 99,141 yen.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The champion team is Mach-chan's team.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I did it.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Now it's Mach-chan's team's turn.

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's the champion game.

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Are you ready?

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The final prize is 100,000 yen.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Can I borrow it?

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's 100,000 yen.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Really?

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll take it.

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Here you are.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Here's the question.

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What are the 10 legs of an octopus living in the sea?

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Ready.

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Squid.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This way.

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No, this way.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Squid.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Where?

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This is it.

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What is it?

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Squid.

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Squid.

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Squid.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's not a squid.

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not a squid.

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Squid.

118
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Squid.

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Squid.

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Squid.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Squid.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
There it is.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's white and thin.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
30 seconds have passed.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
30 seconds have passed.

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
There's no time left.

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
40 seconds have passed.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What is this?

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This is difficult.

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I can't do it anymore.

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I can't do it anymore.

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's not a margarine.

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's not a margarine.

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Here it is.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Here it is.

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Here it is.

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
5 seconds left.

138
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
4.

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
3.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
2.

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
1.

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Which one was it?

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I can't do this.

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Well done.

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Well done.

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Hello.

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hello.

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Hello.

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Today is your last day of work.

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You look cool.

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You look cool.

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Isn't it good?

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
My stomach is growing.

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's growing a little.

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's growing a little.

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's great.

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
My stomach is growing.

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No, I'm not. I don't sleep that much.

160
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Your eyes are dirty.

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
My eyes are dirty, but it doesn't mean that I sleep too much.

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Why is that?

163
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
My eyes are dirty too.

164
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh!

165
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm wearing double.

166
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're wearing double?

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I can't sleep.

168
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You can't sleep that much.

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Why?

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well...

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Because we're f*****g close.

172
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm really young.

173
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You should have said sorry.

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You should have said sorry.

175
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What are you doing? Are you rolling?

177
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm rolling.

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's not like that. It's a kind of occupational disease.

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What?

180
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's a kind of talent.

181
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Do you know what talent is?

182
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Well, kind of.

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're lying.

184
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's not as easy as you think.

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
For example, you think you're coming out without thinking, right?

186
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You have to change your clothes after you go in.

187
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You have to go on TV, so you have to wear a proper outfit.

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And you're wearing makeup.

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I want to draw my eyebrows.

190
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's ugly when it's shiny, so you have to press it with powder.

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And you come out, right?

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Your eyes are coming this way, right?

193
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The light is shining.

194
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's ugly.

195
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why?

196
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Well, it's just an example.

197
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's a kind of talent comedy.

198
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's you.

199
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's you.

200
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's just an example.

201
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I just happened to be in that kind of place.

202
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You're going to come out again, right?

203
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's a kind of stress.

204
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't know if I'm going to be Jiro.

205
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's right.

206
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's the most painful thing in the world.

207
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But I don't know if I'm going to be Jiro.

208
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I've been there.

209
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's a stomach ulcer.

210
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's hard poop, so it hurts.

211
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
No, no, no, no, no.

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
There's a stomach ulcer next to the eardrum.

213
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What?

214
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What?

215
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's a stomach ulcer next to the eardrum.

216
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's coming out from the inside.

217
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
In my case, there's a stomach ulcer next to the eardrum.

218
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I can only poop once, so I can't do that.

219
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Well, that's what I was saying.

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I was saying that, too.

221
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's a stomach ulcer.

222
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
No, I didn't take it.

223
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I didn't take it.

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's why I put it on after taking a bath.

225
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But it's a disaster.

226
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
After taking a bath,

227
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Like this.

228
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Like this.

229
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I hold a mirror in my hand.

230
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I do this.

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And then I put it on like this.

232
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No, really.

233
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm going to wake up from last year's love.

234
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
If you do something like this.

235
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's hard, but what's the hardest thing?

236
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm having a headache right now.

237
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't feel like talking.

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Well, I'm going to get better, too.

239
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's not a headache, it's a stomach ulcer.

240
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Well, it's a stomach ulcer.

241
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There's a stomach ulcer.

242
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Everyone says it's funny.

243
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
My stomach hurts so much.

244
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
My stomach hurts.

245
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It hurts so much.

246
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But doesn't it feel good?

247
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
How do you feel?

248
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It hurts so much.

249
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
When I'm having a stomach ulcer,

250
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It hurts so much that I feel good.

251
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm sorry, I don't.

252
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No, no, no.

253
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You don't understand.

254
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It hurts so much.

255
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It hurts so much.

256
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It doesn't feel good.

257
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What are you talking about?

258
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're the only one who's talking.

259
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're the only one who's talking.

260
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll tell you in detail.

261
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
My stomach hurts so much.

262
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It hurts so much.

263
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It hurts so much.

264
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It doesn't feel good.

265
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's why I'm telling you.

266
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
When I have a stomach ulcer,

267
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I feel good for a moment.

268
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So I can get over it.

269
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Pain.

270
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Same as that.

271
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
My stomach hurts.

272
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
My stomach hurts halfway.

273
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But when it gets to the extreme,

274
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It feels good.

275
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It hurts so much.

276
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It doesn't feel good.

277
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We're still in the middle.

278
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It hurts so much.

279
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It feels good when I get over it.

280
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I've been there for a while.

281
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's already tearing up.

282
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Can you stand it?

283
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Is it more painful than that?

284
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I can stand it.

285
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
When I was a kid, I had a hard time.

286
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's hard, but it hurts so much.

287
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's getting better and better.

288
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't think it feels good.

289
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It hurts even if it's pinched.

290
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But when I get over it,

291
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's getting softer and softer.

292
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What?

293
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Even if it's pinched?

294
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Even if it's pinched, it hurts at first.

295
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
When I get over it,

296
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's getting softer and softer.

297
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Really?

298
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You're lying.

299
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's just a pinch.

300
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's fast.

301
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You're lying.

302
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's not true.

303
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It doesn't hurt that much.

304
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Let's get out of here as soon as possible.

305
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That's enough.

306
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What do you think?

307
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What are you talking about?

308
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What do you think?

309
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't know what to say.

310
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I haven't seen yesterday's broadcast.

311
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I've been saying a lot.

312
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yesterday's broadcast?

313
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The arrow is over there.

314
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That's before I got caught.

315
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I heard you got caught.

316
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I got caught.

317
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I got caught.

318
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It wasn't just an arrow.

319
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What was it?

320
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Three steps?

321
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Why are you so strong?

322
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
There are two bullets in the gun, right?

323
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's soft, isn't it?

324
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Why are you flying like this?

325
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's weird.

326
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's definitely weird.

327
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's why.

328
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
As I said earlier,

329
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It was in a good way.

330
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It was in a good way.

331
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The bullet, too.

332
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If it's a little off,

333
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's gone.

334
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Someone shot it somewhere, didn't they?

335
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I think so.

336
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I've been saying that for a long time.

337
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I've been saying it, so it's here.

338
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Well, well, well.

339
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's me.

340
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's me.

341
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's me.

342
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Who is it?

343
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You have a nice voice.

344
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's me.

345
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's a big bottle of miso.

346
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's too sticky.

347
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's been a long time.

348
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's been a long time.

349
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's too sticky.

350
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm tired.

351
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Good luck with your work this year, too.

353
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
By the way, I was curious about it the other day.

354
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
After the trial,

355
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
There's a man who comes out of the courtroom with a paper that says he's a criminal.

356
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Where did he go after he left the door?

357
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I didn't go out.

358
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I didn't leave the door.

359
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm here to show it to the person waiting in front of me.

360
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm here.

362
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Have you ever seen the end?

363
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The guy who went like this.

364
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
There is.

365
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
How is it?

366
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's wrapped.

367
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't do that.

368
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Have you ever seen it?

369
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I haven't seen it.

370
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I've seen it.

371
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I saw it on the news.

372
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's wrapped in ink.

373
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:57,000
There's a production like that.

374
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There's such a thing.

375
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
There is.

376
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I didn't know that.

377
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
There is.

378
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Is it dispatched?

379
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's dispatched.

380
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm going to show it to everyone with a paper that says he's a criminal.

381
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm going to go to the office anyway.

382
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll say, thank you for your hard work.

383
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No, no, no.

384
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There's a lot of distance from there to the office.

385
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
There's a lot of distance.

386
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'll give it to someone who doesn't care at all.

387
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'll do it anyway.

388
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll go home and get a drink.

389
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Who are you looking at?

390
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm the master.

391
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh, my.

392
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
There's a master.

393
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The story's getting bigger.

394
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There's a master.

395
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'll say, thank you for your hard work.

396
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That master.

397
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That master has been doing it since the very beginning.

398
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's right.

399
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's called a trial master.

400
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
His name is already a trial master.

401
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll say, thank you for your hard work.

402
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
In the dressing room.

403
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Where are you going to the dressing room?

404
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's where they are.

405
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's your office, isn't it?

406
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's right.

407
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
There are a lot of older brothers and sisters.

408
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
There are a lot of older brothers and sisters.

409
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The next turn is in front of the mirror.

410
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What's that?

411
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The next turn is the older sister.

412
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The older sister is doing makeup.

413
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The woman is also doing makeup.

414
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The older sister is saying, how was the customer?

415
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Hey, hey.

416
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Please come next time.

417
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That's it.

418
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
That's it.

419
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
There's a place where I have to take it.

420
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's right.

421
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's right.

422
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And then the older sister came out.

423
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's what it's like.

424
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's like a day trial.

425
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's right.

426
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Why do you use a bath or a pool for a long time?

427
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
When you soak in water for a long time, your hands, fingers, and soles of your feet become wrinkled.

428
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I see.

429
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
When you use a bath for a long time, your feet become wrinkled.

430
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You get used to it, don't you?

431
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You get used to it, don't you?

432
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yes, yes, yes.

433
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Why is that?

434
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Hmm.

435
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Well, actually, I think everyone has had an experience.

436
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
For example, a float or something like that.

437
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What?

438
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
A float or something like that.

439
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yes, yes, yes.

440
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
When you first use this, it's good, isn't it?

441
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes.

442
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And it's like, wha!

443
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's like this.

444
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Where is the foam coming out?

445
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
No, it's not coming out.

446
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Huh?

447
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's a big float, isn't it?

448
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Who is it?

449
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
No, no, no, for example, it can be anyone.

450
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's a big float, isn't it?

451
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So imagine a big float.

452
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And then you put it in the bath, right?

453
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:31,000
When the mouth part is like this, it goes like this.

454
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And the mouth part goes like this.

455
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And then it goes like this.

456
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Two or three days ago, I found a mole sticking out.

457
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What is it doing in the mole?

458
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Look at this.

459
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Is it coming out?

460
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The animals also come out by themselves.

461
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What does that mean?

462
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
We have a world.

463
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's in the soil.

464
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
There is a town in the mole.

465
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
There is a town in the mole.

466
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
There are bullying issues in the mole society.

467
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The mole that wants to die also comes out.

468
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
When humans die, they commit suicide by gas or by hanging themselves.

469
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They jump off.

470
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
In the case of the mole, it is suicide to come out on the ground.

471
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Is that so?

472
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You don't die because you came out, do you?

473
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If you come out, you die.

474
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
There is a picture like this.

475
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What is that?

476
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's a picture.

477
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
No, it's a video.

478
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What is it?

479
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's like coming out of a hole.

480
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The mole is sticking out a little.

481
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What does that mean?

482
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
When humans die, they stand on top of a building.

483
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
If you fall from here, you die.

484
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That's the picture.

485
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's coming out, isn't it?

486
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It only looks like we're showing our faces.

487
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:37,000
In the back, there are police officers with glasses.

488
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Don't apologize!

489
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm telling you not to apologize!

490
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The name is a mole.

491
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm telling you not to apologize!

492
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's like this.

493
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Don't come! If you come out, you'll come out!

494
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
If you come any closer, I'll come out!

495
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Stop it! Stop it, mole!

496
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's like this!

497
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I know.

498
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I know.

499
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
There is such a world in the mole.

500
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I see.

501
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What is the last foreign language of Cecil's commercial?

502
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's a language that expresses love and trust.

503
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Is that what you're saying?

504
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's right.

505
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I see.

506
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Thank you.

507
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's a language that expresses love and trust.

508
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I see.

509
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
This girl calls me Kinoshita-kun Seisho Nagon.

510
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
She calls me Kinoshita-kun Seisho Nagon.

511
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
She calls me Kinoshita-kun Seisho Nagon.

512
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
She doesn't say it. She can't speak Japanese.

513
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What does she say?

514
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
She says that it expresses love and trust.

515
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
She says Cecil?

516
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
She says that in French, right?

517
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What does she say in French?

518
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I don't understand.

519
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Don't make me laugh.

520
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You have to understand that.

521
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It doesn't make sense.

522
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I was also interested in Cecil.

523
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
She says Cecil Hion Sosolomon Sasolomon.

524
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Say it again.

525
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
She says Hion Sosolomon Sasolomon.

526
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I see.

527
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
There's no doubt about that.

528
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Does that make sense?

529
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It doesn't make sense.

530
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

531
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That's what she says in Japanese.

532
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
There's no Japanese or any other language.

533
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's French.

534
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's not French.

535
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
She says Cecil Hion Sosolomon Sasolomon.

536
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So what language is that?

537
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's not a language.

538
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
She says Hion Sosolomon Sasolomon.

539
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So what does that mean?

540
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It doesn't make sense.

541
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What language is that?

542
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's not a language.

543
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You're Chimaki Joe.

544
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I understand.

545
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I understand what you're trying to say.

546
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But I want people watching TV to listen to what you're trying to say.

547
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I want them to think you're trying to do your best.

548
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I understand what you're trying to say.

549
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But I don't want people to think you're trying to say that you can speak Japanese.

550
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's right.

551
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
That's right.
