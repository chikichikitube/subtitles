1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Next time, we will install a cooler in Kokoriko Endo's room.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's hot.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm suddenly excited.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's close.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's hot.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's hot.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's hot.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But there's no cooler in his room.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Tanaka doesn't have it.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I had a cooler in the apartment.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Originally?

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Originally.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But there's a hairball on it.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is not good.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There's a hairball on it.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't use it.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I can't use it.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's not true.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's okay.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'll take it off for now.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's a mistake.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And then we all said,

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is kind of us.

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Really.

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'll give you a cooler.

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's for that.

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And it's by hand.

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's like this.

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's cool.

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And this is type A.

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What's type A?

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's type B.

33
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's type A.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's so hot.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Good morning.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Good morning.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're sweating.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Why are you sweating so much?

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:42,220
Popular

40
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,000
So this time I'm going to install a cooler in Endo's room.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm here for you.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There's no cooler in this room.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
There's no cooler.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Look at this.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's a big cooler.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Put it on for me.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Really?

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Really?

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We'll put it on.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Thank you very much.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Shall we go in?

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Can you put it on for me?

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's so hot.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's so hot.

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This is a joke.

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
There's no cooler.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's narrow.

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's thin.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's hot.

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is the outside.

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's hot.

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If you get a call, I'll open the drawer and touch it.

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll do it.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll do it.

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll do it.

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Really?

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I can't help it.

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's do it.

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Wait for me at the cafe in the neighborhood.

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
May I?

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Sure.

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
There's no cooler in this room.

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Really?

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Thank you very much.

76
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thank you very much.

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let's put the blanket on.

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Shall we move this?

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There's a lot of dust.

81
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Endo is grateful for his seniors' hard work.

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's fast if four men work together.

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We can do it, right?

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We can do it.

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We can do it.

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's right.

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I can't get it on camera.

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can't get it on camera.

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I can't get it on camera.

90
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay.

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay.

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's done.

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Tanaka, call him.

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay.

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Tell him I'm here.

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay.

97
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Tell him it was hard.

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay.

99
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I should have let Endo do the first one.

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's right.

101
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's right.

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I did it.

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Really?

104
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I did it.

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Really?

106
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm a senior now.

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm serious.

109
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I finally did it.

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Really?

111
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm serious.

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I want to do it.

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's done.

114
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Thank you very much.

115
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You did a good job.

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
There's a remote control.

117
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
There's a remote control.

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You put the switch in first.

119
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's right.

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's cool.

121
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's cool.

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay.

123
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's coming.

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay.

125
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay.

126
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Look.

127
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's working.

128
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's working.

129
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's working.

130
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's really cool.

131
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Wait a minute.

132
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Hey.

133
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's the other way around.

134
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Why?

135
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Nothing.

136
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There's a cold wind outside.

137
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is the heat.

138
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This is for outside.

139
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What's wrong?

140
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What's wrong?

141
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Tell me.

142
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't know.

143
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I want the room to be cool.

144
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Really?

145
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There's a cold wind outside.

146
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's the other way around.

147
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's the other way around.

148
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You're young.

149
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You're young.

150
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It doesn't matter.

151
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's do it again.

152
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You should think about it.

153
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Even though it's a senior's action,

156
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Enzo can't afford to make a mistake.

157
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's done.

158
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay.

159
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll call him.

160
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's press the button.

161
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Is it about 24 degrees?

162
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
24 degrees.

163
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
If it gets cold suddenly,

164
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
you might catch a cold.

165
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I see.

166
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Is it really what he wants?

167
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Thank you.

169
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You don't have to thank me.

170
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you.

171
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Thank you.

172
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay.

173
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Switch.

174
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You do it.

175
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
First, cut the tape.

176
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Look.

177
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's coming.

178
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's coming.

179
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Look.

180
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's set at 24 degrees.

181
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It looks good.

182
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why is your face so sharp?

183
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's not the other way around.

184
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What do you mean?

185
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It doesn't matter if you catch a cold here.

186
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If you don't catch a cold here,

187
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
it will be here again.

188
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Is this okay?

189
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It doesn't make sense.

190
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Young people these days are like this.

191
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Are you sure?

192
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's difficult.

193
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Young people these days are polite.

194
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's difficult.

195
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Is this a joke?

196
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I was so happy when Mr. Oshiro Chaburo was with me.

197
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If the hose is broken,

198
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I can't fix it.

199
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Please fix it.

200
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm begging you.

201
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'll remove it.

202
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It doesn't matter.

203
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The hose is broken.

204
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I want to fix it.

205
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Endo is annoyed by the work that doesn't go as planned.

206
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's done.

207
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Thank you very much.

208
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm glad to see you.

209
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What will the result be?

210
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I wanted you to do this.

211
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's right.

212
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Thank you very much.

215
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's done.

216
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Come here.

217
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Look.

218
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Look at this.

219
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hurry up.

220
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Hurry up.

221
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Look.

222
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hurry up.

223
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It doesn't matter.

224
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Look at this.

225
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Push it.

226
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's open.

227
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's open.

228
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's open.

229
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's open.

230
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The door to happiness has opened.

231
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
All right.

232
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
OK.

233
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
All right.

234
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Let's go home.

235
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Wait a minute.

236
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Wait a minute.

237
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What's wrong with this hose?

238
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's open.

239
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's in the middle of the room.

240
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't know what to do.

241
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hey.

242
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hey.

243
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What?

244
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What did you just say?

245
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Are you crazy?

246
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Are you crazy?

247
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hey.

248
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What?

249
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's for everyone.

250
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Everyone is working hard for you.

251
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What?

252
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Everyone is working hard for you.

253
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What are you thinking?

254
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What are you thinking?

255
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You are crazy.

256
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You are crazy.

257
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Are you crazy?

258
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You are crazy.

259
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What's wrong with this hose?

260
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What are you thinking?

261
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What's wrong?

262
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What's wrong?

263
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Stop it.

264
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You are crazy.

265
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You are difficult.

266
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You are difficult.

267
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Sorry.

268
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What should I do?

269
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What do you want me to do?

270
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The room is narrow.

271
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And I can't install a cooler.

272
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Can you install a compact one?

273
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll do it.

276
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Remove the hose part.

277
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Understood.

278
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The cooler that finally came true.

279
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's done.

280
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's okay now.

281
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Really?

282
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
There's nothing left.

283
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Let's go.

284
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's finally done.

285
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I brought it.

286
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Let's go in.

287
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's done.

289
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
There's nothing left.

291
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
There's nothing left.

292
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's better to use that.

293
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's compact.

294
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Sit down.

295
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
This is your seat.

296
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Sit down.

297
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Press this switch.

298
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Press it.

299
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Press this switch.

300
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's cool.

301
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's cool.

302
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why is it cold?

303
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's hot.

304
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Put it in.

305
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What is this?

306
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What?

307
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Give me a break.

308
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That?

309
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

310
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's not the problem.

311
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's right.

312
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's not it.

313
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's not it.

314
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's not it.

315
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Sit down like this.

316
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's pretty good.

317
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Stop it.

318
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What did you do?

319
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Just me.

320
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Just me.

321
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This room is cool.

322
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's all I need.

323
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm not going to do this.

324
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If you don't care about the coolness,

325
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I have something for you.

326
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Is that so?

327
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You want to make this room cool, don't you?

328
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's right.

329
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I want to make this room cool.

330
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm not going to do it for you.

331
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm not going to do it for you.

332
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Thank you.

333
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is what Kogoriko does every time.

334
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Today's guest is not feeling well.

335
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Do you have a guest?

336
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Do you have Kogoriko?

337
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm not feeling well, but I'm Kogoriko.

338
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
How are you doing recently?

339
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What?

340
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
How are you doing recently?

341
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm doing well.

342
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I have a big house.

343
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I have a big house.

344
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I have a big house.

345
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I have a big house.

346
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I haven't built it yet.

347
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I want to build a house.

348
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Is that so?

349
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Go ahead.

350
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But it's hot.

351
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What?

352
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's hot in the summer.

353
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's hot in the summer.

354
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You can park your car in the parking lot.

355
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Who are you talking about?

356
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm talking about you.

357
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's not true.

358
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's just one car.

359
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's not true.

360
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You're a fool.

361
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You're a fool.

362
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's not true.

363
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What?

364
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm not sure if it's going to be popular.

365
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm talking about you.

366
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm talking about you.

367
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You're a fool.

368
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You're a fool.

369
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You can't park your car in the parking lot.

370
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm not talking about you.

371
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But it's popular.

372
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What?

373
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's not going to be popular.

374
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's not going to be popular.

375
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That's not true.

376
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You're a fool.

377
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You're a fool.

378
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Where do you want to go this summer?

379
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Where do you want to go?

380
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No, no, no.

381
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm not going with you.

382
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Why do you want to go with me?

383
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's okay to go with you sometimes.

384
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't want to go with you.

385
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Why?

386
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'll get kicked out.

387
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I won't get kicked out.

388
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I won't get kicked out.

389
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm not that kind of person.

390
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll get kicked out either way.

391
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll get kicked out either way.

392
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's not true.

393
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll get kicked out if I get kicked out.

394
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
By the way, do you stand up when you see my butt?

395
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
No, no, no.

396
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm not that kind of person.

397
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm a general person.

398
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, really?

399
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm not going to get kicked out.

400
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm not going to get kicked out if I get kicked out.

401
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Today's guest is not going to talk.

402
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm not going to talk.

403
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Then what do you want to do?

404
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm not going to talk.

405
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm not going to talk.

406
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You're going to go somewhere, aren't you?

407
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I don't know.

408
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Oh, really?

409
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I just remembered something while I was talking.

410
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What is it?

411
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Around October, this year...

412
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If I talk about this, everyone will turn blue.

413
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't think so.

414
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I heard it from someone I can trust.

415
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Around October, it's going to be really bad.

416
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What?

417
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Japan.

418
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
There's a rumor that Japan is going to disappear after leaving Shikoku.

419
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's going to be really bad.

420
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No, no, it's true.

421
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Alright!

422
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Let's do something.

423
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's really bad.

424
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's bad.

425
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Of course, not only Japan, the Earth is going to sink.

426
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The Earth is going to sink?

427
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The Earth is going to be really bad.

428
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's not something to laugh about.

429
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No, no, no.

430
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I know. I'm listening.

431
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You know it's going to be really bad, right?

432
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's not going to be bad.

433
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's a lie.

434
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Why don't you trust me?

435
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Do you think aliens are going to attack us?

436
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's part of the world of movies.

437
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You don't trust aliens?

438
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I haven't actually seen them.

439
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Do you know?

440
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
There are a lot of people who have been kidnapped by aliens.

441
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Maybe you've been kidnapped too.

442
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
No, I haven't been kidnapped.

443
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's not true.

444
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I haven't been kidnapped.

445
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You've been kidnapped and beaten up.

446
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I haven't been beaten up.

447
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You've been licked all over your body.

448
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What do you want to do with an alien?

449
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But he doesn't realize it because he lost his memory when he returned it.

450
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Sometimes he's planted something like a microchip.

451
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Sometimes he's not planted.

452
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
When you plant something, you plant it on the top of your mouth.

453
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
There's nothing on my mouth.

454
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
When I put it down like this, there's a microchip.

455
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What's a microchip?

456
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Where are you going?

457
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
When you buy clothes, you have to take it off.

458
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
When you go out, the clerk asks you how it went.

459
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You always say, I'll take this.

460
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He doesn't notice it.

461
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What would you answer?

462
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Please tell me.

463
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

464
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What?

465
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What would you answer?

466
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't care, but the customer is interested in it.

467
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's all right.

468
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
If the customer isn't interested in it, I don't care what I do here.

469
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
At that time, I'll be the one to take care of it.

470
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The customer is not interested in it at all.

471
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's hard to say.

472
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I want everyone to be more excited.

473
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What are you talking about?

474
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
If you have such an attitude, I won't be told.

475
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm sorry.

476
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Please look back.

477
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
When you're done reading, don't do this.

478
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Like this.

479
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
My body...

480
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's good.

481
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Wait a minute.

482
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
When you're done reading...

483
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Are you done?

484
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes, thank you.

485
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Are you okay?

486
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yes, I'm fine.

487
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'll read the document.

488
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
When you buy clothes, you have to take it off.

489
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You have to wear it properly.

490
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
When you go out, the clerk asks you how you feel.

491
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You always say, I'll take this.

492
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Please give me this.

493
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You don't get the point.

494
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You don't get the point.

495
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Mr. Matsumoto, what would you say?

496
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Well, I'd say...

497
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm sorry.

498
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm done.

499
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Please open it.

500
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I opened it.

501
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
How was it?

502
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What do you mean how was it?

503
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What is it?

504
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Which is it?

505
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Well, well...

506
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's a good feeling.

507
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm glad.

508
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Now I won't be able to slide.

509
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I don't want to slide anymore.

510
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't care.

511
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
In the race where Ayrton Senna won...

512
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Mr. Matsumoto was always in the front of the F1 car.

513
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What were you doing?

514
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What were you doing?

515
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
How did you get into the circuit?

516
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Is it the system?

517
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Well, basically...

518
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Wait, wait.

519
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You can't watch TV.

520
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You have to watch the scenery.

521
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's not it.

522
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I can't do that.

523
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You can.

524
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
More.

525
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's why...

526
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
There are a lot of cameras on the track.

527
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
There are no cameras on the track.

528
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
There are places where you can't see the camera.

529
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Senna always tells me.

530
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's hot. It's hot.

531
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Senna always tells me.

532
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
He always tells me.

534
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Basically, I'm like this.

535
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
When the camera isn't on, Senna says,

536
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Are you okay now?

537
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I open my eyes and close them for a while.

538
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm like, this is bad.

539
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
When Senna steps on the accelerator,

540
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
it's like he's stabbing my butt.

541
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The bar.

542
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
When Senna goes like this,

543
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
it stimulates my front wheel.

544
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What do you think?

545
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
When I do that, I go like this.

546
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You!

547
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You're just struggling in the front.

548
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm not struggling.

549
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
There's a hole in the middle.

550
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's a turbo.

551
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
When Senna goes like this,

552
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
it stimulates my front wheel.

553
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I go like this.

554
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's like this.

555
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
When Senna got into an accident,

556
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
he wasn't in the car.

557
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What?

558
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
When Senna got into an accident,

559
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
he wasn't in the car.

560
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What?

561
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You were okay?

562
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
That's right.

563
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It wasn't you who pushed him into the car, was it?

564
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It was a big deal.

565
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I didn't think it was a big deal.

566
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's okay to say that Senna got into an accident

567
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
because I jumped out.

568
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Senna lost his balance.

569
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
He said,

570
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Mazumoro!

571
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Senna jumped out of the car.

572
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
No, Mazumoro, no!

573
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Why did you jump out?

574
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Why did you jump out?

575
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I thought it was a big deal.

576
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I said, Mazumoro, no!

577
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Because Mazumoro wasn't there,

578
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I lost my balance.

579
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Don't talk too much.

580
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
In such a short time.

581
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No, I don't know.

582
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You're still talking.

583
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I don't know the last word.

584
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
When I was in elementary school,

585
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I stopped the train running to save the puppy sleeping on the tracks

586
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
with bare hands.

587
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Bare hands are too much.

588
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I don't drive.

589
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Why are there so many stones around the tracks of the train?

590
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
To fix the bar of the track,

591
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
you have to fix it.

592
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I can't fix it with such a thing.

593
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's fixed.

594
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I think it's better to fix it a little more.

595
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Do you know how much money it costs to fix the track?

596
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't know.

597
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
How many meters do you think the track is in Japan?

598
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
No one has ever thought about that.

599
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The track is several times as big as Mt. Fuji.

600
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It costs a lot of money.

601
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Why do you have to do that?

602
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I want to do it.

603
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What are you talking about?

604
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I didn't have any money this time.

605
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's terrible.

606
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I want to take a bath.

607
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yes.

608
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I don't want to.

609
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm sweating.

610
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I can't do it.

611
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I can't do it at all.

612
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm sorry.

613
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Please tell me.

614
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Are you thinking about it now?

615
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Are you thinking about it?

616
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Are you thinking about it?

617
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What do you mean?

618
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm thinking about it.

619
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm thinking about it.

620
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm thinking about it.

621
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Please tell me.

622
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I don't have the courage to tell you today.

623
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Why?

624
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Something is wrong.

625
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What's wrong?

626
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I feel like I'm going to slip.

627
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm scared of today's guest.

628
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That's not true.

629
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Something is wrong.

630
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Please tell me.

631
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What's wrong?

632
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I have a lot of thoughts.

633
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Why?

634
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Then tell me.

635
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Tell me.

636
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'll tell you.

637
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I can't do it if I don't have money.

638
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Why?

639
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yes.

640
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Why?

641
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That's why.

642
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I heard your opinion.

643
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Do you have any other opinions?

644
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
No.

645
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Do you have any other opinions?

646
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I've never talked about it.

647
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I can't think of anything else.

648
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I have an answer.

649
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Then tell me.

650
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yes.

651
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Tell me.

652
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'll tell you.

653
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
If I don't have money, I can't do it.

654
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I see.

655
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Think about it.

656
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's scary.

657
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What do you mean?

658
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
There's only one way.

659
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
That's amazing.

660
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
What do you mean?

661
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What do you mean?

662
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What?

663
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
What kind of question is that?

664
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Oops.

665
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
This is the reason.

666
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What is it?

667
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's messed up.

668
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
What is it?

669
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's messed up.

670
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Bring it to me.

671
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
What are you saying?

672
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
What is it?

673
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
What is it?

674
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's messed up.

675
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
What's messed up?

676
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I didn't say anything.

677
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You're lying.

678
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You're lying.

679
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Why are you angry?

680
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
What is it?

681
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Why are you angry?

682
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I don't want to draw.

683
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I don't want to draw.

684
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I don't want to draw.

685
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You're lying.

686
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's messed up.

687
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You're lying.

688
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Why are you angry?

689
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You're lying.

690
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's messed up.

691
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You're lying.

692
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It's messed up.

693
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You're lying.
