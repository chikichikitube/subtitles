1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In the first episode, we will have a remote fanfare with 9 people in a row!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Masuo-san, what is this about?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sure you're familiar with this, but the number of people using the remote is increasing.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's almost like that.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I thought it would be nice to use the remote to do a fanfare.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What kind of person is this Mentsu?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes, I've been told that it's interesting in the interview.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't think there's an answer to the question about the lunch.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
There are countless kinds of jokes for one topic.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm looking forward to the interview.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Then, shall we introduce who the nine people are?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, let's do it.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Everyone!

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Who are these nine people?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The hand-shape is also the best.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I think it's better to introduce yourself.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Can you introduce yourself?

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's Yama-chan.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm Hosei Nitei, 32 years of my acting career.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Nice to meet you.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm Shodo Endo, 29 years of my acting career.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Thank you for coming.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm also Koko Riko Tanaka.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm honored to be chosen for the interview.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The salaryman who was drunk said that.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Is it okay?

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Next is the winner of the 25th year of his career, Shogun Shiragawa.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Please.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Next is...

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Good morning.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm the 20th year of his career, Daihatsu.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Please take care of me.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry!

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You're also wearing a big cut.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's amazing.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't have much.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You can wear a big cut if you tuck it in.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's the difference.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And now, the 14th member of the GYAKUEN GENKURI POCKET, Otake!

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Otake-san!

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Otake wasn't chosen!

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I wasn't chosen.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But, do you need these three?

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
First, this one.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hello, I'm Masaharu Fukuyama.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm Masaharu Fukuyama.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm sleepy. I'm sleepy.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I like you.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I like you.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But Zaku-shi is also a good singer, he has a good performance in the Japan Grand Prix

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm a fan of big shows, please look forward to it

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Biii! I'm Kojima Yoshio!

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh! Girigiri!

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What is this?

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yoshio has the image of a big show

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No no no, I came to Tokyo to do a big show

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's right!

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Just as I thought!

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No, no, no, no.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then it's not a naked person.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Last one!

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you!

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm Pantone Wato.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Thank you very much.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Today, too,

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I had 10 chocolates

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
for the big day.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's right, that's right.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Wait a minute.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Wait a minute.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's right, that's right. Please wait a moment.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The above voice acting challenge will be given to the remote O-Giri.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Introducing the rules.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Each person will announce the answer to the O-Giri given.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Matsumoto will judge whether it's interesting or not.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If you fail the challenge when you get an interesting internal judgement, you will have to clear the 9 members in a row

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
In that case, we will give each of you 10,000 yen

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's amazing

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's amazing

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If you don't have work, let's all work hard

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I also want to say something

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If the answer is the same among the 9 members, I will simply hate you guys.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
There is no such thing as the same answer.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Let's do our best, everyone.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's do our best.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now, the time limit is 1 hour. Let's go!

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is the first question. Matsumoto-san, please.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's easy to think at first. How about this?

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
How much does the first line change?

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What is it?

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Can I go smoothly?

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I think it's a good idea.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's the first line.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I can hear the chorus.

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The pen is not moving at all.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm worried that the pen is not moving.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Ah, I see.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
There are too many choices in my head, and it takes too much time to organize them.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Please think about it.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Is it because Otake is organizing his face?

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No way.

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Everyone is writing.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Hurry up and write.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's time to...

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No, I can't do this.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm going.

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's over.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So, Matsumoto-san, who will go first?

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Then shall we start with the first introduction?

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay, let's start with Yama-chan.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What is the most important line that Nishikko-san has thought of?

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Hatssaku!

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What?

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Wait a minute!

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Wait a minute!

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Wait a minute!

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What?

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll give you a raise!

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What?

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
When are you going to use it?

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you use it, you'll be able to use it when you get a good one.

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
When I get a good one?

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's strange.

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is there anyone who thinks that I can use it?

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Who?

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's good.

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I was the one who said it!

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Tanaka! Tanaka!

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Now, Hikoto-san, what do you think the Gimei ZuriF will be?

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's the question!

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Either way, it's impossible.

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Isn't it too soon?

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Either way, it's impossible.

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Just one person!

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm really confident.

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Someone, someone, go!

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Ah, Zagoshi?

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Can I go?

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's go. What is the line that you think is the most important?

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm going to go!

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The image is a little messed up now.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I see.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I see.

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's move on to the next topic.

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What is the first place of Kappa aru aru?

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Please show us.

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This is a good question.

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
There are many people who don't know Kappa.

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
There are many features of Kappa.

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I use that.

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Mame-san, you really don't write this comment right away?

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No, because my IQ is high

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You can do it, you can do it

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's over!

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So, Mr. Matsumoto, where do you want to start?

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Where do you want to start?

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Please decide, Mr. Hamada

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But, Tanaka has already finished writing the first episode

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay, then let's start with Tanaka

162
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What is the first episode of Kappa Aru Aru?

163
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The magazine cover says,

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Hey!

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Hey!

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Is it bad?

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's harsh.

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You should listen to this.

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Please write it.

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Here comes the letter.

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Here it comes.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Here it comes.

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What is the first letter of HAPPARUARU?

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
In winter, hair grows fast.

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Girl, you may not be funny.

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Wait a minute.

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's fast.

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I can't say it clearly, but you may not be funny.

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's fast.

180
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's not Kappa Aru Aru, right?

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's not Kappa Aru Aru.

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's not, right?

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Otake, let's go.

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What is the first place of Kappa aru aru?

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Don't soak cucumbers in water

186
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's funny

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's funny

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's funny

189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I like cucumbers

190
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's quite funny

191
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let's go Yoshio

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What is the first place of Kappa aru aru?

193
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What is it?

194
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The river is pretty bad.

195
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's not bad.

196
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's not bad.

197
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okada, you go first.

198
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You can go first.

199
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What is the first place of Kappa aru aru?

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The sneakers don't fit.

201
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That was a little funny.

202
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Wait a minute!

203
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The flow will stop next time.

204
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Tsuda!

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You did it!

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes, I did it!

207
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What is the first place of the Cup RR?

208
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Mezakusa Genki!

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You were running away!

210
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You were running away!

211
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Alright, if it's like this, it's Yama-chan.

212
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Do you want to see it?

213
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Do you want to see it?

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's no good to watch it.

215
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Next, Kappa RR. What is the first place?

216
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The plate on his head is thin.

217
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's thin.

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He was talking.

219
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't understand.

220
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He was saying BOO at the plate.

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I couldn't hear it.

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Can we go with a good tempo?

223
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Can we go with pan pan pan pan?

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes.

225
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I see.

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The next question is this!

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What is the reason why the pink screamer is screaming?

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Please show us the picture and scream!

229
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Wait a minute, so it's in front of everyone?

230
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes, so you can just show it and scream.

231
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So it's like he was doing it beforehand?

232
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He didn't have time to think?

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He just died!

234
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He was taken from the back!

235
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He was taken from the back!

236
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't know. It's fine if you know it in advance.

237
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I know it. I know it.

238
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Please don't say that you know it.

239
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The argument is not there.

240
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's go.

241
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Let's go.

242
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
First, Otake.

243
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Kaze Kimi

244
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Correct!

245
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Okay!

246
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Let's go!

247
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
How much?

248
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No, no, no!

249
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Shouji!

250
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Eight pieces!

251
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Wait, wait!

252
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Mom!

253
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I want to eat seafood!

254
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Correct!

255
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Wait a minute!

256
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What is that?

257
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What? What? What? What?

258
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What do you want to eat?

259
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I want to eat seafood.

260
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's the sea, so I think you remembered seafood.

261
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Is it okay to say that it was released once?

262
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Because there was a flow.

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
To some extent, it will also be a flow.

264
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Because there was a lot of it.

265
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Because there was a lot of it.

266
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Even if it wasn't Augusta, I'm sorry, next.

267
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Tanaka!

268
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Osaka!

269
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That's not good!

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Tanaka, you're always red!

271
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

272
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Tanaka-san, you're not good at acting.

273
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Alright, let's wipe out the pride!

274
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Pride!

275
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We'll change the scene.

276
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Tanaka, you're like a convenience store.

277
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
This is the most embarrassing one.

278
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The most, the most?

279
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It wasn't in the video.

280
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I really thought it was GIN.

281
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's so funny.

282
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I was swallowing, swallowing, and then spit.

283
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I wanted to hold my laugh.

284
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Akko-san, you can't say goodbye.

285
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You can't say goodbye.

286
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't want to hear that.

287
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You haven't got the first one yet.

288
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I want to get it.

289
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll take this one.

290
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Masuo-san, you should be a little more relaxed.

291
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I understand.

292
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I understand.

293
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Lower the bar.

294
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Please.

295
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And it's a very good topic.

296
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
This is it.

297
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
This is the question.

298
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What is the next year's popular dessert?

299
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Please think about it.

300
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
There are many.

301
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's often seen in the big screen.

302
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
There are some that are popular every year.

303
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But I think it's harder to slip.

304
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What did you say? You can't even open your mouth.

305
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
If you just put ink in it, it'll be fine.

306
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Is that okay, everyone?

307
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
If we look at the screen, let's start with the middle one, Tsuda.

308
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What is the next trend in sweets?

309
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Pink Ohagi

310
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Okay okay okay

311
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Okay okay okay

312
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's pink

313
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Pink Ohagi

314
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Pink Ohagi

315
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Now, Yama-chan

316
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What is the next popular dessert?

317
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Gorilla potato

318
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You did it

319
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Gorilla potato

320
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You are being very kind to me.

321
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
How is it?

322
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
All of you are booing.

323
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm serious.

324
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
If it's Akko, I don't know what to say.

325
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
How many times do I have to say I don't know what to say?

326
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I don't want to hear that.

327
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You are being kind this time.

328
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Wait a minute.

329
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This is a booing.

330
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But I did a booing.

331
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If this is a pinpon, I'll be in trouble.

332
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yoshio!

333
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
By the way, let's see.

334
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yoshio, what's the next popular dessert?

335
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Anago-ppi.

336
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What's the difference between this and Gorilla Live?

337
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What's the difference between pinpon and bun?

338
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Zagoshi, let's see.

339
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What's the next popular dessert?

340
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
3. Fried rice without a plate.

341
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh, that's a good one.

342
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's a sweet.

343
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I see.

344
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
There's no plate.

345
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Let's hear only Choji.

346
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Let's see only Choji.

347
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What is the next popular sweet?

348
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Tapioca.

349
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What?

350
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Tapioca.

351
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Tapioca.

352
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Ewa.

353
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What?

354
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's a bad one.

355
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Ewa?

356
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Alright, this is it! Shodo, go!

357
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What's the next popular sweets?

358
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Poop parfait

359
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What's the next popular sweets?

360
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I won't say it. You didn't hear it, did you?

361
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You didn't see it, did you?

362
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
No, no, no. You didn't see it, did you?

363
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Just the sound.

364
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Just the sound.

365
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Wait a minute. I want to go with this.

366
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Not at all.

367
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
This is bad.

368
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'll give you a very easy one.

369
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
A very easy one.

370
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
If I were to say it on this scoreboard, the regular people are completely destroyed.

371
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's a bit too early.

372
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's a bit strict.

373
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The regular people are strict.

374
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'll give you a light one.

375
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The lightest one today.

376
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Here's the question.

377
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The North Prince, Kinya, wants to see me too.

378
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I want to see a bit of snow.

379
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Now, what is the name of the person who gave the name?

380
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Please show us!

381
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
This is definitely good.

382
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The amazing actor, Mr. Kitagawa

383
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Because he is a big shot

384
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The tension

385
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And the feeling from there

386
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's very funny

387
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Isn't it good?

388
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's basic

389
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Okay, Shoji!

390
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What is the name of the person who gave the name?

391
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Let's go!

392
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yakin

393
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Correct!

394
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Okay

395
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Zaboshi!

396
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What is the name of the food that Mr.Hikawa ate?

397
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Kinpoko

398
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Correct!

399
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Okay, okay, okay

400
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Otake! What is the name of the food that Mr.Hikawa ate?

401
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Kinchaku Bukuron

402
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Correct!

403
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Good, good, good

404
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Good, good, good

405
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What is the name of the prince?

406
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Kitaboshi Pin-chan

407
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What is this?

408
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Okay, let's go

409
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What is the name of the prince?

410
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
O-chan

411
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay, Yama-chan, let's go

412
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What is the name of the prince?

413
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Basha Basha!

414
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Wait a minute!

415
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What is this?

416
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What is this?

417
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's like Michopa, like Yuki Poyo.

418
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't understand.

419
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I don't understand.

420
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Akko-san, please stop.

421
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
By the way, Tanaka!

422
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yes.

423
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What is the name of the person who explained it?

424
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Kitao Kimi Kimi

425
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Ah!

426
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That's tough

427
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's a bit of a fan

428
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The ABC is...

429
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's tough for the younger members

430
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yoshio, Yoshio, by the way, what's your name?

431
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Prince Kimi Kimi

432
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You're wearing it!

433
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I hate you

434
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
No, I'm not

435
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You're the last one to wear it in the garden

436
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Say it already

437
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What's your name?

438
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Ok, tea time?

439
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I don't want it.

440
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You don't want it?

441
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You don't want it?

442
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You want to be called a boon?

443
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You want to be called a boon?

444
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Finally, the 9th place is cleared.

445
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Big chance!

446
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yay!

447
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yes!

448
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Ah, there's 30 minutes left.

449
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What?

450
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Already 30 minutes?

451
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
This is bad.

452
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Let's go on and on.

453
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Let's go with 5 people

454
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This is good

455
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Next question

456
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Question

457
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
In 2020, Shin Momotaro

458
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Dog

459
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Monkey

460
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What is the 4th friend that comes to mind?

461
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Please write your answer

462
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
The newest Momotaro

463
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
This is like a question from the New Mon edition of Oogiri

464
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I see

465
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Let's go

466
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We have to go

467
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Let's go

468
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
That's right.

469
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Ok, let's go.

470
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Ok, let's go.

471
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What is the fourth otomo?

472
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yosuke!

473
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That's good.

474
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's good.

475
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That's interesting.

476
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Ok, let's go.

477
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Zagoshi!

478
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Zagoshi, what is the fourth otomo?

479
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Sakai Masaaki.

480
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I feel like he's a bit of a child.

481
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Let's go with Kusuzawa!

482
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What is the 4th otomo?

483
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Pepper-kun

484
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I see

485
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's good, it's a good idea

486
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's a good idea

487
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's a good idea

488
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Shouji!

489
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What is the 4th otomo?

490
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Kaeya

491
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's good

492
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Let's go with Sake

493
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Sake!

494
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What is the 4th sound?

495
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Medaka

496
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yoshio, go!

497
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What is the 4th sound?

498
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
100 days after death

499
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's a trend, isn't it?

500
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's better to have a trend like this

501
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Alright!

502
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Tanaka, let's go!

503
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What is the fourth sound?

504
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's the grass.

505
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That's enough!

506
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What's with this regular scene?

507
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Isn't it a bit harsh?

508
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's not harsh.

509
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
If it's not Tanaka, then it's Shouzo.

510
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Well, that's right.

511
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
What is the fourth man?

512
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yes, Son Masayoshi.

513
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I don't know if I said it in the flow.

514
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
What is the fourth man?

515
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Shoei.

516
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I was saying it.

517
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It's time to say it.

518
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
No.

519
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
There is no Shoei.

520
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yama-chan and Tanaka are not here

521
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
No, no

522
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Even if they come as a person, it's not like a movie

523
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's a movie where they're taken away

524
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's everyone

525
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
What is the 13th OO?

526
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Microphone exercise

527
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The second half of the sister's cooking

528
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
What is the thank you in OO?

529
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's a rain-candy!

530
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's a rain-candy!

531
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And finally, a big chance!

532
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
If he succeeds, he'll get a prize!

533
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
He's attacking from a distance.

534
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And...

535
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
If it's Makko, then we're done.

536
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
We're done.

537
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Don't say that!

538
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The last episode will be broadcast exclusively on Hulu.
