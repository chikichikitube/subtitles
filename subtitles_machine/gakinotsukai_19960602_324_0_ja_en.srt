1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the 1st episode of Gaki no Tsukaiara, Chikkun's 1, 2 finish...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Chikkun's Dantan presents worth 100,000 yen!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It seems like everyone is in a bad mood today

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm in a bad mood today

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm really in a bad mood

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Everyone, do you remember what you looked like just now?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's a strange transformation

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A strange transformation?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't want to do this anymore

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Everyone looks like this right now

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's been a long time

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's been a long time

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's been a year

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's been a year

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Is that so?

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't know why he doesn't like it

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's right

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We're still friends

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We're still friends

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
There's no such thing

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What is this?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm the villain in this story

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsors you see

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
First, we're going to fight for the right to get 100,000 yen

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's just one person

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The person with the least amount of money will get 100,000 yen

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The person who gets 100,000 yen will be chosen by me or Matsumoto

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Then I'll get 100,000 yen

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll get 100,000 yen

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Then I'll get 100,000 yen

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll take care of that

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's a bit early

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is...

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is a bit early

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This is not good

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is 5

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Wait a minute

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
5

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is 5

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is not good

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I didn't say I didn't drop it

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I didn't say I didn't drop it

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I saw it at once and it was 6

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I thought it was a 5, but it's a 5.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't like that either.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, then let's go with 6.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't say that.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This guy is really selfish.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
2, 2, 2.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
2.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I can't do this.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll do it.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
5th place.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
9th place.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Please, please.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
4th place.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
4th place.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
7th place.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay, okay, okay.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's the last one, right?

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's the last one.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is Sakamoto-chan.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Wow.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Wow.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
4th place.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Hey, wait a minute.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hey, wait a minute.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hey, wait a minute.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay, Sakamoto-chan.

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
From now on, we're going to do a free throw.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay.

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's do it five times each.

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Whichever way you want to do it.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Whichever way you want to do it.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Please decide whether you can do it or not.

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Please, please, please.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll do it first.

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's just us.

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Before we do it, we'll do it like this.

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay, let's go.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That was close.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's in.

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's in.

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's in.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's in.

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's in.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's in.

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's in.

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That was close.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Ah, it sank.

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It sank.

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It sank.

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It sank.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It sank.

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If this goes in, I win.

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's right.

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh, it went in.

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I won!

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I won with 2-0!

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I won with 2-0!

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Please go to the Royal Box

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,320
The

108
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
Mimic of the Mimic

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:20,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Please go to the Mimic of the Mimic

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Everyone, welcome to the second stage

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I saw something amazing

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's win another 100,000 yen

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why are you so happy?

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why are you so happy, Harutatsu?

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is strange

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What is this?

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's do it again

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes!

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What is this?

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes!

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
10

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Wow

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is amazing

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This is amazing

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Be careful

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
6

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yes

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't know yet

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This is amazing

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
9

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
9

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's go

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
9

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I won

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I won with 2-0

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's make it with 2-0

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I will throw this ball

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's see who will die

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's see who will die

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I chose this

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Please

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is Hamada's normal debut

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This is definitely the choice of Matsumoto

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's right

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't know if I'm wearing the opposite

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't know if I'm wearing the opposite

149
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't have a choice

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll do anything you want me to do.

151
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Let's do it.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Ready, go!

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I did it!

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's listen to it.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I can see a new world.

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's enough!

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This is scary!

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's dirty!

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's dirty!

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Scary!

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Let's do the last one with Russian roulette.

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You have six shots.

163
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You have six bullets and one gunpowder.

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll do it.

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I did it!

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I did it!

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It looks like it's going to work.

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's going to work.

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's going to work.

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm counting on you.

172
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm counting on you.

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm counting on you.

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm counting on you.

175
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The third round is the other way around.

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Rock-paper-scissors!

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The other way around!

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Rock-paper-scissors!

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The other way around!

180
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I won the first round.

181
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't know who will win.

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The second round!

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I won the first round.

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The third round is the final round.

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The final round.

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Rock-paper-scissors!

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Rock-paper-scissors!

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Rock-paper-scissors!

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Let's go!

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The transformation of charm!

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:22,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yama-chan, go ahead.

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Let's make it a final round of love!

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

195
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's good again.

196
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What are you looking at?

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It seems like there's something going on these days.

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That used one.

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The old one.

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What is it?

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, well, well, well.

202
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Isn't that right?

203
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He's the used one.

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's just, it's just, you know.

205
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's not it!

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Hey!

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The one who's in that costume is called Hamada.

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's a good one.

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Hamada?

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Nothing has changed.

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's the same, right?

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's the same, it's the same.

213
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's right.

214
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's strange.

215
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's Hamada!

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Even in fashion, he's the leader.

217
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's good, right?

218
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
He's cool.

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He has a lot of things that I don't have.

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
For example, what is it?

221
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
A big house, right?

222
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There's nothing wrong with that.

223
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And a loving wife, right?

224
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Right?

225
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
In the past, when was it?

226
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Was it when you made your debut or high school?

227
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It wasn't like that.

228
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
In fashion, it was zero to zero.

229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It was terrible.

230
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It was better than you.

231
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No, no.

232
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
When you were in high school, you were still called by your number.

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's not it.

234
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It was terrible.

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You went to Japan and did whatever you wanted.

236
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Whatever I wanted?

237
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's not it.

238
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I didn't do whatever I wanted.

239
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I was just walking around.

240
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I didn't know what to do.

241
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If you see a friend like that next to you, just hide it.

242
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't know where it changed.

243
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What's this?

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Is this going to be popular?

245
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's not going to be popular.

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Is this going to be popular?

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's not going to be popular.

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If you say it's good, it will be popular.

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Why?

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I don't have any influence.

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's not going to be popular if someone like me does it.

252
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But if you say it's good, it will be popular.

253
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
If I do it like this?

254
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What?

255
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If you say it's good, it will be popular.

256
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Are you stupid?

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's not good.

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I can't reach it.

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's not good.

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Can you reach it?

262
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes.

263
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
From Toshi.

264
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I can't find Shakutani.

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I've been looking for him everywhere.

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Shakutani...

267
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I hope Shakutani will come to the show.

268
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That would be the best.

269
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san, who recently went from D cup to E cup.

270
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You've been making a fool of yourself with the concept of bringing your brother closer.

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
How is your brother going to evolve?

272
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
My brother has changed a lot.

273
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
His underwear has changed too.

274
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's like 643.

275
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What's that number?

276
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's the number of his underwear.

277
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's not 643.

278
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What was it?

279
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
64...

280
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
2?

281
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
7?

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's 647!

283
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's the bell button.

284
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's the bell button.

285
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yes, it's the bell button.

286
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's right.

287
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's too old to bring him closer.

288
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's too old?

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yes.

290
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
How is he going to evolve?

291
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's going to be a big deal.

292
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Let me hear that.

293
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You've also gone from D cup to E cup, right?

294
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yes, I have.

295
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What is this?

296
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm talking to you.

297
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Did you wear it then?

298
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes, I did.

299
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're not wearing it now, are you?

300
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm not wearing it now.

301
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Why?

302
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's because...

303
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What is it?

304
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Why?

305
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What is it?

306
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Please tell me the next one.

307
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That's because I'm talking while singing.

308
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That's not it.

309
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That's not it.

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's not it.

311
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
For now, let's listen to the song.

312
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Why?

313
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You're doing a radio show.

314
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're not doing it.

315
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I want to say this.

316
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I know Matsushi, of course.

317
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Please say it.

318
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But if I say it,

319
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'll get a lot of calls.

320
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
They'll say,

321
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You can't do it, Matsushi.

322
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Please give me a hint.

323
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
A hint?

324
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I can't give you a straight answer.

325
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'll give you a light hint.

326
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What's the next one?

327
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
When the moon is covered in clouds.

328
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't get it.

329
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
How do you say it then?

330
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
When the moon is covered in clouds.

331
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
How do you say it then?

332
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You'll fall.

333
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What?

334
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Don't touch me.

335
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's strange.

336
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What?

337
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That's strange.

338
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That's impossible.

339
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That's not it.

340
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
If you two go to the jungle,

341
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and Hamada-san gets bitten by a poisonous shrimp,

342
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
what will you do?

343
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I think it's a question.

344
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Why?

345
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's why,

346
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I only think about Hamada.

347
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's why,

348
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
when a poisonous shrimp comes out,

349
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I won't forgive that poisonous shrimp.

350
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Why would it come out in front of my Hamada?

351
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Moreover,

352
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
when I ask it, it has poison in it.

353
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Who did you ask?

354
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Who did you ask?

355
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It has poison in its tongue.

356
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What's its tongue?

357
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I can't help but get angry.

358
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It hurts.

359
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It hurts.

360
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's why,

361
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I won't go to the place where Hamada gets bitten.

362
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
When I do something,

363
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
for example,

364
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
when I take this eraser,

365
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
is it good or bad for Hamada?

366
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What are you talking about?

367
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What's wrong with Hamada?

368
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Are you thinking about Hamada?

369
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
When I drink mugi tea in the morning,

370
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
is this mugi tea good for Hamada?

371

N.H.K正しい日本語講座

373
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
My first brother, Masumoto-san.

374
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Is that so?

375
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yes, that's right.

376
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Do you have a cool way to call a Chirigami exchange student?

377
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What's that?

378
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's cool.

379
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
There are many cool ways, right?

380
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's right.

381
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
For example,

382
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
even if you fall down on the street,

383
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
you can still be cool.

384
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You can still be cool even if you get hurt.

385
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Please show me a cool way to call a Chirigami exchange student.

386
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So,

387
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
what kind of way is that?

388
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Well,

389
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I don't know.

390
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Idiot!

391
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What's that?

392
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I don't know.

393
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Chirigami exchange student.

394
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
At that time,

395
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
you open it like this.

396
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Wait a minute.

397
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is my car.

398
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yes, that's right.

399
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Everyone,

400
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
every year,

401
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Chirigami exchange student.

402
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm not doing this as a small business,

403
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
so I'm going to stop.

404
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What?

405
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm going to stop.

406
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm just fooling around.

407
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Don't get so angry.

408
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Every year,

409
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
every year...

410
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You know,

411
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Chirigami exchange student.

412
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You can just tell your girlfriend that you like her.

413
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That's right.

414
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That's right.

415
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's right.

416
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's right.

417
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm going to stop.

418
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm going to stop.

419
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm scared.

420
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
If you tell me the truth.

421
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
After all,

422
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm cool.

423
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
If Otama-Jakushi grows up,

424
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
he will change.

425
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And Otama-Jakushi is in front of the frog.

426
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Otama-Jakushi between the frog and Otama-Jakushi.

427
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
When Otama-Jakushi is growing up.

428
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What are you going to say?

429
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What are you going to say at this time?

430
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Well...

431
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Simply put,

432
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
what am I going to say?

433
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's a number.

434
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
A number?

435
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm serious.

436
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Wait a minute.

437
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's not funny.

438
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Why?

439
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Why?

440
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's not funny.

441
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Why?

442
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's Otama-Jakushi, right?

443
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Otama-Jakushi, right?

444
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The final type is a frog.

445
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's a frog.

446
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
In the meantime,

447
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
his hands, tail, and legs are growing.

448
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What is this?

449
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
At that time,

450
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm serious.

451
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
For example,

452
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
you,

453
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Hamada-san,

454
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
you have various faces.

455
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What do you mean by various faces?

456
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
For example,

457
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
you have the face of Kataya H-Jungle.

458
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yes.

459
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Let's say this is a frog.

460
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
H-Jungle is a frog.

461
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
At that time,

462
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
you have the face of a frog.

463
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
A frog is a frog.

464
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I see.

465
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
When you were in H-Jungle,

466
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
you were like this.

467
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And one more thing.

468
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
When you were in a drama,

469
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
you were Otama-Jakushi.

470
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But when you were in a drama,

471
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
you were acting.

472
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Otama-Jakushi is acting as Otama-Jakushi.

473
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You were acting as Otama-Jakushi.

474
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You were acting as Otama-Jakushi.

475
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm not acting as Otama-Jakushi.

476
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You were acting as Otama-Jakushi.

477
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yes, I was acting as Otama-Jakushi.

478
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Okay, okay.

479
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Right?

480
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You were acting as a frog.

481
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Geku, Geku, Geku, Geku.

482
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
In the meantime...

483
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
In the meantime,

484
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
it was normal.

485
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It was the most ridiculous time.

486
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I didn't know how to act.

487
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You had your hands, legs, and tail,

488
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
but you were told that you weren't a frog.

489
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I didn't know what to do.

490
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So...

491
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
How do you call it?

492
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's Su.

493
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Su.

494
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's Su.

495
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Everyone has that part.

496
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The Su part.

497
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Well, yes.

498
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I was like,

499
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
are you serious?

500
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I know, I know.

501
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I can't be that serious.

502
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I can't be that serious.

503
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I can't be that serious.

504
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Why is Omaru shaped like a duck?

505
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What do you think about this?

506
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You see,

507
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Omaru is only used by children.

508
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Only children.

509
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Children.

510
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yes.

511
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So, if you don't make it fun,

512
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
it makes people happy

513
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
to have characters like this.

514
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Isn't that right?

515
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So, in that sense,

516
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
it's a cute character.

517
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
To comfort children.

518
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yes.

519
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Isn't that what it means?

520
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It doesn't mean it's not cute.

521
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
If that's the case,

522
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
it doesn't have to be a duck.

523
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It could be Anpanman.

524
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
There's something like that.

525
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Are you serious?

526
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's just a normal answer.

527
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I don't know.

528
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's serious.

529
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm telling you.

530
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
If it's an animal,

531
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
there are many other things.

532
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
An elephant,

533
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
a giraffe,

534
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
but it's an excuse.

535
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But why is it a duck?

536
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Well,

537
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
he's asking why it's a duck.

538
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I see.

539
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Why is it a duck?

540
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yes.

541
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
In the past,

542
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
people used to

543
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
poop on a duck.

544
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Let's go home.

545
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What's so sad about pooping on a duck?

546
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Don't touch it!

547
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What are you talking about?

548
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Listen, listen.

549
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's better.

550
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
From now on,

551
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
listen to me.

552
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
If it was a place where there was nothing,

553
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
it would make a sound, right?

554
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That's right.

555
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That's why girls are embarrassed.

556
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Let me hear it.

557
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So, in the past,

558
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
people used to poop on a duck.

559
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Poo...

560
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
A duck?

561
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
They used to poop on a duck.

562
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Ah!

563
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That's why they made a sound.
