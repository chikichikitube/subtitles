1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Next time, at Gaki no Tsukaiya, we'll be gathering the 50s comedians!

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Look over there! Hoi hoi hoi!

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
I feel like I'm being teased.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,500
This is the same.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,500
This is bullying the young.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,500
I feel like that.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,500
If we can be treated like that...

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,500
No, no, that's not true.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
The side view is amazing.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
It's amazing.

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Tonight's Gaki no Tsukaiya is super gorgeous!

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,500
As a result of the Segiuchi Hiroshi, Megumi is the only one left.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
She's carrying the Karo of the team.

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500
I think she's carrying it.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Next is Megumi Toshiaki.

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
It was hard to get along with Machan.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
It was like that.

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,500
This is the first grade.

19
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
It was like that.

20
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,500
B21 special Hiromi.

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,500
I was told that I have a runny nose and I have to go to the hospital to get a drip.

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Is that true?

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:00:54,500
The

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Higokazu Hiro

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,500
I thought this TV was interesting, so I switched it off and turned it off.

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,500
And downtown

27
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,500
The legends who have been running comedy clubs for over 30 years have gathered.

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,500
What kind of things will they do?

29
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,500
Hoi Hoi Hoi Hoi Hoi Hoi Hoi Hoi Hoi

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,500
The last year's Wara-tsuwa is over

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,500
They are doing it again

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Everyone is over 50

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,500
The legendary battle between the villains is going to be a big success

34
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,500
The ones who will challenge this time are these people!

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Thank you very much!

36
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,500
There's a lot of emotions in this.

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
It's a legendary scenario.

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
You just want to make fun of us, right?

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
You just want to make us laugh, right?

40
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
There's no way we'll make fun of you!

41
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,500
There's only a bad ending when the script is written.

42
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
There's no happy ending.

43
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
There's no chance of everyone being together.

44
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Chigou-san and Koto-chan aren't together.

45
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I was the last one in the beginning.

46
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
I was the first one.

47
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
You were the one who did the prize money reserve.

48
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
I was the one who said that.

49
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
I wasn't the prize money reserve.

50
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
I was the Yokozawa-han.

51
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
That's what happened.

52
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Does that matter?

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
That was the time.

54
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
I was the Ishida-han.

55
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Yokozawa-han, huh.

56
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
How about age?

57
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
The oldest one is...

58
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Higo-chan and I are the same age.

59
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
Same as me

60
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
I was also there

61
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Why?

62
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Same as you

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Why?

64
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
I was walking there and I was already an old man

65
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
That's terrible

66
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Terrible

67
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
I was almost out of battery

68
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
We are also excited

69
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:41,500
The viewers of T, maybe they don't know unless they introduce them properly.

70
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Maybe they are the host or the actor.

71
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
I thought they were from TBS.

72
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
They are called employees.

73
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
They are called employees.

74
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Maybe they are the new faces.

75
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,500
They are the new faces of the news.

76
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
First, Mr. DownTown.

77
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
Mr. Hamada Masatoshi.

78
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
From there?

79
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
From here?

80
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
You're making fun of me from here too?

81
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
To make the teens understand,

82
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
I'm 53 years old.

83
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
53 years old.

84
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Hamada-san is a tsukkomi.

85
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Hamada-san is a black-haired Hamada-san.

86
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
He's in the picture now.

87
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Recently, he's been pretty silly.

88
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
That's true.

89
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
I'm not sure if it's because of the weather.

90
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
It's not like that.

91
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
It's completely a joke.

92
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Oh, I see.

93
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
It's a bit of a natural thing.

94
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
And the blonde one.

95
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
The blonde one.

96
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
It's Asumoto Hito.

97
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
He's a member of Yoshimoto Creative Agency.

98
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
He's been around for 35 years.

99
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
35 years.

100
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
He's from Amagasaki City, Hyogo Prefecture.

101
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
He's a star from Amagasaki.

102
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
It's the best place to be.

103
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,500
There are photos of your debut.

104
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Here they are.

105
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
The members of the team.

106
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
It's really cute.

107
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
It's really cute.

108
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
It's cute, right?

109
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Hama-san, you're really motivated.

110
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
That's right. Hama-san is really working hard.

111
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
This is a photo of when he was 18.

112
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,500
It's a photo of when he was 18.

113
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
There's one more.

114
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
One more!

115
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
This is a photo book, right?

116
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Yes, it is.

117
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
What is the meaning of the word, Hamada?

118
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
It's tied up.

119
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
Oh, it's tied up.

120
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Because he is a super idol.

121
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
A photo book is also a photo book.

122
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I was going to sell it like that.

123
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
That's right.

124
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Let me read the history of Downtown again.

125
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
Again?

126
00:05:50,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Downtown-san, the duo name is Matsumoto Hamada, Hitoshi Masashi, Aozora Teruo Haruo, they are now downtown brothers.

127
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Since their debut, they have been aiming for a new kind of comedy.

128
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
This is going to be a big hit.

129
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,500
They were once sent to the Yokoyama Yasushi Show to talk about their funny stories.

130
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,500
He was a famous comedian, actor, and a great poet.

131
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,500
He was a hit in many TV shows and was recognized by the whole country.

132
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
A few years ago, Matsumoto suddenly became a macho talent.

133
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
This was an unexpected event.

134
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
He is now a big star in the entertainment industry.

135
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
He is a genius.

136
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Tell me more about him.

137
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Tell me about his professional history.

138
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
How about you?

139
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
I heard that you were a big fan of Hiromi and Dao.

140
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,500
I was in Tokyo.

141
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,500
I heard about it and it was very popular in Osaka.

142
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,500
So I was very stupid and I thought he would fight with me.

143
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
I see.

144
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,500
I was a little bit around him but it wasn't like that.

145
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,500
At that time, young people were formed.

146
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,500
It was like the Sengoku period.

147
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
But did you feel it easily?

148
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,100
In the end, there were many similarities between this place and that place, right?

149
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,100
Yes, yes, yes.

150
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,300
What kind of similarities?

151
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,300
The father here and my father were from the same class.

152
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,900
Oh, it's a similarity.

153
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,600
Yes, it was Kagoshima.

154
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,400
Yes, yes, yes.

155
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,900
The one who went to Tokyo and the one who went to Osaka were separated.

156
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,100
That's what happened.

157
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,500
The weather in Kataya is the best.

158
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
It's the best.

159
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,000
That's right.

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,200
Hey, is there a relationship here?

161
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
I'm the same.

162
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
You guys are related.

163
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
I know.

164
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
No, no, no.

165
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
They are connected.

166
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
I did the program with them.

167
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Where did you do it?

168
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
We all met.

169
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
We all laughed.

170
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Our friends in this program.

171
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Let me introduce.

172
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
I'm going to do the ending!

173
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
No one laughed.

174
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
There wasn't much of a scene at the end.

175
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
How long did it last?

176
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
It was 5 or 6 times.

177
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
It was a rare scene.

178
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
That's terrible!

179
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
This member didn't do that.

180
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
What? Was there a squad?

181
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Yes

182
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
And there was a squad

183
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
By the way, Higo-san is Dan Dan's first impression

184
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
And he was in Hyokin Yubikko

185
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Megumi-san was in Hyokin Yubikko too

186
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Megumi was there

187
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Hyokin Yubikko was before that

188
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Hyokin Yubikko was at the very beginning

189
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Right

190
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
It was the first round

191
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Right

192
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
And there were 3 groups

193
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
There were 4 people.

194
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Oh, like Nambu Nambu.

195
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Yes, yes.

196
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Megwin was alone.

197
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
But Ishizuka was there too.

198
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,200
At that time, Yokosawa-san went to various places and gathered interesting people.

199
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
He said that the combination was not related.

200
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
It was a program that I did.

201
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Yes, yes.

202
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
In Kanto, Dachau Club is already an ace.

203
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
That time.

204
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
In downtown.

205
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
In downtown, Dachau Club always had 4 people.

206
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,200
We were all separated, but the group of birds always had 4 people.

207
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Yeah, we had to have 4 people.

208
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,200
We couldn't do anything without 4 people.

209
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,200
But if Higo-chan wasn't here, we wouldn't be in this industry.

210
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Why is that?

211
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Before we were on TV, we were on the show house of Roppongi.

212
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
There was a banana party.

213
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Serakado introduced us to that.

214
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
That was the question.

215
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,200
And then we were on TV.

216
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
We were on TV a lot.

217
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
We were on TV too.

218
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
There's a history like that.

219
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Ishizuka and Ichiha were on TV too.

220
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
This is still a downtown introduction.

221
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
There's still more.

222
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
This is scary.

223
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Everyone is on TV.

224
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Look at this.

225
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
20 minutes have passed.

226
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
I'm not a singer!

227
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Next is the profile of Higo of the butterfly club

228
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,200
He is a 53 year old butterfly club member

229
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
He is a singer

230
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
He is a member of Ota Production

231
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,200
He has 32 years of experience

232
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,200
He is from Okinawa, from Nahashi

233
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,200
We have a photo of Higo when he debuted

234
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,200
This is it.

235
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Ahhhh.

236
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
So, this is...

237
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
It was done by 4 people.

238
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
When Nanbu was there, Nanbu was the leader?

239
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Yes, he was the leader.

240
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
He was the oldest.

241
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Nanbu was amazing.

242
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,200
He carried a huge rabbit doll when he was called to the ice rink.

243
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
And he sat in front of it.

244
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
The camera...

245
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
His ears were in the way.

246
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
He asked, Nanbu, can you do something about the doll?

247
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Nambu-san said, I'll cut off your ears.

248
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Cut off ears?

249
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
The rabbit's ears.

250
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
You can take off the ears.

251
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Don't be scared.

252
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
It's okay to kill.

253
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm scared of the feeling.

254
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
That's Nambu-san.

255
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
That's Nambu-san.

256
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
I don't know if he cares about me or not.

257
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
I don't know that much now.

258
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
It's amazing.

259
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Nambu-san was great.

260
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Once again, I will introduce my background.

261
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Ryuhei-san, the Dachou Club was founded with Jimon-san, and has become a charisma of Oden, which comedians can pass through once.

262
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,200
In addition, it has been involved in a lot of reaction games, and has been involved in a lot of tea time.

263
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:28,200
And in 1993, the golden time of the show, the broadcast variety, Tsukami wa OK, started.

264
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,200
The result was a brave withdrawal in five months.

265
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
I wasn't aware of it.

266
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
There were four of us.

267
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
Nambu was still there.

268
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Nambu was strong.

269
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Nambu was already 80 years old.

270
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
What happened?

271
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I really don't know.

272
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
Nambu was a little older.

273
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
I said, this TV is interesting.

274
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
I pressed the switch and turned it off.

275
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,040
note

276
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,500
The peach добав存する

277
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,600
sorry

278
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,200
By pushing the off switch

279
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,400
👍

280
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,300
That's most sense

281
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,780
Is really real

282
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,080
really

283
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,120
Is really lie

284
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:53,320
A

285
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
I was asked, what are you talking about?

286
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Is that true?

287
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
That's amazing.

288
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
He said, either you die or you become a fool.

289
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
That means he can't die.

290
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
That's true.

291
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
After all, they broke up.

292
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
One day,

293
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Nambu said,

294
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
I don't want to play a fool anymore.

295
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
I have to make a concession from now on.

296
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
I said, I have to do it.

297
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,320
When I said that, the glasses were hanging diagonally.

298
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
I said, is that so?

299
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
The world is looking at you diagonally.

300
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
That's why I wanted to do it.

301
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Megumi-san and Higo-san at that time, how did you feel?

302
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,320
We often get together with the power of bananas.

303
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
You went to the banana farm, right?

304
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Yes, I did.

305
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,320
I often came to the Boro apartment in Shimokita.

306
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
I talked about how I could sell it.

307
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
You did that, didn't you?

308
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
I did.

309
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
You did, didn't you?

310
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
I had to pay about 40,000 yen for rent.

311
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
It's like...

312
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
It's like...

313
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
It's like an AV.

314
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
I don't know.

315
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,320
It's like the beginning of the movie.

316
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
It's like an AV as a production.

317
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Next is B21 Special, Hiromi's profile

318
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:31,320
This is Hiromi-san, B21 Special, 52 years old, leader of B Company, 31 years of experience, born in Tokyo, Hachioji

319
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,320
This is Hiromi-san's photo when he debuted

320
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,320
It's a little bit of a Thai style.

321
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,320
It's like Tokyo.

322
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,320
DC brand is popular.

323
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,320
I saw a little bit of a stylish three-man army wearing a DC brand.

324
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,320
Since then, comedians don't laugh so much in the photo.

325
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,320
The way he put his bangs is cool.

326
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
I'm not like that.

327
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
That's not true.

328
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
The king of the history, Hiromi.

329
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Mr. Jin and David Ito, together, created the B21 Special.

330
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Hiromi played the role of a former gang of gangsters.

331
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Takeshi was the uncle.

332
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
Tokoro was the Tokorochi.

333
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
Masayuki Sakai was the Machaaki.

334
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,320
And the senpai-gamer, called by nickname.

335
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,320
They were popular in 1993.

336
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,320
He married a famous idol, Iyo Matsumoto.

337
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:43,320
He became a hero of the famous idol, but he was rejected by the entertainment industry.

338
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:50,320
After 10 years, he broke up with a famous comedian.

339
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
He broke up with a famous comedian?

340
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,320
Yes, he broke up with a famous comedian.

341
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
It disappeared because of the incident.

342
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,320
What is it?

343
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
What is it?

344
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
It's a rumor, isn't it?

345
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
It was posted on the news.

346
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
It was posted on the news.

347
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
What do you think, Tanaka?

348
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,320
I think it's true.

349
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,320
You're really strange.

350
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,320
It's a lot of things.

351
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,320
So, really, everyone should be careful.

352
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,320
It's not like that.

353
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,320
There was nothing, right?

354
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:29,320
He's been talking about this for a long time, so I think he might be able to erase it.

355
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,320
What was Hiromi like?

356
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,320
It wasn't scary, but as you can see from the photo, it was fashionable.

357
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,320
The story was fashionable, and it was a so-called skit.

358
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,320
He started dancing Michael Jackson in the middle.

359
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:59,320
It's like going to a disco and when you enter the disco, Michael Jackson is dancing.

360
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,320
It's a story like that.

361
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
It's a proper dance.

362
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,320
All the girls debuted and became Kya Kya.

363
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
It was cool.

364
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
It was cool.

365
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,320
It was a three-person team that worked as a host.

366
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
I want to be an idol forever.

367
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
I'm always confused.

368
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
I watched a news program.

369
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,320
I put in a guest.

370
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
I do it every time.

371
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
That's amazing.

372
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
I like it every time.

373
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
Banana is a joke.

374
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Dachio is the same.

375
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,320
Everyone is good at it every time.

376
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
I do it every time.

377
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,320
I do a news program with a woman.

378
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,320
I do a news program in Tokyo.

379
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,320
I said I'll do it first and then do the next episode.

380
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,320
Everyone does the story after that program.

381
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,320
But I'm doing the next episode, so I'm the most popular.

382
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
I see.

383
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,320
I'll be in the corner all the time during the next episode.

384
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,320
If you're in the corner, you'll laugh.

385
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Don't say I'm cheating.

386
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,320
How do you sell it?

387
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,320
What was the first impression of Mr. Downtown and Mr. Hiromi?

388
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,320
Matching was hard to get used to.

389
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
It's a little bit tight, isn't it?

390
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
It's like air.

391
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
It was hard to stick it in.

392
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
It was like that.

393
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
Really?

394
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
It's tight.

395
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
I opened it recently.

396
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
It took a year or two.

397
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
It took a long time.

398
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
It took a long time.

399
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
I really opened it.

400
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
It took a year or two.

401
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
He opened it.

402
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,320
It took 30 years.

403
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
It was a long time

404
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Was Hamada-san open?

405
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
He was open

406
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
He was talking normally

407
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
He was eating

408
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
I was also like that

409
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
It was full open

410
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Did Hamada-san and Megumi-san go to eat?

411
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
They went to eat when we called them

412
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
That's amazing

413
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
It was a high-rise

414
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
That's amazing

415
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
That high-rise

416
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
It's not a back story

417
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,320
I went to the funeral of Mr. Ohyoji in Kichiranma

418
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
You were surprised?

419
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
I was surprised

420
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
I was surprised

421
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
No, that's not it

422
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
It's your own feeling

423
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,320
Please say it with your own will

424
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,320
A man over 50 years old can't go

425
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
What is it?

426
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,320
The last is Megumi Toshiaki

427
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
Megumi Toshiaki

428
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,460
Honjamaka, 52 years old, is in charge of the

429
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,460
Kagoshima scene

430
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,460
Here is Megumi's debut photo

431
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,460
I'm fat

432
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,460
I'm fat

433
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,460
Ah, really

434
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,460
Because I was round

435
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,460
I was fatter than this

436
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,460
I see

437
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,460
I was really fat

438
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,460
I was fat

439
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,460
I think it was when I lost weight

440
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,460
No, no

441
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,460
I'm a little thin

442
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,460
I'm a little thin

443
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,460
I was a little round

444
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,460
I was a little round

445
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,460
I think there are many generations that don't know the real Honjamaka.

446
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,460
These two are the same.

447
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,460
Let's review the history.

448
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,460
When he debuted, his partner was Ishizuka, who was familiar with his eyebrows.

449
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,460
Megumi was popular as the manly person of Honjamaka.

450
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:22,460
At that time, he started a big image with the current Summers.

451
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,460
He will live a life of a comedian full of pure air.

452
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:31,220
and then a few years later, he became a comedian and after the news silence turned into TV

453
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:37,580
the person I'm sure is Min Watanabe, will be the most Nicolas fill cues, he has caught the camera

454
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:45,060
while his life was f辛 lock As an ordinary comedian, I wouldn't know what really happen to him

455
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:52,440
So with that said, this posts of For you at noon

456
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,440
How many years have you been doing this?

457
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,440
I don't really know.

458
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,440
8 years?

459
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,440
8 years?

460
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,440
8 years?

461
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,440
If you look at Hiroshi Sekiguchi, Megwin is the only one.

462
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,340
He has the

463
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,340
I think he has it.

464
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,340
Have you always felt that way? Hiroshi, what was it like?

465
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:28,340
When I was young, I would say some vulgar jokes and I would do it at late night.

466
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,340
I don't remember it at all.

467
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,340
You are a dirty comedian.

468
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,340
Yes, I am.

469
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,340
You wear a leotard and wrap a tissue around a girl who is dancing.

470
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:46,340
I would go to a disco with a leotard and ask them to change me into a leotard.

471
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,340
It's a great project.

472
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,340
Actually, it's better to do it at night.

473
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,340
You're right.

474
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,340
Now it's day off.

475
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,340
Yes, it is.

476
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,340
Now it's day off.

477
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,340
Now that the team members have been enlightened, I would like to explain the rules.

478
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,340
From here!

479
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,340
Do it!

480
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,340
From here!

481
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,340
I think it's the first one.

482
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,340
I used to watch a video like this.

483
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,340
I want to talk about many things and say the last one is ***

484
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,340
It's long

485
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,340
You have to endure it and say the last one is ***

486
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,340
You have to endure it and say the last one is ***

487
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,340
That's important

488
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,340
It's important

489
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,340
3, 2, 1, go

490
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,340
Look over there

491
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,340
Hoi! Hoi! Hoi! Hoi!

492
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,340
The 50-year-old man is finally opening up with a hoi-bata!

493
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,340
You took my neck!

494
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,340
He is the one who is chasing after him

495
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,340
When this is over, we'll be going to the Hiryu-Obi, right?

496
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,340
Will this continue like this?

497
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,340
What will happen?
