1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the first episode of Gakyu no Tsukai, we're going to celebrate our 10th anniversary!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Mokutte Mokutte Scuba Diving!

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey, Gakyu no Tsukai!

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hey, hey, hey!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Say something!

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're doing something rude!

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's just a bad thing.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Say something!

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What are you doing?!

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Is this okay?!

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You're doing it the wrong way.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's our 10th anniversary!

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I see.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're going to have a scuba diving experience!

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What?

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Challenge!

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Do it!

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's take a commemorative photo underwater.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I see.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I've never done it before.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's why we're doing it!

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're bad at it, so we're doing it!

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The engine's running.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're bad at it, so you've never done it before, right?

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So take off your hat!

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Wait a minute!

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's why we're doing the scuba diving!

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes, yes!

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes!

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes, yes!

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes, yes!

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'd like everyone to see my scuba diving.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is...

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Why are you doing it?

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is my second time.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I've done it twice.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Do you have a license?

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't need a license for scuba diving.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You do!

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't need it.

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How about you, Tanaka?

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I've done it three times.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You've done it three times?

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Really?

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Where did you do it?

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I went to Ishigaki Island.

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's not true. I went to Australia.

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Australia!

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Australia!

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Really?

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Australia is a mountain.

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Australia, right?

53
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Australia.

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Australia!

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This time, the scuba diving will take place in the OK Marine Pro 5m deep pool.

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
As you can see, this is the first time Hamada and Endo have dived only twice.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Will they be able to take photos underwater?

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yamachan's scuba diving!

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Thank you.

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is the first time I've taught you.

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
If you teach me something strange here, I'll kill you.

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If you do it half-heartedly...

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll never do it half-heartedly.

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
First of all...

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's normal, right?

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's normal, right?

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's really half-heartedly.

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
First of all, you can't lick the sea.

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's written in red.

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You can't lick the sea.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes.

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's normal.

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why?

76
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You can't lick the sea.

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's all I'm going to say.

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hey!

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't laugh!

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm just saying the same thing over and over again.

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Is that okay?

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Please put this in the corner of your head.

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In the corner?

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Isn't it the most important thing to write in red?

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Just put it in the corner.

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You can't lick the sea.

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Next!

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Next is the name of the scuba equipment.

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
First of all, the mask.

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The underwater mask.

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm definitely going to use the underwater mask.

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And the regulator.

94
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The regulator is the tail of the mouth.

95
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The tail of the mouth?

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What is the tail of the mouth?

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's where you breathe.

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's where you breathe.

99
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And the auxiliary air source.

100
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This is written as the source of the air.

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's called the air source.

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No, it's not.

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's not that.

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Tell me what it is.

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's a special case.

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What kind of thing is this?

107
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is the pressure gauge of the air pressure.

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This is how much air is left.

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Next is the basic knowledge of diving.

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
First of all, the knowledge to average the pressure.

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If you remember discomfort when you dive.

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What kind of thing is discomfort?

113
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You have discomfort, right?

114
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What do you mean?

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I feel a little uncomfortable now.

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ear removal.

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Please remove your ear.

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If you can't remove your ear properly.

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The eardrum in the back.

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You'll break it.

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I can't do it.

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I won't explain it in English anymore.

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Please tell me how to remove your ear.

124
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Please close your nose.

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's your first time, right?

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's my first time, too.

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You have to do it.

128
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You're going to break your eardrum.

129
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Close your mouth.

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't you put this in when you dive?

131
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I put it in.

132
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I put it in, but my ears...

133
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Do you put your nose like this?

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes, please put your nose in.

135
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But your nose is like this.

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's like a mask.

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But the mask has a hole so that the nose can be pinched.

138
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is that so?

139
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Did you have a hole?

140
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't you have a hole?

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're all starting.

142
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's from above, right?

143
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If you have a hole, you'll have a hole.

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
There's a hole.

145
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The mask has a dent to make it easier to pinch the nose, not a hole.

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
How do you do it?

147
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I breathe in like this, and then I breathe out like this.

148
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's hard to understand.

149
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Breathe in, and then breathe out like this.

150
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
When you take out your ears, you have to look down, pinch your nose, and when you bite your nose, you have to push the air out.

151
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You can do it when you're on a plane and your ears hurt.

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You have to feel the air coming out of your ears.

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No, I can't do this.

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You can't do this.

155
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If you can't do this, you'll never be able to dive.

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't think I can dive.

157
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Please do it, Mr. Amada.

158
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is also important.

159
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Next is the lungs.

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You go down like this, right?

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There's a bubble that comes up, right?

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If you go further than that, your lungs will burst, and you'll get sick.

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Really?

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If that's the case, I'll quit.

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There's a lot of diseases.

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Are you okay?

167
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If you go further than that, you'll get sick.

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You'll get sick.

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Are you okay?

170
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's like an illness.

171
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's called a diving disease.

172
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Really?

173
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Isn't that a disease?

174
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's like this.

175
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't know what's going to happen next.

176
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What?

177
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What's going to happen next?

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
If you go up suddenly, your lungs won't be able to withstand the change in air pressure.

179
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't panic.

180
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Slowly continue to go up while breathing.

181
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Next is a hand signal that is important to protect yourself in the water.

182
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's a trouble signal.

183
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is it.

184
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Matsumoto-san, this is it.

185
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It was really like this in Buramo.

186
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Lastly, it's time for Yamazaki-sensei's question corner.

187
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay, then.

188
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay, end.

189
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Today is a poll, so it's like this.

190
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If sharks come out, what should we do?

191
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
When sharks come out, I'll definitely meet them.

192
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What?

193
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's right.

194
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If they come out, I'll meet them.

195
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If you encounter sharks, don't panic.

196
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Wait for them to pass by the rocks nearby.

197
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What if you catch a shark's leg?

198
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
When I catch a shark's leg, I'll definitely meet them.

199
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What?

200
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What if I catch a shark's leg?

201
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What if you catch a shark's leg?

202
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll remove the regulator and the fins.

203
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll remove everything.

204
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll be naked.

205
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's a festival.

206
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's a diving festival.

207
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll be naked.

208
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You're wearing a suit and practicing in the pool.

209
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're the opposite.

210
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Zaki-san.

211
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Are you okay?

212
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Zaki-san.

213
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
First, get used to the water.

214
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's something that can be removed neatly.

215
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's amazing.

216
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay.

217
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's go.

218
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Why do you keep looking at me?

219
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're always looking at me.

220
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What are you doing?

221
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You can't turn around at all.

222
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's amazing.

223
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You're always looking at us.

224
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'll show you how to swim.

225
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What?

226
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You did it, didn't you?

227
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Contact.

228
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This is so much fun.

229
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This is so cool.

230
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is amazing.

231
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm already floating.

232
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I can do it with this.

233
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It feels good.

234
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
This is amazing.

235
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This is so much fun.

236
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I can do it with this.

237
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
This is so much fun.

238
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This is an important ear removal exercise.

239
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's go.

240
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Please come out.

241
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You can do it, right?

242
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes.

243
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You can do it.

244
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You can do it.

245
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You can do it.

246
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You're fast.

247
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I did it, but I don't know what happened.

248
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It doesn't hurt yet, does it?

249
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It doesn't hurt yet, does it?

250
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It doesn't hurt yet, does it?

251
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It doesn't hurt yet, does it?

252
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It doesn't hurt yet, does it?

253
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I can't do it.

254
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I want to put it in.

255
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But it's too deep.

256
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's too deep.

257
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm scared.

258
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm going to do it here.

259
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You're lying.

260
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're lying.

261
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is so sad.

262
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And he's wearing a scuba suit.

263
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm going to break my ankle.

264
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He's going to break his ankle.

265
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Pink.

266
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Pink?

267
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I've been very happy up to here.

268
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I've been very happy up to here.

269
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Let's go.

270
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm going to dive if I have time.

271
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm going to dive if I have time.

272
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm going to dive if I have time.

273
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
OK.

274
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Hamada is showing a high tension.

275
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Will he be able to make it to the commemorative photo?

276
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Why are you laughing?

277
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You should be a professional.

278
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What are you doing?

279
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's a butterfly knot.

280
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
No!

281
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's a shoulder knot.

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Next is breathing training underwater.

283
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
From the top of the hose.

284
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
From where?

285
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
From the bottom.

286
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
From the top of the hose.

287
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
This is Hamada's first challenge.

288
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I can't do it.

289
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You can do it, right?

290
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
If you can't do it here, you can't do it here.

291
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Hamada is getting used to the water while practicing several times.

292
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Hamada is getting used to the water while practicing several times.

293
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The other members are breathing in the water.

294
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So far, everyone is doing well in scuba diving.

295
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm the only one who's breathing in the water.

296
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's too much water.

297
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Too much water?

298
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I think I'll be fine today.

299
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll show you how to swim.

300
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Is this okay?

301
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's okay.

302
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's okay.

303
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Hamada, are you okay?

304
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm okay.

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'd like to learn how to deal with the water in the mask.

306
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Are you ready?

307
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes.

308
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Listen carefully.

309
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Are you listening?

310
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes, I'm listening.

311
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You're not listening.

312
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm listening.

313
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm listening.

314
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm listening.

315
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm listening.

316
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
There are times when water comes into the mask.

317
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
When the water comes in, push it up and take it out.

318
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Do it.

319
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm just making a sound.

320
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's coming out.

321
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Put the squid in.

322
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Put the squid in.

323
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's in.

324
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's scary, isn't it?

325
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's coming out.

326
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's coming out.

327
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's coming out.

328
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's coming out.

329
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's coming out.

330
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's coming out.

331
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's coming out.

332
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's coming out.

333
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's coming out.

334
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
There are other ways to deal with water problems.

335
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Next, I'll teach you how to remove the regulator.

336
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What do you mean?

337
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Maybe you can remove the regulator.

338
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No, it's not like that.

339
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Do it properly.

340
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Why do I have to remove it?

341
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Remove it once.

342
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
If you bump into it.

343
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
If you bump into it.

344
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And then the other regulator.

345
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
There's another one.

346
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Give it to the person next to you.

347
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
If you remove it in here, the water will come in together.

348
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There's this button, right?

349
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah.

350
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Push it hard.

351
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Push it once.

352
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And then the air won't go in.

353
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What?

354
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The water won't go in.

355
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What are you talking about?

356
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You're going to kill me.

357
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm about to die.

358
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I won't kill you.

359
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The water won't go in.

360
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, that's what it is.

361
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I see.

362
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's so big.

363
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Let's try it.

364
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll do it first.

365
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll do it first.

366
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Really?

367
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Everyone is passing the regulator to the person next to them in the water.

368
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Will they succeed?

369
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't make me laugh.

370
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Please remove it.

371
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
How is it?

372
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Listen to me.

373
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You're not letting me do it.

374
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You're not letting me do it.

375
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm doing it, but you're not letting me do it.

376
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's not going well at all.

377
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He's being taught by everyone and he's doing it alone.

378
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Put it in like this.

379
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Put it in?

380
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yes.

381
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And then add this.

382
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If you do it like this, it'll be fine.

383
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Ready, start.

384
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You're weak.

385
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're weak.

386
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You changed your character.

387
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Is it okay?

388
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Ready, start.

389
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

390
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I did it.

391
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I did it.

392
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Let's go to the last gate.

393
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Let's take a commemorative photo at the pool.

394
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It doesn't have to be there.

395
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
No, no, no, let's take it there.

396
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This is my ideal.

397
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's right.

398
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I understand your ideal.

399
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This is impossible.

400
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There's a bench down there.

401
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That might be true, but I can't go that far.

402
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Dan-dan-san.

403
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm in the middle.

404
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Put it here.

405
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Is this called a goggles?

406
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yes.

407
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Do I take this off with my tongue?

408
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes, take it off.

409
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What?

410
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
This is the ideal.

411
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I want you to take it off.

412
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's okay.

413
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
With Mr. Waraka.

414
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
If it ends with a tongue, it'll be like this.

415
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's dangerous.

416
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Then I'd like to do it now.

417
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yes.

418
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
First of all, for example, if something happens.

419
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
When you get sick or get hurt.

420
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll make sure that this person is responsible.

421
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's my own responsibility.

422
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll take it off.

423
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Say it to the camera.

424
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's crazy.

425
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It means you're the one who's bad.

426
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Right?

427
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's my fault.

428
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It doesn't matter to me.

429
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You did it, right?

430
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Okay, I'm done.

431
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Okay.

432
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
So, 5 meters.

433
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If you go 5 meters, your head will explode.

434
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Dan-dan, let's have two people take it off.

435
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Just the two of us?

436
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
When?

437
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
After everyone takes it off.

438
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The two of us who remain.

439
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Only Dan-dan.

440
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
This is the pose.

441
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
A funny pose.

442
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
A funny pose.

443
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
This is a 5-meter-long shooting set.

444
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
One by one, they go down to this place.

445
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
First of all, Yamazaki.

446
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Good luck.

447
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It hurts.

448
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It hurts.

449
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Let's do it one by one.

450
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It went.

451
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
5 meters.

452
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It went.

453
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's amazing.

454
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
He's crazy.

455
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
He's an idiot.

456
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm going.

457
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Why can you stand on the ground?

458
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
If I go down, I'll break.

459
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Really?

460
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Hurry up.

461
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm a gay.

462
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't get it.

463
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't get it.

464
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm getting more confident.

465
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This is impossible.

466
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
My head will explode.

467
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's a shocking video.

468
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't care if my head explodes on a TV program.

469
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Can I put this on?

470
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Sure.

471
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That's it.

472
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yes.

473
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I can't use this.

474
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I've been doing this for 10 years.

475
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You did a good job.

476
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It was fun today.

477
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I've been doing this for 10 years.

478
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It was really fun today.

479
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Thank you very much.

480
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'll prepare a meal for you later.

481
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll prepare a meal for you later.

482
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Can they take a 5-meter-long commemorative photo?

483
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
There are only two people left in downtown.

484
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If Hamada can't go, I can't go.

485
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's go.

486
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's okay.

487
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Hamada failed to take a picture.

488
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I think I can do it.

489
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's hard.

490
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Hamada failed.

491
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Put the pen down.

492
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's hard.

493
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's hard.

494
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This is easy.

495
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Let's go.

496
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I feel like I can hear it.

497
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
There it is.

498
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's going.

499
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's going up.

500
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
My ears hurt.

501
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I can't do it.

502
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
My head is about to explode.

503
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
They failed again.

504
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'll try it.

505
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'll try it.

506
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
My head and ears hurt.

507
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Take a deep breath.

508
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
My ears hurt.

509
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
My ears hurt.

510
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Matsumoto also failed.

511
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's hard to go down to the bottom.

512
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Matsumoto will do a side challenge.

513
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Matsumoto did his best.

514
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Hamada is the only one left.

515
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And the last challenge.

516
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Hamada is doing his best to take a picture.

517
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
The photo was taken after this.

518
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Is it taken?

519
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Can't you see it?

520
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
There is a hose on the neck.

521
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I can't move.

522
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It looks like it's done.

523
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's the 10th anniversary.

524
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's a beautiful photo.

525
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm sure it's good.

526
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'll take a picture.

527
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I was looking at everyone from above.

528
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm counting on you.

529
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's a photo for the viewer as a gift, right?

530
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Of course.

531
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I've been pinching my nose all the time.

532
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
This challenge was done by Downtown, which is always said to be cowardly.

533
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Their courage impressed us.

534
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Thank you, Downtown.

535
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
This is a memorable photo.

536
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And a wonderful downtown two-shot.
