00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ladies and Gentlemen

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ladies and Gentlemen

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today you look like a manga artist

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yes, I look like a manga artist

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Today, you are doing a punishment game at 5.29 am

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yes, I'm doing it

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Of course, of course Kohaku will win

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes, yes, yes

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I thought so

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes, yes, yes

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Actually, I watched Kohaku too

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I watched it too, for some reason this year

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You watched it, right?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yachiyo no Kai came out

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes, yes, yes

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And gave me a card

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, yes, yes

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I watched it

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Here you go

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's all white

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What is this?

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I watched it

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And I showed it to the audience

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And everyone in the audience gave me a card

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And I looked like I had a lot of red

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Really?

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yachiyo no Kai has a lot of red

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Really?

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The audience gave you a lot of red

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Kohaku, I really don't feel like I lost

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I still have it

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, this can't be helped, so I let it go

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, after that

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, after watching the video

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
My brain is

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Brain?

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You said brain

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Please monitor it

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Did you actually watch it this morning?

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You guys are out

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Please watch the punishment game

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This is

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This is

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Are you stupid?

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Are you stupid?

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I am

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I am

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's pretty long

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's pretty long

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Are you stupid?

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Are you stupid?

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is the first job of ITele this year

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm on it

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This is

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
JOH TV Channel 4

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is Japanese TV

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is Hayami Yu's American Kiss

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Please watch

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I am

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I am

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I didn't lose to Hamada

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Kobayashi Sachiko lost to luck

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If you could have been there

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't know that mistake

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's true

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Kobayashi Sachiko did it

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I would have lost

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you could have been there

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I would have made a big difference

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm saying this again

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Matsumoto Matakai

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You are a great person

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You might say that

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I was picking up pachinko

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I was picking up pachinko

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What happened?

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You were picking up pachinko

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I was picking up pachinko

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I saw the pachinko

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Thank you

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Thank you

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Thank you

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is Yamaoka Yuza

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This is

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This is

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This is

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This is

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This is

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:12,000
This is

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This is

101
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This is

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is

103
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This is

105
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Hello

106
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm glad you invited me to Yoshimoto

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's all

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You were on that show

109
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
After the show ended, you called me

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You didn't say a single word

111
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You were on the show

112
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I didn't know

113
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You were on the show

114
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You liked this song

115
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
After the show ended, you didn't say a single word

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You must have made a mistake

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I shouldn't have done that

118
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If I hadn't made a mistake, I would have called you 20 times

119
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Is that so?

120
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Ha ha

121
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What's with the ha ha?

122
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What?

123
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You're scary

124
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I was doing it

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Stop it

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's the result

127
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's the result

128
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I wanted you to be on the show

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What are you talking about?

130
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I wouldn't have been punished if I had told you

131
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What?

132
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's nothing

133
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You scared me

134
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You were awake

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You were in the opposite position

136
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I was sleeping

137
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You were awake

138
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I wouldn't have been punished

139
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Were you watching TV?

140
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I was watching

141
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You were awake and you were still awake after the show ended

142
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I wouldn't have been punished if I had told you

143
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's the same

144
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What?

145
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't want to be on the show anymore

146
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Shut up

147
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I didn't do anything wrong

148
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Why should I be punished?

149
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I told you

150
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I can win

151
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You think you can win?

152
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I won't be punished if I get 200,000 yen

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's cheap

154
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's like rugby

155
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I didn't do anything wrong

156
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Other players were playing

157
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You were playing

158
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Wait

159
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Rugby

160
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
My mouth smells

161
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Whose mouth smells?

162
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
My mouth says it's going to be sour

163
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm really good at sports

164
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Even if I get sick for a week or two

165
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I have a lot of power in rugby

166
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You can do it

167
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What are you doing?

168
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I haven't put on makeup

169
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll do it

170
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sure I can win

171
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That was funny

172
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You guys are funny

173
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But I'm the only one who gets embarrassed

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You can't even come to my house

175
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What are you going to do if you can't come?

176
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I can't turn it around

177
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't want to do it anymore

178
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I can't sleep

179
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I can't sleep

180
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't want to do it anymore

181
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's good

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's good

183
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It started this year

184
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Do you have a day off this year?

185
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't have a day off

186
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You have a lot of days off

187
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I was playing at home

188
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I bought a kotatsu

189
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I was playing at home

190
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That's good

191
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Where are you going?

192
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Where are you going?

193
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This is the first time

194
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm talking to you

195
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't have a day off

196
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
This is the first time

197
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Really

198
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And I'm sitting here

199
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I can't stop

200
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I know who I am

201
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm a person who can't tell the cause

202
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Maybe

203
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I had this face

204
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm bleeding

205
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It started

206
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I can't get on

207
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I was walking down the street

208
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I was looking at you

209
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I was happy

210
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You were late

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I was late

212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You were telling your boyfriend

213
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I can't tell

214
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
My boyfriend is okay

215
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I can't tell

216
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
My boyfriend is okay

217
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I can't tell

218
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
My boyfriend is okay

219
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That's good

220
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I came here with a strong will, so I thought this girl would be the same.

221
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's right, that's right.

222
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's what I thought!

223
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's what you thought.

224
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Somehow, this...

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
She's back!

226
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
She's back!

227
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I was just talking about you!

228
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Ah, the guest!

229
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Congratulations!

230
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Ah, I'm glad, I'm glad.

231
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm glad, I'm glad.

232
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I won't say it to everyone anymore.

233
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I won't say it to everyone anymore.

234
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I already know everything.

235
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I won't say it to everyone anymore.

236
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Ah, I'm glad, I'm glad.

237
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But, I'm glad you brought it.

238
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Right?

239
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I was relieved.

240
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's really rare.

241
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It can't be helped.

242
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Right?

243
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Ah, I'm glad.

244
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What were you talking about?

245
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That you bought a kotatsu.

246
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Ah, when I talk about kotatsu,

247
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
there are people who stand up, aren't there?

248
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
There are, aren't there?

249
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I bought a kotatsu.

250
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You bought rice.

251
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I bought rice.

252
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Ah, did you hear that?

253
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's a pattern!

254
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's a pattern!

255
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
There's still more.

256
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
There's still more, there's still more.

257
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
No, really, it was a good price.

258
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
There's still more, isn't there?

259
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Why is it so big?

260
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's on the side.

261
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's a star, isn't it?

262
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's Nanga-sama, isn't it?

263
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's amazing, it's amazing.

264
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's amazing, it's amazing.

265
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Who is it?

266
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There's still more.

267
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
No, this time, I just took my parents with me.

268
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You just took them with you?

269
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What?

270
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I just took my parents with me.

271
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's the first and the last time.

272
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Ah, your grandma,

273
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and my dad,

274
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and my mom,

275
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and my sister, right?

276
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh, your sister went too?

277
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yes.

278
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And me, my brother-in-law, my sister-in-law,

279
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
my brother-in-law's father and mother-in-law,

280
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
and last year, I went too,

281
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
but I'm riding on the Orix picture,

282
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and the couple there,

283
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and the parents and sister there,

284
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's a circus!

285
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That's amazing!

286
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It was really hard.

287
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Where did you go?

288
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I went to Gamu.

289
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I went to Hawaii last year, and then to Gamu,

290
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
but it wasn't fun at all.

291
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Why?

292
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I've never been to Gamu.

293
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Only the entertainer, Mitchan.

294
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What about Mitchan?

295
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Did he come with his husband?

296
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
With his child.

297
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I thought I'd go again.

298
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I went to a duty-free shop or a shop,

299
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and they talked to me,

300
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and I said,

301
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm going to take pictures,

302
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
so don't do that!

303
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It was going on like that,

304
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and I was sleeping, eating.

305
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And the woman in front of me was like,

306
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Hama-chan, Hama-chan!

307
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I looked at her,

308
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and the woman wearing glasses was looking at me,

309
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and I thought I'd go again.

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I didn't know what to do,

311
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
so I took her out and said,

312
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Hama-chan, Hama-chan!

313
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I looked at her,

314
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and she was so ugly!

315
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Who is this?

316
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I looked at Mitchan.

317
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh, Egbo.

318
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's Egbo's true identity.

319
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Why do you have a dent?

320
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What is it?

321
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This is,

322
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
in the past,

323
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
once,

324
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I've been dented.

325
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You've been dented?

326
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Once in the past.

327
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
By whom?

328
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That depends on each person.

329
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh.

330
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Why?

331
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's why I said,

332
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
why?

333
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That's because the reasons are different.

334
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If the reasons are different,

335
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
does that mean you're all dented?

336
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You're dented here.

337
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yes, yes, yes.

338
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
How did you get dented?

339
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That's why there are so many reasons!

340
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That's why I didn't say it!

341
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I said,

342
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
say at least one example.

343
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I said,

344
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
say at least one example.

345
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I see, I see, I see.

346
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's how it is.

347
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's right.

348
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
If you don't say it,

349
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
everyone won't be convinced.

350
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
This is,

351
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
this is a good thing

352
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
you just said,

353
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Hama-chan.

354
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Egbo-san,

355
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
an elementary school student,

356
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
a fourth grader,

357
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Egbo-san,

358
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
let's take her as an example.

359
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It doesn't matter who it is.

360
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Hurry up and say it.

361
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's a girl.

362
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
At that time,

363
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
my father,

364
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
um,

365
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
got dented.

366
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
This Egbo-san,

367
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
um,

368
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
is from Tokyo.

369
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
She's from Tokyo.

370
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So,

371
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
my father got dented,

372
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and had to go to Hokkaido.

373
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I thought about it simply.

374
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But,

375
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
um,

376
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
for a fourth grader,

377
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Egbo-san,

378
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
it's the most important time,

379
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
so,

380
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
my father and Hama-chan...

381
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Don't say that!

382
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Say that!

383
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
How did you get dented?

384
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You should say it!

385
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'll say it, so shut up!

386
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Don't say that!

387
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's not good, is it?

388
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Even though you're here,

389
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
you're with your family.

390
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Don't say that!

391
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So,

392
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
with your family,

393
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
you're going to Hokkaido, aren't you?

394
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yes, yes.

395
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Actually,

396
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Egbo-san,

397
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
your favorite man...

398
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Don't say that!

399
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Say it!

400
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So,

401
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
finally,

402
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
the day of moving...

403
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Hurry up and say it.

404
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
...has come.

405
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Hurry up and say it.

406
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You did it, didn't you?

407
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Did you go to Hokkaido?

408
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Um,

409
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
well,

410
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I took the train to Hokkaido.

411
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I have to say goodbye to everyone.

412
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Egbo!

413
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Egbo?

414
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No, Egbo-san.

415
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Egbo!

416
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It doesn't have to be a special name.

417
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Egbo!

418
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Why?

419
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Say it.

420
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's terrible!

421
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Don't say that!

422
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What?

423
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Hurry up and say it!

424
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Egbo,

425
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
what?

426
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Egbo,

427
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I take the train to Hokkaido,

428
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I take the train at this time.

429
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm telling you.

430
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But,

431
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
when the train is about to depart,

432
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
the man doesn't come.

433
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So,

434
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I take the train,

435
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and I pass a mountain road,

436
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
but on top of the mountain,

437
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
there's a man waving his hand.

438
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
When Eiko sees this,

439
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Pee!

440
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm sorry.

442
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You said you were peeved.

443
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
No, I was really peeved mentally.

444
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I gave you a bad example.

445
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's the example of a person who is emotional.

446
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's right.

447
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Well, that's what it is.

448
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So, um...

449
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What are you doing?

450
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Peeing.

451
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That's right.

452
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's right.

453
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
The other day, I was so full that I ate a crab until I died.

454
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What is that?

455
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh, really?

456
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I ate a lot.

457
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh, really?

458
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yes.

459
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What?

460
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You said you were full and ate a crab.

461
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
How do you say that?

462
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That's good.

463
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
There's a little more.

464
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What kind of person is that?

465
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Wait a minute.

466
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I was so full that I ate a crab until I died.

467
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I ate a crab.
