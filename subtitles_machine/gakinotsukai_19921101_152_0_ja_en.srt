1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
Next time on Gaki no Tsukai Arahen!

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,900
There's one more opening.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,700
Next time on Gaki no Tsukai Arahen!

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,100
Who will be the victim of Tsukitsuki Touka's face?!

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,800
Well, as the title says, who will be the victim?

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,300
That being said, there's one more big theme this time.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,700
After all, it's about making Yamazaki stand alone.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,400
Is that so?

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,400
Of course it is.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,800
Well, that's the reaction to that.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,800
There's Yamazaki in that song, though.

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Actually, I have a strong desire to make Yamazaki stand alone.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Ah, so it's still going on.

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
It's a big deal.

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
I see, I see.

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
I'll be doing that for another season.

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
Ah, is that so?

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
There's only one left, though.

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Ah, is that so?

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Yes.

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Well then, I'd like to start right away.

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,800
First of all, in front of everyone,

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,800
we have these transparent balls.

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
In these balls, one by one,

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800
we'll put faces on them.

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Please put your faces on them.

27
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Only one person!

28
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
There's someone putting their faces inside the ball.

29
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Well then, let's start right away.

30
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
Ready!

31
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
Poker Face!

32
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Who's the victim?

33
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Ready!

34
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Put them on!

35
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
Don't open your eyes.

36
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,800
If I open my eyes, it'll be bad, right?

37
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
Yeah.

38
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Ah, that face.

39
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Wow, Yamazaki's face is so dirty.

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Wow.

41
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Wow, Sugachan's face is the worst.

42
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,800
This year, you're making fun of me.

43
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,800
What number do you think Mano-san is?

44
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Number 4.

45
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Number 4 is easy to put on.

46
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
Number 4 is easy to put on.

47
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Now, who's the victim?

48
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,800
There's no victim!

49
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,800
The victim is Yamazaki!

50
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Next, we'll have everyone put on a mask.

51
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Only one person!

52
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,800
There's someone putting their faces inside the ball.

53
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
That's why it's a pack.

54
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Everyone, please look.

55
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Like this.

56
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
It's like this.

57
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Because it's a pack.

58
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
It's good, right?

59
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Well then, let's start right away.

60
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Everyone, please get ready.

61
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Let's go!

62
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Ready!

63
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
That's right, that's right.

64
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
That's right, that's right.

65
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
That's right.

66
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
That's right.

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
That's right.

68
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
That's right.

69
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,800
It's fine if you're stopped.

70
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Put your glasses on!

71
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Put your glasses on!

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,800
There we go.

73
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Nice.

74
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,800
What should I do?

75
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
What should I do?

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
This is a hard place to be.

77
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
This is a hard place to be.

78
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Let's slowly increase the time.

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Let's slowly increase the time.

80
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
What should I do?

81
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Obviously, your actions are wrong.

82
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Hidai-sama! Who is it?

83
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Oh, it's you!

84
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Oh, it's you!

85
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Actually, we have headphones in front of you.

86
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Well, the music is playing, but...

87
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Only one person!

88
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
That glass...

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
With his nails, like this...

90
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Like this...

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
That sound is playing.

92
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Let's go!

93
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Hidai-sama!

94
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Who is it?

95
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Hidai-sama! Who is it?

96
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
I don't know this.

97
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Hey, Mr. Yamazaki.

98
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Yes.

99
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
The main character, Mr. Yamazaki, has a runny nose.

100
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Well, it's his way of listening to music.

101
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Oh, is that so?

102
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
It's easy to get on.

103
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
It's easy to get on.

104
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Well, let's go!

105
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Hidai-sama!

106
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Who is it?

107
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
I don't know this.

108
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
It's easy to get on.

109
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Huh?

110
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
No, no.

111
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Huh?

112
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
It's easy to get on, isn't it?

113
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
No.

114
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Ah, well, that's right.

115
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Well, let's continue.

116
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Yes.

117
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Well, in front of you, on the table...

118
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Yes.

119
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Well, gum is prepared.

120
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Oh.

121
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Well, um...

122
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Everyone is chewing gum.

123
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Only one person!

124
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
It's Gin.

125
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
It's Gin.

126
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Wow.

127
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Let's sing.

128
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Let's sing.

129
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Hidai-sama!

130
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Who is it?

131
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Mr. Takahashi is crying.

132
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
I'm not crying.

133
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Huh?

134
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
I'm not crying.

135
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Why are you crying?

136
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
I'm not crying.

137
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Why are you crying?

138
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
I'm not crying.

139
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Huh?

140
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
You're crying all by yourself.

141
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Ha ha ha.

142
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
What is this opening?

143
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Why are you crying all of a sudden?

144
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Well, that's number two.

145
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Yes.

146
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Hidai-sama!

147
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Who is it?

148
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Ha ha ha.

149
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Ha ha ha.

150
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Wow.

151
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Wow.

152
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Ha ha ha.

153
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
It's so big.

154
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
It's so big.

155
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Ha ha ha.

156
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Wow.

157
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
The last one.

158
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Yeah.

159
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Well, you're tired.

160
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
I prepared something sweet.

161
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Oh, oh, oh.

162
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Well, in front of you,

163
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
um, a shake.

164
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I prepared it.

165
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Oh.

166
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Marium has been prepared.

167
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
I've never drunk this before.

168
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Me neither.

169
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
It's very disgusting.

170
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
It seems to be very disgusting.

171
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,800
And after drinking it, you have to drink something like this.

172
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
If you don't drink it.

173
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
If you don't drink it.

174
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Poop is hard!

175
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Poop doesn't harden!

176
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
It seems to harden like a stone.

177
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Ready!

178
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Hello!

179
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Hello!

180
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
How are you doing?

181
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Is it funny?

182
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,800
It smells like the first time we met.

183
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Who do you want to meet for the first time?

184
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Okay, Mr. Mazo.

185
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Who is the first victim?

186
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,800
I'm sorry!

187
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Ladies and gentlemen.

188
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Hello.

189
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Hello.

190
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Hello.

191
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Hello.

192
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Hello.

193
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
It's hard, isn't it?

194
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
It's hard, isn't it?

195
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Thank you very much.

196
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
It's hard, isn't it?

197
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
It's hard, isn't it?

198
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
But, recently, there are many angry children.

199
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Oh, is that so?

200
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,800
If you read magazines, you'll see that they write about selfish things, right?

201
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
What do you mean?

202
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Something like people's bad words.

203
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Ah, bad words.

204
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
There are bad words.

205
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
The other day, you saw it, right?

206
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
What?

207
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Asahi Entertainment.

208
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Asahi Entertainment.

209
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Naughty talent special.

210
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
If you look at the cover, it says,

211
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Dantan!

212
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Wow, it's written, it's written!

213
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,800
I can accept people's bad words, but I can also accept my own bad words objectively.

214
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Oh, I see.

215
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,800
You're being cheeky.

216
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Sorry for that.

217
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Hey, brother!

218
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,800
What are you laughing at?

219
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
You are...

220
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
You are!

221
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
You're writing down, down!

222
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
No, no, no.

223
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
What?

224
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Ah, that person's a little angry, isn't it?

225
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
No, angry!

226
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
No, no, no.

227
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
It's because you're writing down, down.

228
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,600
It's not like I'm the only one who's upset that I didn't write it.

229
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,000
It's not that I wrote it in Downtown Hamada, I wrote it in Downtown.

230
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,600
That's not good.

231
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,200
Well, if you write it in Downtown...

232
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,100
If you write it in Downtown, that's not good.

233
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,300
It's just the two of us.

234
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,700
If you say it's in Downtown, then you and I are the same.

235
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,300
That's right, we're the same.

236
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,400
So we have to be cheeky.

237
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
We have to be cheeky.

238
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,500
We really have to discuss this.

239
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,400
Right?

240
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,200
The content is written in Downtown, right?

241
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,700
You did a 24-hour TV show, right?

242
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,100
I wrote down their attitude, so they're being cheeky.

243
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,500
Well, that's true.

244
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,700
Well, well, well, they're looking at my attitude.

245
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,500
If I'm told they're being cheeky, I can't help it.

246
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, just write it down.

247
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,600
I thought, that wasn't really about being cheeky, was it?

248
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,300
Well, well, it wasn't about being cheeky.

249
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:09,900
Mask, mask, mask.

250
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,700
Mask, mask, mask, it's like ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

251
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,100
I laughed.

252
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:21,100
After that, the producer told us that he shaved a little.

253
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,100
Then downtown got angry when they heard that.

254
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,100
We're working, so why are you shaving?

255
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,100
Why?

256
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,100
The producer had a beard.

257
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,100
He said he shaved his beard.

258
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,100
We shaved the beard of the producer.

259
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,100
We laughed and left.

260
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
That's a lie.

261
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,100
No, it's true.

262
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,100
It's not true.

263
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,100
Our producer doesn't have a beard.

264
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,100
It's true.

265
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
It's true.

266
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,100
He's sitting there.

267
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,100
According to the producer,

268
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,100
It's a trend that's been selling so far.

269
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
I can't help what I've been told.

270
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,100
It was a proud beard.

271
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,100
It's a little too big.

272
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,100
It's a little too big.

273
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,100
There's a mistake about the producer.

274
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
There's a mistake.

275
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,100
It's not a bad word.

276
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,100
In a broad sense,

277
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,100
I'm still angry.

278
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,100
If you compare it to the eastern part of the country,

279
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,100
The western part of the country is angry.

280
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,100
The eastern part of the country is the western part of the country.

281
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
I'm just the western part of the country.

282
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,100
I thought I had to compare it.

283
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,100
I'm from Osaka, so I can't compare it to the western part.

284
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,100
The eastern part is the center of Japan.

285
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,100
If you say the eastern part of the country,

286
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,100
It's an image that has dominated the whole country of Japan.

287
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,100
If you say the western part of the country,

288
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,100
I'm a fox.

289
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,100
This is delicious.

290
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,100
I'm still in Osaka.

291
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,100
I don't like this way of writing.

292
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
It's a little too big.

293
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,100
I'm angry.

294
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
I'm angry.

295
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,100
I don't know why.

296
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,100
I'm not a critic.

297
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
I'm angry.

298
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,100
I'm angry.

299
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
I'm angry.

300
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
I'm angry.

301
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,100
I'm angry.

302
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
I'm angry.

303
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
I'm angry.

304
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,100
I'm angry.

305
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
I'm angry.

306
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,100
I'm angry.

307
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
I'm angry.

308
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,100
I'm angry.

309
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,100
I'm a little angry.

310
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,100
I'm angry.

311
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:03,100
I'm angry.

312
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:10,100
What do you like to watch?

313
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,100
What do I like to watch?

314
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,100
What do you watch?

315
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
You always say you watch this.

316
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
I see.

317
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Is it your drama?

318
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,100
What do you watch? You always say you watch this.

319
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
I always say I watch it every week?

320
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
What is it?

321
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,100
I watch it every week.

322
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,100
If you have time to watch it at home, you should watch it.

323
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
What do you watch?

324
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,100
Morning Ten.

325
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
What is it?

326
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Morning Ten.

327
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
I don't care about the morning.

328
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,100
What I wrote on that show is the name of a celebrity who was born on that day.

329
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:00,100
I thought you would say my name on September 8th, so I was watching it all the time.

330
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm the same age as you, but I was told earlier than you.

331
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:12,100
I watch this a lot.

332
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,100
I don't really watch it.

333
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Normally I don't watch it.

334
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
It's not an interesting show.

335
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,100
My show is the most interesting.

336
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,100
Don't you watch other people's shows?

337
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,100
It's not a big deal.

338
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,100
What is it?

339
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
What is it?

340
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,100
For example, what kind of show is it?

341
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
No, no, that's a brother.

342
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
What are you talking about?

343
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
Don't lie to me.

344
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,100
What is it?

345
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Tell me. I don't know which one is the most interesting.

346
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,100
There are many shows like this that are not interesting.

347
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,100
Most of them are not interesting.

348
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,100
What is the most interesting show that you don't like?

349
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,100
The one that I hate?

350
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
Yes, the one that I hate.

351
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Don't think about it. Stop thinking about it.

352
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Don't think about it. Stop thinking about it.

353
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
You're stupid.

354
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Die.

355
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Die.

356
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,100
I want to do it.

357
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,100
No, you are wonderful.

358
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,100
Let's go to the post office.

359
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
John, wait!

360
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
Don't be so surprised.

361
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,100
I'm talking about John.

362
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
John, wait!

363
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
Say something.

364
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,100
What are you doing?

365
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,100
I'm not looking at you.

366
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,100
What are you thinking?

367
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Are you stupid?

368
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Why do the actresses who are selling because it is a commercial say such a stupid joke?

369
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,100
I want to throw it away.

370
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,100
For example, Yasuko Sawaguchi.

371
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:27,100
The wind is a stoner, but it's a stoner.

372
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:33,100
But such a joke is said when you go to the post office.

373
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,100
I can't help it.

374
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,100
We are the only ones who can say such a joke on the spot.

375
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,100
I can't help it.

376
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,100
The wind is a stoner, but it's a stoner.

377
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,100
The wind is a stoner, but it's a stoner.

378
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,100
The wind is a stoner, but it's a stoner.

379
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,100
I'm a little confused.

380
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:06,100
It's very unpleasant to think of this as a joke.

381
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,100
Don't underestimate the joke.

382
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,100
I'm not underestimating it.

383
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,100
The wind is a stoner, but it's a stoner.

384
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,100
The wind is a stoner, but it's a stoner.

385
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:27,100
The wind is not in compliance with the official joke.

386
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
For example.

387
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
Why do you talk like that?

388
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Let's say your name is poop.

389
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,100
It's not poop, but it's poop now.

390
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,100
The three horses ate the three horses.

391
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,100
It's not funny at all.

392
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,100
The three horses decided on their own.

393
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,100
The stoners decided on their own.

394
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
The wind is a stoner, but it's not funny at all.

395
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
Do you understand what I mean?

396
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,100
I understand what you mean.

397
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
It's not funny at all.

398
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,100
If you think it's funny and say it, you shouldn't laugh.

399
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,100
It's not funny if people around here say it.

400
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
Is that so?

401
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,100
It's not funny if people around here say it.

402
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:24,100
It's not funny if people around here say it.

403
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
I heard this from a friend of a friend.

404
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
When he was working at the post office,

405
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,100
There was a yearbook from Mr. Hamada's house.

406
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:37,100
When I looked closely, it was a picture of three families laughing.

407
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Did you get that picture?

408
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,100
I don't have a picture of three families.

409
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
I took a picture of a child only.

410
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,100
You like that kind of picture, don't you?

411
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,100
If you ask me whether I like it or not, I like it.

412
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,100
It's just a picture of a child, isn't it?

413
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Are you laughing at the picture of a child?

414
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
I don't know if I'm laughing or not.

415
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,100
If you do that, you won't send me to the yearbook.

416
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Why don't you send me to the yearbook?

417
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Why are you standing still?

418
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,100
Have you ever sent me to the yearbook?

419
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,100
I have.

420
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,100
I haven't.

421
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
I have.

422
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
I haven't.

423
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,100
But you moved to a new house, didn't you?

424
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,100
You're good at it.

425
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,100
I moved to your house in the New Year.

426
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,100
Why? I'm a new year's person.

427
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100
If you're a new year's person, I'll send you to the yearbook.

428
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
You're lying.

429
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Why does the old lady's bicycle brake?

430
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,100
The old lady's bicycle brake sounds like this.

431
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,100
Please tell me.

432
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,100
The old lady's bicycle brake is old, isn't it?

433
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
It's not being maintained.

434
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,100
But if a young person rides a bicycle like that, it's even more embarrassing.

435
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:51,100
There are some young girls who ride old bicycles.

436
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
The old lady's bicycle brake sounds like this.

437
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,100
It's hard to watch.

438
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:02,100
I've never seen it before, but there's a bicycle brake that stops the bicycle.

439
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,100
If you do this, the bicycle brake stops the bicycle.

440
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,100
It's like rubber.

441
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,100
That's a little different.

442
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,100
That's different.

443
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
It's common for young girls to ride bicycles.

444
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,100
That's right.

445
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,100
Why are high school students in the countryside wearing a helmet?

446
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
Why?

447
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,100
I'm sure they're wearing a helmet.

448
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,100
That's why it's dangerous in the mountains.

449
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,100
In that case, I think it's more dangerous in the city.

450
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100
I've been chasing stones from above.

451
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,100
It's a rice field as far as you can see.

452
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
It's a blue sky.

453
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
There's nothing in the sky.

454
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,100
But the place you're chasing is like a cliff.

455
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,100
I see.

456
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,100
When you fall.

457
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:54,100
There's a mountain over there.

458
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
I'm sure I'm wearing a helmet.

459
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,100
I don't know.

460
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,100
I'm wearing a jersey and running.

461
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,100
I don't know.

462
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
It's definitely strange.

463
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,100
You can't wear a helmet when you're single, can you?

464
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,100
That's right.

465
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,100
But you don't have to wear a helmet when you play baseball, do you?

466
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,100
I don't know that.

467
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Why?

468
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,100
There's no such dangerous sport.

469
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,100
I don't know where the ball will fly from.

470
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,100
You'll find out when you see it.

471
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,100
It's tough.

472
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,100
I can't avoid it.

473
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,100
You can avoid it.

474
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,100
It's not like it's going to fly with a liner.

475
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
Do you need a helmet?

476
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
I don't know.

477
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,100
If you hit a red ball, you'll get hit.

478
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
What are you going to do if you don't wear a helmet?

479
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,100
You're wearing a helmet.

480
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,100
So don't wear a helmet.

481
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
If you say that, it won't start.

482
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,100
What's that?

483
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,100
Everyone was excited when Sena came.

484
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,100
But for me, he's just a foreigner.

485
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,100
That's right.

486
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,100
He's just a foreigner to me.

487
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,100
He had a head like Zura.

488
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,100
He had a head like Toresu.

489
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,100
What's that?

490
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,100
What's that?

491
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,100
What's that?

492
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,100
What's that?

493
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,100
What's that?

494
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,100
What's that?

495
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,100
You're not supposed to be driving.

496
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:22,100
I'm definitely faster.

497
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,100
It's like this.

498
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,100
He's been running for 300 kilometers.

499
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,100
I think I can do it.

500
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,100
It's 300 kilometers.

501
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:39,100
And then his head goes like this.

502
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,100
It's not just one person who runs 300 kilometers.

503
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,100
Everyone runs 300 kilometers.

504
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
If it's just one person, it's a loss.

505
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,100
It's not a loss.

506
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,100
It's a problem of whether you can do it or not.

507
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,100
The machine is amazing, but the person who is riding it is not.

508
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,100
It's the skill of the person who is riding it.

509
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,100
When I went to Kyosho...

510
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,100
Don't talk about Kyosho.

511
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,100
Is there a car like this in Kyosho?

512
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,100
Is this how you do the S-shaped crank?

513
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100
It's easier.

514
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,100
I don't know my skills.

515
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,100
The instructor at the Kyosho shop said you were too fast.

516
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,100
That's stupid.

517
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,100
It's a white line.

518
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,100
The instructor at the Kyosho shop said,

519
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,100
It's too fast.

520
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,100
It's too fast.

521
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,100
It's about 40 kilometers.

522
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,100
The instructor was surprised.

523
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,100
It's about 40 kilometers.

524
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,100
That's why I was dropped.

525
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,100
It's about 40 kilometers.

526
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,100
It's too fast.

527
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,100
It's too fast.

528
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,100
Do you have a bike like that?

529
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,100
Are you stupid?

530
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,100
Do you have a bike like that at 40 kilometers?

531
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,100
I don't have much money.

532
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,100
I only have a little gas left.

533
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,100
I can't go home by calculation.

534
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,100
What does that have to do with the E1 machine?

535
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,100
I don't think about that.

536
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
I'm thinking about it.

537
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
I'm putting gas in the pit.

538
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,100
I don't have any money.

539
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
I don't have any money.

540
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,100
I'm working.

541
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,100
I don't have any money.

542
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,100
That's a lot of money.

543
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:32,100
What are you?
