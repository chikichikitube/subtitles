1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Shichihenge, the masterpiece for children.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Many of the staff have been under tremendous pressure to make this project a success.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And tonight, the new challenger is...

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Shinagawa Shoji, Shinagawa Hiroshi.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He's the number one young talent who has made his way to Stardom at once.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Tonight, Shinagawa World will carve a new page in the history of Shichihenge.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Shichihenge

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is the first episode of Shichihenge!

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's been a while, hasn't it?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's right.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I didn't think there would be anyone else doing this.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's the 18th person.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He's very motivated.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Really?

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't know what he's motivated about.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Did you say it yourself?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I thought about what kind of relationship I should have with Shoji Shinagawa before the show.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But I don't have one.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You don't have one.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I don't have one.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's cold even if I force myself to do it.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Today's star is Shoji Shinagawa!

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Nice to meet you.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The staff said this.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This is the first time we've had a meeting three times.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We usually have a meeting once.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Then we talk on the phone and talk about small things.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I see.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We've had a meeting three times.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's different from the past.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Where are you in the world?

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm here.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why?

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Why?

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm scared.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't want to say it.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't want to say it, but I'm still a little scared.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm scared.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What should we do?

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What should we do?

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Goodbye, Yama-chan.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Goodbye, Yama-chan.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Graduation ceremony.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If you want to do it, it's a prank.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But everyone is saying goodbye mentally.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What do you mean?

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm not doing it at all.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll show you the whole life of Tsutsuno.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm curious.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Right now...

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, I see.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But what about the gas festival that everyone was addicted to before?

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's interesting.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's hard to grow up.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I had a headache after it was over.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I stayed on the ship for about an hour and a half.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Suga-chan.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How many kilometers are you riding?

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh, that's right.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Shut up.

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Shut up.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, it's used.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Tanaka.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Did you give a marriage proposal?

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
How much is it?

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I can't hear you saying it's noisy.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes.

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Endo.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Did you give a birthday party?

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
How old are you?

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I can't hear you saying it's noisy.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Your story is boring.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Matsun.

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If you sell the book, it's 100%.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What do you think?

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
How many books are you selling?

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I can't hear you saying it's noisy.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yama-chan.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, it's nothing.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Well, let's go to the bathroom.

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's go.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's big.

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Ayato, go.

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He's not doing anything.

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's acting like a girl.

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He's not doing anything.

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I laughed at Zaki-san's acting ability.

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He didn't look like a girl.

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He didn't say anything.

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's do this.

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Matsunoto, Heipo, Onuma.

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hanano, Dokushin Unit.

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's good.

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's go.

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's go.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's go.

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Matsunoto, Heipo, Onuma.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He's being teased.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He's the best.

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why did you choose that?

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I thought it was a good book.

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You've raised the level of good books.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's still the same.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What are you going to do?

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't know if the final meeting is in Korea.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Hey, you.

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What is this?

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's loose.

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hey.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hey.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't apologize.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You've been apologized.

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I said don't apologize.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Hey.

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't take it off.

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Try it.

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Idiot.

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What is an idiot?

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Hey.

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What is it?

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Hey.

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Look at me.

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mentally.

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let me see.

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's off.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Do it properly.

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't have time.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You only have 30 minutes.

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Do it properly.

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes, I'll do it. I'm sorry.

148
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Don't apologize.

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't apologize.

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's a new book.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He's putting it in.

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Is it M or M?

156
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's all M.

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's all M.

158
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's all M.

159
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's all M.

160
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's right.

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Can I go to Tanaka's new home?

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No.

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's still a little messy.

164
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Is it messy?

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes.

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's the same place as before.

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's a mess.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's a mess.

169
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's a mess.

170
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's a mess.

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's a mess.

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's a mess.

173
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's a mess.

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's a mess.

175
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Isn't it the first one in order?

176
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's right.

177
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's right.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's right.

179
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
He's getting ready now, isn't he?

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Well, well.

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He went home early to get some fresh air.

182
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Hey.

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yes.

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Thank you.

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Thank you.

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Hey.

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes.

188
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Thank you.

189
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Thank you.

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Hey.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes.

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Thank you.

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Thank you.

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What are you doing?

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What are you doing?

196
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's none of your business.

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Come here.

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Come here.

199
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I want to get beaten up this much.

200
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That's great.

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That's great.

202
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's great.

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's great.

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's great.

205
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's great.

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's great.

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He's amazing.

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Hard, hard.

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He's hard.

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He's amazing.

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
There's still some left.

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Stop it.

213
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't touch my butt.

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's why I didn't want to play sumo with Shinagawa.

215
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I won't touch it.

216
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I won't touch it.

217
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Don't touch my butt.

218
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I won't touch it.

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'll touch your butt.

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Then I'll play billiards.

221
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You'll touch it anyway.

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That was dangerous.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That was dangerous.

224
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That was dangerous.

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That was dangerous.

226
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Hello.

227
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes.

228
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Now?

229
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
In the meeting.

230
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yes.

231
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What?

232
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Why?

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Why did you break up?

234
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What's that?

235
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Vegetables.

236
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's impossible.

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't want to break up.

238
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's impossible.

239
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I got it.

240
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'll do it.

241
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What I want to see is more important than anything else.

242
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I look at what's behind the pain and dream.

243
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Everything should start from there.

244
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's a lie.

247
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You were surprised.

248
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm a student of the M university.

249
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I put one in.

250
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I put one in.

251
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I put one in.

252
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's 12,000 yen.

253
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's 12,000 yen.

254
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You've earned a lot of money.

255
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Thank you.

256
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Thank you.

257
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
How was it?

258
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The fourth one.

259
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The fourth one.

260
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
My heart was broken from the end.

261
00:14:37,000 --> 00:15:06,000
My heart was broken from the end.

262
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Do you want to do it?

263
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm going to do it.

264
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
He's like an AV corner.

265
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What kind of corner?

266
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Do you cut your hair?

267
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm sure you'll cut it.

268
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's dirty.

269
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll cut it.

270
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'll cut it.

271
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's high tech.

272
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'll cut it myself.

273
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Are you angry?

274
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Why?

275
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I cut it for sure.

276
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm sure I'll cut it the next day.

277
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I bought it from my parents.

278
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Are you sure?

279
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm sure.

280
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You've been betrayed.

281
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I've been betrayed.

282
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Really?

283
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The scissors come out from this side, right?

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's right.

285
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's why I discovered it.

286
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
In short, when you cut it, it's like you're holding your breath.

287
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's why it's not good at that time.

288
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Even if you're holding your breath, when you're done cutting, it's like a mirror.

289
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't know if it'll come out at that time.

290
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So when you cut it.

291
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'll continue.

292
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
If you cut it well, I'll cut it.

293
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Is the machine okay?

294
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'll put the machine in properly.

295
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'll raise it like this.

296
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'll raise it like this.

297
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You look angry.

298
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
When you raised your nose, your face was probably two times more angry in Yoshimoto.

299
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Who's number one?

300
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't know.

301
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Don't be angry if you raise your nose.

302
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm not angry at all.

303
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You look angry.

304
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You do it.

305
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You're a family member.

306
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Why?

307
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's terrible.

308
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Your face is funny.

309
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm not angry at all.

310
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Your mouth is funny.

311
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Your face is really angry.

312
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm not angry at all.

313
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Your face is funny.

314
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You look like a Korean woman.

315
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What kind of face is that?

316
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Your face is really angry.

317
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Your face is funny.

318
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm a man like that.

319
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm a man like that.

320
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm a man like that.

321
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I remembered.

322
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What?

323
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You have to do something.

324
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What?

325
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Japanese series.

326
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You told me.

327
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What are you going to do?

328
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Let's say it together.

329
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
If you break up, there's no problem.

330
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's right.

331
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Are you sure?

332
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm sure.

333
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What's the reason?

334
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The reason?

335
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Do you have a reason to be on that team?

336
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Because it's like this.

337
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Can I say one thing?

338
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's close.

339
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's really close.

340
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Do you have a reason to be on that team?

341
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't know much about baseball.

342
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But I'm sure there's something like that.

343
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I think it's better to win the championship later.

344
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's difficult.

345
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Are you ready?

346
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
One, two, three.

347
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Daiei, go!

348
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's really cool.

349
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But I told you first.

350
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Then I'll go.

351
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm Daiei.

352
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
This is a punishment for one person.

353
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's not a punishment for four people.

354
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's a punishment for one person.

355
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'll go again.

356
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
One, two, three.

357
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
HANSHI.

358
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
No, no, no.

359
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Daiei.

360
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I don't know.

361
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I don't know.

362
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I don't know.

363
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I don't know.

364
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I've been doing it twice last year.

365
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I've been doing it a lot lately.

366
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Shut up.

367
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You've been playing games all this time, haven't you?

368
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm Daiei.

369
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
HANSHI.

370
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I don't know.

371
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'll decide what to do.

372
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'll stop here.

373
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yes.

374
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I have to do this.

375
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Don't do it.

376
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The book came out.

377
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Don't put it out.

378
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's not that kind of character.

379
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It seems to cry.

380
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Can this book cry?

381
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The second page seems to cry.

382
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It seems to be a kid's book.

383
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What kind of book is it?

384
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't know.

385
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It seems to be thick, but it's about eight pages.

386
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And it's like a notepad.

387
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Matsumoto-san, who always wants to leave memories for everyone.

388
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That's right.

389
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The hit single that Matsumoto-san released when he was an idol.

390
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I want to hear it again.

391
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Please let me hear it.

392
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's okay.

393
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I need a lot of power.

394
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I need a lot of power.

395
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I went to the mountains.

396
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I went to the mountains.

397
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I went to the sea.

398
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I went to the sea.

399
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I want you to stop clapping.

400
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's hard to get a pen.

401
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I see.

402
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Is it okay?

403
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Are you still okay with the time?

404
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm fine with the time.

405
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You can't sell 20,000 copies like this.

406
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I got it.

407
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Hey!

408
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
When your partner is doing his best to make a turn,

409
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Is it the next postcard check?

410
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I won't do anything.

411
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Why don't you want to do it together?

412
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't know that song.

413
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You don't remember?

414
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I can't remember the first one.

415
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I went to the mountains.

416
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I went to the sea.

417
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I went to the sea.

418
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I went to Nagisa.

419
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Hey!

420
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's over.

421
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Hey!

422
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I ran on a stolen bike.

423
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's over.

424
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's over.

425
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I brought the song from a completely different place.

426
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I can't sell it.

427
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Please show it to me.

428
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What are you going to show me?

429
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Is it over?

430
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's not over.

431
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Please show it to me until the end.

432
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'll do it again next time.

433
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
There are times when you can't do it.

434
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Hey!

435
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Don't be so angry.

436
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
What's wrong with you?

437
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
There are times when you can't do it.

438
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Don't say that.

439
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You said you would do it next time.

440
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
There are times when you can't do it.

441
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
There are times when you can't do it.

442
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
There are times when you can't do it.

443
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Don't be so angry.

444
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:54,000
That's why I'm telling you.

445
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
There are times when you can't do it.

446
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
There are times when you can't do it.

447
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
There are times when you can't do it.

448
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Hey!

449
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Don't be so angry.
