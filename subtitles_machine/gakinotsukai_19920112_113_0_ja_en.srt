1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Next, we have downtown's Gaki-no-Tsukai-ya-ara-hende.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Please watch!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Gaki-no-Tsukai-ya-ara-hende!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What's the matter with you all?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Are you ready?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's the matter with you all?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'd like to have fun with everyone!

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's have them on stage right away!

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's have them on stage right away!

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Today, we've prepared a lot of things for you.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's a simple story about why you got hit from behind.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's right.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This...

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What is this?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It says it's a good eye.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hey!

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Your head is messed up.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You can set it up later.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I can't see at all.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Which one is cooler?

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It matches this jumper.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No, I don't need that eye.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't need that eye.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Here I go!

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hey!

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What the hell are you doing?

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's so tight!

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Who the hell is this guy?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What's the correct answer?

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Number 5.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Number 2!

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Mr. Ami.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Are you ready?

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm ready.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's go.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What are you holding?

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You tell me.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why did you get hit?

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Here, here, here, here.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Let's do it again.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You know what I mean, right?

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You tell me right away.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Here we go.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Here we go.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm the manager of Yoshimoto factory.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh, this chair.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You're wrong.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's your answer, Hamada?

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Here we go.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Why do you look so happy?

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's go.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't move.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let's do it again.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Let's do it again.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What?

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're a bad guy.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What's your answer, Otomo?

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't think so.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't know either.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're a bad guy.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Your answer is this.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're a bad guy.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's do it again.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Here we go.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Here we go.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Here comes number four.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And...

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh, no.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No, Otomo, no.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No, no.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh, no.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What are you sorry about?

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What's your answer?

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Wow.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Wow.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're a bad guy.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Are you ready?

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What?

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You're a bad guy.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What are you doing?

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Are you okay?

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't move.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Don't move.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't raise your hand.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Wait a minute.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Are you okay?

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What?

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What are you doing?

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You're a bad guy.

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're a bad guy.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You're a bad guy.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You're a bad guy.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Here we go.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Hey.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You.

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're a bad guy.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yamanashi.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's go, Yamanashi.

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Where are you going?

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Where are you going?

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You are the one who is scared.

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This is scary.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Now, what is this?

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Is it over?

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes.

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I will kick you.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Just like that.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What will happen if I do this?

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's scary.

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I can do it if I do this.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
No, it's slippery now.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I can do it if I wear it.

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No, no, no.

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I can do it if I do this.

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Sit down.

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I will do this.

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No, no, no.

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You guys can't do it.

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I can't do it.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Last year, we had a bet.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Who will win?

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
After 5 and a half hours, one of us will be naked.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
After that, we will be naked for hours.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We will be naked.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We will be naked from 4 to 5 in the morning.

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We will be naked.

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We will be naked.

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Please watch it.

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes.

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We will show you the making next week.

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
After 5 and a half hours, one of us will be naked.

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
After that, we will be naked.

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Are you ready?

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes, I am.

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I am looking forward to the ratings.

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes, yes.

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You can't be on the show.

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You can't be on the show.

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
How long will you be on the show?

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I have been on the show for 5 hours.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You can sleep once.

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You can live in the morning.

152
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't know when the next episode will come out.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
As of now, we have been on the show for 5 hours.

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The show has been finished.

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The next episode will start in the morning.

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It will start at 5 and a half hours.

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes, yes.

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The real caravan has been running for a long time.

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We have been on the show for 5 hours.

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So I'll be like this for about 5 minutes, and if it's 5 minutes, I'll immediately change to the weather forecast for the morning.

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I feel like I'm going to lose.

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't care if I do carabao.

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's early in the morning.

164
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Instead, if I do carabao, you do garrison.

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What is that?

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Say Hayami.

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Why are you doing that?

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Why?

169
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't care.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If you call me at home, I'll be like you.

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll do it.

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't care.

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Even though I'm sleeping.

174
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll watch it.

175
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's the first thing I'll do.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's the only thing I'll say as an announcement.

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
If this program ends, I'll be on the show in 5 and a half hours.

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's a busy season right now.

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
My apartment in Osaka is a one-room apartment.

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm sorry to say this, but I don't have a lot of money.

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I've been living next door for about a week.

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What is it?

183
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm asking for my money back.

184
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's scary.

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Really?

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I've never heard that before.

187
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's a live voice.

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's about 1 and a half in the middle of the night.

189
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I thought I'd take a nap while watching a video.

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm doing this.

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't know if you're hiding.

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Come out.

193
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's hard.

194
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I thought you were with your girlfriend.

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's not good.

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You're the one who's going to pay back what you borrowed.

197
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's right.

198
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's hard.

199
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Is this it?

200
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I think so.

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
About two.

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Two of you?

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The guy next door.

204
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I know he was washing his clothes a few hours ago.

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I know he was doing it.

206
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's been about two hours.

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I know he was doing it.

208
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I know he was doing it.

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I know he was doing it.

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Turn off the lights.

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Turn off the lights.

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He's doing it.

213
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Poor guy.

214
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Is he a young guy?

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I've never seen him.

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Poor guy.

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It can't be helped.

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's 1 and a half in the middle of the night.

219
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I thought it was rude to take a nap.

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
At that time.

221
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I thought I'd take a nap while watching a video.

222
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There are two of you, right?

223
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There are two of you.

224
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But I don't know what to do.

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't know what to do.

226
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Open the door.

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Get out of here.

228
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Stop it.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Stop it.

230
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What are you doing?

231
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Are you going to live like this?

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What are you doing?

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Don't do that.

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What are you doing?

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Don't open the door.

236
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Stop it.

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Stop.

238
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Stop it.

239
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Stop it.

240
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Stop it.

241
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I can't stop two people.

242
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can beat them to dance to the rhythm.

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You two are going to be beaten.

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm totally fine.

245
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I can't do this.

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I can't avoid it.

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm just shaking.

248
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm really alright.

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm scared of those kinds of things.

250
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, it's their job.

251
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You've been there too, haven't you?

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I've been there a long time ago.

253
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What was it?

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Hand-shaped.

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Hand-shaped.

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
My father fell on the back of the hand-shaped one.

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He fell, didn't he?

258
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And he was taken away like an alien that my father captured.

259
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
He was taken away!

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
My father was taken away somewhere.

261
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
He was imprisoned.

262
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
He was imprisoned.

263
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He said, I'll be back in a few days.

264
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
He was taken away from a small window like a prison.

265
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
He was taken away from a small window like a prison.

266
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Are you kidding me?

267
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's true.

268
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
See?

269
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
This is Nakata Botan.

270
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So, when he was in a terrible situation,

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
he would do a manzai like this, right?

272
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
His sleeves would be like this.

273
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
A debt-trigger.

274
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
A debt-trigger.

275
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
When he said, I'm back!

276
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
He would run away from here.

277
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He was a bad guy.

278
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He would run from the entrance like this.

279
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He was a bad guy.

280
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He was taken away, like you said.

281
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He was taken away from a small window like this.

282
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
He ran to the rice field.

283
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
He was runny.

284
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He came to the theater the next morning.

285
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He was runny.

286
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He was like a baby.

287
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Bad guy!

288
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
If he went that far.

289
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's amazing.

290
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's amazing.

291
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Recycling is really scary, isn't it?

292
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's scary, isn't it?

293
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You see, in the past, I didn't do that kind of recycling, but...

294
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
There's this thing called Ojiyanoma Shopping, right?

295
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yes, yes, yes.

296
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
There's a guy who bought that.

297
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Ah, it's a prank, right?

298
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's a prank.

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Then, he comes, right?

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Pay up, pay up.

301
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I came.

302
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That...

303
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's called the Youth Set.

304
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

305
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's right, that's right, that's right.

306
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's called the Nigiri Gekitaisuru.

307
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Something like that.

308
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
There's a guy called Spon, Spon.

309
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I came.

310
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's the Youth Set, right?

311
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's the Youth Set.

312
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I was leaving it there.

313
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I can't send it to you.

314
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I think it's because of the fans.

315
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You're a fan, but you're leaving it there?

316
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I've done a lot of things like that before.

317
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I see.

318
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's one of those things.

319
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's one of those things.

320
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The Youth Set.

321
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The Youth Set.

322
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I was leaving it there thinking that I was doing it.

323
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I kept saying, pay up, pay up, pay up, pay up.

324
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Ah, pay up.

325
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Pay up, pay up, pay up.

326
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I left it there.

327
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The fourth time, the fifth time.

328
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
When it's about the fifth time, that's the kind of attitude you have.

329
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's the kind of attitude you have.

330
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So you can't pay up?

331
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
If you're like that, you can't even take legal action.

332
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I see.

333
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I came, paid up, made a big call.

334
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Made a big call.

335
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Made a big call.

336
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm waiting.

337
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm saying, hey!

338
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I suddenly got sad.

339
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I didn't even tell the person in charge.

340
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I said, I'm going to go out.

341
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Hey, you!

342
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You can go out, but what's the Youth Set?

343
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Did you mess up your youth?

344
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Hey!

345
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Help me, Popeye!

346
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The other day, my mother told me to do whatever I want.

347
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I did whatever I wanted, but she scolded me again.

348
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Then what should I do?

349
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I have a dad who says things like this.

350
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
He says things like this to his girlfriend.

351
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But there are a lot of places like that.

352
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
When I was told to make tea,

353
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
my face changed.

354
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I said, I'm going to make it!

355
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I said, I'm going to go to the kitchen.

356
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I really don't know what to do.

357
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
If I point there, I'll be in trouble.

358
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I said, I got it, I'll make it.

359
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What are you going to do?

360
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You'll end up putting the tea in.

361
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
In the end, I'll be in trouble if I drink it.

362
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Then drink it.

363
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Why won't you let me drink it?

364
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's really annoying.

365
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I drink it once.

366
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's why, when I open the door,

367
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
the glass door opens like this.

368
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's broken here.

369
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's bleeding.

370
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I said, I'm going to drink it.

371
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I said, bring me a handkerchief.

372
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's right.

373
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's bleeding here.

374
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I thought you were playing a water game.

375
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Why do I have to do it with you?

376
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Hello, Osai-san.

377
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's often said that men complain.

378
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What kind of state is that?

379
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Complain?

380
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Ah, I'm sorry.

381
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You complain, right?

382
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You want to do it, right?

383
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You complain.

384
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You complain, right?

385
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes.

386
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
When do you complain?

387
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
When I'm tired.

388
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It happens.

389
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Right?

390
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It happens.

391
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
When you're on the Shinkansen,

392
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
you wake up early in the morning,

393
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
you get on the Shinkansen and go to bed, right?

394
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
No.

395
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Never.

396
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's going to explode.

397
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's going to explode, right?

398
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's harder than iron.

399
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's harder than iron.

400
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You can't even do a reclining.

401
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's going to explode, right?

402
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Good evening.

403
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I have a question.

404
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
A lot of people are running at night, right?

405
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes.

406
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Why do those people often write kanji?

407
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's often written on the wall with a spray.

408
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And they often use calligraphy.

409
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Where do you think that came from?

410
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Dan-dan, please tell me.

411
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
There are a lot of them these days.

412
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I wonder why.

413
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
These days, those people are ugly.

414
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
They used to be beautiful.

415
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
There were a lot of beautiful women in the past.

416
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
These days, those people are ugly.

417
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
They're fat and ugly.

418
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
They're annoying.

419
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
They're annoying.

420
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
They're crazy.

421
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
They're crazy.

422
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Don't show off.

423
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Don't show off.

424
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Don't show off.

425
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
In movies,

426
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
in TV shows,

427
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
they're cool because they're actors.

428
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
They say,

429
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm the president.

430
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But in real life,

431
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
in the movies,

432
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
in the movie theaters,

433
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
they say,

434
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm the president.

435
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'll do it anytime.

436
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You're a little high.

437
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You look like you can win.

438
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I look like I can win.

439
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
An amateur can't speak.

440
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's hard.

441
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You're a little stupid.

442
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Nice to meet you.

443
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You're not speaking.

444
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You're a little nervous.

445
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Everyone will say,

446
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What are you?

447
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That's no good.

448
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let's go home.

449
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Let's talk about the theme.

450
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The theme?

451
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
When I was a kid,

452
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
when I was in elementary school,

453
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
when I was in elementary school,

454
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I was bullied again.

455
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
After lunch,

456
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
we ate as soon as we could.

457
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It was a race to go to the gym.

458
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
One day,

459
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I ate the first one and ran.

460
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The next guy was coming.

461
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I had to go to the gym as soon as possible.

462
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
When I came,

463
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I was grabbed from behind.

464
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
My arm was beaten.

465
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I fell down.

466
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I was taken to the health center.

467
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Everyone was like this.

468
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's hard.

469
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's a counterattack.

470
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't have the guts.

471
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm a little weak.

472
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You're already in the blue.

473
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm already in the blue.

474
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That's what they say.

475
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Everyone was alone.

476
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I drank milk.

477
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I was like this.

478
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I drank milk on my head.

479
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
On your head?

480
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yes, yes, yes.

481
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I knew it smelled,

482
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
so I went to the hospital.

483
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I was like this.

484
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I was kicked out.

485
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
My mother sometimes wore red pants.

486
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
When I was in elementary school,

487
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I didn't know that.

488
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You can't stand out.

489
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That's right.

490
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
When I went to the party,

491
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I was like this.

492
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's a man.

493
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's just a man.

494
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Matsumoto pants are red.

495
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's a man.

496
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's a man.

497
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I was surprised.

498
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Hey! Stop!

499
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's Tomiko.

500
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
We played together on New Year's Eve.

501
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What did you do?

502
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I went to the movies.

503
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What did you go to?

504
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The Truck Man.

505
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I was watching the Truck Man together.

506
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
There was a man next to me.

507
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
He was in the military.

508
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Do you know?

509
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't know.

510
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You don't know?

511
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I was looking at the screen and the old man next to me was standing and doing a handstand.

512
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It was a very good scene.

513
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Oh, I remember.

514
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You don't?

515
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I don't remember.

516
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Then, the movie theater was all like, zawazawazawa.

517
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Ba-n, pa-pa-pa, pambarapam.

518
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What are you doing?

519
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What are you doing?

520
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I was turning around.

521
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I was looking at the screen and the old man next to me was standing and doing a handstand.

522
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I think the old man was a bit more dominant.

523
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
No, I think the young man was more dominant this time.

524
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You were able to distinguish them well.

525
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
There was no problem at all.

526
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yes, yes, yes.

527
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Thank you very much.
