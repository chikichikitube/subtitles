1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Good evening!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, well, well...

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I've been doing this for a long time.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm not sure if I'm clapping or not.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, well, well...

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's exactly like that.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, thank you very much.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There's nothing.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Normally, there's something like this, right?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There are times like this.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I've been doing this for a long time.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There are times like this, right?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What kind of public program is that?

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There are times like this.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
There are times like this, right?

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Today, I'm out.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What do you mean, you're out?

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's all because of you!

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, but this is only the first time.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It can't be helped.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Have you been somewhere?

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I've been to Hawaii.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
At this time of year...

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What?

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In Hawaii...

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's been four years since I've been to Hawaii.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Really?

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I've been to Guam.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You haven't been there, have you?

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
No, that's not it.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I haven't been to Hawaii.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What?

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What do you mean?

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I had to take a day off.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Are you kidding me?

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's why it's so luxurious.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's elegant.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's what it is.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's like that.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's like a veranda.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's wonderful.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What are you talking about?

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's hot in Guam.

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's hot in Guam.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Why is that?

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's cold in Hawaii.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's warm during the day.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
When the sun goes down a little.

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'd like to be able to say that.

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why don't you go?

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why don't you go?

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The flight time is the limit in Guam.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Oh, really?

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If it's longer than that, I'll be sick.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I feel like a little crab is coming out of my mouth.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's like a little crab in miso soup.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I want to see it, so let's go together.

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I haven't been to Los Angeles, so it'll take some time.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's different from that.

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't want to have a reporter.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I want to sell the feeling of being at home like you.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's like waiting for a life insurance commercial.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's just once a year.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Going out there.

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's right.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's a little broken in the typhoon in Guam.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's right.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
There were a lot of cancellations.

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's right.

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How were the people?

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There weren't many people.

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's empty.

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I didn't have much stress this year.

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How do you say it?

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Signs, handshakes.

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But if there aren't many people, I can't see you.

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's lonely at night, isn't it?

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's lonely at night.

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's not lonely at night.

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's the same in Tokyo.

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's right.

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I understand that.

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's not like that every year.

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's not like that.

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
How is it?

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
There are people who make you angry.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's right.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why is that?

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
They come to you and say,

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The children want your autograph.

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
They don't care about what the children say.

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
They say, I'm sorry.

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What?

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No, no, no, no, no.

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's impossible.

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Even though the children are saying it.

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm getting angry.

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No, no, no, no.

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's very likely.

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's right.

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
At the airport, at the airport on the way home,

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They came again.

104
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The children.

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's their birthday.

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's not true.

107
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's not true.

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's their birthday.

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
They said, I'll take a picture.

110
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I said, I'm sorry because it's my birthday, too.

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's September.

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's September.

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I was like, what?

114
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Is that true?

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It was over.

116
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I was on the plane.

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The plane was quite empty.

118
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I was relaxed.

119
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I said, it's okay.

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I was playing with my headphones.

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The sound of the headphones was cut out.

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You think something happened, right?

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It was so loud.

124
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:04,000
There was a birthday guest on board today.

125
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Why?

126
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Why?

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Why is it someone else's birthday?

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't know if I should wake them up.

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't even know why they stopped the song.

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Please look at the screen in front of you.

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I said, happy birthday.

132
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's true.

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I said, I'll give you this coffee cup.

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The coffee cup went up.

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I can't get it.

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The coffee cup went up.

137
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What's wrong with me?

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The people around you are like this.

139
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What's wrong with the people around me?

140
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The people around me must have woken up.

141
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That service is definitely wrong.

142
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't know about that.

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
When I think about it, it's his birthday.

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I said it earlier.

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Think about it the other way around.

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:03,000
On your birthday, if you get on the plane, you'll get hit.

147
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But you can't say, it's this person.

148
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You can't say, it's this person.

149
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But it's embarrassing.

150
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
When I was in a hurry, there was a birthday person on this plane.

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
His face was red.

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I thought he didn't know.

153
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He came to the party and gave me a coffee cup.

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's right.

155
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It was good in Hawaii.

156
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's not true.

157
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I want to go to Hawaii too.

158
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You should go.

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Where did everyone go?

160
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Did you hear?

161
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Heihei Shimizu came with me.

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He said he was going to eat and the next day he went to play golf.

163
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I said it was morning and he said he wouldn't come.

164
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He came back only at night.

165
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I asked him why he didn't come.

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He said he was pulled by a black man.

167
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He was not pulled by a black man.

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He was pulled by a black man.

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
A black man?

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I asked him if he wanted to go to the toilet.

171
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He said he didn't want to go.

172
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He went to the doctor because he was in pain.

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He said he was broken.

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What's wrong with you?

175
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No, the black guy pulled my leg.

176
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't say things like that.

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The black guy...

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The black guy pulled your leg.

179
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The black guy's bike or car, right?

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't like that.

181
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Do you know Kim?

182
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He's always traveling.

183
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This year too, when we're going to Guam from tomorrow...

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The water sign?

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
He said his hand was numb.

186
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
His hand was numb.

187
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He's always traveling.

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The day before, Miuchi would come.

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He said he was going to Okinawa from tomorrow, but Miuchi was taking care of him.

190
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
In the end, he said it was okay.

191
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He said he couldn't go to Guam.

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He said he'd take him to the airport.

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
While he was driving to the airport, he would cry.

194
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
He was frustrated.

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He didn't know.

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I couldn't go.

197
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I couldn't go.

198
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He was frustrated.

199
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He would cry.

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Shut up.

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm serious.

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Ask him.

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm going to cry.

204
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm going to cry.

205
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're making fun of him.

206
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He's the one.

207
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm serious.

208
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
In Guam, there was a water sign.

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I had a cramp in my neck.

210
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
There were four of us.

211
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The three of us didn't scream.

212
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But basically, we kept going.

213
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's fun.

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We were screaming.

215
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I had a cramp in my neck.

216
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What happened before that?

217
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
About two days before we went to Okinawa,

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
we failed the three times.

219
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We failed the three times.

220
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We all thought it was strange.

221
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We went to a hot spring.

222
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The next day, we went to Okinawa.

223
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I was wondering if it was okay to go to a hot spring.

224
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I had a cramp in my neck.

225
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I thought it was strange.

226
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The three juniors were all wet.

227
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I thought it was strange.

228
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I said, let's do a skinhead.

229
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He said, I don't want to.

230
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I said, really?

231
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We went to a hot spring.

232
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
We borrowed about 30 security cameras.

233
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We did a skinhead.

234
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I said, that's cool.

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It was midsummer.

236
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The next day, we went to Oiso Long Beach.

237
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I was excited.

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We went to Oiso Long Beach.

239
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The sun was...

240
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I was weak.

241
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It was a skinhead.

242
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
My skin was getting used to it.

243
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
A person who didn't have anything suddenly had a skinhead.

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It was midsummer.

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I was in a good mood.

246
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
There was a cute girl.

247
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The girl was cute.

248
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The girl looked at me and laughed.

249
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I was in a good mood.

250
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I put on my goggles.

251
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I couldn't get in.

252
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I slipped and couldn't get in.

253
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The girl laughed at me.

254
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I was in a good mood.

255
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
When I got home, my head was shaking.

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You were in a good mood.

257
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I looked like a lychee.

258
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I was translucent.

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I was blue.

260
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The car was about to leave.

261
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We went to Oiso Long Beach.

262
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I was driving.

263
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
My head was hot.

264
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I turned the towel over.

265
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
From behind.

266
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
How much should I turn it over?

267
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There were three signals.

268
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I was caught in a traffic jam.

269
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I couldn't turn it over at all.

270
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If I had escaped, I would have been killed.

271
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's true.

272
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't know the reason.

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't know the situation.

274
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't know the reason.

275
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I have a question for Matsumoto.

276
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There is a place called Kawanabi.

277
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
If you go there, you will be attacked.

278
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Where is it?

279
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I have never heard of it.

280
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I think it exists.

281
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I think it exists.

282
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Tell me if you have experienced it.

283
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I have.

284
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Where is it?

285
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There are many places.

286
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
There are many places?

287
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Where?

288
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Think that you are Kawanabi.

289
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There are many things that happen.

290
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Why?

291
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
For example.

292
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
If you are called youth, you will be in trouble.

293
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you are called youth, you will be in trouble.

294
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
If you are called youth, you will be in trouble.

295
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This is serious.

296
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Can I talk about serious things?

297
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Please talk about this too.

298
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I will talk about serious things.

299
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Where do you use Kawanabi?

300
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Where do you use Kawanabi?

301
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Panasonic.

302
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Panasonic.

303
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If you use Kawanabi against Panasonic's rival company, you won't get out.

304
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Rival company?

305
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes, other than Kawanabi.

306
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What do you mean by try?

307
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
If you want to go to Pioneer...

308
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's a lie that you won't get out.

309
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What is this?

310
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It doesn't mean that you won't get out.

311
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It doesn't mean that you won't get out.

312
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It doesn't mean that you won't get out.

313
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It doesn't mean that you won't get out.

314
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I don't know.

315
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I don't know that Kanabi is lying.

316
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't lie.

317
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I can't lie.

318
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't lie.

319
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I can't lie.

320
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I can't lie.

321
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I can't lie.

322
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I can't lie.

323
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I can't lie.

324
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I can't lie.

325
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't know that nuance.

326
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What is your type?

327
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
If you want to go to Pioneer, you can go like this.

328
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
If you play Sonic the Hedgehog as a pioneer, you'll be like...

329
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Just kidding.

330
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Just a little.

331
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Just a little!

332
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But you still have to say it.

333
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Well, it's a little...

334
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's a little...

335
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's a little...

336
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's a little...

337
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's a little...

338
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's a little...

339
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's a little...

340
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's a little...

341
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's a little...

342
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's a little...

343
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's a little...

344
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's a little...

345
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's a little...

346
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's a little...

347
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's a little...

348
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's a little...

349
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's a little...

350
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's a little...

351
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's a little...

352
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's a little...

353
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's a little...

354
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's a little...

355
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's a little...

356
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's a little...

357
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Just kidding!

358
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,500
No, no, no. Please tell me. I want to hear that.

359
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
I've been scolded so many times.

360
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
By the firecrackers.

361
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Where? Where?

362
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,000
Hey.

363
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,500
Don't ask me those things.

364
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,000
Your firecrackers...

365
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,500
Firecrackers are mostly women, right?

366
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,000
Yes, yes. They come out first, right?

367
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Women...

368
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Standing there.

369
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,500
Standing there, right?

370
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Yes, standing.

371
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
They'll turn into old men.

372
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,500
Hey.

373
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
No, no. It's not like that.

374
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,000
Hey.

375
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
When the firecrackers come out,

376
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
At the beginning, there's a woman standing there.

377
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,500
That's long. That's annoying.

378
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
She's standing there.

379
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,000
Yes, she's standing.

380
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What about that?

381
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That woman will turn into an old man.

382
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yes, she'll turn into an old man.

383
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
No, I mean, she'll push that woman like this.

384
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,500
And the old man will say,

385
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,000
Hey!

386
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Hey!

387
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
If you do something like that.

388
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But the firecrackers come out first, right?

389
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yes, yes.

390
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,500
After that, they'll turn into an old man.

391
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,000
After they turn into an old man, the old man will go like this.

392
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,500
Say something like that.

393
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,000
Where is it?

394
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,500
Tell me where it is.

395
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,000
I want to try it.

396
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
If I put it there, will the old man come out? Tell me.

397
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,500
Umm...

398
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,500
My dream, right?

399
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,500
What a fool.

400
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
It's okay. I'll tell you where it is.

401
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,000
Please.

402
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
If you tell me like this,

403
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
the whole of Japan will panic.

404
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Who are you?

405
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Are you okay with that?

406
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,500
What is that?

407
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Are you okay with that?

408
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
No.

409
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,000
If I put it there, will the old man come out?

410
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,500
You think you can do anything.

411
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,000
Let me do it on my way home.

412
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You're so easy.

413
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,500
If I put it there, will the old man come out?

414
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
I can't put it there, so tell me where it is.

415
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,500
If all the people here do that,

416
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,000
you'll panic.

417
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,500
Everyone can't be sure that they're driving.

418
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,500
This is discrimination.

419
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
This is discrimination.

420
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,500
You're told that you can only ride a bus.

421
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,000
If you say that, you'll panic.

422
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
This is a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who is more familiar with baseball than the Americans.

423
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm familiar with baseball.

424
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,500
Next season, please tell me the necessary rules for Matsui to play in the major leagues.

425
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,000
It's okay.

426
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Really?

427
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Tell me.

428
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,500
What is it?

429
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Please tell me the necessary rules for Matsui to play in the major leagues.

430
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,000
This is really Matsui...

431
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Matsui, are you watching?

432
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I don't know if you're watching or not.

433
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't know if your acquaintance is watching and teaching you.

434
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Shut up!

435
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Please tell me.

436
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Go home!

437
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What?

438
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,500
You can't go home.

439
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,000
Please tell me the necessary rules for Matsui to play in the major leagues.

440
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,500
What are you doing?

441
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,000
Please tell me the necessary rules for Matsui to play in the major leagues.

442
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,500
Tell me the necessary rules for Matsui to play in the major leagues.

443
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,000
I think Matsui is under great pressure.

444
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's right.

445
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
He is expected by the Japanese people.

446
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I think Matsui is under great pressure.

447
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's right.

448
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,500
So...

449
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,000
Do your best!

450
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Matsui, listen to me.

451
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Stand up.

452
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'll send you an A.

453
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's a writing exercise.

454
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There are five.

455
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
If you protect this...

456
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
There are five.

457
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's okay when you protect this.

458
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You can play.

459
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I really want you to deliver this to Matsui.

460
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I didn't see it and I didn't go.

461
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Do you deliver it or not?

462
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I won't do it if you don't deliver it.

463
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,500
I can deliver it.

464
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,000
Really?

465
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,500
I'll send you an A.

466
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,000
Really?

467
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'll send you a message.

468
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Matsue...

469
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Do your best, Akane!

470
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Don't go so low!

471
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Are you listening, Matsue?

472
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yes, I'm listening.

473
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You...

474
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It can't be helped, Matsue.

475
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What's that sound?

476
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Let's start with that part.

477
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Let's drop it once.

478
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Drop it once and then raise it.

479
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Listen, Matsue!

480
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Listen, Matsue!

481
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
How long are you going to do that?

482
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What's wrong with you?

483
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Your belt is here, isn't it?

484
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's strange, isn't it?

485
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
There's a fire in the center!

486
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Listen, Matsue!

487
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
From now on, Matsue!

488
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
From now on, Matsue!

489
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Matsue!

490
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You just want to say, Matsue, don't you?

491
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Say it, Kaki Kokeko!

492
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
From now on...

493
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Say it, say it.

494
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
From now on, for you to do your best on this show...

495
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Kaki Kokeko!

496
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Say it!

497
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Listen, Matsue!

498
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Matsue!

499
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I've already drawn it.

500
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I've already drawn it.

501
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
If you can't protect this...

502
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'll tell you to die.

503
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You don't have enough words.

504
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I don't have enough words.

505
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't have that kind of stupidity, Matsue!

506
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm sorry!

507
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Matsue, I'm sorry.

508
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Listen to me.

509
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Let's go!

510
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Let's go!

511
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Matsue!

512
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You don't have to say, Matsue.

513
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's true that I've been saying it for a while.

514
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Matsue!

515
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Let's go!

516
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Matsue!

517
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Matsue, listen to me.

518
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Matsue, look at me!

519
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Not you, look at me.

520
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Matsue!

521
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Matsue, are you crying?

522
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This is a question for Matsumoto-san, who has been sleeping with Hamada-san's wife for 5 years.

523
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It seems that you recently went on a trip to Guam with Hamada-san's wife.

524
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Please tell us about that trip.

525
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Well...

526
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I was wondering when this letter would arrive.

527
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Well, Shikari Shuganjosei.

528
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Shikari Asahigeino.

529
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I was wondering when I would get a scoop.

530
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Were you nervous?

531
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I was nervous.

532
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I contacted three of them.

533
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Hey, why is your voice so small?

534
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Are you okay?

535
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm okay!

536
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So, in conclusion, I'm okay.

537
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You were with your wife.

538
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
No, no, no.

539
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
That happened.

540
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I see.

541
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But it can't be helped.

542
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
This is the most interesting part.

543
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I understand that.

544
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
In conclusion, I'm okay.

545
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
To be honest, there was a phone call when we were shooting the opening scene.

546
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
While I was worrying about you,

547
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I said,

548
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Hey, wife!

549
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Are you okay?

550
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I was doing it.

551
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Did you go to Guam?

552
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Well...

553
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Well,

554
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
From the second day,

555
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I went to Guam three times.

556
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I pretended to go to Hawaii.

557
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I see.

558
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I came quickly.

559
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I see.

560
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It was amazing.

561
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It was...

562
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You know,

563
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
This kind of dangerous love,

564
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
or dangerous love,

565
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
makes people angry.

566
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I see.

567
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
That's why I said,

568
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Hold me.

569
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I said almost nothing but,

570
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Hold me.

571
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You liar!

572
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Shut up!

573
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

574
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
