1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm the manager of Dantan, Nakimokuro Okamoto Taku!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
He's a new manager.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I can't just leave him like that.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We have to celebrate tonight.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We have to.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm going to kill Okamoto.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm going to kill him.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're going to kill him?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm going to kill him.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Team Zero isn't going to kill him either.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I met the manager the other day, Nitta.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Nitta is going to be a decoy today.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
He's getting ready for it.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The three of us are going to step in.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We're going to go all out.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And after that, Team Zero.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We're going to have them do the celebration dance.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We're going to have them do the celebration dance.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We're going to have them do the celebration dance.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And we're going to have these two even more powerful dancers.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Here they come.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Where are they from?

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
They're from Hawaii.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hawaii.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hawaiian dancers.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Aloha.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Aloha.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
First, we're going to have them do the celebration dance.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And then we're going to have them jump in.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's the plan.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's go to Okamoto's house.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hurry up.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's already 4 o'clock.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, Okamoto.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Good morning.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, well, let's go in.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The manager is going to celebrate again.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes, yes, yes.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Come on in.

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Come on in.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Good morning.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Good morning.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No, it's not good morning.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No, no, no.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What is this?

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's not dirty.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's dirty.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come here.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's dirty.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's dirty.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's dirty.

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Where should I sit?

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, oh, I'm ready.

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What are you looking at?

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's dirty.

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What is this?

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh.

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's Okamoto.

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's Okamoto.

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes, that's Okamoto.

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okamoto.

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, you.

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What are you doing here?

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's a celebration.

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Are you here to celebrate?

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No, this is what I always do.

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I did it on the day.

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This is a matter of course.

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
This is a matter of course.

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is a matter of course.

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's great.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Thank you very much.

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There's one more group.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's great.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's great, Okamoto.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The symbol of peace, the pigeon.

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The pigeon.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
How was it?

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Good job.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Good job.

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Good job.

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What?

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh, I'm tired.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Are you tired?

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm tired.

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why?

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't know.

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let's take the time to eat.

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can't do it anymore.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I think I'll be dead in about five years.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't know.

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What is that?

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't know.

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Life?

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't know if it's life.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't think I'll die if it's life.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I think you'll be killed.

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Who's going to kill me?

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't know who it is.

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
A woman?

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't know if it's a woman.

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're the one who got stabbed.

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh, that's right.

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm definitely going to be on the special edition.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Michael Tomioka is chewing gum.

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why are you chewing gum on TV?

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Michael Tomioka's face is red.

111
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's unexpectedly stupid.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What?

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What?

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's on TV.

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's a guest.

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's a guest.

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm talking to a person, and he's chewing gum.

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's right.

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're wrong.

120
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Michael Tomioka is wrong.

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Michael is wrong.

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's right.

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's right.

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's right.

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Michael is wrong.

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's right.

127
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's my win.

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Michael, don't look at the gum.

129
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But Nagoya, huh?

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What kind of gum is that?

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Michael, you know.

132
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
When I say that, the ratio of badness between Michael and you is about the same.

133
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why?

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's what happens.

135
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Michael is already in the other side, so it doesn't matter.

136
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
At that time, you said something like a foreigner.

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's different from a foreigner.

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Well, that's right.

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No, that's not good.

140
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
No, that's not good.

141
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If you're chewing gum, you'll know it's not good.

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I don't know if he's half or something.

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's right.

144
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But foreigners are kind of shy.

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Because half of it is flowing.

146
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Half like me.

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Are you half?

148
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm wearing a little Indian.

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's it.

150
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Didn't you know that?

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If you say that, I'll believe you.

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm wearing a little Indian.

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What are you talking about?

154
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I have a Thai face, but you have a Filipino face.

155
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why are you wearing an Indian?

156
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm wearing an Indian.

157
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I've been with you since elementary school, but I've never heard of it.

158
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I didn't want to say that much.

159
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If you get along normally, you can say something a little bad.

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Actually, I'm not wearing an Indian.

161
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's what friends say.

162
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You've been deceiving me for decades.

163
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Wait a minute.

164
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Isn't it your first time being so mean?

165
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
If you've been so mean for a long time, I'd be like, huh?

166
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's my first time now.

167
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Get out!

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Sometimes it's fun to be stupid like this.

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Well, that's fine.

170
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I've never started, but I was a little angry when I got a good one.

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What is it?

172
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm just going to come out.

173
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Then a guy came up to me and said,

174
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're so stupid.

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Did you really say that?

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I said, you're so stupid.

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You're so stupid.

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I've never started, but I'm angry.

179
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm angry.

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
How should I walk?

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm just walking the way I was taught by my mother.

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Why are you doing that?

183
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
My mother doesn't teach me how to walk.

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No, I'm aware of it.

185
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Who said that?

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm aware of it.

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That's...

188
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't say that.

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You're the one who said it.

190
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's a woman.

191
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm just walking normally.

192
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't walk like this with a glass on your head.

193
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Like this?

194
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Like this.

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Is this transparent?

196
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's transparent.

197
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm transparent in a different way.

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
How can I forgive you if you walk like that?

199
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I have a low back.

200
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Like this.

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't look at me.

202
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's why you're wearing a dandy.

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No, no, no.

204
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm wearing a dandy.

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's why you don't have a wide foot.

206
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
A comedian should have a wide foot.

207
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What kind of comedy is this?

208
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
A woman should have a wide foot.

209
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
A woman should have a wide foot.

210
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
A woman should have a wide foot.

211
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If you do that, no one will like it.

212
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't say that.

213
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No, I'm serious.

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't know if you need a wave-like hand.

215
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If you do that, you'll look like you're on TV.

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm really angry.

217
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Some people are smiling.

218
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm angry.

219
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're angry, aren't you?

220
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I almost got angry yesterday.

221
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why did you get angry?

222
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I was eating at a lunch in Akasaka yesterday.

223
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Why?

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What do you mean?

225
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm at home.

226
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I was eating at a lunch in Akasaka.

227
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Akasaka is my hometown.

228
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's different at this time.

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I was born in Akasaka.

230
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I was eating at a lunch in Akasaka.

231
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Two students came in.

232
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
They looked at me.

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
They didn't look at me.

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
They looked at me.

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
They looked at me while eating Chinese food.

236
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Chinese food was delicious.

237
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No, no, no.

238
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Why are you looking at me?

239
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I didn't make it.

240
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If you made it, it would have looked good on you.

241
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm angry.

242
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What's wrong with you?

243
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm really angry.

244
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm really angry.

245
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And that.

246
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Shinkansen, Shinkansen.

247
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm going to go to Tokyo Station soon.

248
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm going to go to Tokyo Station soon.

249
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Don't say it twice.

250
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If you're next to me, say it once.

251
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If you're next to me, say it once.

252
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This is the third time.

253
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm getting off.

254
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm not getting off.

255
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's all for today.

256
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Come on.

257
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Come on.

258
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Come on.

259
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Do you speak properly?

260
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll speak properly.

261
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll never say anything strange again.

262
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Speak properly.

263
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll speak properly.

264
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll get off at Shinkansen and wait in a place where I can get on in a minute.

265
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's so I can get off as soon as it opens.

266
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Two brothers came.

267
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He has a younger brother who is in kindergarten.

268
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
He has a younger brother who is in kindergarten.

269
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
He has a younger brother who is in kindergarten.

270
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The rest of the elementary school students are like this.

271
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He has a younger brother who is in kindergarten.

272
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm scared.

273
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm scared.

274
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm scared.

275
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
He doesn't keep them in his heart.

276
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He calls them younger brothers.

277
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I call my younger brother, Machan, Machan, and he goes back and says,

278
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What should I do with this damn kid?

279
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And while ignoring it, he sings a song.

280
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
He immediately turns it into a song.

281
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He makes it on his own?

282
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Machan, Machan, Machan.

283
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He says it, he says it!

284
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's a pretty good song, isn't it?

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's...

286
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Hello, hello, hello.

287
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm a fan of the two of you, but I'm also a member of the Smapp fan club.

288
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm the only girl.

289
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Shut up!

290
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Smapp is tough, isn't it?

291
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What's wrong with you? Why do you all have the same hairstyle and laugh the same way?

292
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's usually the same guy that comes out from there.

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
While leaving behind the big-heartedness of Go Hiromi...

294
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And the atmosphere of the match...

295
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And while keeping the atmosphere of the match...

296
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And while keeping the atmosphere of the match...

297
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
While making Mokkun shiver...

298
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And while making Mokkun shiver...

299
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And while making Mokkun shiver...

300
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Why is that?

301
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And while making Mokkun shiver...

302
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And while making Mokkun shiver...

303
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Why is that?

304
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What's wrong with you?

305
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's a strange band.

306
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I heard human beings are born between the small number of fingers of the sand in the park.

307
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Huh? Who?

308
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Ah, The doctor.

309
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Like everyday.

310
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Is it true that humans were born with the size of the little finger of the sand of the sports field?

311
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The size of the little finger of the sand?

312
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The sand of the little finger of the sand, right?

313
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's written there, the size of the little finger of the sand.

314
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But it's true.

315
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But this is actually true.

316
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes.

317
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Don't you think so?

318
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
In the end, there is the sand of the wide sports field, right?

319
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yes, yes.

320
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The probability of being born to humans is so small.

321
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yes, yes, that's right.

322
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The possibility of being born to humans is really close to zero.

323
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes, yes, yes.

324
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Including us.

325
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Including us.

326
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It was a coincidence or luck that I was born to humans.

327
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I want to be with you again if everyone who is alive now is reborn.

328
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's stupid, isn't it?

329
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't know if I can be born to humans first.

330
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I can't be born first.

331
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Is that so?

332
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No, if I have a heart like a real boy and live with something bad, I can be born to humans.

333
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But if I live a dirty life like you, I can't be born.

334
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's absolutely impossible for you.

335
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Oh, me?

336
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yes.

337
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Why?

338
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If you are born next time, you may be born with a red cloth.

339
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
All at once?

340
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
First of all, you may not be born with a red cloth.

341
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm sure.

342
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm sure.

343
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm sure.

344
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm sure.

345
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm sure.

346
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sure.

347
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You may be born with a red cloth.

348
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But if you think it's better to be born with red nuts, you may face to be hit by red nuts.

349
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Tell me about it...

350
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
How do you feel?

351
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:11,920
I thought you may be eaten at the moment of

352
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Wait a second.

353
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Hold on.

354
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm sure.

355
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm sure.

356
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You have to live well for life.

357
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You can't say you're born with a red cloth.

358
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Can you say that again? I can't sleep tonight.

359
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
How is it?

360
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
When you are born next time, it's going to be awesome.

361
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You are going to be a GT scanner.

362
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's complicated.

363
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's close.

364
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's close.

365
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's close.

366
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You are going to be born as a human.

367
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If you have a pure heart like me, you are going to be a GT scanner.

368
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I usually talk to a fairy.

369
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You are going to die soon.

370
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Why?

371
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You are going to be a GT scanner.

372
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I have never talked to a fairy.

373
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You have never talked to a fairy.

374
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What kind of fairy?

375
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
There are a lot of fairies.

376
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What kind of fairy do you dress up as?

377
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I usually dress up as a mini skirt.

378
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Do you dress up as a woman?

379
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
No.

380
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You are a man.

381
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Do you wear a mini skirt?

382
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I don't wear a mini skirt.

383
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Ask me more questions.

384
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
No.

385
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I often say that the dog's nose is a million times better than the human's.

386
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But the dog is snorting because it's close to the poop.

387
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Even if the nose is good, the dog doesn't smell.

388
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Or is it stupid?

389
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If you think about it, you can't sleep at night.

390
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's true.

391
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's natural that the dog doesn't smell.

392
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If the dog is this close to the poop, it will smell.

393
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But if you put the dog in the nose, it won't smell.

394
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That's not true.

395
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The dog blocks the nose that smells with poop.

396
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's a big deal.

397
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Even if you put the dog in the nose, it's still smelly.

398
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
If you put the dog in the dog's eye, you can't see it.

399
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Can't see it?

400
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
If you put the dog in the dog's eye, you can't see it.

401
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,700
I can't see it if I have a shit in my eye.

402
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,700
It's the same as that.

403
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,300
Where is it?

404
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,500
Why?

405
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,200
I can't see it, but now I can see it.

406
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
It stinks.

407
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,100
It stinks until it comes here.

408
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,500
Even if it comes here, it stinks.

409
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,900
Even if it comes here, it stinks.

410
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:14,100
At first it stinks a little, but it's the heavy fin between here and here.

411
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,200
It stinks with the heavy fin up to here.

412
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:22,300
It's the heavy fin. It stinks with the heavy fin, but if it comes here, it doesn't stink anymore.

413
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,700
It stinks. It stinks. It stinks.

414
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,400
You've never done it, have you?

415
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,100
But it's definitely like that. I'm sure of it.

416
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:33,700
I can't poop, but if it stinks, I'll try it.

417
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,700
It stinks.

418
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,700
It's okay. It's okay.

419
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Even if you put it in, it's about this much.

420
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,400
How is it?

421
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,100
It smells from here.

422
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,500
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

423
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,200
The smell is when something mixed with air enters the nose and it starts to stink.

424
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,100
Even if your nose is stuffed, you can feel that it stinks.

425
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,500
I can feel it with my mouth. I can feel it with my sense of taste.

426
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Is that true?

427
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Yes, it's true.

428
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,000
I can't do that.

429
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,300
I'll do it.

430
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,200
What are you going to do? What are you going to do?

431
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,500
Are you going to poop?

432
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,200
It's true, isn't it?

433
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,900
It's true, isn't it?

434
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,800
But you have to poop.

435
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Why?

436
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,300
I can do anything.

437
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,300
You guys don't use applause for such a trivial thing.

438
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,300
It's the most meaningless applause I've ever had.

439
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Use it more when you watch an opera or something like that.

440
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:26,800
An opera is...

441
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,800
You're such a lousy singer.

442
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,300
You don't use applause for such a trivial thing.

443
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,300
It's okay. Let's use it here.

444
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,300
Oh, this.

445
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,800
One by one...

446
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,300
What?

447
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,800
You don't have to think about it. Just say it.

448
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,300
Why are you trying to twist it?

449
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,800
I want you to laugh at least once.

450
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,800
I know, but you don't have to say it quickly.

451
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,300
You can just say it normally.

452
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,300
One by one, from the Esper Kids.

453
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,300
Hey, you're slipping.

454
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,300
If you look at it closely, I'll hide it.

455
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,300
The message I sent you...

456
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,300
Just say it normally.

457
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
From the Esper Kids.

458
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
It's all over the country.

459
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,300
From the Sniper Kids.

460
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
Just say it normally.

461
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,800
It's coming more and more.

462
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,800
The other day, Machan said that he would write it when he saw a part of the old man's body.

463
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,300
So I tried it in the bus when I went to school in the morning.

464
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,300
I saw the old man's nose.

465
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,800
Then the old man sneezed.

466
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Thank you very much.

467
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,300
It doesn't say thank you very much.

468
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,800
It's a lie.

469
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,800
It says that this is true.

470
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,300
There were a lot of pictures in other newspapers.

471
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,300
That's why it wasn't brought to me.

472
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,300
The staff was removed at Kitsuko.

473
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,300
Kitsuko?

474
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,300
What if I find it?

475
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,300
I'll be angry.

476
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,300
I'll be like this.

477
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,300
Are you doing it?

478
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,300
What?

479
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,300
I'm doing it.

480
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
Are you doing it?

481
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,300
Did you do it?

482
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,300
I didn't do it.

483
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,300
You didn't do it?

484
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,300
Send it to me more and more.

485
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,300
It's true.

486
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,300
There were a lot of people who didn't do it.

487
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,800
I'll gather a thousand people to say that I did it.

488
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,300
A thousand people will gather there.

489
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,800
A thousand people will gather in a circle and hit an old man in the middle.

490
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,300
A part of the old man.

491
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,300
If the old man is surrounded by a thousand people,

492
00:21:47,300 --> 00:22:00,300
I'll be like this.
