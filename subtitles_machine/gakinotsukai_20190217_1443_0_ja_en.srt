1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Kazushige Nagashima's honest rumour, Soda Kareta-san

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
For example, who is the old idol?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Kawai Naoko-san

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's true

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And also, Ikue Sakagibara-chan

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Even though I'm angry at my son for saying that

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You're looking at him with that kind of eyes?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I remember that.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There was a TV show where Mr. Ega threw a batting ball at Matsui and Ega explained the rules.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
After Matsui finished batting, he jumped in to get in.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I thought I'd get out of the game and get in, but Ega didn't even look at me.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That was really a trick.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I want to do a voice acting.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I have to match the voice with the picture on the rock.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But it doesn't fit no matter how many times I try.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It does fit.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It does fit.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I changed the picture later.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You changed it?

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll call you after that.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm the champion!

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hamada is the first to win the first half.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Who will win?

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The rules are simple.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The person with the most points will receive a present from Kazushige.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Here we go.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm so excited!

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Please bite my earlobes!

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Da!

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's Da!

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Da?

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Not Da, it's Da!

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Ah, sorry, it's Da?

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's Da, right?

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes, it's Da!

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Ah, I see.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Ah, I see.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What's going on?

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is also a bit erotic.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's like that.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's about what I like and what I don't like.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I like my right side.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Do you bite?

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I can bite.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I think there are parts that you want to bite.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you have any parts you want to bite?

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't have any parts I want to bite.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Are you a god?

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Of course I'm a god.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But I don't think you're a god.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How many?

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
About the nipples.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Ah, the nipples

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, it's the one that's biting

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If it's a mosquito, it's either painful or not painful

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's not like that

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's being abused

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's not about being bitten

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There's something

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No, no

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I really don't think it's good

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You guys should relax and do a free talk

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Of course you want to be bitten

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No, not at all.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Who's scary?

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Where do you want to be bitten?

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm all for the ultimate law.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You want to be bitten?

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't want to be bitten.

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't want to be bitten.

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't know what it is.

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There must be.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Endo is a bad guy.

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He's not an adult at all.

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No, it's not.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He's worried about his wife.

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He's close to the interview at the children's school.

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I see.

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He's in the middle.

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I think that's a negative.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
When I went to the interview, I said I wanted to be bitten.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I think the child will be affected.

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What kind of school is that?

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's go.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Present

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Present

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Give or receive, red rose.

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Is it a negative?

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's a negative.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm getting a lot of flowers.

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm in front of you.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I really like to get flowers.

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Is that so?

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
My mother loves red roses.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I always give flowers to my mother in Hawaii.

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I want to get red roses too.

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Men don't like flowers.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,180
N-no, I never bought you anything.

99
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,100
You never bought her a flower?

100
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,280
Even a present?

101
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,840
What?!

102
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,780
Well, you never gave any gifts to her.

103
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,040
But!

104
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,060
I don't know if you never ordered a group of flowers.

105
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,560
Oh, OK, but on the stage?

106
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,480
Or the там?

107
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,060
A partyING for you?

108
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,600
You got it, too?

109
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
A wedding anniversary?

110
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I'll send it to you after I've ordered it.

111
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Wow, that's amazing.

112
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,600
That's a lie.

113
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
I got an image.

114
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
What are you guys aiming for?

115
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
It's not a lie.

116
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
I don't want to give it to you guys.

117
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
I'll send it to you.

118
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
A stupid one?

119
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
There's a company.

120
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
I'll do it.

121
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
That's nice.

122
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
I'll do it.

123
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
I'll do it for the stage.

124
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
I'll do it.

125
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Do you give your wife a kiss?

126
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
No, I don't.

127
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
I give her a gift.

128
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
If it's a gift, it's a flower.

129
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Do you kiss your wife?

130
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Yes, I do.

131
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
I see.

132
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
But you are a couple.

133
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
I also...

134
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
kiss?

135
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
I do.

136
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Why are you saying such a thing?

137
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm already 50.

138
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
You kiss your wife.

139
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Why do you kiss your wife?

140
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
You kiss your wife, right?

141
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I don't have a wife.

142
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I don't have a wife.

143
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
You're speaking in a weird way.

144
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Let's start.

145
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,600
I've never heard of Matsumoto-san's high school days.

146
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
It's a C.

147
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
I've never heard of it.

148
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,600
I won the championship when I was 20 years old in a TV show.

149
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Oh, the one about the comic book.

150
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
The one about the adult.

151
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,600
But I've heard a lot about my high school days.

152
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Oh, high school days.

153
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
But you were more into my high school days than yourself.

154
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Well, I was in the first year of high school, so I don't know much about my school days.

155
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,600
It's a school that makes you feel like you're going to a junkyard.

156
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,600
We don't take any classes.

157
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,600
It's a school that smokes cigarettes during class.

158
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
No, no, no.

159
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Even if I say it, there were about 32 percents.

160
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
That's the last one.

161
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
At least 25.

162
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
7 is also over.

163
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,600
And that's the one from Amagasaki Industrial High School.

164
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
I was in that machine car.

165
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
There were many bad things.

166
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
And domestic violence.

167
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Yes, really.

168
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,600
The Bebop High School was destroyed.

169
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
It was that time.

170
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Everyone was really bad.

171
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,600
In the past, everyone was riding a motorcycle in the high school.

172
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
It was normal.

173
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
It really happened.

174
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
It happened when I was in middle school.

175
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,600
The other gangsters were all like this in middle school.

176
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
They stopped their classes.

177
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,600
There were times like that.

178
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
There was a school called Odako next to it.

179
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
It's a school for male and female.

180
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,600
There was a lot of jealousy about it.

181
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
This is a boys' school.

182
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,600
But when Odako passed by, everyone choked.

183
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Choke?

184
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
The national road is so stupid.

185
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
That's a little cute.

186
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
I was in the school where the match was held.

187
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
All-girls.

188
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,600
There were only girls who were discriminating in the class.

189
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
I was surprised.

190
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
So that's the rest of the voice room.

191
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
No.

192
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Yes, yes, yes.

193
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
It was like,

194
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
I'm going to announce the results!

195
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
It was like,

196
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Really,

197
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
During a normal class,

198
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
I'm going to announce the results!

199
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
It was like this.

200
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
In the high school dormitory,

201
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,600
The results were announced, right?

202
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,600
The news reported it, this guy.

203
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,600
During the class, he suddenly had a parasite.

204
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Eh? Matsumoto-san?

205
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Is that so?

206
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
During the class,

207
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
During the class, suddenly,

208
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Ahhhhh!

209
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
No, no, no!

210
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
You're so mean!

211
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Let's start!

212
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Okay!

213
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
The truth is...

214
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
I don't know...

215
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,600
I never gave up on the path of a leader.

216
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Really?

217
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
I want to hear this.

218
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
I want to hear this.

219
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Come on!

220
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
I did it there.

221
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Leader...

222
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I can do this.

223
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
This is a baseball story.

224
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
That's right.

225
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Yes.

226
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Oh, I see.

227
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,600
I realized it at the end of last year.

228
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Giants changed to Hana-Kantoku.

229
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:37,600
At that time, Coach Miyamoto Kazutomo, Motoki Daisuke, Mizuno.

230
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,600
They were friends who played together a lot in the game.

231
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Why am I not in?

232
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
That's all.

233
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
It's not like he's busy or anything.

234
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
That's right.

235
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
That's the difference.

236
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Does that have anything to do with your past achievements?

237
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
To be honest, it does.

238
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Well, anyone can say that.

239
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Considering that, there's no room for Kazushige to enter.

240
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
You're still saying too much.

241
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
It's not just anywhere.

242
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,600
I think there's somewhere.

243
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
What do you want to do?

244
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,000
You want to be a director, right?

245
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,400
Anyone can be a director, if they play baseball.

246
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,600
Director Ichi.

247
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,100
Of course.

248
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
If you have to say more, a director of the Titans.

249
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,300
If it's not the Titans, but a director...

250
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,500
But if you're told you can be any director...

251
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,100
Yes, I'll say Titans.

252
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,000
Right.

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,800
That's impossible.

254
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,100
Hamada-san?

255
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,700
I don't know.

256
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,900
Impossible?

257
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,200
I don't know anything about baseball.

258
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Well, I don't think Kazushige has any record.

259
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
He has a record of memorial.

260
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,200
I don't know if that's different from being a director.

261
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
That's right.

262
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
He's a famous actor.

263
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Matsumoto-san, you know a lot.

264
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
No, no.

265
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
If he doesn't have a record, I don't want to be taught by you.

266
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Hamada-san, can you say something?

267
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
For example, he became a batting coach.

268
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,200
This time, Nagashima Kazushige is a batting coach.

269
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,200
I'm not sure if I can beat you.

270
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm sure you can beat me.

271
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,200
I'll beat you all.

272
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,200
No, you can't.

273
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
I can't beat you.

274
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
I'm sure you can beat me.

275
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I'm sure you can beat me.

276
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
But I'm interested in you.

277
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Do you have a dream of leaving it behind?

278
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
What do you mean?

279
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:43,200
I wanted to be a member of the different world if I didn't join the entertainment world.

280
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
I wanted to be a member of the committee.

281
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Committee?

282
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Yes, and before that, I wanted to be a police officer.

283
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,200
There is a place where the people here are one-sided.

284
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
The world over there.

285
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
One-sided?

286
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Like a back and forth.

287
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Not a police officer, but a police officer.

288
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,200
He came to the government office and put a gun on his head.

289
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
And he put a police cap on his head.

290
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,200
When he was riding a two-seater, he said,

291
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Hey, come here!

292
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
That's what he wanted to do.

293
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
That's what he wanted to do.

294
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
He kicked the front tire.

295
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
He's got a license.

296
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
That's scary.

297
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
What about you, Matsumoto?

298
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
If it wasn't for this world.

299
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
If it wasn't for this world...

300
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
It's not like that at all.

301
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I don't have any experience like that.

302
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,200
I think it's cool for a shogi player.

303
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
It's cool.

304
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Like Fujii-kun.

305
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
It's cool to see Fujii.

306
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,200
I think it's cool to do it without any tools.

307
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Certainly, there is a shogi.

308
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
There is a hammer and a sword in the Hamazoo Seiran-tai.

309
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,200
I came with a bag in my hand and went home with a lot of money

310
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Finally, the fight for the title was over

311
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,200
That fight was faster

312
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,200
From here, the fight for the title that no one knows yet was revealed

313
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
This is amazing

314
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:23,200
In the past, when we were doing Japanese TV, we had a corner where we had to fight against various fighters.

315
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,200
At that time, Ogawa-san and Inoue Kosei-kun were doing Judo.

316
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I thought Judo was amazing.

317
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,200
I thought Judo was strong.

318
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
The result is?

319
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
It was fast

320
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
The ball looked big

321
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
The ball looked big

322
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
It was a huge advantage

323
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
It was scary

324
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
It was scary

325
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
It looked big

326
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
It looked big

327
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
It looked like a dodgeball

328
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,200
It would have been easier if you said it bigger

329
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,200
The results so far are as you can see.

330
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Will Hamada win? Or will Matsumoto win?

331
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Which one will it be?

332
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Let's move on to the next one.

333
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
6 is not correct.

334
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,200
2 is found out and you apologize on the floor.

335
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
What are you saying?

336
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
It's the same thing.

337
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
I'll start.

338
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
This is quite...

339
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
What is this?

340
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
This is...

341
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,200
I want to talk about my situation at that time.

342
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:44,200
In the era of Yakuza, there were two people who were dating.

343
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Coincidentally, two people.

344
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Did you really like the same person?

345
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Yes.

346
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,200
What I made a mistake was that there was a girl named A and a girl named B.

347
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
I called A on this day.

348
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
I thought B was the next one.

349
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,200
But for some reason, it was the next one.

350
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,200
A was the next one, B was the next day.

351
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,200
We fought in our apartment.

352
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
It was a fight.

353
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,200
At that time, I was asked,

354
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Which one do you choose?

355
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
I was told by A.

356
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
But I couldn't say anything.

357
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
When I was lying down all the time,

358
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,200
A stood up and went to the kitchen and brought a knife.

359
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Oh, this is the one.

360
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,200
I have a save game the next day.

361
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
In spring.

362
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
I have to go to the save station.

363
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
It's okay.

364
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
It starts at 8 o'clock.

365
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
This guy is a blue bastard.

366
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
It's about 2 o'clock in the morning.

367
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,200
At that time, we had a floor.

368
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,200
There was a floor, and I was sitting down and saying,

369
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,200
I'm really sorry.

370
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
I apologized.

371
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
I thought the movie was good.

372
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,200
He stepped on my head from Kotobu.

373
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
I hit him.

374
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,200
I saw about 20 stars.

375
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
From above.

376
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
The floor is hard.

377
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
The floor is hard.

378
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Stars really appear.

379
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
This is what I want to send out to the whole country.

380
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Stars appear.

381
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
I'll show you my teeth!

382
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Before this, when A woman asked which one to choose,

383
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,200
flooring has this kind of connection, right?

384
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Like a groove.

385
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,200
She stabbed the knife right here.

386
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
That's amazing.

387
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:48,200
So, normally, if you're a man, you might think that your teeth might fly off.

388
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,860
You can't imagine that a knife would stick to the floor.

389
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,160
It happened to be stuck here.

390
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,860
But it happened to stand up.

391
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,480
The knife stands up.

392
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,640
The knife also stands up.

393
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,480
This is what I said in the national broadcast.

394
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,980
The knife stands up.

395
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,560
The knife stands up and the star stands up.

396
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,220
What happened to you, teacher?

397
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,220
I was late because I was sleepy

398
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,220
Next, the last one

399
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,220
Really?

400
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,220
Please take care of me

401
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,220
This is the last one

402
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,220
Super

403
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,220
Unfortunately

404
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,220
Onee-chan's Mune-Momezu

405
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,220
You only have 4 minutes

406
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,220
The last one

407
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,220
What is this?

408
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,220
This is last year's story

409
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,220
I don't go to Ginza very often.

410
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:55,220
I'm influenced by Sanma-san, so I really like Sanma-san going to a club in Ginza and drinking my sister's boobs.

411
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,220
You're saying amazing things.

412
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,220
Sanma-san says that himself.

413
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:11,220
I'm sorry to say this, but on the day of the Setsubun, we went to the Mamenakishi temple.

414
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,220
Before the Setsubun, we did a ritual.

415
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,220
It was a proper shrine ritual, so we all wished each other good health.

416
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:26,220
I heard a request from Sanma-san that he wished that good breasts would come closer.

417
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,220
I thought, as expected, it was a breast.

418
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,220
I'm not kidding.

419
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,220
Did you really say that?

420
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,220
I really said it.

421
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,220
You didn't say it so that everyone could hear it?

422
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
I said it out loud.

423
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,220
Out loud.

424
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,220
But I heard it.

425
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,220
Really?

426
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,220
Really.

427
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,220
It wasn't because you were fooling around and the camera was rolling.

428
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,220
It was because it was something you were good at.

429
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,220
I chased after my boobs from there.

430
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,220
I chased after them from before.

431
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,220
Last year, I couldn't chase after them.

432
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,220
I don't go to clubs very often.

433
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,220
Is it okay to drink boobs at a club?

434
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,220
It's not good

435
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,220
It's okay

436
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,220
It's okay

437
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,220
I'll drink it

438
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,220
With this, all the Karta is over

439
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,220
Who will win?

440
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,220
What will happen?

441
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
It was tough

442
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,220
Matsumoto-san was going to win

443
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,220
It was a close game

444
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,220
Congratulations to Hamada-san

445
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,220
Congratulations

446
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,220
I was looking for it

447
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,220
I was waiting for this.

448
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,220
What is the reward from Kazushige?

449
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,220
What is it?

450
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,220
I brought wine.

451
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,220
It's a high-class wine.

452
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,220
It's expensive.

453
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,220
It's about 50,000 yen.

454
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,220
It's more than 100,000 yen at a shop.

455
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,220
Thank you very much.

456
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,220
Do you like red wine?

457
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,220
Yes, red wine.

458
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,220
Have you ever been drunk?

459
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,220
I've been drinking.

460
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,220
I've never seen it.

461
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,220
I want to drink it.

462
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,220
I'm going to come with a Santa Crab.

463
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,220
You're going to come with a Santa Crab?

464
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,220
No matter what happens,

465
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,220
I'm going to be the best Sake-nochi!

466
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:17,220
I really don't want to get angry at people over the age of 8.

467
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,220
If I talk too much, I'll get angry.

468
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,220
I'll get angry at the world.

469
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,220
I don't want to get angry. I will never get angry.

470
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,220
I will never get angry.

471
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,220
But I have a suggestion.

472
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
Yes, yes.

473
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
Really...

474
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:39,220
You know, when you get in a car, you park it at the parking lot of Aodora.

475
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,220
Yes, yes.

476
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,220
That is...

477
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,220
First of all, it's expensive in Tokyo.

478
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,220
Oh, in terms of price.

479
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,220
It's really expensive.

480
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,220
You can only stay for 2 hours.

481
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,220
If you don't, you'll get 4000 yen.

482
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,220
It depends on the place.

483
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,220
Sometimes you get 4000 or 5000 yen.

484
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,220
I see.

485
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,220
It can't be helped.

486
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,220
But you can't use 10,000 yen bills.

487
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,220
That's true.

488
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,220
Right?

489
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,220
It's okay to ask for the price.

490
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,220
But is there anyone in the world who has a thousand yen bill?

491
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,220
That's true.

492
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:25,220
If you think about it, you have to use 10,000 yen bills as a corporate effort.

493
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:31,220
There are two kinds of 1000 yen bills.

494
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,220
It's a plastic one.

495
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,220
It's a patterned one.

496
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,220
It can't be done on top.

497
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,220
It's patterned.

498
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,220
I understand that.

499
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,220
If you get into the rain or wind, it will cause a breakdown.

500
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,220
So you have to do it like this.

501
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,220
Yes, and then I have to do it like a plastic bottle.

502
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,220
This is going to be like this, but while I'm doing this, it's going to be like this.

503
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,220
You can just do it like this.

504
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,220
But I don't think it's going to be like this.

505
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,220
Ah, well, well.

506
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,220
It's impossible.

507
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,220
I want you to think about it.

508
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,220
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

509
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,220
No, you're not angry, are you?

510
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,220
No, I'm not angry at all.

511
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,720
And recently, there was a guerrilla war.

512
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
It rained a lot.

513
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
So I did it there.

514
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
You see?

515
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,720
I couldn't use an umbrella like before.

516
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
I had to use both hands.

517
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
I had to use 4 life jackets.

518
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,720
And there was a little sun.

519
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,720
Was it for the machine?

520
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,720
Maybe it was for the machine.

521
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,220
There was a little sun.

522
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,220
It's short.

523
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,220
That's the center of the waterfall.

524
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,220
It's the most wet.

525
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,220
It's the most.

526
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,220
It's the most wet.

527
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,220
I'm excited.

528
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,220
I'm excited.

529
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,220
Can't you do something about that?

530
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,220
Just a little bit more.

531
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,220
Just a little bit more.

532
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,220
I thought I'd try not to get wet.

533
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
It's like this.

534
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,220
It's like this.

535
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,220
I can't do this anymore.

536
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,220
You're getting close.

537
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,220
What's that? What's that length?

538
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,220
You're not thinking about other people.

539
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,220
I'm not thinking about anyone.

540
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,220
You can't get the machine wet.

541
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,220
Then I don't need that.

542
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,220
I'd rather not have it.

543
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:29,220
If I had that, I'd be dead by the time I was done with it.

544
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,220
I'd be the first to run away.

545
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:26,540
I'd be the one to get all the

546
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,540
I'm a man of my word!

547
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,540
I'm the best!

548
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:36,540
I've been through all the bad luck in the world!

549
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,540
I really want you to stop!

550
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,540
It's short.

551
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,540
The people watching this...

552
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,540
I think they'll understand if you drive a car.

553
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,540
I can only think of it as a habit.

554
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,540
You won't get angry, will you?

555
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,840
I've been saying something like this for a while now.

556
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,540
I'm just crying.

557
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,540
You should have talked more quietly.

558
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
You definitely want to sing, right?

559
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,540
I want to sing here!
