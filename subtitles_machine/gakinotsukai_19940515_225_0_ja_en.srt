1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
THE NEXT DAY

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,500
He's up.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Good morning.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
He's so chubby.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,500
I'm so pissed.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Did you see the guy in the black suit?

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,000
I saw him a little.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,000
I didn't see him at all.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,500
Did he laugh at you?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,500
Was it a joke?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
No, they came out and did it.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Did they laugh at you?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,500
No, they didn't.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Right?

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Why didn't you tell them?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,500
They didn't have to laugh.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,500
No, they didn't.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,500
They were rude.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Rude?

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,500
They didn't listen to you because your hair was long.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
They said that to you, right?

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,500
They didn't listen to you, right?

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,500
They were comedians.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,500
They weren't comedians.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Right?

26
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
They weren't comedians.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
They weren't comedians.

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
They wouldn't be comedians if they were like that.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They were wearing dirty clothes.

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,500
I don't think so.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I don't know.

32
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Bring me some paper.

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Paper?

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Write your name on this.

35
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll give it to you.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,500
I'll give it to you as soon as possible.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,500
Did you know where they were?

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,500
What are you talking about?

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,500
Let's fly a helicopter.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,500
What?

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,500
Why do you want to fly a helicopter?

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,500
Get a pigeon.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,500
Give me a pigeon.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,500
Why are you doing this?

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,500
I don't know.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,500
Can you do it?

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,500
I think I can do it.

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,500
I'll get it ready.

49
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's fly a helicopter.

50
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's fly a helicopter.

51
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,000
Stop it.

52
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's stop it.

53
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's stop it.

54
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's fly a helicopter.

55
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,000
Write your name on this.

56
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll write it.

57
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,000
Write your name on this.

58
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Stop saying, we are.

59
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's fly a helicopter.

60
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's go.

61
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,000
Everyone.

62
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes.

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,500
Let's fly a helicopter.

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,500
What are you talking about?

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,500
Let's fly a helicopter.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,500
Let's fly a helicopter.

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,500
Get on the bus.

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,500
I'm going to the hospital.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,500
This program is provided by the sponsor.

70
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,000
Are you coming?

71
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,000
Are you coming?

72
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't think I'm coming.

73
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,000
You're not coming, are you?

74
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,000
You shouldn't say that.

75
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,000
I invited you.

76
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,000
Why didn't you come?

77
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,000
Who am I?

78
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,000
Who am I?

79
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,000
Everyone knows.

80
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,000
It's okay.

81
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,000
I went to your house.

82
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,000
We didn't do anything.

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,500
We just listened to the song.

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,500
What song?

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,500
I'm going to your house.

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,500
I'm going to your house.

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,500
I'm going to your house.

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,500
I don't think I'm coming.

89
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,500
I'm not coming.

90
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,500
Let's go home in 10 minutes.

91
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's go home in 10 minutes.

92
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,000
Is that so?

93
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,000
What?

94
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,000
Is that so?

95
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,000
Is that so?

96
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,000
Is that so?

97
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,000
Is that so?

98
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,000
Is that so?

99
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,000
Is that so?

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,500
Let's go together.

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,500
It's okay.

102
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,500
It's okay.

103
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,500
She's coming back.

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,500
She's good.

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,500
We want to hear her sing.

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,500
We want to hear her sing.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,500
Are you ready?

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,500
Are you ready?

109
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,500
Are you ready?

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,500
Is that so?

111
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,500
I don't know

112
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,500
He's doing it

113
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
I can't do it

114
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,500
He's doing it

115
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Asuka got hit

116
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Chagi

117
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Let's ride together

118
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,500
This is long

119
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,500
You have to put your ears out

120
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Put your ears out?

121
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Did Nishikawa-san say that?

122
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,500
You have to put your ears out

123
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,500
I have to put my shoes on

124
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,500
It's easy to move

125
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
You can do it

126
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,500
It's strange

127
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,500
You have to put your shoes on

128
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,500
When they appear, put your hands together

129
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:44,120
Well done

130
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,120
I'm gonna do it

131
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,120
I'm gonna do it

132
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Hey

133
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Hey

134
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,120
I'm not saying it because I don't like it

135
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,120
I'm saying it on behalf of you guys

136
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,120
I didn't know

137
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,120
Hey

138
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,120
I'm going to be a great cartoonist

139
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,120
I'm going to be a great cartoonist

140
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm going to be a great cartoonist

141
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,120
I won't let that happen

142
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,120
I've done it before

143
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,120
How's it?

144
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,120
I guess this is my life

145
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,120
He came

146
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,120
He understood me

147
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,120
I said sorry and said it was just a joke

148
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,120
I told him I'd sell him

149
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,120
I said I'd pay him back

150
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,120
He said I was too fat

151
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,120
I look thin on TV

152
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,120
But I was fat

153
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:23,120
I said everything I wanted to say

154
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,120
I can't sell for them

155
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,120
It depends on my Chinese

156
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,120
I get it

157
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,120
I don't care who says it

158
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Happy birthday

159
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Ladies and gentlemen

160
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,120
It's Hamada's birthday

161
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,120
He drank two cups of champagne

162
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,120
He's in a bad mood

163
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,120
What do you want to do?

164
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,120
I want to watch the wide show

165
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Speak faster

166
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,120
There was a big incident in Osaka

167
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,120
I didn't know

168
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,120
He went fishing on his day off

169
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,120
He said his back hurt

170
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
His back?

171
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,120
He looked at his back and said

172
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,120
You've been stabbed

173
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Really?

174
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
You're lying

175
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,120
It was on the news

176
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,120
It's true that it happened

177
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,120
But you're wrong

178
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,120
My back hurts

179
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,120
Please watch it

180
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,120
It's on the news

181
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,120
My back hurts

182
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Please watch it

183
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,120
I won't say it

184
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,120
He's an old man from Osaka

185
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,120
He's an old man from Osaka

186
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,120
There was a big fire in NGK

187
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,120
There was a big fire

188
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,120
There was takoyaki

189
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,120
There was a big fire

190
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,120
There was a big fire

191
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,120
I asked for takoyaki

192
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
There was a big fire

193
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,120
There was a big fire

194
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,120
I asked him to wait

195
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,120
There are many things

196
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,120
Have you calmed down?

197
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,120
I'm in a good mood

198
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,120
You're acting like a human

199
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,120
I'm fine

200
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,120
It's hot

201
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
What are you doing?

202
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,120
You're putting it in again

203
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,120
If you hadn't put the mic here

204
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,120
I would have shown it

205
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,120
You're putting it in again

206
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,120
You took it off

207
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,120
I didn't mean to make it popular

208
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,120
Don't cut it

209
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,120
I'm sorry

210
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,120
It's very popular

211
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Who is it popular with?

212
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Marunouchi

213
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Young salaryman

214
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,120
It's very popular

215
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,120
I didn't mean it

216
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,120
I don't know if you like it

217
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,120
I always do it

218
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,120
I had a class called Fuji Sankei Classic

219
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,120
I was doing it in the rain

220
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,120
I was doing it in the rain

221
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,120
I was doing it in the rain

222
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,120
I was doing it in the rain

223
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,120
It's wet

224
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,120
I was doing it

225
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Did someone say hello to you?

226
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,120
It's usual

227
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Hi

228
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,120
I thought you were filming

229
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,120
You were recording?

230
00:12:12,120 --> 00:11:53,480
It was

231
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Actually, we're the same.

232
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
Oh, hello!

233
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
We're the same.

234
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
I was caught by the camera.

235
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Also, the commercial...

236
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
What do you mean by that?

237
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,480
At first, I thought it was a bit of a joke, so I made it sound good.

238
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
You deceived me.

239
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
You deceived me.

240
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
You deceived me.

241
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
The commercial didn't cost any money.

242
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:24,480
There are a lot of commercials that are like the Sangaria of the Shimoda Kageki.

243
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
It's like...

244
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,480
I was just doing this in front of Kuromaki.

245
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
I'm in the middle!

246
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,480
That's terrible, isn't it?

247
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,480
It's like the Shimoda Kageki commercial is worth a lot of money.

248
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
It's worth a lot of money.

249
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
The commercial is true.

250
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
That's right. It's terrible.

251
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,480
You should have spent more money.

252
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,480
I don't have any money right now.

253
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,480
I don't think I'll be able to do one more commercial.

254
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,480
It's not broken at all.

255
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
I'm not selling it anymore.

256
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
I'm selling it!

257
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
Now?

258
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
That's right.

259
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,480
That's the rest of the city.

260
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,480
I'm going to the convenience store.

261
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,480
I'm going to put it in the back of the big refrigerator.

262
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,480
It's going to flow forward.

263
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,480
There are few products that are selling well, so I have to add them right away.

264
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
That's right.

265
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
Zura!

266
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
Zura!

267
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Zura!

268
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,480
The popular one is a little lukewarm.

269
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,480
It's cold!

270
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Why is there a shutter in the convenience store and family restaurant that is open 24 hours a day?

271
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,480
There are times when you can rest 24 hours a day.

272
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
I can't rest 24 hours a day.

273
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
I don't know how many days you can rest on New Year's Day.

274
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,480
No, it's not that. The convenience store is open even on New Year's Day.

275
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
I take a break when I have something to do.

276
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
You're wearing a shutter for that time.

277
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
That's right.

278
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Just for that?

279
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Yes.

280
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
See you again.

281
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:36,480
When you have to set up a shop in a building, you have to wear a shutter.

282
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
That's right!

283
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,480
In the end, you get to know me by asking me all the questions.

284
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,480
Every time, a lot of customers come.

285
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,480
When a really good customer comes,

286
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,480
when I think this is a good customer,

287
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,480
I don't let them go.

288
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,480
Don't be ridiculous.

289
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
Do you understand?

290
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
What?

291
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,480
Don't push yourself too hard.

292
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,480
Recently, a shocking thing has become the topic of our class.

293
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Masatoshi-kun's...

294
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
Ah, me?

295
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
Masatoshi-kun's is called a side shoulder.

296
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
Why?

297
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,480
Masatoshi-kun's is called a side shoulder.

298
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,480
I want you to confirm that Masatoshi-kun's is different.

299
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
Wait a minute.

300
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
But if you look at me and say,

301
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,480
Ah!

302
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,480
I get it!

303
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
What are you talking about?

304
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,480
No, I don't say that.

305
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,480
Then look at me.

306
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,480
Wait a minute.

307
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
The PC is not working either.

308
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,480
Thank you for the food.

309
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,480
Thank you for the food.

310
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,480
It's different.

311
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
Why are you crying?

312
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
No, no.

313
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,480
It's not a side shoulder at all.

314
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
What's wrong?

315
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
What's wrong?

316
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
Why are you crying?

317
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,480
Hey!

318
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Come on, get a hold of yourself.

319
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
No, but...

320
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
A side shoulder is a little smelly for everyone.

321
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
Ah...

322
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,480
You don't wear this kind of thing, do you?

323
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
I'll never wear it.

324
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Why do you know that?

325
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,480
I'm sorry.

326
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
The smell...

327
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
It's different, you idiot.

328
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,480
I really don't like it.

329
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,480
My feet don't stink either.

330
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
It doesn't stink at all.

331
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Even my toes stink, you idiot.

332
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Hey, hey, are you serious?

333
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,480
My toes don't stink like my sister before.

334
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,480
Your sister stinks like that.

335
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
Your sister stinks like that.

336
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
Your sister stinks like that.

337
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
It stinks.

338
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
It definitely stinks.

339
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,480
My feet don't stink at all.

340
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
My breath doesn't stink either.

341
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Your breath stinks.

342
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,480
You smell like a squid.

343
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,480
Why are you laughing?

344
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
Well, it's a tough joke.

345
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
What's that smell?

346
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,480
Have you ever smelled like poop?

347
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
No, no.

348
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,480
I think it was about 1,000, 1,000, 1,000 weeks ago.

349
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Do you remember that?

350
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Like the prince of the country of poop.

351
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
No, I'm serious.

352
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
I don't smell like poop.

353
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
I don't smell like poop.

354
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,480
I smell like poop sometimes.

355
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
It stinks.

356
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
You idiot.

357
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,480
No, it doesn't stink.

358
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
It doesn't stink?

359
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Well, it stinks.

360
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,480
It doesn't stink.

361
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,480
I go to the movies a lot.

362
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
I like movies.

363
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
I go to the movies a lot.

364
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
You go to the movies a lot?

365
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
But I can't go.

366
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
You can't go?

367
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
I can't go.

368
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,480
I like amusement parks.

369
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
You don't like amusement parks?

370
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
I don't like them.

371
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Stop it.

372
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
Where did you have your first kiss?

373
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
You're so cool.

374
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
You're a chanson singer.

375
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Why?

376
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
This is a chanson...

377
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
This is a chanson?

378
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,480
I can't sing.

379
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
Wait a minute.

380
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
You sing.

381
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
I went to the Shimming Land in Amagasaki.

382
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
Really?

383
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Actually, I went to the Shimming Land in Amagasaki.

384
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
I said that on TV.

385
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,480
I don't know how he got it wrong.

386
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Mr. Matsumoto and Ms. Amano kissed in the Shimming Land in Amagasaki.

387
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,480
Please tell me the moment when the newspaper turns into a newspaper.

388
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,480
It turns into something when you wrap it.

389
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
That's not it.

390
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,480
It's just now.

391
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
Where are you going?

392
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
The stage.

393
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
The sleeves.

394
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,480
Where is this?

395
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,480
I see.

396
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,480
That's what you're saying.

397
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,480
That's what you're saying.

398
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
I got it.

399
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
I'll read the newspaper.

400
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
Read the newspaper.

401
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,480
I'll put the newspaper I've read in a rack.

402
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,480
I'll put it in the house I live in.

403
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,480
I'll put it in the house I live in.

404
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,480
I'll put it in the house I live in.

405
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,480
The moment you put it in, it's still a newspaper.

406
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,480
It's still a newspaper.

407
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,480
I have to make onigiri.

408
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,480
Make onigiri.

409
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
You're making onigiri?

410
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
I'm making onigiri.

411
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Even then, it's still a newspaper?

412
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
It's still a newspaper.

413
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
It has nothing to do with it.

414
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
Onigiri, yes.

415
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Mom, I'm done.

416
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Hitoshi, please get the newspaper.

417
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,480
It's still a newspaper?

418
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
It's still a newspaper.

419
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
I'm nervous.

420
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Hitoshi put his hand on it.

421
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
He took the newspaper.

422
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
At that time it's still a newspaper

423
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
It's still a newspaper

424
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
It's a newspaper

425
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
This is done

426
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
Wrap it

427
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Put it here

428
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
At this time it's still a newspaper

429
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,480
What are you going to do with it?

430
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Wrap it like this

431
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
No

432
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
The other way

433
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
Wrap it like this

434
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
Yes

435
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
I'm doing it while thinking

436
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
I don't know which is better

437
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Like this

438
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
That's right

439
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
It's still a newspaper

440
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,480
It's still a newspaper

441
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
Like this

442
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
It's still a newspaper

443
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
It's still a newspaper

444
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,480
Happy birthday to you

445

It's amazing

449
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
It's amazing

450
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
You are 31 years old

451
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
You are old

452
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
Hello

453
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
Open it

454
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
I want to be on TV

455
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
