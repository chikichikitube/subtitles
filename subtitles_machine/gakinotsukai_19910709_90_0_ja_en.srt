1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hama-chan's KIN-CHAN RACING MOTOKU!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hama-chan, you're good.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm not good at all.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I talked about it last time.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You said it.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I got a letter from the viewers.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Just one?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I want you to appear in the Fuji TV program called KIN-CHAN RACING.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm not going.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not ready for KIN-CHAN RACING yet.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's enough.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's enough just to wear a suit.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Put this on.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Makeup.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Why are you doing that?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I didn't expect you to do this again.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is the suit I wore when I was a stuntman.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not good at all.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm getting old.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll put this on.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Why are you doing that?

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
My teeth are wet.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't like it.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't like it.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I don't like it.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I don't like it.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I don't like it.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I didn't mean to change it.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I didn't mean to change it.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I have to train.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why?

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I have to train.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Run.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm going to train here.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's go.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's go.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's fun.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's fun.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's like this.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's like a train.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's like this.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's fun.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's speed up.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's coming.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's coming.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's coming.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's fun.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's fun.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's fun.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
More.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's fun.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I see.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll put this on.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This program has 8 episodes.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
8 episodes.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Are you serious?

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let's go.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's coming.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's coming.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Faster.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Faster.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Faster.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Faster.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Faster.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Faster.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Faster.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Faster.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Faster.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Faster.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That was great.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hey!

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hey!

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hey!

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hey!

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's really hard.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's really hard.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
As promised.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
As I told you before.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We are going to meet the Minister of Culture.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We are going to meet the Minister of Culture.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It was really hard.

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It was really hard.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It was really hard.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It was really hard.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We had lunch, and we were late.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We had lunch, and we were late.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I wear a suit.

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I wear a suit.

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And you wear a tie.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Wearing a necktie, wearing pants, and wearing a plastic bald headdress.

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
With a red nose.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
With a red nose.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I went there.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm going to see the Prime Minister now.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The Prime Minister?

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm going to see the Prime Minister.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I see.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What are we going to talk about today?

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Today, we're going to talk about Yuka.

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yuka?

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes.

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Just one story?

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Just one story.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What are you going to do if he's in a bad mood?

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Him?

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes.

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If I give him a sign, he'll turn around and bully me.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Like this?

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll kick his belly and run away.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Then tell him to run away.

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll tell him to run away.

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You tell him to run away and I'll catch him.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yes.

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll tell him that.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll tell him.

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
If I get caught, I'll leave the rest to you.

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes.

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Leave it to me.

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll leave it to you.

126
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I can't be in this situation.

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh, really?

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I have a policy as a comedian.

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I see.

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I can't be in this situation.

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh, really?

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes.

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I can't be in this situation.

134
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I see.

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I have a policy as a comedian.

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm proud of it.

137
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, really?

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes.

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But people will think I'm a fool.

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Good luck.

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He has a scary face.

142
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He's amazing.

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He's a very popular guy.

144
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll do my best.

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He was amazing.

146
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He was in front of the entrance.

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It was huge police station.

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And there were a lot of SP's.

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And this guy was so scary.

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I really wanted to entertain myself.

151
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I did my best.

152
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I was worried at first.

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I held his hand and said,

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Tashiro-san came to the entrance and said,

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
No!

156
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Every time he said that, I said, No!

157
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
How many times did you say that to me?

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's not good.

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I said, No!

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Is it over?

161
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He came out.

162
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I said, I'll go.

163
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I went down the stairs.

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
When I went down the stairs,

165
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Kento Delicato said,

166
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No!

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No!

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What are you doing?

169
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I tried to go down, but I couldn't.

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I raised my hand and said,

171
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Where do you think you are?

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I thought you were going to run away.

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I shook it off and went down.

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
SP said,

175
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What are they?

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I was scared.

177
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It was the first time I held his hand.

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Seriously.

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The first time I saw them,

180
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I said,

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's not good.

182
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
They pretend to be strangers.

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
They don't come close.

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Right?

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
They have guts.

186
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
They have guts.

187
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I don't do that.

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm in the film department.

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You guys are here.

190
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Hanshin and I are here.

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We're here together.

192
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's a popular show.

193
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It stinks.

194
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's good.

195
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Everyone came together.

196
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It was a calm atmosphere.

197
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The person who came was Gyo, so I asked him to take a picture.

198
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He said,

199
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There!

200
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He was a little angry.

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I went to his place and gave him a name card.

202
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He was a secretary.

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I knew it.

204
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I was watching the servant of the child.

205
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I was waiting for him.

206
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I was waiting for him.

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He said a lot of things.

208
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He left.

209
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let me introduce his wife.

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
His wife is still here.

211
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
His wife doesn't know much about us.

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
She doesn't know.

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
She's always watching us.

214
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Get out of the way!

215
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
She's a liar.

216
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
She's a liar.

217
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Ask her about her job.

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Right.

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If there was a 2.26 incident, I couldn't write it at all.

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Most of them were wearing a wig.

221
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Most of them.

222
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There was no discomfort at all.

223
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It was hard.

224
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There was a little left.

225
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I should have hit him more.

226
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I took it off.

227
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I took it off a little.

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The back is clean.

229
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The back is clean.

230
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I hit him with a stick.

231
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That was good.

232
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That was good.

233
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
After that, I kicked him.

234
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That was no good.

235
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I knocked down 4 SPs.

236
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The fifth one.

237
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
My nose is open.

238
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
My nose was broken.

239
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I was hit.

240
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But he was really a good man.

241
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I really wanted to meet him.

242
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Right.

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
To be honest, I still don't agree with the consumption tax.

244
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I wanted to tell him that.

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
If he resists, I'll use my fist anytime.

246
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Right.

247
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If he resists.

248
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
If he resists.

249
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
If he gives me a sign.

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Right.

251
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
If he gives me a sign.

252
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I have to beat him up.

253
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
At that time, he didn't understand us.

254
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He gave me a sign to go.

255
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I beat him up.

256
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I told him to be Nan-chan.

257
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He...

258
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I went home.

259
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He was like,

260
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'll be Nan-chan.

261
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll be Nan-chan.

262
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't like that kind of thing.

263
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't enjoy it.

264
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't want to do it.

265
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't copy me.

266
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't want to do it.

267
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If you like it, I'll copy you.

268
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You know, the thing that comes out of the plate.

269
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Like this.

270
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It looks like a man.

271
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Like this.

272
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That voice is cool.

273
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Like this.

274
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Like this.

275
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Like this.

276
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Like this.

277
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Like this.

278
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Like this.

279
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Like this.

280
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Like this.

281
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Like this.

282
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm scared.

283
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I just want to say that.

284
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I just want to say that.

285
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I just want to say that.

286
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I want to try that.

287
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Can't you do it at the opening?

288
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Can an amateur do that?

289
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Do you have a license?

290
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I do.

291
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I do.

292
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Do you have a license?

293
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I do.

294
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Do you want to get a license?

295
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Go get it.

296
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Do you want me to get it?

297
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yes.

298
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Really?

299
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yes.

300
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Will you give me money?

301
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Why?

302
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You want to do it, don't you?

303
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What kind of license do you want?

304
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Do you want a boiler license?

305
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Will it be useful?

306
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Do you want a boiler license?

307
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Wouldn't it be better to weld it?

308
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Do you want a boiler license?

309
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I want a welding license.

310
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Let's do it at the opening.

311
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Do you want me to do something like this at the opening?

312
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Do you want me to weld it?

313
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yes.

314
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What are you doing?

315
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Do you want a boiler license?

316
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Do you want a boiler license?

317
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Let's get a license.

318
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You don't have a license at all.

319
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
If you think about it.

320
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's right.

321
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
My car license was taken away.

322
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Do you know why?

323
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Because I stole gasoline.

324
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No.

325
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's not true.

326
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I only have a normal car.

327
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Go get a license.

328
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's funny.

329
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I can play at the opening.

330
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If you get a license?

331
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes.

332
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You can only do it at that place.

333
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You can't do that.

334
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You can't do that.

335
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You can't do that.

336
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You can't do that.

337
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You can't do that.

338
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
If you say yes from that place, the dishes will fly away.

339
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Is that so?

340
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Where does the dishes come from?

341
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I've been thinking about it all my life.

342
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Someone said yes.

343
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Is that so?

344
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I can't do that.

345
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
If you say yes, it's a violation of the law.

346
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What?

347
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That's a sign.

348
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What?

349
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Really?

350
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Is it okay even if it's not yes?

351
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Is it okay to say yes?

352
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Of course!

353
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If you say yes, they will push the button.

354
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Is it okay if I say yes?

355
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's hard to understand.

356
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What should I do?

357
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Is it okay?

358
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Is it okay?

359
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't think so.

360
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Well, well, let's think about it.

361
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's go with Aragaki.

362
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yes, Aragaki.

363
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Wow, I was surprised.

364
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Thank you very much for promoting me on TV.

365
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What happened?

366
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Well, in the shop...

367
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Well, if you're going to promote me anyway, please promote this one.

368
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This one?

369
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yes.

370
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Healthy curry?

371
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yes, we have a curry shop.

372
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh, really?

373
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yes.

374
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes.

375
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Walk straight to the left.

376
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's behind the first Toyota building.

377
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We don't use water for our curry.

378
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
We cook it with yogurt.

379
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Really?

380
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's right.

381
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What?

382
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What if we go to the kitchen and there's a curry prince?

383
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
No way.

384
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That kind of curry is only in Japan.

385
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That kind of solid one.

386
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That's not good.

387
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Well, the students are watching.

388
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
They're always watching this program.

389
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes.

390
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And they talk a lot about you.

391
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What?

392
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
They don't talk about me.

393
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So I thought I'd thank you today.

394
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Did I say something?

395
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
No, I don't remember.

396
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You talked a lot.

397
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's not true.

398
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm a big fan.

399
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Really?

400
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Well, today...

401
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Well, in the first place, I have a deep connection with Yoshimoto Kogyo.

403
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's the same.

404
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I've been to Yoshimoto.

405
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yoshimoto Kogyo?

406
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Really?

407
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That's a mistake.

408
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You're a senior here.

409
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Well, that's...

410
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I didn't say anything.

411
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I've been there.

412
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So, I'm a big fan of you.

413
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Thank you very much.

414
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Please promote it.

415
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes, thank you.

416
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Thank you very much.

417
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This program has guests all of a sudden.

418
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You'll be surprised.

419
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I can't say bad things.

420
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You can't say bad things.

421
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Well, let me introduce the manuscript.

422
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's about a house near my house.

423
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:06,000
There is a house called Hamada and Matsumoto in Yamaguchi's house.

424
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What is this?

425
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
This is Yamaguchi's house.

426
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
This is Hamada and Matsumoto's house.

427
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
This is Matsumoto's house.

428
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Are these houses lined up?

429
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yes, they are.

430
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
There is an old man who is 73 years old in both Hamada and Matsumoto's houses.

431
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
We call them Hamaji and Matsuji.

432
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The difference between Hamaji and Matsuji is that they are good friends and bad friends.

433
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
They often drink tea in the garden of Hamaji's house.

434
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
They often quarrel and talk about the past.

435
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
When I was a child, I often played with Hamaji.

436
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Thank you, Hamaji.

437
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I love Hamaji, but Matsuji has a bad breath.

438
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I've quarreled with him, but I've been with him since I was a student.

439
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's rare to quarrel with a man.

440
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That's amazing.

441
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's rare.

442
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's rare.

443
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
He is an old man.

444
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Everyone is laughing now, but I don't want to quarrel with him.

445
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
He has a bad breath.

446
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's hard to quarrel with him.

447
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
What should I do?

448
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's hard.

449
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
There is a lever in the picture.

450
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's a pink plastic lever.

451
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It would be nice if it was a partial lever.

452
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The whole lever?

453
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yes.

454
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That's hard.

455
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
When you get older, a lot of things come out.

456
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't know if it's a lever or not.

457
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What is it?

458
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
For example, an old man's eye.

459
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I see.

460
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What is an old man's eye?

461
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's an electron.

462
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I can see far away.

463
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I can see close.

464
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's like this.

465
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
An old man's eye.

466
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
If I were an old man, I would definitely enter the world of birds.

467
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I can see far away.

468
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Really?

469
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That's good.

470
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I can't see close.

471
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I want to see close.

472
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I want to see far away.

473
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That's right.

474
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What is the difference between what you can only see here and what you can only see in front of you?

475
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's better to see two kilometers away.

476
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What is this?

477
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I can't see it at all.

478
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I don't like it.

479
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's better to be close.

480
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Why?

481
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm not interested in two kilometers away.

482
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm not interested in two kilometers away.

483
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't know if that's true.

484
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's better to be close.

485
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Why can't you see?

486
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Two kilometers away again?

487
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
No.

488
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I can't see two kilometers away.

489
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I can see here.

490
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's better to walk two kilometers and see here.

491
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So if you move, two kilometers away will move.

492
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
This is two kilometers away.

493
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
If this is two kilometers, I'm doing it here.

494
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That's right.

495
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I want to go from here to here.

496
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
If you want, two kilometers away.

497
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If I move, this guy will move.

498
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That's right.

499
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So your eyes are two kilometers away.

500
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That's why I'm a good boy.

501
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I can see it here.

502
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That's good.

503
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I can see it here.

504
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That's good.

505
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm a good boy.

506
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Two kilometers away is good.

507
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm a good boy.

508
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
My eyes are two kilometers away.

509
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That's right.

510
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So when you wear a T-shirt, it's two kilometers away.

511
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm covering my eyes.

512
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That's right.

513
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Two kilometers further away.

514
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Two kilometers away from your main body.

515
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Two kilometers away from your main body.

516
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Another main body guy is looking at you.

517
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Then who are you talking to?

518
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's like this.

519
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's like this.

520
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But you guys are not worth hitting at all.

521
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I can only see this side of you and this side of you.

522
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Which side of you is good?

523
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
This side is good.

524
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So the main body guy is better.

525
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's impossible.

526
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Let's go home.

527
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That's enough.

528
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You talk too much.

529
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Even if you say that, we can go home right away.

530
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's like a crescent moon.

531
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
We're stars, so we'll go back to the stars.

532
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's like a crescent moon.

533
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's amazing.

534
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Don't make such a noise.

535
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Don't make such a noise.

536
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's scary.

537
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Can you see it?

538
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's scary.

539
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I ran with Kin-chan today.

540
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What are you talking about?

541
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That's decided.

542
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Really?

543
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You're lucky.

544
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You're lucky.

545
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm not lucky.

546
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm not lucky at all.

547
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That's all for today.

548
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Next week, we're going to show you the video of Kin-chan running.

549
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Please look forward to it.

550
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Goodbye.

551
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's over.

552
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's over.

553
00:23:36,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's over.
