00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
After a Long Relationship

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's been awhile...

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,500
Yup...

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I didn't see you anymore...

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Look at him! He got back all of hisGIVEAWAY Cl willing

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Look at him!! He got back all of hisGIVEAWAY Cl willing

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:12,000
His face looks like he got something back from someone else...

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
He got back all of hisGIVEAWAY Cl willing

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,800
He looks so Release A similar expression that he took off last week...

10
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,000
Look here! He's got a真振运!

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, well...

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But...

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
At least his face looks like it has been returned...

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm starting to get angry.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What's going on?

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm starting to get angry.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Say it already.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What's going on?

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There's probably some people who quit smoking, but...

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, you're still smoking?

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm still smoking.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm still smoking.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're still smoking.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
No, no, I'm not smoking.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's not like I want to smoke.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Really?

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you don't have that kind of will...

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Then jump in!

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't have that kind of will.

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not a professor, but...

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Professor Heihachi just said...

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He said there's nothing good about it.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There's really nothing good about it.

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, really?

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's why I said it.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He said it's good for your stomach.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's a lie!

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Really?

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If you ask a guy who went on a trip abroad and came back...

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How was it?

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He'll say, it was fun.

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's the same as that.

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What are you talking about?

45
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's a lie.

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's easy to say it wasn't fun.

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It costs a lot of money.

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I see.

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I want to say it's good.

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's good.

51
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's good.

52
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So you want to say that you quit smoking and you're good at eating?

53
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I want to say it.

54
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I want to say I have stamina.

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I see.

56
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't have anything.

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What is that?

58
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's a lie.

59
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's completely a lie.

60
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I get irritated.

61
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I get irritated a lot.

62
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Your parents must be irritated too.

63
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I do.

64
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I do want to eat gum.

65
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You want to eat gum?

66
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You want to eat gum?

67
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes.

68
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
When I come home today...

69
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There's that thing.

70
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
There's a lot of stuff in there.

71
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes, yes, yes.

72
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's like a drum can.

73
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, yes, yes.

74
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If I open it while driving...

75
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Bam!

76
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Everything!

77
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Everything!

78
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you look at it...

79
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Only the paper is left.

80
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Bam!

81
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's your fault.

82
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But you put it in properly.

83
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No, no.

84
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I put it in the right place.

85
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Damn!

86
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You want to say that you quit smoking.

87
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I really quit smoking.

88
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I really quit smoking recently.

89
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The other day...

90
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I was surprised.

91
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why were you surprised?

92
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You know...

93
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yuta worked really hard, right?

94
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes.

95
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, that's a bad thing to say.

96
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I think he's making quite a bit of money.

97
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The other day...

98
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I woke up in the morning.

99
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Why are you laughing?

100
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I woke up in the morning.

101
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I was taking a shower.

102
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes.

103
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I was doing this.

104
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It was cold in the morning.

105
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why is it so cold?

106
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
My heart was throbbing too.

107
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No, you shouldn't talk about it.

108
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I went to the toilet many times.

109
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Apparently...

110
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The gas was stopped.

111
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

112
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I've been trying to stop it for months.

113
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I think it was in the mail.

114
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It was in the mail.

115
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But I didn't see it.

116
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I only saw it once or twice a week.

117
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I didn't know.

118
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It was in the kitchen.

119
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I turned it on.

120
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
When the gas was on, it was like a flame.

121
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I see.

122
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I see.

123
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
When I didn't see it, my heart was throbbing.

124
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I turned it on.

125
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I was like an old woman.

126
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I was like a young woman.

127
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Ah...

128
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I turned it off.

129
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It was like this.

130
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh...

131
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The whole panel was like this.

132
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Ah...

133
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, no, no, no, no.

134
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It was so cold.

135
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I turned it on again.

136
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I turned it on again.

137
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Ah...

138
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I turned it off again.

139
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I didn't notice it.

140
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I didn't think the gas was stopped.

141
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's right.

142
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I was like,

143
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't panic.

144
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's a stove.

145
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I turned on the stove and looked at it.

146
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I was like,

147
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't drink it.

148
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I made a mistake.

149
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I see.

150
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I went to the manager.

151
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It was cut in half.

152
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The gas was stopped.

153
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I was a junior high school student.

154
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I said,

155
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll do something.

156
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I looked into it.

157
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll call you back.

158
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I was in my room.

159
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I said,

160
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The gas store was here.

161
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I made a mistake.

162
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It was cut in half.

163
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I see.

164
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I turned on the gas.

165
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The manager looked into it.

166
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I paid for the gas.

167
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Is that okay?

168
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Say it.

169
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Say it.

171
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's not automatic.

173
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's not automatic.

174
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I was in the parking lot.

175
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I was in the parking lot many times.

176
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The gas was cut in half.

177
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
By yourself?

178
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't drink it.

179
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't drink it.

180
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It was cut in half.

181
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I was depressed.

182
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I thought I had to fix it.

183
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I looked into my past.

184
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It may be fixed soon.

185
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If I leave it alone,

186
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It may be fixed.

187
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It may be fixed.

188
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Natural gas.

189
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm glad to hear that.

190
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That may be the case.

191
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't know if that's the cause.

192
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If everyone quits smoking, I'll smoke.

193
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't like being with people.

194
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You smoked a lot.

195
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I didn't smoke as much as you thought.

196
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I didn't smoke as much as you thought.

197
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I didn't smoke as much as you thought.

198
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's enough.

199
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That's enough.

200
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What are you doing?

201
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What are you doing?

202
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You can smoke.

203
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I avoided it a little.

204
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's why I don't like it.

205
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Among the top ten things you shouldn't see in this world,

206
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I forgot the 9th and 6th places.

207
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I can't remember.

208
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Mr. Matsumoto, please tell me.

209
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's true.

210
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's true.

211
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's a little hot, so I'll get a tissue.

212
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll get a tissue.

213
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's true.

214
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Can I have one or two?

215
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
There's a lot more.

216
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Can I have 15th place?

217
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's enough.

218
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's enough.

219
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Excuse me.

220
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What is it?

221
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Among the top ten things you shouldn't see in this world,

222
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I forgot the 9th and 6th places.

223
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Among the top ten things you shouldn't see in this world,

224
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I forgot the 9th and 6th places.

225
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'll tell you.

226
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Did you forget?

227
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Why did you forget?

228
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't know.

229
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why don't you remember?

230
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I forgot.

231
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Why do you ask such a proud person?

232
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't know.

233
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Please tell me.

234
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What do you think it is?

235
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What kind of system is it?

236
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What kind of system is it?

237
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I think it's like that.

238
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's like a parent's child.

239
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That kind of thing.

240
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You haven't seen it?

241
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I've seen it four times.

242
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I haven't seen it.

243
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's like a testimony, right?

244
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I've seen it in the way that my father and father-in-law are treating the green man and the old lady.

245
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The old man.

246
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What? Be my child.

247
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You guys don't have to ask.

248
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I've seen it.

249
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's right.

250
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What kind of trauma is it?

251
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I've seen it in the morning.

252
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Go ahead.

253
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well, that's about it.

254
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
There are a lot of them.

255
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The 9th and 6th places.

256
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't really like them.

257
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Is that so?

258
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes.

259
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Go ahead.

260
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
There are still a lot of them.

261
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I think you'll be addicted to them.

262
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Thank you.

263
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Excuse me.

264
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This is a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who is known all over the world for his suit.

265
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes.

266
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Please tell me five things about climbing a suit.

267
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Isn't it hard to wear a suit and climb?

268
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It was hard.

269
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Why do you do it?

270
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Why do you do it?

271
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I was asked by everyone.

272
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why don't you do it?

273
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

274
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's right.

275
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I think this is a famous saying.

276
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But did you know it was hard to climb a suit?

277
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What?

278
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Did you know it was hard to climb a suit?

279
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What?

280
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Are you thinking about it now?

281
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What am I thinking about?

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You should act before you think.

283
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You knew it was hard to climb a suit, didn't you?

285
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I knew it, but I didn't do it.

286
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Please tell me those five things.

287
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't like the way you talk lightly.

288
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What is it?

289
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's a relaxed feeling.

290
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What is it?

291
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What is it?

292
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Something like this.

293
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's enough.

294
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Please tell me five things about climbing a suit.

295
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Climbing a suit is a must.

296
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's a must?

297
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's a must?

298
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's right.

299
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's right.

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Why?

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Climbing a suit doesn't matter.

302
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why?

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's useless.

304
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
When you climb a suit, your necktie goes like this.

305
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's not funny, is it?

306
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's not funny, is it?

307
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You don't like it, do you?

308
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll tell you.

309
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Climbing a suit doesn't matter.

310
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Your necktie goes like this.

311
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I made a mistake.

312
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Your necktie goes like this.

313
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's one thing.

314
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It goes like this.

315
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's not good, is it?

316
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But you don't do it, do you?

317
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's why I said it.

318
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Do you know why?

319
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
When your necktie goes like this.

320
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's scary.

321
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's a world where the roses go like that.

322
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The necktie goes like this.

323
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Which mountain are you climbing?

324
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You climb such a mountain in a suit?

325
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I thought it was a snowy mountain.

326
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I thought it was a normal mountain.

327
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's a snowy mountain.

328
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's a snowy mountain, right?

329
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's a snowy mountain.

330
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The roses go like that.

331
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The roses go like that.

332
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Of course.

333
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's a world where the roses go like that.

334
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
If you don't wear a necktie there,

335
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:06,000
why don't you wear a tie?

336
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
A tie?

337
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
If you say that, it's really scary.

338
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's really scary.

339
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's really scary.

340
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's scary.

341
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's scary.

342
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I've seen a lot of friends who went like this.

343
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I went all the way to the top, but it's all the way here.

344
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's like a red elephant is coming out from here.

345
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I see.

346
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You should wear a tie.

347
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You should.

348
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That's fine.

349
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's a mountain of neckties.

350
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That's a caustic button.

351
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You come all the way here?

352
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You should wear a caustic button.

353
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You should.

354
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You should.

355
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It doesn't really mean anything.

356
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What do you mean?

357
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It doesn't really mean anything.

358
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Why? Are you stupid?

359
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Is that so?

360
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What are you going to do if this part goes like this?

361
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What are you going to do if this part goes like this?

362
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
No, you should stop the button.

363
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No, winter mountains aren't that sweet.

364
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's really cold.

365
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's colder than you think.

366
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
In that sense, you should stop the button.

367
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's definitely...

368
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Then you should wear hiking clothes.

369
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Why do you go all the way to the top and wear a suit?

370
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Say it again.

371
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What?

372
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Say it again.

373
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Then you should wear hiking clothes.

374
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Then why?

375
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why do you go all the way to the top and wear a suit?

376
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Then why do you go all the way to the top and wear a suit?

377
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The caustic button.

378
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
There's a lot of that.

379
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There's also a rice cooker.

380
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't need a rice cooker.

381
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Why?

382
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I definitely need a rice cooker for a suit.

383
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But you don't need it.

384
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You don't need it.

385
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You're stupid.

386
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
When you feel like you're going to get lost...

387
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's SOM's Oda.

388
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I think I'm going to die at that point.

389
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Why?

390
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So we went.

391
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm curious.

392
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Party.

393
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh, hiking.

394
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, I get it now.

395
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You stupid, you get it now.

396
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I get it.

397
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:41,000
If you go to a party in a suit, all you do is a Christmas party.

398
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Why is he angry?

399
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
If you go to a party in a suit, all you do is a Christmas party.

400
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Is it Christmas?

401
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
A party in a suit?

402
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
This is a mountain.

403
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's a snowy mountain.

404
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You're stupid.

405
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You're going to die.

407
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm sorry.

408
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'll die when the time comes.

409
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Next is an example of a rice cooker.

410
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You should plug in a full-size room.

411
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What do you use that for?

412
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The ink will flow here.

413
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh, I see.

414
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It will flow.

415
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Okay, okay.

416
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's how you use it when you're in trouble.

417
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Like this.

418
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There's a helicopter.

419
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You can't see Yuta.

420
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You can't see him when he's wearing a suit.

421
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Then you use the ink here.

422
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You!

423
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What about the other one?

424
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You're so cool.

425
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What are you talking about?

426
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
There's another one.

427
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The flag.

428
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The company's flag.

429
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You put the company's flag on the roof.

430
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You put the company's flag on the roof.

431
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I see.

432
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I have to bring that.

433
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You have to bring that.

434
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I see.

435
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I see.

436
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Huh?

437
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's stronger than I thought.

438
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What are you talking about?

439
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You're noisy.

440
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What do you mean I'm noisy?

441
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's on my show.

442
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So I'm a little noisy.

443
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What happens to people when they go into the sea or the mountains?

444
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The mountain god is the sea god.

445
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I see.

446
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So the mountain god says no, but they go in.

447
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The sea god says no, but they go in.

448
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's not going to happen.

449
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What happens then?

450
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
For example, you have a house in the city.

451
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I do.

452
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It costs 2.5 billion yen.

453
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What kind of house is that?

454
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Are you stupid?

455
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It can't be.

456
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I have a house.

457
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's a 20-meter wall.

458
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What?

459
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
There's a 20-meter wall.

460
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Is there?

461
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
If you go in there, what will you do?

462
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Everyone gets angry.

463
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Everyone gets angry.

464
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But it doesn't mean anything.

465
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The mountain god and the sea god.

466
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The mountain god says no, but he doesn't hate people who like the mountains.

467
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's getting complicated.

468
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So?

469
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So you can't go in, but you're angry about coming in.

470
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But you like the mountains, don't you?

471
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I don't hate you that much.

472
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So what's going on?

473
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I know how you feel.

474
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So if you go into your house, you're like, hey!

475
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Hey!

476
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You really shouldn't come in.

477
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But the mountain god says you shouldn't come in.

478
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But you like the mountains.

479
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I know that.

480
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I don't hate you that much.

481
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That's how he gets angry.

482
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't get angry that much.

483
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Huh?

484
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I got it!

485
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So the sea is the same?

486
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The sea is a little different.

487
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's a little different.

488
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's different?

489
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah.

490
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But this guy stopped it.

491
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's different.

492
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's a completely different interpretation.

493
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Then tell me.

494
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What?

495
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Tell me about the sea.

496
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What?

497
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
If you go that far.

498
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Then I'll tell you.

499
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The mountain is a little manly, but the sea is a little womanly.

500
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh, really?

501
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes.

502
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Did you know?

503
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I didn't know.

504
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The mountain god is a man.

505
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But the mountain god is...

506
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What the hell!

507
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You're making me nervous.

508
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm going to rip you apart.

509
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I want to see it.

510
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I want to see it.

511
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You just said the mountain god is a man.

512
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I said the mountain god is a man.

513
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You're making me nervous.

514
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I didn't!

515
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The mountain god is a man.

516
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That's right.

517
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And the sea god is a woman.

518
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That's why I'm saying it's a little different.

519
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Then tell me.

520
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
If you go into the sea before the opening of the sea.

521
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Then I'll tell you how to say it.

522
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That's right.

523
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'll tell you.

524
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'll tell you.

525
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'll tell you that.

526
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The mountain god doesn't want you to go in.

527
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't think so.

528
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I see.

529
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't think so.

530
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't think so.

531
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I don't think so.

532
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't think so.

533
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't think so.

534
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I don't think so.

535
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Who are you talking to?

536
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
A crab.

537
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
There's a crab I like.

538
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Do your best.

539
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And?

540
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Do your best.

541
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What do you mean by do your best?

542
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm telling the crab.

543
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
What do you mean by do your best?

544
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm telling the crab.

545
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm telling the crab I like.

546
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm telling the crab that it's been a while.

547
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But I haven't told this crab how I feel yet.

548
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That you like it?

549
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That you like it?

550
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But the crab has already noticed.

551
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Wait a minute.

552
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What's wrong with that?

553
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's not like that.

554
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I can see the crab.

555
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I see.

556
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That's right.

557
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I don't think so.

558
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So the crab knows that I like it.

559
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It knows.

560
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It knows.

561
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
But there's a crab I like.

562
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That's not good.

563
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
There's a crab I like.

564
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It doesn't matter what crab.

565
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's a crab.

566
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And I'm saying things like,

567
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm saying things like,

568
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm saying things like,

569
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm saying things like,

570
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't know.

571
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I don't know.

572
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
But it says that.

573
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And it says,

574
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I don't know if I'm really that jealous of it.

575
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And,

576
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The crab that I like

577
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's what it says.

578
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
But if I say that,

579
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The female crab might be like,

580
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Are you saying something again?

581
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I see.

582
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So your face tells me you don't really know.

583
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That happened.

584
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But that's not what I'm trying to say right now.

585
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

586
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
If you're in the warehouse and someone comes in,

587
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
the crab will pinch your leg.

588
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I see.

589
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But stop it.

590
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
This is the sea crab.

591
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Stop it is the sea crab.

592
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
This is the sea crab.

593
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And then...

594
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And then the mountain crab...

595
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What the hell is that?

596
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
What the hell is that?

597
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Solve it yourself!

598
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I can't look at it.
