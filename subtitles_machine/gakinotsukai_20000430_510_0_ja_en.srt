1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Chikitsuki! Dantan Presents!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The 1,000,000 Yen Spring hide-and-seek tournament!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's the 4th time.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We've never done it before, so let's do it today.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We always do it in the middle.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In the 1st hide-and-seek tournament held in December last year,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
a mysterious UFO landed and captured an unknown alien.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The 1,000,000 Yen prize will be given to the winner.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In the 2nd hide-and-seek tournament held in February last year,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
a mysterious man was caught in a time-slip.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He was asked to take care of him,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
so the 1,000,000 Yen prize will be given to the winner.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
3 months later,

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
in the 3rd hide-and-seek tournament held in February last year,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
a cute baby was found to be sleeping.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The kind-hearted Dantan was caught by the baby in the hide-and-seek tournament.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The 1,000,000 Yen prize will be given to the winner.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Who will be the winner of the 1,000,000 Yen prize?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The producer, Mr. Suga, told me to stop raising 1,000,000 Yen.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll raise 1,000,000 Yen every time I walk.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's great!

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
1,000,000 Yen!

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What is it?

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Is that a horse?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's a horse.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is terrible.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
In this peaceful era without war,

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that hero came.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What are you talking about?

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Napoleon Bonaparte, the emperor of France,

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
came here in a time-slip.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's terrible.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's impossible.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The era is different.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's terrible.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Let me do it. Hide-and-seek.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's terrible.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's always raining when he does this.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He's the worst.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Come on.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I wanted to do it.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
1,000,000 Yen for walking.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm getting 1,000,000 Yen.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Napoleon Bonaparte, the emperor of France,

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Napoleon is his full name.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
There are children.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What's going on?

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hey!

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hey!

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hey!

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What?

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Napoleon.

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's Napoleon Bonaparte.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Now.

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He came like this.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He has the French flag.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hello?

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hello?

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He has the small flag of France.

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He has a dictionary.

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He has a dictionary.

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's a small dictionary.

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's impossible for him.

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right.

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hello?

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's follow him.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Shall we follow him?

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's follow him.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's terrible.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There's no time to hide.

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's right.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's all my fault.

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's just an incident.

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I was in a time slip.

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I was shocked.

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You were shocked?

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I was shocked.

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I see.

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But it was amazing.

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I looked like a person from the East.

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hello?

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hello?

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hello?

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He didn't wake up at all.

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He didn't wake up at all.

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He woke up.

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's wake him up with this.

89
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's wake him up with this.

90
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He woke up by mistake.

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's right.

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He woke up like this.

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He woke up like this.

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He had no choice but to wake up like this.

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This is the second one.

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He definitely woke up.

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He woke up.

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He woke up.

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This is Napoleon.

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Where are we?

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We are in Japan, in Heisei.

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Is it Japan?

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes, it's Japan.

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is the place where the hero Napoleon Bonaparte was born in France.

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There are no impossible words in this dictionary.

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is a famous one.

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I know it.

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He is terrible.

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He is terrible.

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He is terrible.

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He is terrible.

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He is terrible.

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
There are no impossible words in this dictionary.

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It says that there are no impossible words in it.

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Is it true?

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's try it.

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is a famous one.

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If there are no impossible words...

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
There are no impossible words in it.

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't know if there are no impossible words in it.

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why is he sighing?

122
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What will happen to this if there are no impossible words in it?

123
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It hurts!

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What's going on?

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hang in there, Ramuneo!

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What is this?

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What is this?

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What is this?

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This is a good effort.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
As expected of Napoleon.

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is his drink.

132
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's 40% alcohol.

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's alcohol.

134
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't hold back.

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's okay, Mr. Napoleon.

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Just drink this for now.

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You can't break it with your fingers.

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's wonderful.

139
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Is he really Napoleon?

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't know.

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm curious.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The last prince in the history of the world is Natsu.

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's amazing.

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Help me.

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm scared.

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's dangerous.

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Watch out!

148
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Watch out!

149
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Watch out!

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
There are no words of appreciation in the revolution.

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What is this?

152
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Just a little more.

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
A little more.

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He jumped.

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's dangerous.

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's like Hyeon-kichi didn't say anything.

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What is this?

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Here you are.

159
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's good.

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll do it with a weapon.

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's fast.

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's different from Fujiwara.

163
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll stop it first.

164
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'll stop it first.

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Mr. Napoleon jumped.

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Why did you do that?

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I made a mistake with the sound of the propeller.

168
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What is it?

169
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I want Napoleon.

170
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Napoleon asks for a brandy.

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He shows that he can't do it.

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But he can't stop drinking.

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
After that, he puts on a bra.

174
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He suddenly goes into the water.

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Mr. Napoleon.

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There is a game.

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Let's enjoy the beauty and the game.

178
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's do that.

179
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This is good.

180
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Look at this.

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This is amazing.

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's yellow.

183
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's good.

184
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's getting good.

185
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's good.

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's amazing.

187
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What is this?

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What is this?

189
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Napoleon.

190
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Napoleon.

191
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Who is it?

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I can't read it.

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I can't read it at all.

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I can't do this.

195
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I want you to press the button.

196
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Macchan.

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yes.

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Macchan is so cute.

199
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Macchan is so cute.

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why?

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Macchan.

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Macchan is a lady.

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Macchan is a lady.

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Hama-chan is a lady.

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hama-chan is a lady.

206
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Hama-chan is a lady.

207
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You know I'm motivated.

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm running out.

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm confident.

210
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
This is my first appearance.

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What are you going to do tomorrow?

212
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm going to throw a party.

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I have a party tomorrow.

214
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I want to attend my favorite party.

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I talk about this.

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The president of Yoshimoto will hold the party.

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I want to attend the party.

218
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If I don't attend, I'll be fired.

219
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's not good.

220
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I can't go because of that.

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We should go together.

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Where are you from?

224
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Eh? I'm from Nabe Pro.

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Nabe Pro.

226
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Ah, this is a rare combination, isn't it?

227
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yes.

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's a different product.

229
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Really, Yoshimoto...

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I've been saying this for a long time, but...

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm in the middle of a car delivery.

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Where does the gas bill come from?

233
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's the story.

234
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, yeah.

235
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Right?

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Normally, the manager would come pick you up in the morning, right?

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But that's not the case.

238
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He'd be like, why did you wake me up?

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He'd be on the phone.

240
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He'd be calling.

241
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He'd be on the phone, and I'd be on the phone.

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Right?

243
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And if there's something important, he'd be on the phone.

244
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He'd be like, what's important to you? I'm on the phone.

245
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Don't be on the phone.

246
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It'd take him about 100 minutes to hear that.

247
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's funny, isn't it?

248
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, yeah.

249
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I've been saying this for a long time, but...

250
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's funny, really.

251
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You shouldn't be saying that.

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What is it?

253
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
To the president.

254
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
To the president?

255
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah.

256
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Why is there no car?

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That's what I really think.

258
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Normally...

259
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's why...

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:54,580
Everyone in Yoshimoto

261
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Be debug and whine?

262
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Be debug and whine?

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Be debug and whine?

264
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's what I think.

265
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Be debug and whine?

266
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What do you mean?

267
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Are you sure we're talking about me?

268
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You should just tell him tomorrow.

269
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You hate that, right?

270
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
My glasses?

271
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
His glasses?

272
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I hate your glasses.

273
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm sitting in a corner, so tell me.

274
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
No, no, no. I've never really talked to her that much.

275
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And you've been friends with her for a while, right?

276
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You've been friends with her for a long time.

277
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I mean, we've been friends for a long time.

278
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You should go and tell her that you're in a good mood tomorrow.

279
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You should hit her head and say that you're in a good mood.

280
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You're making me cry.

281
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You're in a good mood. You're definitely in a good mood.

282
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I've grown up, so I don't really...

283
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If you don't say something like that, you're really a nuisance.

284
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No, she's been like that for a long time.

285
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
She has a lot of strength.

286
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's right, that old man.

287
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Shinsuke-san told me to go and hit her head and tell her that I'm in a good mood.

288
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's right. I don't want to do that.

289
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll go and tell her.

290
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
My back hurts, too.

291
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san, who always says that he doesn't have a castle.

292
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes, yes.

293
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
When an old lady uses a toothpick, she hides her mouth with her hand.

294
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I think there's a reason to hide it.

295
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What's going on in your hidden hand?

296
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm taking a toothpick.

297
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If you're taking a toothpick, you don't have to hide it.

298
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's already a spoiler.

299
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's a spoiler, but you can't see it when you take it.

300
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If that's the case, you can only do this when you get it.

301
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You don't have to do that.

302
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't care if you see it at this point.

303
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
When you think you've got it, you can do this.

304
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Or you can do this.

305
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The reason I'm doing this is because I'm doing more than I thought.

306
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What's going on?

307
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Well, that's it.

308
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm going to tell you that now.

309
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh, please.

310
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There's no need to rush.

311
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
There's plenty of time.

312
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But it's not just old ladies.

313
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What?

314
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There are men who do this.

315
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Men do this, too.

316
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I've never seen a man do this.

317
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Do you do it?

318
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't.

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You don't, do you?

320
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Then it's not right.

321
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's enough.

322
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's about time.

323
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What?

324
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Tell me what's going on.

325
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Do you want to hear it?

326
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's right.

327
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll tell you if I really want to hear it.

328
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I really want to hear it.

329
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What is it?

330
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What is it?

331
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Why are you trying to go to the next page?

332
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Do you think I don't have anything?

333
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No, it's just a spare.

334
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Are you stupid?

335
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Don't try to go to the next page even though you know it.

336
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's right.

337
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You shouldn't do that.

338
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm going to tell you now.

339
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh, really?

340
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Of course.

341
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Your acting is strange.

342
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's not strange at all.

343
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I've been saying it all the time.

344
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Why are you hiding it with your hands?

345
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Look at this sweat.

346
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You know I don't have anything yet, right?

347
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
No.

348
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You should have noticed.

349
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I thought so.

350
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Is this the sweat of the next page?

351
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What is it?

352
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Cold sweat.

353
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Cold sweat.

354
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Say it with both hands.

355
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Cold sweat.

356
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Cold sweat.

357
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I thought so.

358
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That's why you tried to go to the next page, didn't you?

359
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, I see.

360
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Right?

361
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You went to the next page.

362
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh, I see.

363
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You went to the next page, didn't you?

364
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And then...

365
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Oh, that's right.

366
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's the same as before.

367
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I understand that.

368
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I understand your love.

369
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But think about it.

370
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
There are only three people in Downtown.

371
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You don't even know the next page.

372
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't think about the next page.

373
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If there's a story here, I'll think about the next page.

374
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't say that.

375
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'll think about it all the time.

376
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You're a fool.

377
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If you say that, I won't be able to move on.

378
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's why I said I'd go first.

379
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You're still going to come back.

380
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I should come back, right?

381
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
No, I'm angry that I lost.

382
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Come on, come on.

383
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'll definitely do it.

384
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yes, yes, yes.

385
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Come back.

386
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Mr. Matsumoto seems to know all the titles of the same word.

387
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh, I know.

388
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Please guess all the titles of the same word that I'm going to give you now.

389
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh, it's easy.

390
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Why are the crows crying?

391
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The crows are in the mountains.

392
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
This is why.

393
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
If you say it in detail, why...

394
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No, I don't need that.

395
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
If you say it like that.

396
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Why?

397
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's a joke.

398
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's true.

399
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
No.

400
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's true.

401
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I asked you why.

402
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
To whom?

403
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
To the teacher, the kindergarten teacher.

404
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Why?

405
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll go forever.

406
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Forever?

407
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm a child of seven.

408
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh, that's wrong.

409
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Which one is right?

410
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That's strange.

411
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You should look it up.

412
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If you're wrong, you can do anything.

413
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Look it up.

414
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You can't do anything.

415
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Look it up.

416
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Well, I can do a little bit.

417
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Let's go to the next one.

418
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The crows are in the mountains.

419
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
How do you say this?

420
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
My lover.

421
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Forever.

422
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
In detail.

423
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
This is my hometown.

424
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You're wrong.

425
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Look it up.

426
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You're a child of seven.

427
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
This is your hometown.

428
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What do you know about the staff here?

429
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Show me the evidence.

430
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Show me the evidence.

431
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Line up all the writers here.

432
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Line up all the writers here.

433
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Did you look it up?

434
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
How is it?

435
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What's going on there?

436
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I didn't look it up.

437
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What?

438
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Who looked it up?

439
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Who looked it up?

440
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The director must have looked it up.

441
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Get the director.

442
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Get the director.

443
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Line up all the writers here.

444
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Is this okay?

445
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm not like you guys.

446
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm not like you guys.

447
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You're wrong.

448
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Why are the crows crying?

449
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The crows are in the mountains.

450
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You're a child of seven.

451
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
This is your hometown.

452
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What are you wearing?

453
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What do you want to eat?

454
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What are you eating while you're working?

455
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The crows are in the mountains.

456
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This is your hometown.

457
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Where is your hometown?

458
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This is my hometown.

459
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Why are you saying that?

460
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Your head is getting thinner.

461
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
There is a song called Sumida River.

462
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
This is the last one.

463
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is the last one.

464
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Please tell us the title of this song.

465
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It hasn't come out yet.

466
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What will you do after this?

467
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Climbing up and down.

468
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The people of the sea.

469
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The people of the sea?

470
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The people of the sea?

471
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The people of the village?

472
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
The people of the sea.

473
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The people of the sea?

474
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Which way?

475
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Which way?

476
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
There are a lot of adults here.

477
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
There are a lot of adults here.

478
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Sit down.

479
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The autumn breeze.

480
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's true.

481
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's true.

482
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Climbing up and down.

483
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It comes back again.

484
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The people of the sea.

485
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The people of the sea?

486
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The title is the people of the sea.

487
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What is the title of this song?

488
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Flower.

489
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Flower.

490
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Flower.

491
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Why are you saying that?

492
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What is it?

493
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
At the beginning of the program, I gained a lot of weight.

494
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Idiot.

495
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
At the end, look.

496
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What's going on?

497
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
What's going on in your left hand?

498
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Everyone, listen carefully.

499
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You do that a lot at restaurants.

500
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You think everyone does it in front of people, right?

501
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That's not it.

502
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
How much did you eat today?

503
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
After this, you have to go to the toilet.

504
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's what you're calculating here.

505
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I think I did a good job.

506
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
In this situation.

507
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Yes, yes.

508
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Don't make me hate the details.

509
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The same thing will happen next week.

510
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'll bring the book.

511
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
That's right.

512
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
No, wait a minute. It doesn't matter who's right about that.

513
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What?

514
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What?

515
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You're the only one who's wrong.

516
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
If I'm wrong, it's a mistake.

517
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So what?

518
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You don't have to say anything.

519
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Say sorry.

520
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I was wrong.

521
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You're so arrogant.

522
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What?

523
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What do you mean by sorry?

524
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
In fact, you're like a doctor to me.

525
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
To be honest.

526
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm really stressed out.

527
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I've been attacked by so many adults.

528
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I don't remember exactly, but I think that's the title.

529
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's okay. You can tell me here.

530
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Why did you think this would happen?

531
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Right?

533
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's why you chose that title, right?

534
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm sorry.

535
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
An emergency announcement!

536
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
In the party in Yoshimoto, downtown is having a gala negotiation!

537
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Downtown Stemino gala negotiation is going on!

538
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Give me this.

539
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm going to go to the president right now.

540
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Let's have a gala negotiation.

541
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
These are the two from downtown.

542
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Where is the president?

543
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
The president is over there.

544
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
President! President!

545
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Ah, president. Thank you.

546
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You're making a difficult face.

547
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
This is the worst calendar I've ever seen.

548
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
No, it's not like that.

549
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Congratulations.

550
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Thank you.

551
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Are you okay?

552
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yes.

553
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I want to say something.

554
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Ah, ah, ah.

555
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
We're not going to talk about gala today.

556
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
If we don't talk about gala, I won't be able to talk at all.

557
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But today, I was caught by the traffic light.

558
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The fine is 9,000 yen.

559
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I don't know who's going to pay for this.

560
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The company will.

561
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Really?

562
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Really!

563
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Really?

564
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I feel like I've been bitten.

565
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Really?

566
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I said I'd pay 9,000 yen.

567
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So I'm going to take the one that was cut off.

568
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'd like to hear the microphone of the two from downtown.

569
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
President, my brain injury was cut off.

570
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yes, I'm sorry about that, but please.

571
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
9,000 yen, please.

572
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's a promise.

573
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Ah, thank you.

574
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
1000 yen.

575
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
1000 yen for fishing?

576
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Are you fishing?

577
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I can't help it.

578
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Really?

579
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
9,000 yen.

580
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yes, 9,000 yen.

581
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Thank you very much.

582
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You kept your promise.

583
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
