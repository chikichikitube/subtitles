1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Watch it!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukaiya, Chiki Chiki Kotsukatsu Combat Fight!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today, we have a teacher with us.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Everyone's body...

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Who is it?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The one with the loudest voice wins?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yes, simply.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
How many points will the three of them get?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's see.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Today, Yamazaki-kun and...

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Captain.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Captain, look.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hokurou is holding his neck like this.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I see.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hokurou's fortune-teller is a leader.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hokurou is said to be like that.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now, let's introduce Mr. Sasugawa.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is Captain Hokurou!

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Captain Hokurou is...

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
He's cutting everyone's body.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And Captain Arato is...

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He's a judge.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He's a judge now!

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I see.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You're making a duo from a good place.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Don't say that.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Just by touching him, you can tell that he's not in good shape.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Just by looking at him.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Just by looking at him?

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
By the way, what's the difference between you and me?

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What's the difference?

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Your head.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll go first.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You'll go first?

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's see how it goes.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Let's start with the neck.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's good for people with stiff shoulders.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's start with the neck.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
First, there are two on the right.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There are two?

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes, there are two.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is one point.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
One point?

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
One point on the left.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There are three points on the neck.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There are three points on the neck?

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes, there are three points on the neck.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Next, let's move on to the waist.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Good luck hitting me.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't know how to do it.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There's one.

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
There are three points on the neck and one point on the waist.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There are four points on the waist here.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Now ten point for Yamazaki-san.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There are three points on the left and right.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
There are three points on the left and right.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There are three points on the left and right.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There are three points on the left and right.

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Are there three now?

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yes.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That means there are four more points on the left and right.

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Really?

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
olicemment.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
K Sar muscles are a bit funny.

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There are three points on the neck and the right.

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hamada's ears are weird, and I have a weird head.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You're a great kid.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You've got 8 points.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
8 points?

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's easy to get on.

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Here I go.

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Well, it's one.

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
One ear.

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Get used to it!

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You're a plain guy.

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You're a plain guy.

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Get used to it! Get used to it!

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're a plain guy.

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're a plain guy.

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll go next.

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm going to go next.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm going to go next.

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You're a plain guy.

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're a plain guy.

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You're a plain guy.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hey, wait, you're the best in spring.

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're a plain guy.

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Three.

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Three?

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Three?

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Three?

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm scared.

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Three!

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Six, right?

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Six?

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah, six.

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But it feels good.

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's right.

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Two.

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Two?

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm going to cry.

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Come on.

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Your eyes are bad?

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's 3 now.

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's 3 now.

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's 3.

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's pocky pocky pocky.

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think there's something wrong with it.

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm not mistaken.

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's 1 now.

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's pocky pocky pocky.

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's 1 now.

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's 1 now.

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't give up.

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's 4 now.

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Can I take it?

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No, it's 4 now.

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's 4 now.

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
8 points, now.

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Please.

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is the pocky one, isn't it?

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The pocky one that takes leadership.

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, it's a wet tissue.

128
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh, hello, hello.

129
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, there's a lot of information.

130
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What kind of information?

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
There's a rumor that today's guest is quite heavy.

132
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, is that so?

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes, that's right.

134
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No, but everyone is doing well.

135
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What do you mean by doing well?

136
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, normally, you know, it's not like this.

137
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I think it's lame.

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No, there's something on it.

139
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Here, here, here.

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What's on it?

141
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh, I got it, I got it.

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh, it's coming off.

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Something's shining.

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What's that?

145
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What is it?

146
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Something.

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What?

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I ate a bento, chewed gum, ate chocolate.

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're a kid.

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You can only eat sweets.

151
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's crispy and delicious.

152
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Well, today, too.

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm ignoring my work.

154
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Are you ignoring your work?

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm just doing my job.

156
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's no good.

157
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
After all, these people are on a regular break.

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm taking a break.

159
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah.

160
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, it's been about two days now, right?

161
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's why you have a salary.

162
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Why do you have a salary?

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't underestimate me.

164
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Your salary is about the same as ours.

165
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Really?

166
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll quit if I do that.

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What do you mean, you'll quit?

168
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's easier for me to do that.

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What do you mean, you'll quit?

170
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What?

171
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Can I do it with the same salary as you?

172
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's a talent.

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What are you talking about?

174
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's no good.

175
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
No, it's not.

176
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
If you take a break for two days and do it at the same time, it's not a bad thing.

177
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:10,000
In other words, if these people work without a break for a month and do it at the same time, they'll be satisfied.

178
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's a little tough.

179
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're really...

180
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Wait a minute.

181
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If you kill him, it's early in the morning, but if it's in the evening, it'll be over at five or six.

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's over.

183
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You said you'd be done at ten o'clock today.

184
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll try it when it's over.

185
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Well, it's too late.

186
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's too late.

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You said you'd be done at ten o'clock, but it'll be over at twelve o'clock.

188
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's right.

189
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's early in the morning and late at night.

190
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Stop it.

191
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't think you can decide the time.

192
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If you do that, it's over in the morning.

193
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What are you talking about?

194
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What are you talking about?

195
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What are you talking about?

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
In that sense, isn't it good?

197
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's why it's over in the morning and late at night.

198
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's all.

199
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's right.

200
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What are you talking about?

201
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Right now, about 30 salaried men are making about 200,000 to 500,000 yen.

202
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
How many times do you want that?

203
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm not talking about that.

204
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What do you mean, how many times?

205
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Don't give up.

206
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You're really...

207
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You have a wicked heart.

208
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Stop it.

209
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Wait.

210
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're a rich man of money.

211
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Wait.

212
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You're dirty.

213
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What are you talking about?

214
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't need any money.

215
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I just want you to laugh at me like this.

216
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What are you talking about?

217
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're a manager at the scene.

218
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
How many hours have you been doing this?

219
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're a rich man of money.

220
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If the boss of the company comes out, it's okay.

221
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't care.

222
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I don't care.

223
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What's that?

224
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
As I always say, basically, I talk in front of everyone like this.

225
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Everyone is laughing.

226
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's all.

227
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I really don't need anything if I have a bowl of rice and a warm futon.

228
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You don't need a warm futon.

229
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's why I don't need a lot of money.

230
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I get too much from celebrities.

231
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You don't get too much.

232
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The number one is Yoshiko Mita.

233
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
She's amazing.

234
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What are you talking about?

235
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
How much did she earn last week?

236
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Right?

237
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't get me wrong.

238
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yoshiko Mita doesn't earn that much.

239
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:02,000
She doesn't earn that much.

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I was just singing.

241
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Do you know Yoshiko Mita?

242
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I know her.

243
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yoshiko Mita, the actress.

244
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
How much does she earn?

245
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
She earns a lot every year.

246
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That's right.

247
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
She doesn't have a lot of money.

248
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
No, no, no.

249
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yoshiko Mita doesn't have a lot of money either.

250
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That's true.

251
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Celebrities earn too much.

252
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Is that so?

253
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's true.

254
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm really on the side of the people.

255
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll be running for president soon.

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I want to rebuild Japan.

257
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Is that so?

258
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's right.

259
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Where do you want to go?

260
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What?

261
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What did you say?

262
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Where do you want to go?

263
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let's go to Tokyo.

264
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why don't you run for president?

265
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You're still from the Hyogo family.

266
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's right.

267
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You can ride a car here.

268
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't have a lot of money.

269
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What do you mean?

270
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What are you doing?

271
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The microphone is a jumper and the noise is running.

272
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What?

273
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The microphone is a jumper and the noise is running.

274
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Come up here.

275
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What?

276
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The microphone is a jumper and the noise is running.

277
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Where did you get that voice from?

278
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You should talk more like a man.

279
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Don't think I'm an idiot.

280
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You're going to New York, aren't you?

281
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm kidding.

282
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
No, listen to me.

283
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm not going to New York.

284
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Wait a minute.

285
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm going to New York to play dunk.

286
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You're so cool.

287
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What are you talking about?

288
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What?

289
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You're just saying that I can't go because I'm selfish.

290
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
No, no, no.

291
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm not going to the show.

292
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Next time, I'll ask my ex-wife.

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Where is your ex-wife?

294
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There's a show called If You Meet in Dreams.

295
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm going to see Nozawa Naoko.

296
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Nozawa is in New York, so we're going to New York to find Nozawa.

297
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're going to New York, aren't you?

298
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Except you.

299
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm not going to New York.

300
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm going to see Nozawa.

301
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What are you talking about?

302
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What do you think?

303
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Wait a minute.

304
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I already have a dream of becoming a candidate.

305
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Wait a minute.

306
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm scared when you say that.

307
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll tell you this.

308
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm a really bad guy.

309
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You're a bad guy.

310
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What color is my blood?

311
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's green, isn't it?

312
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That's enough.

313
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I hate foreign countries.

314
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Why?

315
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I want to ask you the other way around.

316
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Why do you want to go abroad?

317
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm not going to Chibara.

318
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm not going to do anything.

319
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm just going to have fun.

320
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And I'm going to New York.

321
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't like that.

322
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm going to ask you what you think.

323
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Golden's two-hour show.

324
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Where's Nozawa?

325
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's not funny.

326
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
No.

327
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Who are you talking about?

328
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Who are you talking about?

329
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

330
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm going to stay with everyone.

331
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm going to have fun with everyone.

332
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I said I'd have fun shooting a skit.

333
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Don't you think you're more forward?

334
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I want to see you.

335
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm not going to run away.

336
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I want to see you.

337
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

338
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I can't do it.

339
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's cold.

340
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Listen to me.

341
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What are you talking about?

342
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
U-chan, Nan-chan, and Mitsu-chan are not like that.

343
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And you are not like that either.

344
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
There is something wrong with your feet.

345
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What are you talking about?

346
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Who are you?

347
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You forgot to laugh in the main text.

348
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So?

349
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Are you not laughing now?

350
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Are you the manager of Fujiyama?

351
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No, I'm not.

352
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There is something wrong with that.

353
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Is that so?

354
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yes, there is something wrong with that.

355
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Everyone is saying yes.

356
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Don't look at me like that.

357
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You are like a fool.

358
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Thank you.

359
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Idols are becoming more and more.

360
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
T-Bucks and Girigiri...

361
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
This is T-Bucks, right?

362
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Girigiri Girls are becoming more and more.

363
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What will happen to them from now on?

364
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
This is a serious story.

365
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
They are becoming more and more.

366
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
At this rate?

367
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
At this rate.

368
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
That means...

369
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
They have come to a more terrible place.

370
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
They look like skulls.

371
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
They look like skulls.

372
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Take them to the doctor.

373
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
No, no, no.

374
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
They look like skulls.

375
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What is more terrible than that?

376
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I think it's a terrible thing.

377
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Is that a true story?

378
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
There are no other stores.

379
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Anyway, they are in magazines.

380
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
They are in a good place.

381
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Will they be released?

382
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Probably.

383
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Will there be no more broadcasting code?

384
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Broadcasting code will be improved gradually.

385
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It will be easier to do the next show.

386
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
In that sense.

387
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But they are becoming more and more.

388
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It will be natural.

389
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That's right.

390
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
In a group of five...

391
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Marudachi...

392
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let's do it.

393
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It will be natural in that era.

394
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What about the lyrics?

395
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It doesn't matter about the lyrics.

396
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Like Biro Biro Girls?

397
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yes, yes.

398
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's Biro.

399
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
There are flowers everywhere.

400
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Wow, that's amazing.

401
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's a combination of men and women.

402
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
If there is no dance...

403
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm sorry.

404
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Everyone knows the worst use.

405
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Queen.

406
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm sorry.

407
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Mr. Sazae went to school.

408
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But he was called to the principal's office.

409
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
He was expelled.

410
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Why?

411
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's time to make money.

412
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Let's go.

413
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm wearing a turban.

414
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What are you doing?

415
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Are you riding a horse?

416
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Don't ride a horse.

417
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Let's start with By Happy Hoppy.

418
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Are you a star?

419
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's strange to hear that.

420
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Tell me five things for a star.

421
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Are you asking me to tell you?

422
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Are there five things?

423
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't think so.

424
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
There is a saying that if you eat a lot of food, you can't sell it.

425
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
That's right.

426
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
When I went to eat Okonomiyaki with him, he ate a lot of food.

427
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't know his name, but he can't sell it.

428
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
When I went to eat Okonomiyaki with him, he ate a lot of food.

429
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm very jealous.

430
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I've already finished eating, but my partner's mother changed twice.

431
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's why I'm jealous.

432
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm still doing this in Osaka, but I can't sell it.

433
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I have an idea.

434
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
If you don't eat a lot of food, you can't sell it.

435
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That's what I think.

436
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That's the current situation.

437
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's fast.

438
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's an hour ago.

439
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
There is a saying that time is the most important thing in this world.

440
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
There is a saying that human relationships are important.

441
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's a lie.

442
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's not true.

443
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's not true.

444
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why?

445
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I can't keep time.

446
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
There is a limit.

447
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes, there is a limit.

448
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
No, no, no.

449
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm talking to you.

450
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm talking to you.

451
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Why?

452
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I don't care if you're late.

453
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't care if you're late.

454
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Right?

455
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Right?

456
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Hey, customer.

457
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
There is a limit.

458
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
There is a limit.

459
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm sorry.

460
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's true.

461
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's true.

462
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That's how it feels.

463
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
There is a special edition.

464
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
April 1st, Thursday.

465
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
2 hours from 7 to 9.

466
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Downtown Otoko Mae Yana 4.

467
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's a punishment game.

468
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Akko-chan is still angry.

469
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's a punishment game.

470
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It can't be helped. That man lost.

471
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
He lost.

472
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm sure those who saw Akko lose will understand.

473
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's a punishment game.

474
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
He lost the game.

475
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
After that, he got angry.

476
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
He said,

477
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Remember Masumoto in front of the camera.

478
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
No, you lost the game on your own.

479
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Even if it's my fault.

480
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
He's a scary man.

481
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
He is.

482
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You're really funny.

483
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm angry, too.

484
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
He is angry.

485
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Don't look at me.

486
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's okay.

487
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm angry.

488
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Don't look at me anymore.

489
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Go away.

490
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Hey.

491
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What is it?

492
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Thank you.

493
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You...
