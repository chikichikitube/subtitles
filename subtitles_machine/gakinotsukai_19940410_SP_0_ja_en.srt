1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good evening

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's so cold

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's downtown's special

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Thank you for coming

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Can you see the view?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Where are we?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm in front of JR Amagasaki station

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's open

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes it is

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We are in New York

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We are here to do something

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
They are going to give us a delicious tonkatsu

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's go

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Sakamoto Ryuichi is going to write a song for us

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We are going to do a live

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's our debut

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's not downtown

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Geisha girls

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm Ken from Geisha girls

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
New York recording and live

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Sakamoto Ryuichi is a huge fan of Gaki no Tsukai

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And Matsumoto

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He is going to write a song for Sakamoto

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He is aiming for a big hit in America

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Sakamoto Ryuichi Produce

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Geisha girls

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We went to the office where Sakamoto lives

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We received a fax

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sakamoto is currently working on an album

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But if they are going to come to New York, it's OK

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Sakamoto has a lot of work to do

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Will he have time to write a song?

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Are you really going?

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Is the song ready?

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't know

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't know if I'm a producer

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is the last

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Matsumoto who hates overseas gave up

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
By the way, the office in New York

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Sakamoto is working hard on his album

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Is he thinking about downtown?

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And finally they go to New York

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
12 hours to New York

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Are they tired?

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And downtown is in New York

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Are you waiting for Ryuichi?

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm going to the studio

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
They are going to the studio

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's still midnight in Tokyo

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We are going to the studio

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's check in, eat and sleep

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No no

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is Broadway, the city where Sakamoto lives

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You are cute

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't know how to continue

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm scared

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What is this?

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Everyone is unhappy

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm not happy

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm in the middle

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There are so many people

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Are they lined up?

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Are they lined up to buy tickets?

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The first time in New York

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They look fresh

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This is the studio where Sakamoto lives

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Will they be able to meet for the first time in 4 months?

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Are they really here?

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
They are dressed up as ballerinas

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Are they really here?

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Is the song finished?

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Hello

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hello

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hello

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm here

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Are you tired?

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm a little tired

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The world's Sakamoto Ryuichi was there

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He opened the door of the techno pop era

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He was a world star

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He is also active in film music

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He won the Academy Award in 1988

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The world praised his talent

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He appeared in Madonna's promotion video

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He is a world-famous genius artist

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Can I do it here?

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Do you always do this?

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's a famous studio used by Whitney Houston and Madonna

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm a disciple of Sakamoto

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The staff that Sakamoto collected

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He is the member of D-LITE

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I will make it with these members

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm making it

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Shall we listen to it?

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The song he was worried about was already finished

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The song was almost finished

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The song showed a perfect finish

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I understand the high school students

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You are lying

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You were lying on your neck

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It would be better to release this song

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What should I say?

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It was 4 seconds

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What should I do with this?

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's talk about it

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
One more song

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He really made it

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Sakamoto made another song for Downtown

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Downtown

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Downtown's high quality and serious expression

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's like a word

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I came here to see you

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You came to see me

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You said you would make a song

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I said it easily

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Finally, the recording meeting will be held

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's like a comedy

119
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's a comedy

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The idea of Sakamoto is to put a comedy in the intro

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Downtown will be a comedy for the first time in a few years

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I see

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There are a lot of scary things these days

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What are you talking about?

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
There are a lot of scary things in the news

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's not a comedy

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's a comedy

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's not funny

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If you put 5 million yen in a green bag and put it in a yellow bag and put it in a red bag, I'll put it in a black bag

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you understand?

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Forever

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's really hard

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's the first time I've done it with this kind of tension

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I worked as a professional

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's really hard

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's the first time I've talked with this kind of tension

137
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Take me with you

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Finally, check the recorded sound

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't care

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Hello

141
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Hello

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Hello

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Hello

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hello

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It has nothing to do with the music of this band

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Cool

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It was good at the end

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Cool

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I was waiting

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Cool

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I want to be more emotional

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I want to be more emotional

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll be more emotional

154
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I think it's a story where two people go up and down and two people go up and down

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
No way

156
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll be more emotional

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll be more emotional

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Two people go up and down

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
One time to cooperate with the best of the first song

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I can't even dream of doing a normal comedy in a place like this

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Come to New York

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And then a short break

163
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Hamada is tired after a long journey.

164
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
On the other hand, Matsumoto is...

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
In the meantime, Sakamoto is having a second meeting.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Downtown is...

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I wish I could say something more.

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm back.

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's okay.

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Well, there was something.

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's okay.

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm completely scared.

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Is that so?

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I can do it right away.

175
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
My legs...

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I stepped on my legs.

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm so sorry.

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's all I wanted to say.

179
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The second recording begins.

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
First of all, the chorus of the chorus.

181
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I got it.

182
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Let's listen to it.

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And this person also came to the studio.

184
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What are you talking about?

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's true.

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's hard now.

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We're talking to each other.

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We're talking to each other.

189
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I came to see you.

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I came to see you.

191
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I came to see you.

192
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I came to see you.

193
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The lyrics were written by Sakamoto.

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It took them two hours to write it.

195
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Osaka style rap.

196
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Osaka style rap.

197
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You're talented, aren't you?

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's perfect.

199
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I want to do more.

200
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The lyrics were written by Sakamoto.

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000

Tomorrow is the day of the debut live.

You did a great job.

205
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Osaka style rap.

206
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I have to do it again tomorrow.

207
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The lyrics are too weak.

208
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It took them two hours to write it.

209
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Sakamoto is divided into two.

210
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It took them two hours to write it.

211
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000

213
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The moment of the debut live is approaching.

214
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The last night of singing and talking.

215
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Downtown Binassho.

216
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This project is very popular with the use of children.

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Various activities are held to attract the audience.

218
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000

Good evening, everyone.

240
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000

Thank you very much for coming today.

248
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Downtown Special Binassho is a dinner show.

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's a little different from usual, so I'm sure everyone is surprised.

251
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Please listen to the first song.

It feels good.

258
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But let's look back 13 years ago.

259
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That's right.

260
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
About 13 years ago, we entered Yoshimoto in April 1957.

261
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
There were many songs.

262
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I understand.

263
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm going to eat a lot, so I'm going to eat a lot.

264
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Everyone is saying this, so let's go to the second song.

265
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's right.

266
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Please listen to the miso soup song.

267

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Shama Kenjiro's No. 3, Streper!

271
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Thank you very much.

272
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There's steam coming out of the fish.

273
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Today, we have a special guest for the 30th time.

274
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
We're the only ones who don't have a heart.

275
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Today is a special guest.

276
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Let's have this person appear.

277
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's Hino Mikasa.

278
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Please let me go home a little more.

279
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I won't go home tonight.

280
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't want to go home.

281
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Who's waiting in that room?

282
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's right.

283
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
No one's here right now.

284
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's winter rain outside.

285
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's a night to wet my heart.

286
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's a night to wet my heart.

287
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's winter rain outside.

288
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I won't go home tonight.

289
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't want to go home.

290
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I won't go home tonight.

291
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yoshi!

292
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yoshi!

293
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Don'tоб

294
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Don'tPlay

295
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Don't Play

296
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Shut up!

297
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's hot.

298
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Take it easy.

299
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It should be from now on.

300
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Take a look at the window.

301
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What is it?

302
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Listen," I am a talk show.

303
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I want to talk.

304
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Take a good look.

305
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
My throat hurts.

306
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I didn't expect everyone to be so happy.

307
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Thank you very much.

308
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's like a zoo.

309
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Our special guest is Ms. Hinomika.

310
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I have a new song called Onna Nihonkai.

311
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'd like to promote it.

312
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I really wanted to sing it, but I ended up like this.

313
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Thank you very much.

314
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Thank you very much.

315
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
When you're having fun, the next song is the last one.

316
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I want to hear more.

317
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'll sing it with my fans.

318
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Please come to the stage.

319
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I was impressed.

320
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The lyrics are very convincing.

321
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Please come to the center.

322
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's a sad song.

323
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Time has passed in an instant.

324
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Thank you very much.

325
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The last song is Inazuma.

326
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Let's hear it.

327
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You are the joy of the lightning.

328
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You broke my heart.

329
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's too late.

330
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You are the joy of the lightning.

331
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You are the joy of the lightning.

332
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll never forget the day we parted.

333
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'll never forget the day we parted.

334
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Fire!

335
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Fire!

336
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Thank you very much.

341
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I was deceived.

342
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I was deceived by this program.

343
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I heard it on a talk show.

344
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I got on the Shinkansen at 7 o'clock in the morning.

345
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I was deceived by this show.

346
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I heard it on a talk show.

347
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It's time to take a break.

348
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's time to take a break.

349
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's time to take a break.

350
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Chikichiki Oogiri Daigassen is famous for its use of children.

351
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
This program has created many legends.

352
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
This program is a special program.

353
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000

This program is a special program for children.

356
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Please welcome Mr. Hanashika.

357
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000

It's getting warmer these days.

364
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
How are you doing?

365
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm doing well.

366
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000

I'm Kanda Toshinori.

368
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I'm Kanda Toshinori.

369
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
This is the last one.

370
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
The back of today's program is Die Hard 2.

371
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That's right.

372
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's Die Hard 2.

373
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Die Hard 2 is interesting.

374
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Hey!

375
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'll come here again.

376
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
That's mine.

377
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Nice to meet you.

378
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The first topic is this.

379
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Read the Atakamo.

380
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Read the Atakamo.

381
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Are you ready?

382
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Read the Atakamo.

383
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
This is a book.

384
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I didn't write something like that.

385
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I don't know what it is.

386
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I want you to read the book as if you were writing the Atakamo.

387
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
That's it.

388
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
The first one is this.

389
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Ta-da!

390
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Mo-Takuto and the Cultural Revolution.

391
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Are you ready?

392
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Let's start with Kagi-chan.

393
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:45,000
On April 6, 1994, Mo-Takuto was smoking in Tiananmen Square in Beijing.

394
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
A guard came and said,

395
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You must have come from there.

396
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
The guard pointed at his finger.

397
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Mo-Takuto was surprised by the sound of his finger.

398
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
What are you talking about?

399
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I don't know what it is.

400
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Is that so?

401
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Edison was on Mo-Takuto's knee.

402
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Why are you talking about Edison?

403
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I was talking about 2039.

404
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It was a story that I couldn't see yet.

405
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I understand that very well.

406
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Mo-Takuto was a woman.

407
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
What?

408
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'll explain it in a way that's easy to understand.

409
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
There are 108 spellings to start a great revolution.

410
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I see.

411
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
That is...

412
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Yes.

413
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
What is a spell?

414
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
That's a great thing.

415
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That's right.

416
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
What is it?

417
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
What are the 108 spellings?

418
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
What is it?

419
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Shut up.

420
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You don't have to ask questions.

421
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
What are you going to do?

422
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What are you going to do?

423
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
What is going to happen with the 108 spellings?

425
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
That's right.

426
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
What is it?

427
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
What are you going to do?

428
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Let's play the headphones.

429
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm going to play the headphones.

430
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
There's a lot of music playing.

431
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I don't know what you're saying.

432
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Let's go.

433
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Here.

434
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
That's good.

435
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I'll say it.

436
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
California dance.

437
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
California dance.

438
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm scared.

439
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Let's love each other seriously.

440
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Do you understand?

441
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Let's go over here.

442
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Take this.

443
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
There was a hair on the sushi, right?

444
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Did the sushi have hair?

445
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Did the sushi have hair?

446
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Did the sushi have hair?

447
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Please give me the correct answer.

448
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Please give me the correct answer.

449
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Housuki.

450
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
The next question is...

451
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'm going to be a man.

452
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I'll explain the rules.

453
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:11,000
If you don't answer correctly, the man who is holding the macho man will come closer.

454
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Shimada.

455
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Yes.

456
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Come here.

457
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
What?

458
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Please answer correctly.

459
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's been a long time since I've been in the gym.

460
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Wait a minute.

461
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Wait a minute.

462
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Wait a minute.

463
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
What is it?

464
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
What is it?

465
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
This is hard.

466
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Don't laugh.

467
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
The gentle spring breeze gently envelops us.

468
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Today is a picnic with handmade bento.

469
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I have a feeling something good is going to happen.

470
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Matsumoto.

471
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Let's go on a picnic with everyone.

472
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm fine.

473
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's fun to go with these members.

474
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm fine.

475
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's a fun picnic with bento.

476
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Saito.

477
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Yes.

478
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Sato.

479
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Yes.

480
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Sato.

481
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yes.

482
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Sankon.

483
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Yes.

484
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Hideo.

485
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Yes.

486
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Takeo.

487
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Yes.

488
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Saori.

489
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Yes.

490
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Hiromi.

491
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yes.

492
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Kenji.

493
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yes.

494
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Matsuno.

495
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Arimi.

496
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Marianne.

497
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Yes.

498
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
He's laughing.

499
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Watanabe.

500
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Yes.

501
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Michael Tomioka.

502
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Michael.

503
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
He's not here yet.

504
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
He's not here yet.

505
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
He's not here yet.

506
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Michael is late.

507
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
What are you doing?

508
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Michael is going to gather at the site.

509
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Michael is staying for a while.

510
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
If he comes to the site.

511
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
We are going to get on the bus with Michael who is late.

512
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
There must be a child who is late.

513
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It's going to be fun.

514
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Shiori, who was given by Hama-chan, is excited.

515
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Finally, the bus departs from Nihon TV.

516
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I think Shiori is on the bus.

517
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yes.

518
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Please move over there.

519
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yes.

520
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm going to sing a picnic song.

521
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yes.

522
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Let's sing together.

523
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Yes.

524
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
One, two.

525
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Let's go over the hill.

526
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Let's blow a whistle.

527
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Cheer up.

528
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Look at the blue sky in the corner.

529
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Let's stick our fangs out.

530
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Hurry up.

531
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Yes.

532
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Let's sing together.

533
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Let's dance together.

534
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
La la la la la la la.

535
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Mr. Yagi.

536
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Idiot.

537
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
La la la la la la.

538
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Mr. Yagi.

539
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Idiot.

540
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
La la la la la la.

541
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
While singing a refreshing picnic song,

542
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
we will pass through Koharu Biyori's Jingu and Shibuya.

543
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Mr. Ben, who is always cheerful,

544
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
seems to want to leave today's wonderful moment in the video.

545
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm done.

546
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
What are you doing?

547
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
What am I supposed to do?

548
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Hello.

549
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And finally, the bus arrives at Kinuta Park.

550
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
My heart is beating fast.

551
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Oh.

552
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That bastard just came.

553
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
What are you doing?

554
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Stop saying that.

555
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I was thinking about what to catch last night.

556
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
This is the result.

557
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
There's nothing here.

558
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
We're all heading to the park.

559
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Everyone seems to be having fun.

560
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
This is our destination,

561
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Kinuta Park Family Park.

562
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It feels good to be surrounded by greenery.

563
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
We've just arrived.

564
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Yes.

565
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Let's take a picture of our free time.

566
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
We're going to enjoy this park.

567
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Please enjoy it.

568
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Let's have fun under the blue sky.

569
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Who are you?

570
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Who are you?

571
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Oh, it's you.

572
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And now, it's lunch time.

573
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
How will it turn out?

574
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I'll take a picture and open it,

575
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
but I won't say it's mine.

576
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I'll open it and see what's inside.

577
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And I'll tell you who it is.

578
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Wait a minute.

579
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's good.

580
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's cute.

581
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It's good.

582
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's cute.

583
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It's well-made.

584
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's well-made.

585
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It's well-made?

586
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Whose lunch is this?

587
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It's a girl's lunch.

588
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Yes.

589
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
What?

590
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Hiromi's handmade bento with a cooking license is colorful and skillful.

591
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It's cute.

592
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It's you.

593
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's cute.

594
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Is this different from mushroom rice?

595
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
That's right.

596
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Speaking of mushroom rice, it's Chi-chi.

597
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's so cute.

598
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It's cute.

599
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I like this kind of lunch.

600
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Do you like it?

601
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
This is mine.

602
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
What?

603
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
No way.

604
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
We don't like your bento.

605
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
This is good.

606
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Why?

607
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
You just need to warm it up, right?

608
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
It's definitely a girl's hand.

609
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's not.

610
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I'll warm it up.

611
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
This is what I cooked.

612
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It's not a big deal.

613
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That's right.

614
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It's not a big deal.

615
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Haba-chan's bento that Mach-chan said he liked unexpectedly.

616
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's a good combination.

617
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's amazing.

618
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I ate it.

619
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It's amazing.

620
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Is this Kenji?

621
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Yes.

622
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I woke up at 6 o'clock in the morning and made it by looking at the book.

623
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I made it by looking at the book.

624
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
This is amazing.

625
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I made it by myself.

626
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
This is amazing.

627
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Kenji's bento was worth waking up early.

628
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's a luxurious lunch box.

629
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
What is this?

630
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
What is this?

631
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
What is this?

632
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Who is this?

633
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:31,000
This is a lunch box with pickled plums, bonito flakes, and takuan.

634
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
This is what I saw.

635
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Do you know this?

636
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Who is this?

637
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
This is me.

638
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Ben's lunch box is the same as his head.

639
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I feel lonely.

640
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
This is a small lunch box.

641
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
This is a dessert.

642
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Is this a dessert?

643
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It's not.

644
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
This is a girl's lunch box, isn't it?

645
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
This is a girl's lunch box, isn't it?

646
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
This is a girl's lunch box, isn't it?

647
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Who is this?

648
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Who is this?

649
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
This is me.

650
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
The contents of this lunch box are all super.

651
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
This is a super lunch box.

652
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Takamatsu's lunch box is like a girl's lunch box.

653
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Hoshi and Tetsu are crying.

654
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Makiko's natto lunch box is like a girl's lunch box.

655
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Yacchan and Sato's lunch box is like a girl's lunch box.

656
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Saori's lunch box is like a sweet potato sandwich.

657
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Michael's lunch box is like a French bread sandwich.

658
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Marianne's lunch box is like a curry lunch box.

659
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Sankon's lunch box is like a Japanese lunch box.

660
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
What is this lunch box?

661
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Who is this?

662
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
This is a lunch box that I used to eat when I was in elementary school.

663
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
What is this?

664
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
What is this?

665
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Wait a minute.

666
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Why is there so much rice in this lunch box?

667
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
The last lunch box is a handmade lunch box of a cute girl.

668
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Everyone, let's eat.

669
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Let's eat.

670
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
This is a picnic that I was invited to in the spring.

671
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
The blue sky, green, and fresh air make me feel good.

672
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I will engrave your smile and today as a memorable page in my heart.

673
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Let's meet again.

674
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:54,000
HITOSHI MATSUMOTO continues to challenge various dangers. He has been in this world for 30 years and has always loved danger.

675
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
He is said to have heard the sound of the explosion when he was born.

676
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
He lives on the edge of death.

677
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I can do it.

678
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
His challenge increases the intensity of the voltage day by day.

679
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
No one can stop him anymore.

680
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
No!

681
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm glad I did it.

682
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm impressed.

683
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
He survived again.

684
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And tonight, the greatest danger is coming.

685
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
A total of 50 staff are preparing.

686
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
This may be the last time to see his face.

687
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
HITOSHI MATSUMOTO, the man of the sword, the greatest danger.

688
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
He challenges the intensity of the voltage.

689
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Do you know that electricity passes through the human body?

690
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:49,000
This woman passed 10,000 volts of electricity through her body and operated a 20th generation fan.

691
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
However, this time, MATSUMOTO will challenge 20,000 volts twice as much.

692
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Are you okay?

693
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Do I just turn on the power?

694
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Yes.

695
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I see.

696
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Good morning.

697
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
20,000 volts?

698
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
That's amazing.

699
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:40,000
To put it simply, electricity passes through the body and passes on to others.

700
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I did it once when I was in junior high school.

701
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
That's 10,000 volts, isn't it?

702
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
That's right.

703
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
10,000 volts?

704
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
10,000 volts?

705
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Take a look at this.

706
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Are you serious?

707
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
What should I do?

708
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Before we started shooting, you were one of us.

709
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But after we started shooting, we became stars.

710
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I don't think we should do this anymore.

711
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But let me do this.

712
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Actually,

713
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I wrote a letter to ITSU.

714
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It was a letter from my mother.

715
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,000
She told me that my son didn't study at all.

716
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,000
She sent me a letter about two months ago.

717
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I thought I'd give it a try.

718
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Let's do it.

719
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Let's do it.

720
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I'll hold the cord at both ends.

721
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
You have to plug in the outlet.

722
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I want my partner to do this.

723
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I want my partner to do this.

724
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Let's do it.

725
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
TO BE CONTINUED...

726
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Are you ready?

727
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I'll plug it in.

728
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It's spinning.

729
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Is it on?

730
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It's on TV.

731
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
It's spinning.

732
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
It's spinning.

733
00:44:44,000 --> 00:45:01,000
It's spinning.

734
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
TO BE CONTINUED...

735
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
TO BE CONTINUED...

736
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I did it, didn't I?

737
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I did it, didn't I?

738
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Look at this.

739
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
TO BE CONTINUED...

740
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
What should I do?

741
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
The adventurer, Hitoshi Matsumoto.

742
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Thank you for your inspiration.

743
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
What kind of challenge will he show us next?

744
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
What kind of challenge will he show us next?

745
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
A hot battle between a man and a woman.

746
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
A battle between Akko vs. Ume Miya vs. Jin Ginaki vs. Badminton.

747
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
This season has come again.

748
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
That's right.

749
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I'm glad you two are in the mood today.

750
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Today, we're going to have a battle with Badminton.

751
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I feel like we've done this before, but we haven't.

752
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
We've done table tennis before.

753
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
We haven't done Orthodox.

754
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
We haven't.

755
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I wonder what kind of match it will be.

756
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Let's call them in.

757
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
First, we have Ume Miya and Tatsuo.

758
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
They're in the mood today.

759
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
They're in the mood.

760
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It's already 3-1.

761
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Even if you lose today, it'll be easy.

762
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
If you win, it'll be great.

763
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

764
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Really?

765
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
But Tatsuo has a lot of muscles today.

766
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Muscles?

767
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Why?

768
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I wonder why he's so small.

769
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
This is...

770
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
The man!

771
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Why?

772
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I don't like men.

773
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Why not?

774
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
The first man is Akko, right?

775
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
That's right.

776
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
The first man is Akko.

777
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
The first man is Ume Miya.

778
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
The blue man is Akko.

779
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
What do you think of my muscles?

780
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
You're so mean!

781
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
You're so mean!

782
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Why?

783
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I'm worried about my muscles.

784
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I'm going to lift you up.

785
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Today, Badminton has 3 sets.

786
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
If you win 2 sets earlier, you win.

787
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
This time, you're not going to do it, are you?

788
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I'll go to the judge.

789
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Why do you have to go to the judge?

790
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Akko has a lot of muscles.

791
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Let's see who wins.

792
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Who do you think will win?

793
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
What do you think?

794
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Me and Akko.

795
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
It doesn't matter.

796
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Let's see who wins.

797
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It's an out.

798
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It's under the net.

799
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
This is an out.

800
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Please hit it.

801
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I know it's an out.

802
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
This is easy.

803
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It's an out.

804
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
It's an out.

805
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
You don't even know it's an out.

806
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
This is easy.

807
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It's an out.

808
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
It's strong.

809
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It's an out.

810
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
It's like a fairy tale.

811
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
He's laughing.

812
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I don't know.

813
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Akko wins the first set.

814
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I'm a fool.

815
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I can't see it.

816
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Akko is good.

817
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
He didn't touch it.

818
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
He didn't touch it.

819
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Which side are you on?

820
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
You're on the same side.

821
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
You're on the same side.

822
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Go away.

823
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
He hit it.

824
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
He's serious.

825
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
It's in.

826
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
It's in.

827
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Akko wins.

828
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It's over.

829
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
It's over.

830
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Why?

831
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
He's like a high school student and a donkey.

832
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
It's impossible.

833
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
It's impossible.

834
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I don't know.

835
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
He hit it before the punishment game.

836
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
He's serious.

837
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
He's serious.

838
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
You're on the same side.

839
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Which side are you on?

840
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
We're on the same side.

841
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
You're a judge.

842
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
You're like a child.

843
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
He's on the same side.

844
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
He's like a producer.

845
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
He always does this.

846
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Why does he always do this?

847
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I want to hit him more.

848
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
What's wrong?

849
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Idiot.

850
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
You don't know the rules.

851
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
What's wrong?

852
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
He hit too hard.

853
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
It's fair.

854
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
What's wrong?

855
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
What didn't you like?

856
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I'm upset that I lost.

857
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Idiot.

858
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I'm sorry.

859
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
His way of doing it...

860
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
It's crazy.

861
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I'm sorry.

862
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I didn't do it well.

863
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
You didn't do it well?

864
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Or was he angry?

865
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Why were you angry?

866
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
He's being fooled.

867
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
He's using his power.

868
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
You know that kind of guy, right?

869
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm sorry.

870
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
It's not like that.

871
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
He was bad at the beginning.

872
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I wanted to hit him more.

873
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Sometimes he gets angry because of acting.

874
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I thought he was acting at first.

875
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
He was laughing when I hit him.

876
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
When I hit him, his face was like this.

877
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I hit him too.

878
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Sato.

879
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Yes.

880
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I was surprised.

881
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I was surprised.

882
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I was surprised.

883
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
This is funny.

884
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I was surprised.

885
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I was surprised.

886
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
You're a professional.

887
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Why were you angry?

888
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I was scared.

889
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I was scared.

890
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I knew it.

891
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I knew it.

892
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
That's why I was surprised.

893
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
You're the only one I don't know.

894
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
What?

895
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I was in a bad mood.

896
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I was in a bad mood.

897
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I was in a bad mood.

898
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
That's good.

899
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
It was a great success.

900
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Thank you very much.

901
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000

It's dangerous!

917
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Let's go to the next one.

You're not doing it right.

Soya, you do it.

966

This is normal.

967
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
It's not normal.

968
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It's not normal.

969
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
You're laughing at me.

970

This distance is the most disgusting.

Grandpa Hanasaka.

996
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000

998
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000

You knew the title.

1008
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
You remembered now?

1009
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
You are slightly safe, right?

1010
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Yes, Kanda-kun.

1011
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Aite, it's about growing up.

1012
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
It was a long time ago.

1013
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
That one.

1014
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
That one.

1015
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Is that a story from last month?

1016
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
No, it isn't.

1017
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
If you do it like that, you'll be in trouble.

1018
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Don't lie to me.

1019
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
That's what he said.

1020
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
It's true.

1021
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
It's true.

1022
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
It's true.

1023
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000

01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Hurry up and get out of here.

1031
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:51,000
This guy is very soft.

1032
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
The day of the debut live after a stormy recording.

1033
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:12,000
If you run away with a ball, I'll chase you.

1034
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Are you on it?

1035
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
It is said that the live ad is on that village voice.

1036
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
It's hard.

1037
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Ryuichi Sakamoto.

1038
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:35,000
The photo of Ryuichi Sakamoto is smaller.

1039
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Gen-sha Girls.

1040
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Why is that?

1041
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I'm a man.

1042
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
What is the reaction of the rappers?

1043
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Shut up.

1044
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Shut up.

1045
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000

Shut up.

1049
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Shut up.

1050
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Shut up.

1051
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Why are you laughing?

1052
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
At that time, preparations were made at the venue.

1053
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
This is a famous store at the forefront of the New York scene.

1054
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

1055
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I'm a man.

1056
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I'm a man, but I don't care about the couple there.

1057
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Three hours before the show, the line up had already begun.

1058
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I've never seen it before.

1059
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I will go with this.

1060
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
At the venue, Sakamoto prepared the Royal Remission.

1061
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Really?

1062
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I don't know what's going to happen.

1063
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
It's not something that can be done with effort.

1064
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I'm nervous.

1065
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
The two are nervous about their first overseas live.

1066
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:08,000
They finally arrive at the venue.

1067
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
This way.

1068
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
This way.

1069
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
You've got a boy with a UPS.

1070
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
The debut live stage performance was produced by Sakamoto Ryuichi.

1071
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:31,000
The U.S. hitmaker, Tomie, also participated in the live performance.

1072
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:36,000
The dance demonstration was held to refer to the two's stage performances.

1073
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I think he's got an A.

1074
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I think he's got an A.

1075
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
One hour before the show, the final rehearsal.

1076
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Sakamoto's strict instructions also fly.

1077
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Finally, there are 400 people in the audience.

1078
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:41,000
How will the two's stages be received in New York, the first city of all cultures?

1079
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:54,000
The audience is cheering.

1080
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,000
But there's a lot of scary things in the world.

1081
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
There are a lot of scary things in the world.

1082
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Tell me what's scary.

1083
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I'm not afraid of anything, especially the kidnappers.

1084
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I'm not afraid of anything, especially the kidnappers.

1085
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Hello.

1086
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000

1088
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
5 million?

1089
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Is it expensive?

1090
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
No, it's 5 million.

1091
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Is it expensive?

1092
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
It's 5 million.

1093
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Are you going to lose?

1094
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

1095
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Bring me 5 million.

1096
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000

White hair on the back side, yellow hair on the green side.

1098
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I'll play it one more time.

1099
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,000
White hair on the back side, yellow hair on the red side.

1100
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I'm going to jump.

1101
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
White hair on the back side, yellow hair on the green side.

1102
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
The black one is coming!

1103
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Nice!

1104
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000

The old lady is going!

1106
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
The old lady is going!

1107
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Not yet!

1108
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
The old lady is going!

01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
The old lady is going!

1110
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000

The old lady is going!

1114
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Good evening!

1115
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Let me introduce the members.

1116
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
