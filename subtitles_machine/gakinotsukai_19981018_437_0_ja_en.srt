1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm going to put this flag up so you can see it.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today, I came all the way here to take off my jacket.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Today, I came all the way here to take off my jacket.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We're here!

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, the weather isn't too bad, but...

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's a bit cloudy.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's go!

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's go!

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If you close the trunk, you'll have to open it again.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That was 5 months ago.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hamada played a 4-on-1 handicap golf match with Matsumoto, Yamazaki, and Kokoriko.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
However, when he opened the lid, there were too many rules.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
On top of that, the Matsumoto team had a surprising victory, and Hamada had a hard time.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
In the end, the Matsumoto team won.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hamada ended up losing without doing anything.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So!

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hamachan, you're out!

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The worst penalty game ever given to the loser, Hamada, is...

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
...Titanic with Matsumoto.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
After this, Hamada came up with a new idea.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry, but...

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
How about we do it again?

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Sure!

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't care about the timing, but...

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's change the rules again.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're going to change the rules?

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I have to change that?

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And so, Hamada's revenge begins.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Morning!

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Morning!

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You're so energetic!

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What do you think, loser?

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What do you mean, loser?

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What do you think you're wearing today?

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I came here to return this jacket to you.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You have a bad taste.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
European style.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's not that hot today.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You have to come.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But you're wearing a nice green jacket.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Green jacket?

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Green jacket?

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's go with a rough one today.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's go with a rough one.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The biggest game of this century!

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hamada vs. Matsumoto vs. Kogoriko!

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The dream golf tournament!

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Kogoriko vs. Matsumoto

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Why is it Hamada vs. Matsumoto vs. Kogoriko?

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't say that.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's the opposite!

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, it's not like that.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Tell us!

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What kind of ability do you have?

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I have the ability to act.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's right!

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's how it is.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Kogoriko has the ability to act.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What was that reaction?

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What was that reaction?

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, that's how it is.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's a tie.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I lost the last time.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm here to punish you.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's a tie this time.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Can you tell us the rules again?

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The rules are a little different from the last time.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
In the previous game, the score was 1-1.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That doesn't change.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But when you hit the green line,

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
When you make a putter,

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If you make a putter, it's 1-1.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If the next person makes a putter, it's 2-2.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If one person makes a putter, it's 1-1.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's play normal golf.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
When you hit the green line, it's normal golf.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Matsumoto's team's score is multiplied by 1.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Hamada's score is 4 times as much as the green line.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The next putter is a normal 1-3.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If Hamada wins at least once out of the three holes,

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hamada wins.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You drank a little.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No, I didn't drink at all.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's not natural to drink this much.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We don't want to win.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm holding back a little.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I've been bleeding before today.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I've been bleeding a lot.

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
First of all, there's a long hole in the fairway.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The right side is OB.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It takes a lot of time to put it on the green line.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's a disadvantage for Hamada.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Matsumoto's team will hit in the order of Matsumoto, Tanaka, Endo, and Yamazaki.

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's go.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's go.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's start the game with Hamada's opening shot.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm under a lot of pressure.

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm under a lot of pressure.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
All right.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It went to the left.

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It went to the left.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I can't say it's a nice shot.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's a little bent.

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What do you think?

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's go.

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Next is Matsumoto's tee shot.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Right, right, right, right, right, right.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Mr. Kaji.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What was that?

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's on the right.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Is it an OB?

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Since Matsumoto's shot is not confirmed, Tanaka is going to shoot a penalty shot.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Tanaka, Tanaka.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Tanaka is going to shoot.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm scared.

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's a nice shot.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's a nice shot.

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It went in.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
All right.

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Is it OK?

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It went in.

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You hit it well.

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Excuse me.

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
When are we going to play golf?

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Can we start?

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Is the first shot safe?

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's safe.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You did it.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
OK, OK.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
OK, OK.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Matsumoto's shot is safe.

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The first shot is to the second point.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
One, two.

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Tanaka.

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll do my best.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You've already decided.

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Let's go.

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
OK.

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's a nice shot.

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
OK.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Amazing.

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
OK, OK.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If you can go forward with this, you can win.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You can do it.

146
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You can do it.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This is tough.

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This is tough.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's tough.

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm sure I'll win.

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's impossible if you don't shoot a super shot.

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's easy.

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sure you'll hit the tree and go somewhere.

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What?

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I've always admired him.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It went in.

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It went in.

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It went in.

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It went in.

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It went in.

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It went in.

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It went in.

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But I'm sure I'll win.

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's true.

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll do it.

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Hamada continues with the third shot.

167
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Really?

168
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Amazing.

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Really?

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This is good.

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is good.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What was that?

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What?

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What was that?

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Really?

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is good.

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What was that?

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's a warp.

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Warp.

180
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
After this, En-dou from the Mazamoto team hits it.

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But it doesn't reach Hamada's ball.

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And Yamazaki hits it next.

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh no.

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's a warp.

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's a warp.

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's a warp.

187
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's a warp.

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Mazamoto.

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
This is the first one.

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This is the first one.

191
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Zaku-san.

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's better than going to a strange place.

193
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Zaku-san.

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's better than going to a strange place.

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's focus on teamwork.

196
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's focus on teamwork.

197
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We can't aim.

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We have to aim.

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's right.

200
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Teamwork.

201
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Teamwork.

202
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Let's aim, Mazamoto-san.

203
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's aim.

204
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm counting on you.

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's go.

206
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Aim for the cup.

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
OK.

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
OK, change.

209
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's amazing.

210
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh no.

211
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh no.

212
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
OK.

213
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's the sixth hit from the Mazamoto team, Tanaka.

214
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
OK.

215
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
OK.

216
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Nice shot.

217
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Nice shot.

218
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The seventh hit is En-dou.

219
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh no.

220
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh no.

221
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's a bunker.

222
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Next is me.

223
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Finally, Hamada is in the same position.

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
OK.

225
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Hamada is in the fourth hit.

226
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He wants to hit the green.

227
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I think so.

228
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I think so.

229
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Green.

230
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I got it.

231
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hamada, nice on.

232
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But, he got on the fourth hit.

233
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
He got on the fourth hit.

234
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He got on the fourth hit.

235
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He got on the fourth hit.

236
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You're really good.

237
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm scared.

238
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's OK.

239
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's OK.

240
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's OK.

241
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh no.

242
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You should go home.

243
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Hey.

244
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You're a campaigner.

245
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Look carefully.

246
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
If Matsumoto hits the green, it will be advantageous for him.

247
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
OK.

248
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Nice.

249
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Nice.

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Good.

251
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
From now on, it's one hit at a time.

252
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He can't let his guard down.

253
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I think he will hit the green.

254
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But, if he doesn't pay attention, the next hit will be dangerous.

255
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's dangerous.

256
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's definitely dangerous.

257
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Hey.

258
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Hey.

259
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Hey.

260
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Hey.

261
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Hey.

262
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't come.

263
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Why did you come today?

264
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Take a rest.

265
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I will come.

266
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Nice on.

267
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He's strong.

268
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He's a campaigner.

269
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He's a campaigner.

270
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He's a campaigner.

271
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't know how strong he is.

272
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He's weak.

273
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
He's strong.

274
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He's strong.

275
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Hey.

276
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Hey.

277
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's dangerous.

278
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
OK.

279
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's OK.

280
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's dangerous.

281
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's dangerous.

282
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
OK.

283
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's dangerous.

284
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
In the end, Hamada hit a bogey.

285
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But, he hit 18 in the middle.

286
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I hit a little.

287
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh.

288
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
OK.

289
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
OK.

290
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's OK.

291
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Don't do unnecessary things.

292
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I know.

293
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's OK.

294
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You can approach slowly.

295
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Wait a minute.

296
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You don't have to do that.

297
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You can approach quickly.

298
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You can approach quickly.

299
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
OK.

300
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
He did it.

301
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
He did it.

302
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
OK.

303
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
OK.

304
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
OK.

305
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
First, they won 14 to 18.

306
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But, they have only 4 hits.

307
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Next, they hit a bogey on the right side.

308
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The left side is OB.

309
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's shorter than the first hole.

310
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If they can make a two-on, Hamada has a chance to win.

311
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Hamada is the first one.

312
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's dangerous.

313
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's dangerous.

314
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's dangerous.

315
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What is this?

316
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I think it's OK.

317
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What?

318
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I don't know.

319
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't know.

320
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I aimed too much.

321
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Did you make a mistake?

322
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No.

323
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Safe.

324
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
OK.

325
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's dangerous.

326
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's dangerous.

327
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Matsumoto's ball is taken to the left and it's OB.

328
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's OB.

329
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's OB.

330
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What is this?

331
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't say what is this.

332
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You look scary.

333
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
No, no, no.

334
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It looks like Shime.

335
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's Tanaka.

336
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's Tanaka.

337
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It looks like Shime.

338
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's Tanaka, isn't it?

339
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
He rolled the ball.

340
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's a one-touch.

341
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's not a one-touch.

342
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's not a one-touch.

343
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's light.

344
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's this one.

345
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Here I go.

346
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Tanaka is at his best.

347
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Nice shot.

348
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
OK.

349
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's a miracle shot that goes over 250 yards.

350
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It didn't stop.

351
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It didn't stop.

352
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What was that?

353
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It was a nice shot.

354
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What was that?

355
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You're lucky today.

356
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Really?

357
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
He put the ball in the tee.

358
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I see.

359
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He put the ball in the tee.

360
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You mean he put the ball in the tee?

361
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
He put the ball in the cap.

362
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You're really good at English.

363
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Hamada is in the second hole from the same place as the first hole.

364
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm scared.

365
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
OK.

366
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I hit it.

367
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Good.

368
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm glad.

369
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh, no.

370
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm glad.

371
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That was a waste.

372
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That was a waste.

373
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
After this, Hamada and Yamazaki's ball goes to the bunker together.

374
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The fate of the game is in the bunker shot.

375
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Nice out.

376
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Wow.

377
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Nice out.

378
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
First of all, Matomoto gets a nice out.

379
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Should I take a protest?

380
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And Hamada.

381
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
OK.

382
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
OK.

383
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
OK.

384
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
OK.

385
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
OK.

386
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Nice out.

387
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's right.

388
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He finally got a nice out after three shots.

389
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
He got a green on.

390
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But he got 24 shots out of 6 shots.

391
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I think I can get in from here.

392
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Really?

393
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Matsumoto's team, Tanaka, is in the seventh hole.

394
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Hamada's team has a lot of space.

395
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll aim.

396
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Nice.

397
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Nice shot.

398
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's long.

399
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What?

400
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That's right.

401
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What?

402
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Wow.

403
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You're not good at that.

404
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm not good at it.

405
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Nice.

406
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Nice.

407
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Nice.

408
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Nice.

409
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
This hole is 26 to 9.

410
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Matomoto's team wins again.

411
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The last hole is a short hole with a lot of bunkers around the green.

412
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
If he can get a green on in the first hole,

413
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Hamada has a chance to win.

414
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This is a set up.

415
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Really?

416
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
To be honest.

417
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Really?

418
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's bad.

419
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Is it set up?

420
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You have to put a lot of effort into it.

421
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
If it's not set up...

422
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This is bad.

423
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Will Hamada get a one-on?

424
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
No way.

425
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Hey.

426
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Where did it go?

427
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Hey.

428
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What's wrong?

429
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's in front of me.

430
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
This is bad.

431
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
This is bad.

432
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
This is bad.

433
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That was close.

434
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This is definitely a par.

435
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
How big is this?

436
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's about three bounce.

437
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's big.

438
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
How big?

439
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Was it 160?

440
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's 170.

441
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's 170, right?

442
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What did you say, Hamada?

443
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I can't tell you that.

444
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I can't teach you golf.

445
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
No way.

446
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Why not?

447
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I can't teach you.

448
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's dirty.

449
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's the Chinese mafia.

450
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Why can't you teach me how to bounce?

451
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's Matomoto's first try.

452
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I told you.

453
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I told you.

454
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's coming out.

455
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's coming out.

456
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's coming out.

457
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's coming out.

458
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's coming out.

459
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's coming out.

460
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's coming out.

461
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's coming out.

462
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Here I go.

463
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's Tanaka's second try.

464
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Will he catch up to Hamada?

465
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Hey.

466
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Good.

467
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's a bunker.

468
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm sorry.

469
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I won't break the direction.

470
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
OK.

471
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's Endo's third try.

472
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's a twist.

473
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's a twist.

474
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's Kimu's turn.

475
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What are you doing?

476
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's coming out.

477
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's a bunker.

478
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Are you kidding me?

479
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's a bunker.

480
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's a bunker.

481
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yamazaki.

482
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yes?

483
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
If you change the bunker again, I'll hit you.

484
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I don't like it.

485
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
This is important.

486
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Don't put it on.

487
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's right. Don't put it on.

488
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The club.

489
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I didn't put it on.

490
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Are you Kanpi?

491
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You're like Kanpi Fujiyama.

492
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Next.

493
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm counting on you.

494
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm counting on you.

495
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm counting on you.

496
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm counting on you.

497
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's coming out.

498
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm in trouble.

499
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's coming out.

500
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm sorry.

501
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm sorry.

502
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm really sorry.

503
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm really sorry.

504
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Matsumoto regains his composure and challenges the bunker shot.

505
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Don't put it on.

506
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I was going to put it on for a moment.

507
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I was going to put it on for a moment.

508
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Hamada.

509
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Huh?

510
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Hamada can't put it down.

511
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I don't care.

512
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You're not paying attention.

513
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The Matsumoto team finally escapes from the bunker hell.

514
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But the situation is in a pinch.

515
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The Matsumoto team is careful because there is a possibility of losing for the first time.

516
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Strong.

517
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I think it's strong.

518
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But I don't think I can hit the green.

519
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Really?

520
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
No.

521
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
No.

522
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Don't do that.

523
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Don't do that.

524
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Please hit the green.

525
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'll do it.

526
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Strong.

527
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
One more time.

528
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
More?

529
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
One more time.

530
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I don't know why it's like that.

531
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Strong.

532
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The last one.

533
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You're talking like a fool.

534
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's really scary.

535
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I think I'm going to miss.

536
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's out.

537
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's out.

538
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I said it's out.

539
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's strong.

540
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's strong.

541
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Endo continues to put it on the green.

542
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's not bad.

543
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
If Hamada puts this second hit, it will be eight on four times.

544
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's weak.

545
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
OK.

546
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
OK.

547
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's a little bit.

548
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
OK.

549
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
This is a little bit.

550
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Hamada, hit it a little bit.

551
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's a little bit in the back.

552
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
From now on, it's a pad game for each hit.

553
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The Mazamoto team is seven on.

554
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Hamada is eight on.

555
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
There is a good chance of losing.

556
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yamazaki, who hits the pad next, will be under a lot of pressure.

557
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What's going on?

558
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What's going on?

559
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Good.

560
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Good.

561
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
OK.

562
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
OK.

563
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Good.

564
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
OK.

565
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
OK.

566
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
If Hamada puts this, it will be nine on four times.

567
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You guys are noisy.

568
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Why are you guys so close?

569
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You guys are noisy.

570
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What are you going to eat today?

571
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't know.

572
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Take it off.

573
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Take it off.

574
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Good.

575
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Good.

576
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Let's go.

577
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Good.

578
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
In the end, Hamada was out of the hole in ten hits.

579
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Take it off.

580
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Good.

581
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Good.

582
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The Mazamoto team will lose if they don't put it in two more hits.

583
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
OK.

584
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
OK.

585
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Even if you take it off, you have to take it off at this point.

586
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You have to take it off.

587
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
But let me tell you.

588
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This is a downtown match.

589
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That's right.

590
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Downtown.

591
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's a downtown match.

592
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You've never won a downtown match.

593
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's why the rules are like this.

594
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm being honest.

595
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Let's win.

596
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
If you win, I'll do it with a sash.

597
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's okay to fail, but that's the way to fail.

598
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That's right.

599
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
If you think you're going to make it this far, Tanaka will be next.

600
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
If you come this far, it's impossible.

601
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Tanaka doesn't even know how strong he is.

602
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What's the order?

603
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm so nervous.

604
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm going.

605
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I did it.

606
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Good.

607
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
This is okay, right?

608
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
If you take this off, you'll lose.

609
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
All right.

610
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's okay.

611
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'll break my teeth.

612
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's okay.

613
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I can do this.

614
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I can do this.

615
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's definitely okay.

616
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
If you take this off, you'll lose.

617
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Tanaka's last pad.

618
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm scared.

619
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's okay.

620
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
All right.

621
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's okay.

622
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's okay.

623
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's okay.

624
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's okay.

625
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's okay.

626
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's okay.

627
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's okay.

628
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's okay.

629
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's okay.

630
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's okay.

631
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So, this time we won.

632
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Hamada's punishment game.

633
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I can't win with four people.

634
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Hamada's punishment game is decided again.

635
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Hamada's punishment game has made a lot of history.

636
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
At one time, Hamada's punishment game was skydiving in the sky.

637
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
At another time, Hamada went to the mountains of France to collect avians.

638
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
At another time, Hamada went to the place where Sakamoto Ryuichi lives in New York to get Matsumoto's forgotten mechanical pencil.

639
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And the ultimate, Matsumoto's Okanta's Titanic love scene.

640
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
All of them remain as wonderful memories in our hearts.

641
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
What kind of memories will Hamada give us this time?

642
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And Tanaka-kun will take part in the protest.

643
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's decided.

644
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'll do my best.
