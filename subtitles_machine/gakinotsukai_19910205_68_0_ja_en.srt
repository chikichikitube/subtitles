1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Tsukitsuki, what are you doing?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Are you an expert?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Before the competition,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I want to practice.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I see.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's fine, but why do you have such a dirty image?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The uniform.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It reminds me of dynamite.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Is that so?

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Isn't it refreshing?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What is this sound?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What is this sound?

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Why is there only one person in this room?

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's because of the budget.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Why did we change it to red?

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Because most of the members are

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the same age as me.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So I didn't want to be noticed.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I see.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So I changed it to red.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I see.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
By the way,

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't know what this sound is.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then...

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Stop it!

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's my team!

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You're a Daphons!

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
At the time of writing the letter,

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I knew it,

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but I had to wait until the car came.

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thank you very much.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Thank you very much.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Shall we take a look at your place?

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes, let's take a look.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Noriyasu-kun gave me the first place.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll go to you at 9 o'clock.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, his...

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
There's no one in here who can shoot a bullet.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's right.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't know yet.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't know yet.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well,

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I think he's a little different.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why?

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why?

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why are you hitting him in the direction of the Union?

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What?

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It doesn't matter.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It doesn't matter.

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Well,

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
as you can see from my team,

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
we're all together.

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He's a secret weapon.

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Really?

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well,

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't know yet.

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll go around the town and have him come back.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's really snowing.

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm really shivering in the city.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't wear cold clothes.

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't jump.

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Come on.

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
A jumper came out of the cold.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You're so stupid.

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Wow.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Are you kidding me?

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Get ready.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's go.

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Stop the camera at the right time.

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Stop it?

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The taste is the best!

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You are the number one in the draft!

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You are the number one in the draft!

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Wait, wait, wait!

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What are you doing?

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sad!

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What is this?

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That one is easy to ride.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's the worst.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But I have a member who is a big tool.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's fast if you take a hammer.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's like a direct ball.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Is it like that?

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's like wearing a handkerchief.

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If you take that, it's really fast.

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If you take that, it's dangerous.

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If you take that, you may fly to Korakuen.

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Next

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Practice in two groups.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I see, I see.

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's go, Otomo.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's dirty.

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Otomo.

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Who? Sato.

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's dirty.

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's dirty.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Your glove looks like a banana.

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Old man.

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Old man.

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Old man is good.

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Old man is good.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Old man is good.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's take a hammer.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Hey, Watamoto.

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Can't you take that off?

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Watamoto.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What?

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Is it better to take it off?

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If you take it off, it will be a big deal.

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's take a hammer off.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It will be a big deal.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Can't you take it off?

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let's take a hammer off.

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If you take it off, it will be a big deal.

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If you take it off, it will be a big deal.

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Really?

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's go.

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can't see.

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I can't see.

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I can't see.

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Hamada, try it.

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Why am I the director?

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Hey, hey.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's go.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Hey, hey.

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Good job.

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hey.

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Hey, hey.

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hey, hey.

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hey, hey.

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Hey, hey.

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hey, hey.

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hey, hey.

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Good job.

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Hey, hey.

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Hey, hey.

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
50,000 more.

140
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Hey, 50,000 more.

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hey, hey.

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hey, hey.

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Hey, hey.

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Good job.

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I failed, so 70,000 more,

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Hey, hey.

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Hey, hey.

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hey, hey.

149
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hey, hey.

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Jump!

151
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,720
Run running running

152
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,720
Look!

153
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,720
Here! Here!

154
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Look! Look!

155
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,720
Over there!

156
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,720
Good! Good!

157
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Here! Here!

158
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,720
A dog?

159
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,720
I want to show you the practice scene at the opening.

160
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Next week, you will be able to watch the game on the monitor.

161
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Today, I did a knock.

162
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
That's it!

163
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
What?

164
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Ah!

165
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Is it funny?

166
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,720
It's funny, but I'm scared.

167
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Suddenly, I'm scared.

168
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
I'm not surprised.

169
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
You are weak.

170
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
I will win.

171
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
I will definitely not win.

172
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
I will win.

173
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
It's a mess.

174
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,720
I will protect the third, knock, and reach the first.

175
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
I will catch you.

176
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
Who is that?

177
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Who is that?

178
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,720
I'm going to drop the ball.

179
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Is the ball hot?

180
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Who is that?

181
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
The ball is not hot.

182
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
You are a knocker.

183
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
He is a knocker.

184
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
You are a knocker.

185
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
You are a knocker.

186
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
That's you.

187
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
You are a knocker.

188
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,720
That's because the opponent is watching.

189
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
I was saving my strength.

190
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
You were shaking your body.

191
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
You are a knocker.

192
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Don't you know that?

193
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
What?

194
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Don't you know that knocker?

195
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
I don't know that.

196
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
I don't know that.

197
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
I'm a knocker.

198
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
What?

199
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
I'm a knocker.

200
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Why?

201
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Why?

202
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
I don't know.

203
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
I'm a knocker.

204
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
You are a knocker.

205
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
I know that.

206
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
I don't know that.

207
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
I will win.

208
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
I played with your player.

209
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Who do you want?

210
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Noriasu.

211
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
He is fast.

212
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Really?

213
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
He is not good at the game.

214
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
He is not good at the game.

215
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
He is not good at the game.

216
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
He is not good at the game.

217
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
What?

218
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
What?

219
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
He is surprised.

220
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Noriasu is not good at the game.

221
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
Noriasu is not good at the game.

222
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
You are not good at the game.

223
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
What?

224
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
You and I are the pitchers.

225
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
Everyone else is not good at the game.

226
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
I'm not good at the game.

227
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Why?

228
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
I'm a high school graduate.

229
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
What?

230
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
I'm a high school graduate.

231
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
I'm a high school graduate.

232
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
When did you say that?

233
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
When?

234
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
When did you say that?

235
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
When you were in college.

236
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
I was in college, but I said that when I was in high school.

237
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
I was in college, but I said that when I was in high school.

238
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
You were not a baseball player.

239
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
I was a baseball player.

240
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
I don't know if he will notice.

241
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
You were not a baseball player.

242
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
I was a baseball player.

243
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Maybe I can win.

244
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Maybe I can win.

245
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
He found out.

246
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,720
He found out.

247
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
You are lying.

248
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
I'm not good at the game.

249
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
You are lying.

250
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
I'm good at the game.

251
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
I don't care.

252
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
I'm serious.

253
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
I want to be serious.

254
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
If you lose, you have to get a punishment.

255
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
If you lose, you have to get a punishment.

256
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
If you lose, you have to get a punishment.

257
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,720
Even if I lose, I don't get a punishment.

258
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
Are you crazy?

259
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
The losing team will get a punishment.

260
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
I won't lose.

261
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
I don't know if you will lose.

262
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
But the losing team will get a punishment.

263
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
I won.

264
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
If I win, you will be my stylist.

265
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Why do I have to go to the play house for you?

266
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Why do I have to go to the play house for you?

267
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
I have to change my clothes.

268
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
I have to change my clothes.

269
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
I have to change my clothes.

270
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
I have to change my clothes.

271
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
I'm sure.

272
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Do you have an old man?

273
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
What?

274
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Do you have an old man?

275
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
I have an old man.

276
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
I have to change my clothes.

277
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
I won't let you change your clothes.

278
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
He is good at the game.

279
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
He is good at the game.

280
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
He is good at the game.

281
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
He is a real elite.

282
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Don't say that.

283
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
I'm serious.

284
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
I will do my best.

285
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
Which number do you choose?

286
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
I choose number one.

287
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
I won't lose.

288
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
I won't lose.

289
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
Can you win?

290
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Of course.

291
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,720
I will win.

292
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
I will win.

293
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
What kind of change is going to happen?

294
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
This is not a curves ball or a suit.

295
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
This is not a curves ball or a suit.

296
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
I'm going to throw the ball.

297
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
I'm going to throw the ball.

298
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
No.

299
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,720
This is a bear ball.

300
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
This is the name of the ball.

301
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
I'm upset if this ball comes to me.

302
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
I'm upset if this ball comes to me.

303
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
I think I will win.

304
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,720
Why don't you throw?

305
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
I'll throw.

306
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,720
You can only throw straight.

307
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
What can you throw?

308
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Curve.

309
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
Can you throw a curve?

310
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,720
Of course.

311
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,720
You can't throw a curve.

312
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Listen to Noriyasu.

313
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
You can't throw a curve.

314
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
You can't throw a curve.

315
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
You can't throw a curve.

316
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
You idiot.

317
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
Hello.

318
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Hello.

319
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,720
It's been a long time since I saw you.

320
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,720
Really?

321
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,720
I'm looking for an assistant.

322
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
I don't have many pictures.

323
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
You don't have many pictures.

324
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,720
You look like Ikeike.

325
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,720
This picture is your father or sister.

326
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,720
My father or sister.

327
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
This picture.

328
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
You were more brown than now.

329
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,720
You were more brown than now.

330
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
You were black.

331
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,720
You look like Zashikiwarashi.

332
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,720
You can't say that.

333
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,720
Zashikiwarashi can't be hurt.

334
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:38,720
I don't know what you are talking about.

335
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Zashikiwarashi can't be hurt.

336
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,720
Zashikiwarashi is a monster that appears in tatami.

337
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,720
I don't know.

338
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
I don't know.

339
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
You can't wear clothes.

340
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Really?

341
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Zashikiwarashi.

342
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,720
Thank you very much.

343
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
By the way, I have a question for you.

344
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
On January 22nd.

345
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
On January 22nd.

346
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
Yes.

347
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,720
Is there any fact that your sister came to Tokyo?

348
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
No.

349
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
On January 22nd at 5.50 pm.

350
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:20,720
I saw a woman who looks like you at Yamatesen Hamamachi-cho station.

351
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Really?

352
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,720
She said she was a woman.

353
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
Really?

354
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
She is 150 cm to 155 cm tall.

355
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Her name is like that.

356
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
My little sister?

357
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,720
Her hair is semi-long and she wears a shrimp tea coat.

358
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Her face is like Hamamachi-san.

359
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,720
She looks like a female monster.

360
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
She looks like him.

361
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,720
She said she came to Yamatesen Hamamachi-cho from Hamamachi-cho station.

362
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,720
She was your sister.

363
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
I don't know what to do.

364
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,720
If she wasn't your sister, it would be a foul.

365
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
There is no such fact.

366
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Really?

367
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Yes.

368
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Let's think about it.

369
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
What?

370
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
Let's think about it.

371
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Your sister doesn't come to see you.

372
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,720
She doesn't come to kill you.

373
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Don't say that.

374
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
Why are you a spy?

375
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
You are a rich man.

376
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,720
You are kind.

377
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
I went to your house once.

378
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,720
When I went to your house, I thought you weren't there.

379
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,720
But when you came home, you were 5 meters away from me.

380
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,720
You are like a cat.

381
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,720
You are like a cat.

382
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,720
I feel sorry for you.

383
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,720
You have been tortured many times.

384
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Don't say that.

385
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
I haven't been tortured.

386
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,720
I just had a brother-sister relationship.

387
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Why do I have to be tortured?

388
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,720
You have done a lot of bad things.

389
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,720
You cut people's nose between their nose.

390
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Dolphins.

391
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Why are you so particular about taking everything back?

392
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,880
I mean

393
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Don't you feel sorry for your sister-in-law?

394
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,720
You have blown up her.

395
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,720
YOKOHAMA'sところ has sent this.

396
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,720
I think she is very handsome.

397
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Don't call me like that!

398
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
I don't look like a manzai player.

399
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
When I ask my friends about it, they say,

400
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
What? Where?

401
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,720
They say I have a bad taste.

402
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,720
This is like that.

403
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,720
I'm a person of both good and bad.

404
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,720
I like it when people ask me if I like my face.

405
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,720
But I really hate it.

406
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,720
That's how I am.

407
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
But that's how I really am.

408
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,720
I like people I like.

409
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,720
I hate people I hate.

410
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,720
That's how I am.

411
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
But that's not the case with Hamada.

412
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
There is.

413
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Why do people call me an old man?

414
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,720
That's not a face.

415
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,720
It's a personality.

416
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
I don't know my personality.

417
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,720
I get angry when I watch TV.

418
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,720
I get angry when I watch TV.

419
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,720
That's not a face.

420
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
I haven't done anything recently.

421
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
I went to work in Osaka the other day.

422
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
I was told by a taxi driver,

423
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,720
You've been round lately.

424
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
That's not good.

425
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
That's not good.

426
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
You can't be round.

427
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
I was told by a taxi driver.

428
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
You can't be more aggressive.

429
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,720
You can't be more aggressive.

430
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,720
He said that I should go further.

431
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
He said that I should go further.

432
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
When I'm done with this, I'll cut my hair.

433
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
You idiot!

434
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
You shouldn't be so strange.

435
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
I didn't cut my hair.

436
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
You had a fan's head in Osaka.

437
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
It's you!

438
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
You didn't have a head.

439
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
You had a face.

440
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
But that was funny.

441
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
Why?

442
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
I have a theater in Osaka.

443
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
It's called No. Grand Kagetsu.

444
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
It's about five times bigger than here.

445
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
It's a great theater.

446
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
I'm doing a show in Osaka.

447
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
With new actors.

448
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
We're doing a play together.

449
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
There's no such thing.

450
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
There's no such thing.

451
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
There's a flower road here.

452
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
It comes out of the flower road.

453
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,720
The cola comes out of the audience.

454
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
The cola comes out of the audience.

455
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
One person.

456
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
One person.

457
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Listen.

458
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
I'm done.

459
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
Are you done?

460
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
I didn't do anything.

461
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Listen to me.

462
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
I came out of the flower road.

463
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
Then, I'm singing.

464
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Then, I'm singing.

465
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
In Minato, this kind of thing.

466
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
There's such a thing.

467
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
There's such a thing.

468
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
I want to see it.

469
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
I had my head here.

470
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
I was trying to get it on.

471
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
I was trying to get it on.

472
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
I was trying to get it on.

473
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,720
I'm trying to avoid it with a fan.

474
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
I'm trying to avoid it with a fan.

475
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,720
I thought I dodged it, but I couldn't dodge it, so I just kicked him.

476
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
Why did you kick him?

477
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
You were like, huh?

478
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
I've done a lot of things before.

479
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,720
He was the only one who kicked me.

480
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,720
And then he kicked me really hard.

481
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
I got up on the stage and did a little kick.

482
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
And then I went into the small room.

483
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Why did you go back without even apologizing?

484
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
It's not like that.

485
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Think about it. You've done a lot of bad things.

486
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,720
I'm not the type to be hated even if I kick like that.

487
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,720
You're definitely the only one who gets caught.

488
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,720
I'm really telling the kids.

489
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
You don't have to think so much about it.

490
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,720
It's just that the kids are so small.

491
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,720
There aren't that many living things in society.

492
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,720
If it's a dog, it's cute.

493
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,720
Think about it.

494
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
It could be a dog.

495
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
That's where you got big.

496
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,720
I didn't have much when I was a kid.

497
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
What do you mean you didn't have much when you were a kid?

498
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Because my mom, my dad, my mom,

499
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,720
If I'm told these three things, I'll go to work next time.

500
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Thank you very much.

501
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
Thank you very much.

502
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,720
Next week, we're finally going to have a baseball game.

503
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
I see.

504
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
I want you to watch it on TV.

505
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
I see.

506
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Baseball, right?

507
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
That's right.

508
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,720
I don't know who's going to win.

509
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
I'm looking forward to the results next week.

510
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,720
I want to play fair.

511
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
I'm looking forward to it.

512
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,720
I want to play fair.

513
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,720
That's right.

514
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,720
If you lose, you'll be punished by the whole team.

515
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
It's dark.

516
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
That's right.

517
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,720
And I don't know how to play with the kids.

518
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,720
This is on Monday, February 11th.

519
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
From 4 to 4 o'clock.

520
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
It's a special edition.

521
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,720
It's a special edition.

522
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,720
It's a special edition.

523
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,720
I'll send you this.

524
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,720
The four of us.

525
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,720
Our theme song, Four Men.

526
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,720
Our catchphrase.

527
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Our catchphrase.

528
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
As it is.

529
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
We've been offered a song.

530
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Song.

531
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Various.

532
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
Color.

533
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,720
It's a special edition that's spreading the talk.

534
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,720
From 4 to 4 o'clock on Monday, February 11th.

535
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
4 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock.

536
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
It's a kid's play.

537
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,720
Don't miss it.

538
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,720
The look is.

539
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
The effect.

540
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
And the 11th.

541
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,720
One day.

542
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,720
There are two left.

543
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
Two.

544
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Shut up.
