1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry to bother you today, sensei.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What do you want me to do?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Today, Tama's running...

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You said you've been researching it for a long time.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yes, I've been researching it for a long time.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I came here on purpose.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm really sorry to bother you.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What are you going to show me today?

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today, I'll show you how Tama's running grows.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Grows?

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Grows?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'll show you how Tama's running grows.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Grows?

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I haven't grown it yet.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll show you how it reacts.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Is that so?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's a very rare creature.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Sensei, if you can, please come over here.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you succeed, you'll be a teacher.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm very happy.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Today, I'm going to do something else.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm going to do something else.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to do something else.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Sensei, please come over here.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I've prepared a lot of things.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What kind of thing?

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
First of all, I'm going to try on these earrings.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What are you going to do?

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's a big eater.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's a big eater.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's a big eater.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's a big eater.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It has sashimi.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It has sashimi.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It also has a lot of magazines.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It also has a lot of magazines.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a big eater.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's a big eater.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's a wake-up clock.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It will go off when it reaches a certain time.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You can't stop it.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I see.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I wonder what he'll do.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,800
I'm very curious about what he's going to do.

45
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,600
I'm thinking about how to deal with him by sending him a lot of things at the same time.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He'll be here soon.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He'll be here soon.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If you fail, you'll be in trouble.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, really?

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's okay.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What? Hey!

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Show me something interesting. I'm here on purpose.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What?

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Show me something interesting. I'm here on purpose.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I know what you mean.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're a teacher, right?

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's right.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you okay?

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Why do you say that every once in a while?

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's not like that.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, really?

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Here he comes.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What are you doing?

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What are you doing?

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What are you doing?

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What are you doing?

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Is he a stylist?

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He's a stylist.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He's a stylist.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I never thought he'd come running.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's the Running.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You are standing up.

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm looking at the��.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm looking at the zagg.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Can't you see?

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Can't you see?

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're touching the nod?

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm touching this角 at the very tip of the ideals.

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Sounds like you are wrong.

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,200
That's the best.

85
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,000
That's the best.

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Please write it down.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's Afro.

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I like the socks of Kyosho.

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's a junior high school student's socks.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I raised it.

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm worried that it's a little off.

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I raised it from left to right.

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
From left to right.

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's got a lot of stuff.

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You don't show me anything.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's normal.

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If there's a magazine or food in front of you,

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll look at it.

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
People show their interest.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I quit the magazine.

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What's wrong?

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's my first time.

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This kind of movement.

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh, finally.

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're watching.

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I nodded.

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I nodded.

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I nodded.

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I took a book.

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's getting faster from here.

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
First of all,

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I want to cry.

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Get out of the way.

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Get out of the way.

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Get out of the way.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What are you looking at?

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Are you looking at Gaten?

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Is it Gaten?

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's Gaten.

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What kind of magazine is Gaten?

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's a job magazine.

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, my God.

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He's going to lose his head.

124
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Professor.

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I prepared it in advance.

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
As for this magazine,

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't show you the erotic part at all.

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's cute.

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So,

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll show you a big breast.

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll show you a big breast ad.

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I see.

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He's gone.

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Excuse me.

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Thank you for your time.

136
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Thank you for your time.

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's unnatural for a woman like this to be here.

138
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Do you know Gaten?

139
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He's laughing.

140
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He's laughing.

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He's laughing.

142
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He's laughing.

143
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He's smiling.

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He's smiling.

145
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He's smiling.

146
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He's erotic.

147
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He's erotic.

148
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He's erotic.

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He's erotic.

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He's in a good condition.

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What's wrong with him?

152
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's stuck in my ear.

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I've never seen this many people.

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I can't stand it.

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I've never seen this many people.

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I can't stand it.

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I hid it behind my back.

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I've never seen this many people.

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I can't stand it.

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's stuck in my ear.

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I can't stand it.

163
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's stuck in my ear.

164
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's stuck in my ear.

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's stuck in my ear.

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's stuck in my ear.

167
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's stuck in my ear.

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Professor.

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is the final stage.

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He's always running in white.

171
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Today, the AD will run in different colors.

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'd like to see how he challenges the final stage.

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I think he's very particular about white.

174
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I've prepared a costume for you.

176
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
When the time comes, I'll come to you.

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Please take a look at the costume.

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I checked the costume.

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I just took a picture of the siren.

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

181
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What is this?

182
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's a new running suit.

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Is this for the stage?

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's a new running suit.

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Is it just for the stage?

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's just for the stage.

187
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's just for the stage.

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's all the same.

189
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's all the same.

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's the real thing.

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Thank you in advance.

192
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I think you're wearing a tank top.

193
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Which color do you like?

194
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I like white.

195
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Please.

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Which color do you like?

197
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I like white.

198
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You don't have much of your own will.

199
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Thank you in advance.

200
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Let's take a picture.

201
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This is his self-portrait.

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It doesn't shrink.

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's beautiful.

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
There was a machine.

205
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
There's a lot of self-portrait.

206
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
How was it?

207
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
If this is a hit, I'd like to follow the running a little more.

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Thank you.

209
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
How are you?

210
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm fine.

211
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's a holiday.

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's good.

213
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll do it in that way.

214
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I can't talk fast.

215
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I can't talk fast.

216
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll talk to the audience today.

217
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't have much to say.

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You don't have much to say?

219
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You don't have much to say?

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You don't have much to say?

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm busy.

222
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm busy.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You're not that busy.

224
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We have a holiday.

225
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I was bored the other day.

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I didn't have anything to do.

227
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I went to the Salty Bank.

228
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Salty Bank

229
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Salty Bank

230
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's good.

231
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The unloved child.

232
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The unloved child.

233
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Salty Bank

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's what the child says.

235
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I can't help it.

236
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I can't help it.

237
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm safe.

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm safe.

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I told the staff of CX.

240
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I told the staff of CX.

241
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I told the staff of CX.

242
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I told the staff of CX.

243
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I told the staff of CX.

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I can't touch the audience.

245
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
From the stage.

246
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Foreigners.

247
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
They're coming down.

248
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You're having a hard time.

249
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm having a hard time.

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
They don't know how amazing I am.

251
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
They are standing right in front of me.

252
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's hard.

253
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm a star.

254
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I was wearing a hat to an outsider.

255
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I was wearing a hat.

256
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I was wearing a hat.

257
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I was wearing a hat.

258
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I didn't touch it.

259
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I was a star.

260
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't know the structure.

261
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't know the structure.

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He grabbed me like this and pulled me back.

263
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I got beaten up.

264
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Everyone was looking this way and that way.

265
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
My face was all red.

266
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's what happened.

267
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We were talking like this.

268
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't know how to say it.

269
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I touched the audience.

270
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I think the audience is also painful.

271
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Even if I hit my face,

272
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't know what to say.

273
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's why I get excited when I get beaten up like this.

274
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't want to get hit in the face.

275
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I just don't want to.

276
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
When I got beaten like this,

277
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I was like, don't do that.

278
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I just came to watch.

279
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't want to do that.

280
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I was very angry.

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I didn't touch the audience very much.

282
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I was worried.

283
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I was busy when the drama started.

284
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Who did that?

285
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Is that right?

286
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Really?

287
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What was it like?

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It was for three ADs.

289
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh really?

290
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Kiyona did something like that, didn't she?

291
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I did it a little too.

292
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What did you do?

293
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The one I did.

294
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The one I did was called AD-Bugi.

295
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's similar, isn't it?

296
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's similar?

297
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's called AD-Bushi.

298
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What kind of story is that?

299
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's a kanji, though.

300
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's not a kanji.

301
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's a kanji for Bushi.

302
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I haven't seen it yet.

303
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Really?

304
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Who did you do it with?

305
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
For AD-Bugi, I did it with Taishu Kase.

306
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I see.

307
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I did it with Kochi Mataba.

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I see.

309
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I did it with Hikari Ishida before he sold out.

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
They're pretty good members.

311
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
They are.

312
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Who did you do it with for AD-Bushi?

313
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I did it with a big talent.

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I knew it.

315
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I went to get it.

316
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I went to get the numbers.

317
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
To get the numbers, you have to get a big talent.

318
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's right.

319
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Who did you do it with?

320
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
With Fighting Farada.

321
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Why did you do it with Fighting Farada?

322
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Call someone younger!

323
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And I...

324
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Fighting Farada?

325
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You called me Farada.

326
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's a member like that.

327
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
When it starts again...

328
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's busy.

329
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It really is.

330
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
When does it start?

331
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It starts in May.

332
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It starts in mid-March.

333
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It starts in mid-March.

334
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It should start by then.

335
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yes, yes, yes.

336
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It starts in May.

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yes, yes, yes.

338
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Well,

339
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm a little weak right now.

340
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'll say it suddenly.

341
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm the president of the shooting company.

342
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You're already shooting?

343
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What kind of scene did you shoot?

344
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
A kissing scene.

345
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
With who?

346
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Um...

347
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
With Shirakawa Yumi.

348
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It sounds complicated.

349
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
With a young guy.

350
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
With an older guy.

351
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

352
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But it's one episode.

353
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What?

354
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What's one episode?

355
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's one episode and 12 episodes.

356
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Ah, one episode and 12 episodes.

357
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Ah, I see, I see.

358
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But the drama is hard.

359
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's right.

360
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What kind of drama is hard?

361
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
At the end, I always...

362
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The ending is always my song.

363
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It starts at 5, 2, 2.

364
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It really starts in mid-March.

365
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What time does it start?

366
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Um...

367
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It starts at 7.30.

368
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What?

369
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
30 minutes?

370
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It starts at 7.30 or 8.

371
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
30 minutes?

372
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yes.

373
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's not that big of an deal.

374
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
30 minutes...

375
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Well, well, well...

376
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
If you don't look forward to it,

377
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You won't find anything.

378
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
If you don't look forward to it.

379
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You won't find anything.

380
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You won't know what you're doing.

381
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What?

382
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
If you don't look forward to it,

383
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You won't find anything.

384
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What?

385
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
If you don't look forward to it,

386
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You won't know what will happen.

387
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What are you talking about?

388
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The next day

389
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What is this?

390
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Why are you so concerned about this?

391
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The nose hair is...

392
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's sticking out!

393
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's sticking out because there is a story behind it

394
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
There is a story behind it

395
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's sticking out like this

396
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But it's definitely not a bad thing

397
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The nose hair is both a good thing and a bad thing

398
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's really sticking out

399
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I should take it off

400
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
If I take it off, it's like...

401
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I have to give it as a present

402
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's like a TV show present

403
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Then I don't know what's left

404
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Now

405
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This board too

406
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
If you walk on my way

407
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
All the people are wearing the same clothes

408
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't know if it's a bad touch or a good thing

409
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But it's creepy

410
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm wearing Keita's hat all the time

411
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't know

412
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:07,180
I extremely

413
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,180
I can't go in.

414
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,180
I'm too fast.

415
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,180
Good morning.

416
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,180
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

417
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,180
Good morning is slower.

418
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,180
I don't want to hit the rope.

419
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,180
My legs hurt.

420
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,180
My legs hurt.

421
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,180
Women are not bad.

422
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,180
Women are not bad, but sometimes they are ugly.

423
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,180
The other day, I was listening to a story.

424
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,180
I was eating with a woman.

425
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,180
A crow flew out.

426
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,180
I ate at a great place.

427
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,180
I ate at a place where a crow flew in.

428
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,180
A crow flew in and flew into a woman's hand.

429
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,180
That's not good.

430
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,180
I hate that.

431
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,180
The woman had a dirty face.

432
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,180
The crow flew in again.

433
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,180
The crow flew into Imada's head.

434
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,180
That's not good.

435
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,180
I don't want to see that woman anymore.

436
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,180
It's hard to love.

437
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,180
I understand.

438
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,180
It's hard to love.

439
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,180
I can't help it.

440
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,180
That's your responsibility.

441
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:42,180
I'm sorry, but I can't love a woman who has a dirty face.

442
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,180
I'm sorry.

443
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,180
What's that?

444
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,180
The crow's face was bad in the story.

445
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,180
That's bad, too.

446
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:58,180
The crow ran away.

447
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,180
But...

448
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,180
But?

449
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,180
Why is this a cute woman?

450
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,180
But...

451
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,180
That's your face.

452
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,180
I don't know if I can do that.

453
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,180
That's your face.

454
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,180
I don't know if I can do that.

455
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,180
That's hard.

456
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,180
That's hard.

457
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,180
That's hard.

458
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,180
That's hard.

459
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,180
That's not good.

460
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,180
I can't help it.

461
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,180
I'm nervous.

462
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,180
I'm nervous.

463
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,180
I'm nervous.

464
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,180
I want you to end it without anything.

465
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:52,180
There are times when you can't stop even if you go to the store.

466
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,180
The crow's face was bad.

467
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,180
That's your face.

468
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,180
You look like an old man with a crow's face.

469
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,180
You look like an old man with a crow's face.

470
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,180
You look like an old man with a crow's face.

471
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,180
I understand.

472
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,180
That's your face.

473
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,180
You're trying to fly.

474
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,180
No matter how hard I think about it, this sound is strange.

475
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,180
It's noisy.

476
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,180
It's noisy.

477
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,180
Hamada only wears secret shoes in the drama.

478
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,180
I'm wearing it.

479
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,180
I'm wearing it.

480
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,180
I'm wearing two or three today.

481
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,180
Hamada's back is long.

482
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:45,180
There used to be a lot of difference in the past, but there's not much difference these days.

483
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,180
Even if you say that...

484
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,180
But it's strange.

485
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,180
I'm not that short.

486
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,180
But you're shorter than before.

487
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,180
The gap is narrowing.

488
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,180
That's strange.

489
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,180
Is that so?

490
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,180
Is that so?

491
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,180
I'm surprised.

492
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,180
I'm sure you're doing something.

493
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,180
What are you doing?

494
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,180
Are you a human being?

495
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,180
Look at this.

496
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,180
It's just normal shoes.

497
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,180
What about the outside?

498
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,180
Try it on.

499
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,180
The inside is different.

500
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,180
There used to be a lot of difference in the past, but there's not much difference these days.

501
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,180
What are you doing?

502
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,180
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
