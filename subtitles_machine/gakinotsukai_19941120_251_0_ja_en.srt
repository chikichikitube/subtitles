1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Why?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Look at this.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is what I came up with.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's a Tsukkomi machine.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If you wear this, anyone can be Tsukkomi.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, I don't really...

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Who are you?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm Hamamoto.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hamamoto Kenkichi.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm Hamamoto Kenkichi.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't need you anymore.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Normally, you can't be Tsukkomi.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But if you wear this...

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If you wear this, you can be Tsukkomi.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But if you wear this...

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Turn it on!

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Where did you put it?

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hey, you have to put it in the back.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I didn't know.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Like this.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the back?

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You have to put it in the back.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I've done this before.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I want someone who looks more like an amateur to do it.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I see.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You can say that.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Your glasses are shaking.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But if you wear this...

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It doesn't matter.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It doesn't matter.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Turn it on!

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm scared.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why?

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Why Senbei?

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's edit this.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I hate sweet things.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's sweet!

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It doesn't matter.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It doesn't matter.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You can do it.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Turn it upside down.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's funny.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's funny.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's all the same.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Over there.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Over there.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's do it.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Why?

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You have to put it in the back.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It doesn't matter.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It doesn't matter.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Sorry.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I made it weak.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I just realized.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can wear this.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No, no, no.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's B2.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
B2.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It doesn't matter.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It doesn't matter.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Turn it to B1.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It doesn't matter.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It doesn't matter.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You can do it.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll raise it to maximum.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll raise it.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll raise it.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I've raised it a lot.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll raise it.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll raise it.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It doesn't matter.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
My body is weak.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's weak.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What are you doing?

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
How about that yellow guy?

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You can do it.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You can do it.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You can do it.

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Don't make me do this.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There's a place where I left a question.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why don't you do it?

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It doesn't change much.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It doesn't change much.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's change places.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's change places.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't do that.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't do that.

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't do that.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'll do it.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It might be different.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What is it?

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll do it.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll do it.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll do it.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll do it.

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't want to do it.

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll do it.

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll do it.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll do it.

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's embarrassing.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll do it.

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's embarrassing.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's go.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll do it.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He's smoking

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's getting dangerous

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's getting dangerous

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The last one

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's like Matsubokkuri

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He'll do it

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He'll do it

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He'll do it

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He'll do it

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He'll do it

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He'll do it

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He'll do it

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Switch on

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The girl

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The girl

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The girl next to you

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The girl next to you

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Switch on

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Who should I switch on?

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Who should I switch on?

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Look

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The girl next to you

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Switch on

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Matsubokkuri is dangerous

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Matsubokkuri

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's go home

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's go home

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Let's watch the best scenes

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I went to the audience

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I touched everyone

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You won't do it?

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This is for fan club

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is for fan club

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is for fan club

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I see

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Then let's watch the best scenes

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Then let's watch the best scenes

143
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Then let's watch the best scenes

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Huh?

145
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,000
It's for the sake of the children!

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hello

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You know, on a day like today, I feel a bit of pressure

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Why?

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If I don't get excited with my talk more than usual, the opening will be ruined

150
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,000
Daniel-kun!

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What?

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The power of energy is amazing

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
When I saw this at home, I was like, huh?

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
When I saw the opening the other day, I was like, was he laughing this much?

155
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm laughing as much as I can!

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
After the show, everyone, please stay here for a bit

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Only the laughter

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I won't do it after all

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It wasn't funny, but it was funny

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
There are a lot of shows like that, right?

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes, yes, yes

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I can't even go on set, why am I laughing like this?

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There are a lot of shows like that

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I won't say it to anyone, but it's not good

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's not good

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's still good today

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Tell me how to do it

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This is the color of the mustard, right?

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is the color of the mustard, and this is the color of the mustard

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is the black line, and this is the black line

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's not that black!

172
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If you say it's black, it's a bit...

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
If you say it's black, it's like this

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's like this

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
These days, there are a lot of strange things coming to the house

176
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I think so

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This time, the enemy was really bad

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Ah, yes

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
In the middle of the night, it comes like this

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Ah

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Right?

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The monitor shows it

183
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's a ugly woman with glasses on

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Ah, yes

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Um...

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
She says her name

187
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, that's a form of courtesy

188
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No, that's a way of saying if I know it or not

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Ah, it's me?

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes, yes

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't know about you, and it's a nuisance if you come at this time

192
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
When she comes, it's ping pong, ping pong, ping pong

193
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I don't know about that

194
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
She keeps pressing it

195
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's been about 10 minutes, ping pong, ping pong, ping pong

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
After pressing it for about 10 minutes, she suddenly can't press it

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Ah, she gave up and went home

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I thought so

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Ma-chan

200
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's my mother's voice

201
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's my mother's voice

202
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
She's screaming in the basement

203
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I can't do this

204
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I can hear it from the people in the office

205
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
She's doing something bad

206
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I can't do this

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I called the police

208
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I can't do this

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's ping pong, ping pong again

210
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I can't think about it here

211
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I can't let the police come

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I can't let them come

213
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I can't let them come

214
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I can't let them come

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's Shizuoka

216
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I have a favor to ask you

217
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Don't laugh

218
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't laugh

219
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
My car broke down

220
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I have to go back to Shizuoka by myself

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't have any money

222
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So please put me inside

223
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And lend me some money

224
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't know if you know about me

225
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But I don't know about you

226
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So I can't lend you money

227
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
While I was running, I saw my face on the monitor

228
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I was talking

229
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The police came to the monitor

230
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What are you doing?

231
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Come here

232
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Ah

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No

235
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I wanted to see that monitor

236
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
After a while

237
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
About 10 minutes

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm still talking

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry

240
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
They won't come anymore

241
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's the problem

242
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I was really driving

243
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
My car broke down

244
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I can't let them come

245
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I can't let them come

246
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I can't let them come

247
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Will they come if I tell them not to come?

248
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Will they come if I tell them not to come?

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's your message

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If I tell them not to come

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
They won't come

252
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If I tell them to come

253
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They won't come

254
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
They will come

255
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's natural

256
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It happens

257
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Right?

258
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Again

259
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm really tired

260
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I should have come

261
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But

262
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
There are many professional wrestlers

263
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They are always after

264
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Giant and Baba

265
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
They are always after

266
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
They are always after

267
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
They are always after

268
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
They are always after

269
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
They are always after

270
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
They are always after

271
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They are always after

272
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But

273
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
If I beat Baba

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I beat Baba

275
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You should be proud

276
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You shouldn't look down on Baba

277
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You shouldn't look down on Baba

278
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You will be proud

279
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
If you beat Baba

280
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Even high school students

281
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you beat Baba

282
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Even high school students

283
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If you have a strong body

284
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You can beat him

285
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You shouldn't look down on Baba

286
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What do you know about Baba?

287
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Do you know how big he is?

288
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Of course I know

289
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I've seen him many times

290
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
He is bigger than you think

291
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I've seen him

292
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I've seen him

293
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You are a fool

294
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What are you talking about?

295
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You don't know what a wrestler is

296
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's not true

297
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Wrestlers are different from when you see them in the studio

298
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's not true

299
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
When you fight in the ring

300
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Wrestlers are bigger

301
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
For example

302
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm doing this

303
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
If

304
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
If you fight

305
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If you fight

306
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Your body will change

307
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Really?

308
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
How will you change?

309
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
If you fight

310
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
How will you change?

311
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Why?

312
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Will a bird speak?

313
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Will a bird speak?

314
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
A small missile

315
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
will come

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Your legs will be catapulted

317
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's easy to move

318
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's easy to move

319
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I can move like this

320
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Don't look down on catapult

321
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
People who laugh at catapult

322
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
will laugh at catapult

323
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It doesn't matter

324
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
If you laugh at catapult, it's harder to move

325
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You are scared of catapult

326
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You are scared of catapult

327
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You are a fool

328
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You are a fool

329
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You are a fool

330
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What are you doing?

331
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What are you doing?

332
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What are you doing?

333
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Really

334
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Do you want to go to the toilet?

335
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yes

336
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Take it out

337
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Why do old people

338
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
come closer when they talk?

339
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't have a big voice

340
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't have a big voice

341
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
In that sense

342
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I don't have the power to talk

343
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's why

344
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Matsumoto

345
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Don't forget that

346
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't forget that

347
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't remember

348
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't remember

349
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You don't know

350
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
how old people feel

351
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I don't know

352
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
When you think about

353
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
what old people are

354
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
They want to go to the toilet

355
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
They want to go to the toilet

356
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
They talk to young people as much as possible

357
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
They talk to young people as much as possible

358
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
They try to go to the toilet

359
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
They come again

360
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I thought so

361
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What kind of scream

362
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
is the happy scream?

363
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What?

364
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You are an old man

365
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You are an old man

366
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You have a big mouth

367
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
There is no scream

368
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There is

369
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
There is

370
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
There is no scream

371
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
There is no scream

372
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What are you talking about?

373
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You are angry

374
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I am doing it because there is

375
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I am saying it

376
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Happy scream isn't like that

377
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What do you mean?

378
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
If there is a storm

379
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It is not a happy scream

380
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I am telling you

381
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
For example, you are walking on the street

382
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You see a million yen

383
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You pick up a million yen

384
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What do you do?

385
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You pick up a million yen

386
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You pick up a million yen

387
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
A million yen

388
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
At that time

389
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
There is a happy scream

390
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
No

391
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
No

392
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You are not aware of it

393
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You are saying it

394
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You are saying it

395
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You are saying it

396
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
There is no scream

397
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There is no

398
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What do you mean?

399
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What is a happy scream?

400
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What is a happy scream?

401
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What are you talking about?

402
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What are you thinking?

403
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
A million yen

404
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
There is a million yen

405
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
There is a happy scream

406
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I found it

407
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I know

408
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Let me see

409
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You are thinking

410
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You are thinking

411
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Tell me

412
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Tell me

413
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That's why you are thinking?

414
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes

415
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I am thinking

416
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I am sorry

417
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's why you are thinking

418
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You are walking on the street

419
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You are walking on the street

420
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
A million yen

421
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
There is a million yen

422
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What?

423
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What is that?

424
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What is the happy scream?

425
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Right now, it's like...

426
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
What are you doing?

427
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Are you okay?

428
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It would be strange if it was a happy scream of Kakumon Hirodaki

429
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yes, yes, yes

430
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Don't be a snob

431
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Don't be a snob

432
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Ah, you prepared it

433
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes, yes, yes

434
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I was wondering what kind of happy scream it would be

435
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Ah, I forgot

436
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Ah, I forgot

437
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If you say it a little more, it will be a big deal

438
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
If you say it a little more, it will be a big deal

439
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't understand such a thing

440
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm teaching you now

441
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Ah, I got it

442
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I don't understand such a thing

443
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Natori

444
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Natori

445
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The lion of the beast is the strongest animal in the jungle

446
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
On the contrary, what is the weakest animal?

447
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's a quiet...

448
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What is it?

449
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What kind of cry is it?

450
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Huh?

451
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
For example, the lion of the beast is a very strong animal

452
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yes, yes, yes

453
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It is

454
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It seems to be very strong

455
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That's right

456
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
No matter how you think about it, you can't win

457
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's scared by its voice

458
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's scared by its voice

459
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's very weak

460
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's really weak

461
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The cry of animals

462
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Even dogs are scared

463
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes, yes, yes

464
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So it's a smaller animal

465
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Huh?

466
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's a little bit...

467
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's a little bit...

468
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's wet

469
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Where is it?

470
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's a little bit...

471
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's a little bit...

472
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's an animal

473
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's in the food container

474
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Even if it hits the bottle on the roof, it's going to die

475
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's like this

476
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Huh?

477
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No

478
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
No

479
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's completely different

480
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
How is it?

481
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Can you hear it?

482
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yes

483
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts

484
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What happened?

485
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There's nothing like this

486
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There's nothing like this

487
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts

488
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I feel sick

489
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I feel sick

490
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's like this

491
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Isn't it talking?

492
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What is it doing?

493
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Isn't it talking?

494
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's crying

495
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Even if an enemy comes, it gets sick

496
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It gets sick

497
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's like Japanese

498
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's not Japanese

499
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's a cry

500
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Cook do do

501
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Like this

502
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I see

503
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I heard a rumor that Mr. Matsumoto and Mr. Hama are dating

504
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I have a question for Mr. Hama

505
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What part of Mr. Matsumoto do you love?

506
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What?

507
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm starting to get caught

508
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What are you talking about?

509
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What are you talking about?

510
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The real thing is...

511
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I don't care

512
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Should I tell you what happened back then?

513
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What?

514
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I was surprised

515
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
My clothes were all wet

516
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
After that you took a shower

517
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It was so hot

518
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I cried for three days

519
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's gross

520
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You should talk to me when you're hungry

521
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What?

522
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
What are you jealous of?

523
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You're jealous of me

524
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You want a lot of things from me

525
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I can't give it to you

526
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I won't take it

527
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'll give you anything

528
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'll give you anything

529
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I have a lot of things I don't need

530
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Let's start with me

531
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
When I woke up and saw your face

532
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I was really depressed

533
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Why?

534
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I felt like my head was going to explode

535
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Why?

536
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Let's talk about you

537
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
When you woke up and saw my face

538
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I ranked you up

539
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You can't say that

540
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You didn't notice when you woke up

541
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I didn't see your face when I woke up

542
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I went to the bathroom

543
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I thought I'd brush my teeth

544
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,000
This is me?

545
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Why are you showing your face?

546
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
When I saw you in the mirror

547
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I took a picture of you

548
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Who?

549
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You

550
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Me?

551
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You took a picture of me

552
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Did I?

553
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
When I was walking down the street

554
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You took a picture of me

555
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Wait a minute

556
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What is this?

557
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Wait a minute

558
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
What is this?

559
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Did you come out of the store on purpose?

560
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yes

561
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm the owner of the bar

562
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Wait a minute
