1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Next time, let's go to Gaki no Tsukaya and eat a lot of kaitetsu sushi and get 1 million yen!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's 1 million yen!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This time it's a bonus project.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's right.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Giri Giri Tsukasa said he made a mistake.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
He said, let's go for 2 million yen.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Really?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If you say a little, you can still go for 3 million yen.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's very generous.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The rules are simple.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The five of us can eat the most.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I see.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's all.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You'll definitely get it.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's right.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm drooling.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You're drooling.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Why?

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're drooling.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're drooling.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Again, again.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You're drooling.

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You're drooling.

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You're drooling.

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Try it.

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's the worst.

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Today's project is also called a performance.

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's an old man's face.

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's go.

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Let's go.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Is everyone ready?

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The person who eats the most will get 1 million yen.

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's right.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's get started.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Are you ready?

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Ready.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Start.

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is difficult.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You're definitely going to lose.

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm a little hungry.

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Excuse me.

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What?

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Outside, outside, outside.

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There's a lot of eggs.

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Look outside.

48
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What's that?

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's Mr. Itao.

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Really?

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why do you look like that?

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What is it?

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's like a game.

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What is it?

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Good morning.

56
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Good morning.

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Good morning.

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What's the matter?

59
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What's the matter?

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Well, I'm a little tired.

61
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh.

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I had a pain.

63
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Are you shooting a program now?

64
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes.

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The person who ate the most will get 1 million yen or 2 million yen.

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If that's the case, shall we do it together?

67
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, no.

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry we're doing it alone.

69
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No, no.

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's a program that's always done with the members of the kids.

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes.

72
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But 6 people out of 5 people.

73
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
7 people out of 6 people.

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I have plenty of time.

75
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Mr. Tsuga.

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What are you doing in Yokohama?

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock.

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I still have plenty of time.

79
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No.

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Please sign it.

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Are you okay?

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Please sign it.

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Shall we do it?

84
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Shall we do it?

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No.

86
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How about a confrontation with me?

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Wait a minute.

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What? Really?

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There's no way to win.

90
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's right.

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's okay.

92
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm so hungry.

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But you can't do that to me.

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No.

95
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's okay.

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's okay.

97
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Are you going to do it?

98
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No.

99
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's do it.

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Are you serious?

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's my seat.

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's a tight place.

103
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Wait a minute.

104
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Come on.

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay.

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Are you okay?

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's okay.

108
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm fine.

109
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm so hungry.

110
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Then let's do it.

111
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Please.

112
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let's do it.

113
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I think it's easy.

114
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What do you think?

115
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's easy.

116
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If you're full, let's go home.

117
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Good luck.

118
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm ready.

119
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Start!

120
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I've always had a bad feeling about this.

121
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Please.

122
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I failed.

124
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's okay.

125
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay.

126
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's okay.

127
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's okay.

128
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm too slow.

129
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's okay.

130
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Thank you.

131
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But it doesn't matter if you don't have time.

132
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll do it.

133
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's do it.

134
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can do it today.

135
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You can do it?

136
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can do it today.

137
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's okay if I can eat it.

138
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Here you go.

139
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Thank you.

140
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Here you go.

141
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you.

142
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It says Meiji.

143
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's chocolate.

144
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What's this?

145
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You shouldn't eat that.

146
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What's this?

147
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Here you go.

148
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's good for children.

149
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I got a squid.

150
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I got a squid.

151
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I got a squid.

152
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I got a squid.

153
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll eat that.

154
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This is dried squid.

155
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Dried squid?

156
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's so good.

157
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is a sea bream.

158
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't think it's a sea bream.

159
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's a sea bream.

160
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Let's go.

161
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Let's go.

162
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What's that?

163
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's go.

164
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What's that?

165
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's go.

166
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Don't eat it.

167
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What is this?

168
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What is this?

169
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Glasses.

170
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Wasabi is looking at us.

171
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Wasabi is looking at us.

172
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Glasses.

173
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What is this?

174
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Completely.

175
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Completely glasses.

176
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's pour it.

177
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Pour it.

178
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's coming.

179
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's coming.

180
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Let's go.

181
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's pour this out.

182
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Alright.

183
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's an honest band.

184
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He's wearing a lot of glasses.

185
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's crazy.

186
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's crazy.

187
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I thought he would pass out.

188
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's coming again.

189
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's coming again.

190
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What is this?

191
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What's this?

192
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Cracker.

193
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Cracker.

194
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Hey.

195
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Hey.

196
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hey.

197
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Wait a minute.

198
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's crazy.

199
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's go.

200
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's go.

201
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We're not supposed to eat this.

202
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Pour it.

203
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's get something to eat.

204
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Here it comes!

205
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Which one should I take?

206
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I got it!

207
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Here it comes.

208
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What's this?

209
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What's this?

210
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What's this?

211
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's a student uniform button.

212
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's a high school button.

213
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's a high school button.

214
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's coming!

215
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What's this?

216
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't get it.

217
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What's this?

218
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's eat!

219
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What's that?

220
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What's that?

221
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I can't see the rice.

222
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What's that?

223
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's hot.

224
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I got it.

225
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What's this?

226
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What's this?

227
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What's this?

228
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What's this?

229
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
There's rice.

230
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
There's rice.

231
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's hot.

232
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There's a hole.

233
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's eat this.

234
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Let's eat this.

235
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's eat this.

236
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We have to eat this.

237
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why are you trying to escape?

238
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Stand up properly.

239
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Here we go.

240
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This is the best.

241
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's eat this.

242
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Here we go.

243
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Here we go.

244
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It fell.

245
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I think I can't eat anymore.

246
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There's a dog.

247
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There's a dog.

248
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This is the main dish.

249
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's really good.

250
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't eat anymore.

251
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I can't eat anymore.

252
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I can't eat anymore.

253
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll give it a try.

254
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
There's rice inside.

255
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
There's rice inside.

256
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This is strange.

257
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I can't eat this.

258
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
How about 10,000 yen?

259
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No, we can't do that anymore, Nobu-san.

260
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We can't eat 10,000 yen.

261
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We can't do that at all.

262
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We can't eat that.

263
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There's nothing we can eat.

264
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's not true.

265
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's been going on for a while.

266
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
There's a part where we gave up.

267
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Let's eat more.

268
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Everyone is watching.

269
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We can't eat that.

270
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's see with our own eyes.

271
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The sushi.

272
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We can't eat that.

273
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We can't eat that.

274
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's take it for now.

275
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The prize money.

276
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What?

277
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The prize money?

278
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's the rule.

279
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
How about you, Kusuga-san?

280
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I don't have any.

281
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm scared.

282
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We can't eat that.

284
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We can't eat that.

285
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But I won today, right?

286
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We can eat that.

287
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Perfectly.

288
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's strange that you came suddenly.

289
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Other than that, there's nothing.

290
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
For now...

291
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Hey!

292
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Hey!

293
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
For now...

294
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Take a look at this.

295
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'll take it for now.

296
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Here.

297
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's a freebie.

298
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's strange.

299
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's a freebie.

300
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The prize money is a freebie.

301
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm doing it.

302
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What's that?

303
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's a ballpoint pen.

304
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm going to use a ballpoint pen next.

305
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's a gum demo.

306
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Is he stupid?

307
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You were doing it behind my back, right?

308
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Of course I was.

309
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I wore it.

310
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It hurts.

311
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It hurts.

312
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's strange.

313
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Why is that?

314
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I didn't do anything.

315
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I didn't do anything.

316
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What are you doing in front of me?

317
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What are you doing?

318
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm scared.

319
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hey!

320
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hey!

321
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Hey!

322
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Hey!

323
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Hey!

324
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Nao!

325
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Nao!

326
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Nao!

327
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Hey!

328
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Why don't you drive?

329
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
There was a driver.

330
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It was a team.

331
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
There was another one.

332
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Your wife was there the whole time, right?

333
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
She was there the whole time.

334
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't know.

335
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The staff will come, right?

336
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Are you serious?

337
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Are you a kid?

338
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Gaki no Tsuken wa Tanoshii

339
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Gaki no Tsuken wa Tanoshii

340
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Gaki Gaki kun Gaki Gaki kun Gaki Gaki kun Gaki Gaki

341
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Gari Gari kun

342
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hello.

343
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
How have you been?

344
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
How have you been?

345
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I've only been here for a week.

346
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I see.

347
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What happened?

348
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm from the North.

349
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What?

350
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I've never seen anything like that.

351
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Is that so?

352
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I've never seen anything like that, so I don't know if it's interesting.

353
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's strange.

354
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What is that?

355
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I hate that kind of thing.

356
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
When people get excited, it gets more and more...

357
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I have that kind of thing, too.

358
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I cried.

359
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You cried?

360
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What?

361
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You're the one who cried.

362
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're the one who cried.

363
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You're the one who cried.

364
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
To be honest, this time...

365
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It wasn't a big deal.

366
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's right.

367
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What do you mean by before this time?

368
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There's no way it was a big deal.

369
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
To be honest, before this time...

370
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You're the one who cried.

371
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
If I had to express it in 100%,

372
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I cried about 30% of the time.

373
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I cried.

374
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
To be honest.

375
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm laughing now, though.

376
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I know that.

377
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I know that.

378
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm not crying now.

379
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It was fine until last time, but this time I couldn't go in.

380
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What made you cry?

381
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What?

382
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What made you cry in that drama?

383
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What are you talking about?

384
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That kind of drama isn't funny.

385
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What made you cry in the main?

386
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What made you cry?

387
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Was it about your family?

388
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This isn't about my family.

389
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It was about your love for your family.

390
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What made you cry?

391
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Well...

392
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't know.

393
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Was it about your family?

394
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes, it was about my family.

395
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't know what's good about it.

396
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't know what's good about crying.

397
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
My favorite scene is...

398
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
when you take off your shoes.

399
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What do you mean by that?

400
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's a sad story.

401
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's a sad story.

402
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Really?

403
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Jun and I are wearing worn-out shoes.

404
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Goro bought them for us.

405
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Goro?

406
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Goro is a friend of mine.

407
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
He bought them for us.

408
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
We walked around in Hokkaido,

409
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
so they're worn-out.

410
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
They're already worn-out.

411
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
They're already worn-out?

412
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm asking because there are people who haven't seen them.

413
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What do you mean? They're worn-out.

414
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Come here!

415
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm Ishida Yami!

416
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What are you talking about?

417
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Pro-Radio Yokohama!

418
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Pro-Radio Yokohama cheated on me!

419
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What does Ishida Yami have to do with it?

420
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What?

421
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What does Ishida Yami have to do with it?

422
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Pro-Radio Yokohama?

423
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Pro-Radio Yokohama was a couple with an old man.

424
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Who was that old man?

425
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Kanaka Kuni!

426
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I had a son with a lot of hair.

427
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's a lot of hair.

428
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's Jun!

429
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Jun?

430
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He has a lot of hair.

431
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
His younger sister is an old woman.

432
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I can't help it.

433
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I can't help it.

434
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Who would have seen that?

435
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I saw it myself.

436
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I saw it myself. I don't have 30% of it.

437
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What are you talking about?

438
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's not it.

439
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That's right.

440
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Ishida Yami cheated on him.

441
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There was a man who cheated on him.

442
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Ishida Yami was dead.

443
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But because he was his mother, Jun and Hotaru came to Tokyo for a funeral.

444
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
They were all worn out shoes.

445
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
They were all worn out.

446
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Ishida Yami's husband,

447
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He was a free man.

448
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That old man said,

449
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You guys are wearing dirty shoes. Come here.

450
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He took me to the shoe shop and said,

451
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Choose any of them.

452
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
He asked me to buy the shoes.

453
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The shoes I bought from the old man.

454
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't need this.

455
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
He threw it away.

456
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He wore new shoes and came back.

457
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm curious about what happened to his shoes.

458
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We went to the shoe shop.

459
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Why can't I explain this?

460
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Buy the shoes.

461
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Do you like it?

462
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Don't talk like that in the dressing room.

463
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Tell me what you like.

464
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
We went to the shoe shop.

465
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The shoe shop was closed.

466
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I looked at the back of the shoe shop.

467
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
There was a lot of garbage.

468
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
There were a lot of cardboard boxes.

469
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I gave up.

470
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I thought it might be in the shoe shop.

471
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There was a lot of garbage.

472
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The police officer came.

473
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What are you guys doing?

474
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Don't you think this is the worst?

475
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's still going on.

476
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's still going on.

477
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Okay.

478
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm looking for a shoe.

479
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What is this shoe?

480
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I don't know what it means.

481
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I said something like this.

482
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The police officer said,

483
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Come here.

484
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Let's look for it together.

485
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I looked for it.

486
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I found it.

487
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I found it.

488
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I found it.

489
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No way.

490
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That's funny.

491
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I don't even remember the reaction.

492
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
When I was a kid, my friend was a dog lover.

493
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's rude.

494
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
When I was a kid, I was bitten by a dog.

495
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What kind of disease is it?

496
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
My pen name is Roro Choujin.

497
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I've been told a lot.

498
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's a scary disease.

499
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Really?

500
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Have you ever seen anyone who's been bitten?

501
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I've been bitten.

502
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I thought you'd say that.

503
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I've been bitten.

504
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
When I was a kid,

505
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I was bitten by a dog I had at school.

506
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Really?

507
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I was bitten hard.

508
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And?

509
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
At that time, I was injected with something.

510
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's like an infectious disease.

511
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Did you get a fever?

512
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
No, I didn't get that kind of name.

513
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What kind of disease is it?

514
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm fine on that day.

515
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm fine.

516
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I see.

517
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I can run a lot.

518
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I can play the flute a lot.

519
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I think it's just your imagination.

520
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You're playing the flute a lot.

521
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
No, I'm not.

522
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I've been bitten.

523
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I've been bitten, so I can run a lot.

524
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Matsumoto, you look good today.

525
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Do you have any pain?

526
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
No, I don't have any pain.

527
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
When I'm 50 meters away, I'm like this.

528
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You're so fast, Matsumoto.

529
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Why?

530
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,000
No, I don't have any pain.

531
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You're already playing the flute.

532
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What do you mean, you're already playing the flute?

533
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm playing the flute.

534
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's easy to understand.

535
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's a condition.

536
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You used to work as a part-time worker at a power plant factory.

537
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yes.

538
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What happens when you turn up the volume of the audio?

539
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Mr. Odeo Taro.

540
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Have you ever done that?

541
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
No, I haven't.

542
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
There you go.

543
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yes.

544
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's right.

545
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
In Japan, houses are crowded.

546
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That's right.

547
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's a nuisance, so we don't turn up the volume.

548
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That's right.

549
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But there's something about not doing it.

550
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Well, when you do it.

551
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Of course, I've done it before.

552
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What happens?

553
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:25,000
An old man comes out of the speaker.

554
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's scary.

555
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
An old man comes out of the R.

556
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
An old man in a T-shirt called R.

557
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Bang!

558
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Can you do it?

559
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What are you doing in there?

560
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm trying my best.

561
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm trying my best.

562
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I've come a long way, and I'm really frustrated.

563
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But the old man is holding out.

564
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But I'm still going to turn it up.

565
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Don't tell me to shut up!

566
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
What about this one?

567
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And the L comes out.

568
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Well, well, well, well, well.

569
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The L.

570
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Well, well, well, well, well, well.

571
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Stop it!

572
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Mr. Tenosu, you lose!

573
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Mr. Tenosu, you lose!

574
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But he's definitely setting it up on purpose.

575
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's better to wait for him.

576
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
On the contrary, it's scary.

577
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's like a detective investigation.

578
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's what it is.

579
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The two of them are talking about it.

580
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
In the end, you're back, right?

581
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'll be back in the end.

582
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But Tokitama is going to say something again.

583
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Are you just watching?

584
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Are you just watching?

585
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Are you just listening?

586
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
This time, I'm just listening.

587
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Bang!

588
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's scary.

589
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
From then on.

590
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You can just throw it away.

591
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Even if you're just listening, you're looking at it with your eyes closed.

592
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's close to you, so you can see it well.

593
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You can't see it if you keep your eyes closed.

594
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's a loss if you keep your eyes closed.

595
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's a loss if you keep your eyes closed.

596
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You're looking at it with your eyes wide open.

597
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I pulled it out once.

598
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The cord.

599
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
From the stereo.

600
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
From the main body.

601
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And then...

602
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It was really scary.

603
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
How old are you?

604
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You don't have to do it like that.

605
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's a little bigger than the speaker.

606
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's funny.

607
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It comes out like this.

608
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The shoulder width is amazing.

609
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's almost a right angle.

610
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's a little bigger than the speaker.

611
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I don't want you to do that.

612
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Please be careful.

613
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Your stereo is big, isn't it?

614
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's not big.

615
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
The speaker is big and the old man is big.

616
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Is it on the speaker?

617
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Of course.

618
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's a really big speaker.

619
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You don't have to do it like that.

620
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The old man is listening to the CD like this.

621
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Did you know?

622
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I don't know.

623
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You don't know.

624
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
The old man is a fool.

625
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
What do you listen to?

626
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Mischel?

627
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Let's listen to Mischel.

628
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
When I listen to Mischel, I look at it.

629
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I think it's Mischel.

630
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Can I listen to Mischel here?

631
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:15,000
If you do that, I won't forgive you.
