1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Wato Wato-kun.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yes.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Wato Wato-kun.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yes.

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Where's the camera?

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Why aren't you outside today?

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
No, this isn't outside.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, where?

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This is a set.

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Are you kidding me?

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Do you have such a funny set?

12
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I told you last week that I didn't want to shoot.

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Nittere made a set for me.

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But today, after a long time, I feel like I'm back in the city.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's right.

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Do you call it an adult town?

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Aoyama.

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
How old are you?

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
16.

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Are you a first-year high school student?

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Are you going home?

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Are you going home?

23
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's already 1 o'clock 40 minutes.

24
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's right.

25
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
At this time of the day, why are you so excited?

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sad.

27
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is the venue for today's Gaki no Chikai Arahen.

28
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Instant Ramen Paradise.

29
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you enter here, it's free, right?

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Free.

31
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But it's free.

32
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If you can eat ramen for free, not all people come.

33
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Today's venue is...

34
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Here.

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It wasn't here before.

36
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's an event where you can eat instant ramen for free.

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's why the stage is like an instant ramen.

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's delicious.

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not very good.

40
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Did you prepare this chair?

41
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I think so.

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No, it's a waste.

43
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What is this? I can't see it in a place like this.

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Today is a little different from before.

45
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This is amazing.

46
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's different from before, right?

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's different, isn't it?

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You can see it.

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
At this stage, let's do a story.

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's do a story that suits this kind of place.

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Something you can enjoy.

52
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's right.

53
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm looking forward to tonight's Gaki no Chikai Arahen.

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thank you.

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This program is produced by Soyo.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oyama International Products.

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Provided by Soyo.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Good evening, everyone.

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Good evening.

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Today, with everyone...

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No, it's not like this, is it?

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'd like to learn about the intonation of words.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
In Kansai and Kanto, there are many places where the intonation is different.

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Today, let's learn about those places with everyone.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Please welcome the researcher of intonation, Mr. Matsumoto.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Mr. Matsumoto, nice to meet you.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Today's intonation is to play with lines.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hey, you.

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What is it?

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm telling you to study, but you're telling me to play.

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Let's play with lines.

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Everyone, together.

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let's play with lines.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm a little tired.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let's play with lines.

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm ignoring you.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's play with lines.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm telling you to study.

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I can't continue.

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's play with lines.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Say it out loud.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Let's play with lines.

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're annoying.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I can't continue.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's play with lines.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's play with lines.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
There are many kinds of lines.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There are many differences depending on the lines.

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
For example...

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You're a dirty person.

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're such a dirty person.

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is me, Mr. Lupin.

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is a normal line.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This is me, Mr. Lupin.

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is me, Mr. Lupin.

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It doesn't feel like Lupin at all.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's right.

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It changes a lot by changing the lines.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is me, Mr. Lupin.

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If you say it like this...

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's the way you say it now.

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's do it again.

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is me, Mr. Lupin.

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is how you make it look like Lupin.

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is the line of Lupin.

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is the line of Lupin.

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I see.

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's move on to the next step.

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't want to learn it.

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's a little hard to understand.

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's move on to the next step.

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The lines are all different.

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What is this?

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This is me, Mr. Lupin.

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This is me, Mr. Lupin.

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is a normal line.

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This is me, Mr. Lupin.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It doesn't feel like Mr. Lupin at all.

120
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It depends on how you say it.

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
By adding a line to this...

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is me, Mr. Lupin.

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This is me, Mr. Lupin.

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I think the audience around here will remember this.

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I've been thinking it's strange since I came out.

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I've never seen anyone who looks like this.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I've never seen anyone who looks like this.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's strange, isn't it?

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The group is different, isn't it?

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's strange, isn't it?

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Everyone here looks like this.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Who does this?

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I think the audience here is nice.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I think the audience here is funny.

135
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't say unnecessary things.

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Please.

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What are you doing?

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You're not good.

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
If you get angry, I'll kick you.

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's leave the previous ones aside.

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Next, let's separate Tokyo and Osaka by a line.

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's show the difference between Tokyo and Osaka.

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'd like to hear that.

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
For example, it's better to write it in hiragana.

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Should I write it?

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
There's a word like that.

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If a person from Osaka says this,

148
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If a person from Tokyo says this,

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hamachan.

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
If it's Osaka, it's Hamachan.

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There's a difference.

152
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
If it's France, it's Hamachan.

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's a line like this.

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I gave you a little ad-lib, but it's still heavy.

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's the end of the story for now.

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Let's do our best to liven up this place with free talk.

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If you don't like it, just grab it.

158
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Why are you laughing?

159
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're Japanese, aren't you?

160
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's right.

161
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No matter where you look, you're Japanese.

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
If you don't understand the language, you can't help it.

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
There are no foreigners.

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's all right.

165
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We're going to play with the line today.

166
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Thank you very much.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's been 10 minutes.

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, it's been 10 minutes.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's right.

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It was so much fun today.

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't know why some people are so uncooperative.

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Some people?

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That's why.

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Today, we have an invitation and a letter request.

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They're not completely mixed up.

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh, really?

177
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I think so.

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This person wants to see the letter, right?

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's right.

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And this person doesn't have much time to see it.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They're so into it.

182
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It can't be helped.

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I think it was a lot of fun today.

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I wasn't feeling well today.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can't run away like that.

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Why are you not feeling well?

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm really tired today.

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I played baseball yesterday.

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's right.

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I was playing baseball with the Yume de Aetara team.

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I moved my body for the first time in a while.

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's right.

193
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
My body got a little tired today.

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I was too excited yesterday.

195
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What are you talking about?

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I haven't played baseball for a long time.

197
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I haven't played at all.

198
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I stopped playing baseball after I broke my shoulder in college.

199
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Tell me about your final grade.

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
High school.

201
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I did my best.

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But you must have felt good.

203
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I played baseball at the Seibu stadium.

204
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It was a beautiful place.

205
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
How about playing baseball once in a while?

206
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But I'm pretty good at baseball, right?

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
After I finished playing baseball, I was listening to the radio on the bus.

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I was excited because my name was on the radio.

209
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What are you talking about?

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm sure the Seibu players were watching me somewhere.

211
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Seibu players were watching you?

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The draft was just getting started.

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But the Seibu players were practicing and watching me from behind.

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Practicing?

215
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I was really excited.

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I didn't think I was going to win first place.

217
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But after that, I think I won about 5th place.

218
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Who told you that?

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I've been studying and playing sports since I was a student.

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's strange.

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm the ideal person for Japanese people.

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
When I was studying, your high school was a mess.

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What?

224
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
During class, you were cleaning the cigarette butts between the desks.

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's right.

226
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's unusual for a teacher to throw away the cigarette butts like this.

227
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You had a big head like this.

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And you were wearing a small skirt.

229
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But your IQ was really high.

230
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Really.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What?

232
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You were really good.

233
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What?

234
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I could study better than you.

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And you didn't even know the numbers.

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
If you say that...

237
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I was really surprised.

238
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I couldn't say anything.

239
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I couldn't even tell the difference between the numbers.

240
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And then...

241
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I played baseball yesterday.

242
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Are you serious?

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Everyone who watches TV looks like this.

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But I'm a kanji teacher.

245
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Wait, I haven't let you go yet.

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll let you go after you play a little bit of baseball.

247
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Bring me a whiteboard.

248
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Even if you know the numbers, it's useless for the society.

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What?

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You're more useful to the society if you know the kanji.

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Of course it's useful.

252
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The numbers are the most important thing.

253
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You're like that.

254
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What?

255
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You're like that.

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You're like that.

257
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What?

258
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You studied on a comedy show.

259
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Isn't that funny?

260
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What?

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You don't have to think about it.

262
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If you don't think about it, I'll go next time.

263
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If you don't think about it, I'll go next time.

264
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What?

265
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You're like that.

266
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Two-thirds...

267
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
One-half...

268
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What year were you in elementary school?

269
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You're like that.

270
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Everyone here can't do it.

271
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You're like that.

272
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Anyone can't do it.

273
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't know.

274
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
If you pull it up and try, you might not be able to do it.

275
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Try it.

276
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
This is...

277
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This is serious.

278
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Right?

279
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
This is...

280
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes.

281
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It doesn't stand up.

282
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What?

283
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's wrong.

284
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What?

285
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This is...

286
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yes.

287
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You can't write it.

288
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This is wrong.

289
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You can't erase it.

290
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Two-thirds...

291
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
If I were your mother, I'd make tea for you.

292
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
In front of the door.

293
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Masato Shinkajan!

294
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Your mother is studying.

295
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This is...

297
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What do you call this?

298
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Three.

299
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So what do you call this in the case of two-thirds?

300
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Two-thirds.

301
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's two-thirds.

302
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes, two-thirds.

303
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This is called two-thirds.

304
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What is this?

305
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's called two-thirds.

306
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's right.

307
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Right?

308
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
This is two-thirds.

309
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What's with the big ear?

310
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's two-thirds.

311
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Right?

312
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You have to match this and this.

313
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Why?

314
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
This and this have nothing to do with each other.

315
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Right?

316
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
This and this have nothing to do with each other.

317
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That's right.

318
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm going to be stupid, aren't I?

319
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Are you stupid?

320
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'll teach you next time.

321
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Masato!

322
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I know this.

323
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He can't write it.

324
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll admit it.

325
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I wrote a lot of haji in Osaka.

326
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll teach you next time.

327
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The elementary school students who are watching this are encouraged.

328
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Really.

329
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
How do you read this?

330
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What?

331
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
How do you read this?

332
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Kasuga no Tsubone.

333
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's right.

334
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's right.

335
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
How do you read this?

336
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What?

337
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I know a lot of difficult kanji.

338
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
How do you read this?

339
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Beautiful Tsubone.

340
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Why is it Tsubone?

341
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Don't you hate Tsubone?

342
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You don't know, do you?

343
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What?

344
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What?

345
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes.

346
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Tsutsumotase.

347
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's right.

348
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's Tsutsumotase.

349
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll write the kanji that everyone says.

350
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'll write it.

351
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'll write Saba.

352
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Saba.

353
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Saba.

354
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Do you want to write Saba?

355
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Saba-kun.

356
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Please sign it.

357
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Saba-kun.

358
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Saba.

359
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Please sign it.

360
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I just got a bit excited.

361
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Who do you want to meet at the fish market?

362
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I was going to write it now.

363
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I was going to write it, but he said he wanted to meet.

364
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Is that so?

365
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes.

366
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Say anything.

367
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I can write anything.

368
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What?

369
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Katsuo.

370
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Katsuo.

371
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Katsuo.

372
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Katsuo.

373
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Katsuo.

374
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Katsuo?

375
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yes.

376
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What?

377
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What?

378
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What is this?

379
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't know what Katsuo is.

380
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I can't do it with you.

381
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Let's go with the letter.

382
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll bring the letter.

383
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I've received a lot of letters.

384
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'd like to introduce them.

385
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Let's go with this one.

386
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I found a picture of Machan and Hama-chan in Harajuku.

387
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Really?

388
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That picture was taken a long time ago.

389
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Hama-chan's hair was a bit long and he didn't have much hair.

390
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Machan's beard was long and one of his lower teeth was missing.

391
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What kind of person are you?

392
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
They look like they're having a hard time.

393
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I wonder when this picture was taken.

394
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
We're having a hard time.

395
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Really?

396
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I've never lost a tooth.

397
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This tooth is a bit deep.

398
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Sometimes it looks like that.

399
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I can only see the lower teeth.

400
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's right.

401
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I can only see the upper teeth.

402
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Right?

403
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes.

404
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Is it deep?

405
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's deep.

406
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Why can't you see the upper teeth?

407
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I can't see them.

408
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Why can't you see them?

409
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I can't see them when my mother is looking at me.

410
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Why?

411
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I can see the lower teeth when I'm talking normally.

412
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Why can't I see them?

413
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Try to open your mouth.

414
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Open your mouth.

415
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Even if you open your mouth, you can only see the lower teeth.

416
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I can only see the upper teeth.

417
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What are you going to do?

418
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I can only see the upper teeth when I'm talking normally.

419
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
If you do that, everyone will be worried.

420
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
My fans will be gone.

421
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What if you can only see the upper teeth?

422
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I can't see them.

423
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I can only see the upper teeth when I'm talking normally.

424
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I've been talking like this from the beginning.

425
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'll keep talking like this until today.

426
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Even if I don't say anything, I can see the upper teeth.

427
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I can only see the upper teeth when I'm talking normally.

428
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I can only see the upper teeth when I'm talking normally.

429
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'll keep talking like this until today.

430
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'll keep talking like this until today.

431
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll go home now.

432
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm not a lover.

433
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm a fan of Uchan Nan-chan.

434
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Maybe.

435
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Or B.

436
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You're laughing, but your voice isn't coming out properly.

437
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You're funny.

438
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You're laughing like a gentleman.

439
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm laughing like this.

440
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Who do you like? Tell me.

441
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Who?

442
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Who do you like?

443
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Hama-chan.

444
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I like her.

445
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What?

446
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You're a proper customer.

447
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'll stop the button properly.

448
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I see.

449
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What is it?

450
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
They're people.

451
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You should have told me earlier.

452
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's all.

453
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's all for today.

454
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
We went to many places again.

455
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
We did, didn't we?

456
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
We haven't finished talking yet.

457
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
We did, didn't we?

458
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
When we're done, let's have a drink.

459
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
When we're done.

460
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
We did, didn't we?

461
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
We slept for a month.

462
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
No one laughed.

463
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
When I thought we'd finally laugh,

464
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I called a champion and kicked him.

465
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
A boy champion.

466
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's why some people want to go home.

467
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That's all for today.

468
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What are you talking about?

469
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It starts at 1.40.

470
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a 30-minute program.

471
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's 2 minutes to 30 minutes.

472
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
There's no commercial today.

473
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We have to hurry up.

474
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That's right.

475
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What?

476
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What?

477
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What are you talking about?

478
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's fine.

479
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's fine.

480
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's not funny.

481
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That's all for today.

482
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That's all for today.

483
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's all for tonight.

484
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That's all for tonight.

485
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That's all for tonight.

486
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
See you next time.

487
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
See you next time.

488
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Hello.

489
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What is it?

490
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's over.

491
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's over.

492
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
We're sitting in the audience's seat.

493
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's right.

494
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
We're sitting in the second seat in front of the stage.

495
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Looking from this position,

496
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's a funny story.

497
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And until we go on stage today,

498
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
We're tired from traveling.

499
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's the best.

500
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Long-term location.

501
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
A long-term location.

502
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
In the cold.

503
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
For a long time.

504
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's like a recital.

505
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
A grand location.

506
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
If you're coming to see us,

507
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
He's someone in the fan-ranking.

508
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You pick him up in a group.

509
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
He's something like ałem for the company company.

510
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
He lives life for the people he's然後

511
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I can think of a lot of people who work hard for him.

512
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
He works for us.

513
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I worked hard for the potential sub.

514
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The off-site sub.

515
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I worked hard for the potential sub.

516
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I don't have it next time.

517
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'll be clear.

518
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I can't use it anymore from next week.

519
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
If the title comes out all at once,

520
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Let's get into the story.

521
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Oh, really?

522
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Oh, it's okay.

523
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I told Saito-chan.

524
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Saito-chan, you like the outside, right?

525
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Oh, really?

526
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I told him.

527
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I told Nozawa and Hyoudo to film you.

528
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So, that's it for today.

529
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Thank you very much.

530
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Thank you very much.
