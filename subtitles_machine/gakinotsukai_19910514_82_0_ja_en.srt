1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's play dodge ball.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I see.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Before that, let's play dodge ball.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This rule is difficult.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
For example, when you cross this line,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Cover me, cover me, cover me, cover me.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Cover me.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
While holding your breath.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's play dodge ball.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
With our team.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
With Garakuta.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
With Garakuta and Ponkrat.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Today is a great day.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Look at the camera.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Who are these people?

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
They are the handball team of Sanyo Shokai.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh.

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
They are here.

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I heard it earlier.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes.

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
They throw the ball, right?

25
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes.

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
They are supposed to hop.

27
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Do you call it hop?

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh, here it comes.

29
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Will it hit?

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes.

31
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is a little...

32
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But I don't want you to go out because it's a TV show.

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll do my best.

34
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll do my best.

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But I want to say one thing.

36
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We are stars.

37
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's all I want to say.

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
As you said earlier,

39
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Rule.

40
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We need a referee.

41
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes.

42
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The referee of the Japanese Dodgeball Association.

43
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Mr. Tomioka will do it.

44
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Please.

45
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You don't look like our referee.

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm worried about Mr. Tomioka.

47
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How many people will go out?

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
How many?

49
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
How many people will go out?

50
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Four people.

51
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Four people.

52
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Then I'll go out with four people.

53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes.

54
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Then I'll go out with four people.

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You are the one who will go out first.

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Four people.

57
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Four people.

58
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't know who will go out first.

59
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But I want to do it with a 10-year combination.

60
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's the same no matter what you do.

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm always with you at home.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
OK.

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
OK.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No problem.

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
OK, OK.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
simplesmente

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
бо

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
possibility

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
OK.

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's the rule.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's OK.

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
OK.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
finding

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's OK.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Ouch!

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ouch!

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm scared.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Ouch!

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm scared.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm scared.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm scared.

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm scared.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's hard to take.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Look at the side.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm scared.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm scared.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm scared.

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm scared.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What is this?

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm scared.

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm scared.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm scared.

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm scared.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
7 to 0.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Team Sanyo wins.

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Team Sanyo wins.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Team Sanyo wins.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's noisy.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's noisy.

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Are you all doing well?

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We're doing well on time.

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Really?

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We're doing well on time.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
On time?

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's right.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Why?

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Because we have a lot of days off.

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We don't get angry as much as Golden Week.

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's right.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's really annoying.

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We work until the morning when people are off.

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's right.

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What?

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's right.

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We don't have a day off that's so hard.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We don't.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Right?

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Even if we do, we get told off.

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We get told off and we're in a bad condition.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's right.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And we end up sleeping at home.

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We get a day off and when we wake up we have a lot of things to fold.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why?

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's like that.

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's like that.

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're so mean.

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's like that.

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll say this in my head.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We've decided.

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What?

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Which ball?

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We've decided which ball.

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
On Saturday the 18th.

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes.

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We'll do it at Yomiuri Land.

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yomiuri Land.

138
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We'll do it at Yomiuri Land on the second round.

139
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We'll do it.

140
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So everyone, we'll do it at Bulma.

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The girls will do it at Bulma.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes.

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The order of the first and the second is important.

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's not important at all.

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's not important at all.

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What is it?

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's the order of the first and the second.

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So we'll do it in the order of the first and the second?

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes.

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So we'll do it for the first 500 people.

151
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't know if we'll cut this part out, but please bring a lot of money.

152
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't understand.

153
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You know, last year in September or October I went to Okinawa.

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
As a child.

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes.

156
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's almost the 100th anniversary.

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes.

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's not the time to celebrate the 100th anniversary.

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So I thought I'd go overseas with everyone.

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The fee?

161
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It will cost a little.

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Well, if 1000 people come.

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I won't ask you to come.

164
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It can't be helped if you drop your wallet.

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's right.

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It can't be helped.

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If you don't write your name on it, you can't keep it.

168
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So let's go to Hawaii.

169
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You can go with everyone to Hawaii.

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's good.

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Let's go on a tour.

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's take everyone.

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Let's go on a tour.

174
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You don't have to go on tours.

175
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't say only you.

176
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You must go to your girlfriend.

177
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll go on a tour with Saigo Hideki.

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll go on a tour with Saigo Hideki.

179
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We'll go to the airport and have a dinner show.

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We'll go home and have a great time.

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I hate those tours.

182
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We are always the same.

183
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Always the same.

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Hey, you...

185
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What is it?

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What are you thinking about?

187
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What is it?

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We are always the same. How much are we the same?

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We are always the same when we go somewhere.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You take me with you to a lot of places.

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I always hear this, but the people who come today...

192
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
They are usually...

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
One more thing.

194
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why do you treat them like this?

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't trust them at all.

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Really?

197
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But you always tell them to treat you better.

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You tell them to treat you with a warm heart.

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I have a warm personality.

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So I treat them warmly.

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But they only treat 30 people.

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What kind of fans are they?

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's right.

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
For example, the girl with glasses.

205
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
If she dies, will she cry?

206
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Why does she have to cry?

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Right?

208
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's terrible!

209
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Right?

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
She won't cry?

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What about you?

212
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I won't cry.

213
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's right.

214
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Why does she have to cry when she's dead?

215
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But I don't hate her.

216
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't hate her.

217
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's why I was shocked when I was the president.

218
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What's wrong with you?

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Why are you laughing?

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You don't have to be serious about it.

221
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I did feel sad when she died.

222
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Really?

223
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I did feel sad.

224
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But it doesn't matter if you turn blue.

225
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I was the president about half a year ago.

226
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What do you call it?

227
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's called a pacemaker.

228
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I had a machine in my heart.

229
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I was like, I'm moving with a machine.

230
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What are you talking about?

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I touched it and there was a machine in my heart.

232
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's right.

233
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
At that time, she had a weak memory.

234
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's right.

235
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You can't do it all at once.

236
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Does a pacemaker have such a strong effect?

237
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes, it does.

238
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
After that, the president's movements suddenly changed.

239
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's true.

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He was walking like this because he was so strong.

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He?

242
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He?

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He?

244
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He?

245
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He?

246
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's okay.

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's okay.

248
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Be careful.

249
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But it's different.

250
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What is it?

251
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I said it earlier.

252
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What is it?

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I think you'll like it if you press something.

254
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll definitely do it.

255
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The other day, I said something in the program.

256
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
When I was doing this to the girl in front of me,

257
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I fell down trying to rub my face.

258
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The other day, I was doing make-up for Fuji TV.

259
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
A girl in make-up came up to me.

260
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Matsumoto-san, that's terrible.

261
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You dropped the girl in make-up, didn't you?

262
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Why do you think so?

263
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Do you want me to rub my face?

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I've never rubbed my face.

265
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You've been lying all day.

266
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You've rubbed your face so many times.

267
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I've never rubbed my face.

268
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I've never rubbed my face.

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I've rubbed my face three times in a row.

270
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I've rubbed my face in the changing room.

271
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I've rubbed my face in the bathroom.

272
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's been a long time.

273
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What?

274
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What?

275
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What did you do yesterday?

276
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I was at home.

277
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You had a day off yesterday.

278
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yes.

279
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What did you do yesterday?

280
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I was at home.

281
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What did you do?

282
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What?

283
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What did you do?

284
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I was playing outside.

285
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What did you do?

286
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I was playing.

287
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
With whom?

288
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What?

289
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
With whom?

290
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
With whom?

291
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
With a friend.

292
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What?

293
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
With a friend.

294
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
A friend with long hair?

295
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I think so.

296
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Do you have short hair?

297
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
No.

298
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Do you have short hair?

299
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
No.

300
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Do you have a skirt?

301
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't have a skirt.

302
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What?

303
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
A pants?

304
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yes.

305
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I can't see anyone around me when I walk.

306
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's not good.

307
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Well, I can see you.

308
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You look good.

309
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We are not a man.

310
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What?

311
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We are not a man.

312
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't care.

313
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't care.

314
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
How long did you stay?

315
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
About an hour?

316
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No, 2 or 3 hours.

317
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You stayed that long?

318
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's daytime!

319
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You stayed in the park for 2 or 3 hours?

320
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes.

321
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What did you do in the park for 3 hours?

322
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I played badminton.

323
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And?

324
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I played badminton.

325
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And?

326
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I played badminton.

327
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You played badminton?

328
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You are not a man.

329
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Everyone thinks so.

330
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We are both men.

331
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Why don't you understand?

332
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You don't like to move your body outside.

333
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Why do you go out with a man?

334
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Why do you go out with a man?

335
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's because you are a woman.

336
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You played baseball?

337
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Where did you throw it?

338
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You said, Hii-kun, sorry.

339
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You said, the wind is strong.

340
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You said, the wind is strong.

341
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I call you Hii-kun.

342
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What do you call me?

343
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't like it.

344
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Why is your face red?

345
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't like it.

346
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Your face is red.

347
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I was silent until now.

348
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Actually, I am a bright man.

349
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You stayed that long?

350
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes.

351
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You stayed in the park for 2 or 3 hours?

352
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes.

353
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You are from Awamori in Akita?

354
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes.

355
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What do you mean?

356
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Is your father the leader of the circus?

357
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What's going on?

358
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I am not the leader.

359
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You are not the reason of death.

360
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't make promises.

361
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Thank you very much.

362
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Thank you very much.

363
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
There may be such a thing.

364
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
He is a man with a knack.

365
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
A knack?

366
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
A knack?

367
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Wait a minute.

368
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What is a knack?

369
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It is clear in this program.

370
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What is it?

371
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
We can make mistakes.

372
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Don't take advantage of others.

373
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I can't say that.

374
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Let's stop it.

375
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's a habit.

376
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Even if you watch TV,

377
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
even if the announcer bites you,

378
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
even if the announcer says,

379
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
this is Kenpatesu,

380
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
you can't say that.

381
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Even if you watch TV,

382
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
you can't say that.

383
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You can't say that.

384
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You can't say that.

385
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You can't say that.

386
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Let's stop it.

387
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay.

388
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Let's stop it.

389
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Hello, everyone.

390
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
There was a program called Best Ten,

391
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
which I don't want to use as a commercial.

392
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
There was a downtown in 9th place.

393
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I think so.

394
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
This is what I heard

395
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
from the head of the advertising department

396
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
of a big company, 350 companies.

397
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's a solid data.

398
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There are only good companies, right?

399
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's right.

400
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't want to be in a commercial.

401
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's a lie to make a delicious

402
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
sweets that are not delicious.

403
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's a lie to make a delicious sweets that are not delicious.

404
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But this is the case.

405
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's right.

406
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This is...

407
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
This is the problem.

408
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm sad, so I won't say it.

409
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm wearing it.

410
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm wearing it.

411
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm wearing it,

412
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
but it's really bad.

413
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's right.

414
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't know what I heard.

415
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's a destroyer's commercial in Kagoshima.

416
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I don't know what kind of route

417
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I came on.

418
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What's sad?

419
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's a destroyer's commercial.

420
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I don't say it's a car,

421
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
a cigarette, or a whiskey.

422
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Destroyer's commercial...

423
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What are you going to do with that?

424
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Namu...

425
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm sure you're going to do something in front of Takahashi.

426
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But I'll say it little by little.

427
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
There's a song I've heard.

428
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
There's a song I've heard.

429
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's a trouble.

430
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Especially the food.

431
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Where do you choose?

432
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's the mouth.

433
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Really?

434
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
If you go from there,

435
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
the problem is...

436
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Why?

437
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
This weirdo mouth

438
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
is destroying everything.

439
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's eating our dreams.

440
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's eating our dreams.

441
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
This weirdo mouth

442
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
is eating our characters.

443
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You are bad.

444
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I've had this mouth for 27 years.

445
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's not weird.

446
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Sometimes,

447
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I think,

448
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
what?

449
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That's not good.

450
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That's why the food is bad.

451
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That's not true.

452
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The food is bad.

453
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's not true.

454
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You are bad.

455
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm not bad.

456
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm not bad.

457
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You are purple, too.

458
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You are purple, too.

459
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You are purple, too.

460
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You are purple, too.

461
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You are purple, too.

462
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You are purple, too.

463
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You are purple, too.

464
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You are purple, too.

465
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You are purple, too.

466
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You are purple, too.

467
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You are purple, too.

468
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You are purple, too.

469
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I hear the mouth.

470
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Your mouth...

471
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And you are purple.

472
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It has an old feeling.

473
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Go home.

474
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I heard too.

475
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
He jumped out of the car and was about to go home.

476
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He went into the book and stopped it.

477
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He said, I'm going home.

478
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
He wouldn't have done that.

479
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You said you were going to go home.

480
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Did I say I was going home?

481
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You said you were going to go home in an hour.

482
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I didn't say that.

483
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
If I said that, I wouldn't be in the commercial.

484
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll admit one thing.

485
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
When I did the commercial for Honda's Dio.

486
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That was the only time I complained.

487
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
There was a Honda's Dio.

488
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It was a motorcycle.

489
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
He said,

490
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Can you speak a little louder?

491
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
He said,

492
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Honda's Dio!

493
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
He said,

494
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Can you speak a little louder?

495
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
He said,

496
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Honda's Dio!

497
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
He said,

498
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Can you speak a little louder?

499
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
He said,

500
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Which one is it?

501
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
He said,

502
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Everyone was surprised.

503
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He said,

504
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The person who brought the tea was surprised.

505
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
He said,

506
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The tea was good.

507
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I said,

508
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
He said he was sorry at the time.

509
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I said,

510
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Can you speak a little louder?

511
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
He said,

512
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Can you speak a little louder?

513
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He said,

514
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
He wouldn't come.

515
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I said,

516
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
He came for his voice.

517
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
He said that again.

518
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What did your mother say?

519
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's my birthday.

520
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's your birthday.

521
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, it's the 53rd.

522
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What are you doing?

523
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Today, you...

524
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Ucchan said he was going somewhere, so you said you were going to Omiyage High School, right?

525
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And Ucchan came to see you today, right?

526
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That's what you did in the rehearsal for Shikufuji TV, right?

527
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't know!

528
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Really? You forgot?

529
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Did you bring it?

530
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I brought it!

531
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You came here and left it here, and you said,

532
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Good work!

533
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
This box is for Ucchan.

534
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
No, this is...

535
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
This is my fault.

536
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Ucchan watches this every week, so I'm sorry.

537
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Why do I...

538
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Why do I have to go through that place, too?

539
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Which one?

540
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And finally, the location of the dodgeball tournament has been decided.

541
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's right.

542
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
On Saturday, May 18th,

543
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Come to the second round of Yomiuri Land at 11 a.m.

544
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The reception will begin at 11 a.m.

545
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And on the second round,

546
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The match team and the Hama-chan team will be received.

547
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You can choose which team you want to do it with.

548
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That's how it works.

549
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Everyone wears a burma.

550
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Come to the second round of Yomiuri Land

551
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
on Saturday, May 18th at 11 a.m.

552
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes.

553
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
We'll prepare the Hachimaki.

554
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
1000 Hachimaki, so it's 8000.

555
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
No, no, no.

556
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And...

557
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The assistant.

558
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
The postcard.

559
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
We're recruiting.

560
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The address is the same for all of them.

561
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
At this place.

562
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
At this place.

563
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
No, no, no.

564
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The postcard is...
