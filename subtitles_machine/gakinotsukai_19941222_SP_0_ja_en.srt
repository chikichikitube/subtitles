1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, I guess it will fly.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It's a strong tree.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Well, it's a celebration of the 5th anniversary.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Many famous people have sent us flowers.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Thank you very much.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I also received it from overseas.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
From Michael Jackson.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I also received it from Starono.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It says Starono over there.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, it's nostalgic.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Maybe his face is young.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, yes, yes.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's been 5 years since the 5th anniversary.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's start from the age of 20.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's take a look at this.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, I heard it the day before yesterday.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Is that so?

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hey, watching the Golden program,

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It was decided the day before yesterday.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's what it was like.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's what it is.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In the world of TV.

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
When the world of TV is decided, it will be decided quickly.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Do you edit it like this?

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Do you edit it like this?

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The history of Japanese entertainment history.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The first page started with this kind of talk.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But Kohaku was amazing.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I wonder which one won.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What?

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
People who watch TV know.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's bet.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What?

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let's bet.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Which one won?

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll go first.

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Red wins.

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm white.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah.

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If I lose,

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll be like this behind the zoom-in in the morning.

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll be dressed like this.

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I don't think it's funny.

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You're that.

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's a little different song.

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's a little different song.

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's a little different song.

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's a refreshing morning.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Good morning.

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Good morning.

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's Wednesday, January 17th.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The first thing in the morning is to go to Shizuoka.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Zoom-in.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The number of people who went to Shizuoka is 146, and 154 people were injured.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It looks like a strange person is coming from the morning.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It seems that you will be able to fly to the scene somehow by wrapping the anti-fog material around the runway.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I feel like it's going to work well.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I think I can fly today.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
However, if you go into the shade, it will slip, so I would like you to be careful.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let's zoom in on the smile of the Nippon Red Orchestra.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm a sharp-tongued person, and I can return anything with vinegar.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Watermelon.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Crab.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Watermelon.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Shiasu.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yuta.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The Shiasu I mentioned earlier is the Shiasu of the day before yesterday.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It doesn't matter.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm going to lose.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm going to lose.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm going to lose.

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The end.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Wait a minute.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't eat it.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It hurts.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's noisy.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It hurts.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's noisy.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's noisy.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's noisy.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's noisy.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's noisy.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's noisy.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's noisy.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
First of all.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
daÃ­

90
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,300
for

91
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,660
40 always

92
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,460
Gaki no Tsukai

93
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,460
Well uh

94
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,160
Rlook

95
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,160
voodoo

96
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,260
All the stars of the world ranked Eric

97
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,260
I'm going to Paris.

98
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,260
What about you?

99
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,260
I'm going to Paris.

100
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,260
Yeah, right.

101
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,260
Don't just stand there.

102
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,260
Hey!

103
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,260
Give me a double.

104
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,260
This is it!

105
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,260
I'm ready.

106
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,260
Let's go.

107
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,260
What?

108
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,260
It's 3500rpm now.

109
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,260
3500rpm.

110
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:52,260
It's almost there.

111
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,260
Can they land safely with both feet?

112
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,260
The landing is the problem.

113
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,260
It's raining!

114
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,260
I can't express it in words.

115
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,260
Thank you very much.

116
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,260
You're welcome.

117
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,260
Thank you very much.

118
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,260
Thank you very much.

119
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,260
Thank you very much.

120
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,260
Thank you very much.

121
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,260
Please come again.

122
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,260
I'm very moved.

123
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:37,260
Thank you very much.

124
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,260
Did you see that?

125
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,260
Hmm?

126
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,260
Never mind.

127
00:07:44,260 --> 00:08:05,500
playing

128
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Hello, hello, hello.

129
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Hello.

130
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Are you Sanyo-san?

131
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Come in.

132
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
If I open it, the real Sanyo-san is inside.

133
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
You idiot.

134
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
I'm going to say something stupid.

135
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Come back.

136
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
It's okay. I'm still doing it.

137
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Who did this when you first did Sanyo-san's makeup?

138
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Welcome.

140
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,500
I love the beat.

141
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
I love the beat.

142
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Welcome.

144
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Welcome.

145
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Let's start the game.

146
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
He throws the ball.

147
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
He throws the ball.

148
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
He throws the ball.

149
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
He throws the ball.

150
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
He throws the ball.

151
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
He throws the ball.

152
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
There are brave men.

153
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Look over there.

154
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
They are just idiots.

155
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Look at that rough wave.

156
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,500
From now on, you will go to that rough wave.

157
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Okay?

158
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Let's go.

159
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Let's go.

160
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
My body hurts.

163
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
My body hurts.

164
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
I'm scared.

165
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
I'm scared.

166
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Bring it.

167
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Bring it.

168
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Bring it.

169
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
What are you doing?

170
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
What are you doing?

171
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Bring it.

172
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Bring it.

173
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Don't lose to that rotten Hamada.

178
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
The game has started.

179
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Nagachoba has 30 minutes.

180
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
He passes the ball.

181
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Look at this.

182
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Go, Hamada.

183
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Go, Hamada.

184
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Go, Hamada.

185
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Go, Hamada.

186
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:23,500
Go, Hamada.

187
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
I can't take it anymore.

188
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:43,500
It's 40 meters.

189
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,500
It's so high.

190
00:12:49,500 --> 00:13:11,500
I'm scared.

191
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:35,500
I'm scared.

192
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:41,500
I'm scared.

193
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,500
This is the scariest game.

194
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
It's so scary.

195
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:55,500
We have all the players for the 42nd NHK.

196
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
I'm writing them down.

197
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
I think Shiro is the best.

198
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:09,500
I think Akai is the best.

199
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Shiro is the best.

200
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,500
15 seconds left.

201
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:49,500
10 seconds left.

202
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
5 seconds left.

203
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,500
4, 3, 2, 1.

204
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:17,500
I'm the best.

205
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,500
I'm the American Kid.

206
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:33,500
I'm the American Kid.

207
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:43,500
I'm the American Kid.

208
00:15:43,500 --> 00:16:09,500
I'm the American Kid.

209
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Hello, everyone.

210
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
I'm Hamada.

211
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:21,500
I'm going to introduce you to my friend, Hii.

212
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Hii, come on.

213
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Stand up.

214
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Hii, come on.

215
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Hii, he's your friend.

216
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Say hi to him.

217
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Hii.

218
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Hii.

219
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Hii.

220
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Hii.

221
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:29,500
This is the 40th episode of 1989.

222
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:35,500
I'm Shiro.

223
00:17:35,500 --> 00:18:03,500
I'm the best.

224
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Am I stupid?

225
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Am I stupid?

226
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,500
I'm...

227
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
It's pretty long.

228
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Am I stupid?

229
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Am I stupid?

230
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,500
This is my first job this year.

231
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:33,500
This is J-O-A-X-T-V Channel 4.

232
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
This is Japan TV.

233
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,500
This is Hayami's American Kid.

234
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Watch it.

235
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Hi, everybody.

236
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Am I...

237
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Am I stupid?

238
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Am I stupid?

239
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Hello.

240
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:11,500
I'm glad you invited me to come to Yoshimoto.

241
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Matsumoto is running out of patience.

242
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,500
I want to clear this in one go.

243
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Nice jump.

244
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
It's a jump of fate.

245
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,500
He jumped into the water.

246
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
But he failed.

247
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:37,500
What's wrong?

248
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:46,500
What's wrong?

249
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:54,500
I want to jump into the water.

250
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,500
I want to jump into the water.

251
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,500
I want to jump into the water.

252
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Hamada has left Japan.

253
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:21,500
He's on his way to Mont-Moulin-Saint-Germain.

254
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,500
I don't think I need to drink water here.

255
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Excuse me.

256
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
There's no water here.

257
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,500
There's a waterfall down there.

258
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
We're going to build it there.

259
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Am I stupid?

260
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,500
What's wrong with you?

261
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
There it is.

262
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Let me introduce you to the shrimp.

263
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,500
You're annoying.

264
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,500
The sparkling water is now pouring into the bottle.

265
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
I got it.

266
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Congratulations, Hamada.

267
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,500
His dream has finally come true.

268
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:05,500
It's going to be a relaxing trip.

269
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
What about Evian?

270
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
It's a town.

271
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
I didn't say anything.

272
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
The water of the Alps is the water of the Alps.

273
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,500
The water of the Alps came out of Evian.

274
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
That's why it's called Evian.

275
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,500
If you come to Evian, there's no Evian.

276
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
That's right.

277
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
It's out there?

278
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
That's right.

279
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,500
If you get off the plane and come here, you'll get hit.

280
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:36,500
It's a punishment.

281
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,500
The sparkling water is now pouring into the bottle.

282
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,500
I got it.

283
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,500
It's true.

284
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
It's true.

285
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Congratulations.

286
00:21:50,500 --> 00:22:13,500
The dream has finally come true.

287
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
What is it?

288
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Are you in pain?

289
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:24,500
I'm fine.

290
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Fukuyama.

291
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Fukuyama Masahara.

292
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Checkers last year.

293
00:22:36,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Thank you very much.

294
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Thank you very much.

295
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Hello.

296
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,500
It's me.

297
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Were you sleeping?

298
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:31,500
Listen to my mother's cry.

299
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Then look at the life of the parents and children.

300
00:23:48,500 --> 00:24:13,500
It's been a long time.

301
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:19,500
It's been a long time.

302
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,500
It's dangerous, but it's fun.

303
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Where are you?

304
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
You have a son who is in the second grade of elementary school, right?

305
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
I have a sixth grader.

306
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
How did you do that?

307
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
How did you do that?

308
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
I'm embarrassed.

309
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
It's not funny.

310
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
It's not funny.

311
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Bring me some money.

312
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
I'm the second son of Masumoto.

313
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
Bring me some money.

314
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Bring me some money.

315
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
I'm the second son of Shioe.

316
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:53,500
What are you going to do with your own family?

317
00:24:53,500 --> 00:25:01,500
Thank you very much.

318
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Let's do our best next year.

319
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:10,500
Let me think about it next year.

320
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
It's a battle and punishment game that made a lot of headlines last year.

321
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,500
In addition to that, there is also a famous project that challenged such a thing.

322
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
What are you thinking about now?

323
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:28,500
I'm thinking about the costume of Kin-chan.

324
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:34,500
I'm nervous.

325
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
Good evening.

326
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Nice to meet you.

327
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,500
I'm number 67, Hitoshi Matsumoto.

328
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
The title is Chameleon.

329
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,500
Thank you very much.

330
00:25:48,500 --> 00:26:07,500
I'm lost.

331
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
Come on.

332
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:23,500
Come on.

333
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Thank you very much.

334
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:36,500
I will announce the result.

335
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
Thank you very much.

336
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,500
I'm going to make up for the loss I made last time.

337
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
I'm sorry.

338
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
I did my best.

339
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:56,500
Please give me a high score.

340
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,500
I'm the captain of the costume of Kin-chan.

341
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Thank you very much for accepting the application the other day.

342
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Thank you very much.

343
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:11,500
I will announce the result.

344
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Is that so?

345
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Thank you very much.

346
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
Where are you going?

347
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
How did you do it?

348
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Don't laugh.

349
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,500
Everyone wants to know how you did it.

350
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500
What is the result of the costume?

351
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
I will tell you the result.

352
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:52,500
This time, our costume is a success.

353
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
This is the last work.

354
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,500
This is the last work.

355
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Let's get started.

356
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,500
You look very nervous.

357
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,500
I'm nervous.

358
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,500
This is a terrible work.

359
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Let's go.

360
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,500
No. 40, pass line.

361
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
How did it go?

362
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,500
How many points did the judges give?

363
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:28,500
How many points did the judges give?

364
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,500
I'm sorry.

365
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,500
Please give me a high score.

366
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Are you doing it alone?

367
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,500
Yes.

368
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Please give me a high score.

369
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,500
You can't go down.

370
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Congratulations.

371
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,500
You passed, but you can't win.

372
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
You want to win, right?

373
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Please give me a high score.

374
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Why are you looking up?

375
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
Please.

376
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:32,500
You passed.

377
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:38,500
You passed.

378
00:29:38,500 --> 00:30:01,500
Please give me a high score.

379
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:16,500
