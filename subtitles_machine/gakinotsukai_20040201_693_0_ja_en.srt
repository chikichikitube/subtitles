1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,280
Shinshun-Nails

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,840
Recently, large-scale Neverland возмож fee festival has been held again.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,700
What, fifteen?

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,340
Neverland Devils haven't visited

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,920
So let's stay friendly as always in 2004

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,400
Tada!

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,020
It is also the 15th school fishing festival this year

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,820
Introducing myself, I'm the general manager.

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,820
Introducing yourself?

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
I'm Yabazaki Hosei!

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,420
I have a special guest today.

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,020
Even though I have more work to do, I can't stop laughing.

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,420
I want to get rid of my worries!

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,420
Good luck this year!

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,020
Next...

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,020
This year's S.O.N.A. Combi No.1, Shinagawa Shouji!

17
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,020
Next...

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,020
I'm the white giant of Gaki no Tsukai, Yabana-san!

19
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,020
Thank you very much.

20
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,020
Next, let's look at the mirror.

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,020
He's the mascot of Gaki no Tsukai and La Hende.

22
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,020
Thank you for coming to Downtown!

23
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,020
Thank you!

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,020
Today, we don't have any behind-the-scenes stories.

25
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,020
It's going to be tough.

26
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,020
I've been doing this since I debuted in 2018.

27
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,020
It's like my arms are going to be cut off.

28
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,020
All together now!

29
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,020
Thank you for coming!

30
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,020
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

31
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,020
This year's S.O.N.A. Combi No.1, Shinagawa Shouji!

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:05,020
Everyone is celebrating the beginning of the new year and having a good time.

33
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,020
Shouji seems to be in a good mood.

34
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,020
He's drinking at a high pace.

35
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,020
He's not drinking, is he?

36
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,020
He's drinking.

37
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,020
What?

38
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,020
He's drinking.

39
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,020
Hey!

40
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,020
He's a senior.

41
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,020
He's a senior!

42
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,020
He's drinking!

43
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,020
Cheers!

44
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,020
Cheers!

45
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,020
It's good.

46
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,020
It's good.

47
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,020
What are you looking at?

48
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,020
Why are you looking at the lighter?

49
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,020
That's why I hate the Kanto-based soft drinks.

50
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,020
That's where it came from.

51
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,020
Don't mess with us!

52
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,020
What?

53
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,020
Don't mess with us!

54
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,020
Suddenly, Yamasaki began to talk about this year's grand goal.

55
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,020
I want to be in R-1.

56
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,020
You can't win, can you?

57
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,020
I want to win and open a hole in your nose.

58
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,020
Open a hole in your nose?

59
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:13,020
If you open a hole in your nose, you'll be in trouble.

60
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,020
I'll open a hole in my nose.

61
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,020
I'll open a hole in my nose.

62
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,020
Once a year's fun!

63
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,020
Shinshun Manzai Daigassen!

64
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,020
Thank you!

65
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,020
Thank you!

66
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,020
Thank you!

67
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,020
Thank you!

68
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,020
Thank you!

69
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,020
Thank you!

70
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,020
Everyone, please listen to the news at 9 o'clock.

71
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,020
Please look forward to the new year's festival, Manzai Daigassen!

72
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,020
25 talent staff will draw a card with a number on it.

73
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,020
5 teams will be chosen and each team will show the original Manzai.

74
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,020
I'll choose the first one.

75
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,020
Please!

76
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,020
Stop!

77
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,020
Number 18!

78
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,020
Number 18!

79
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,020
What?

80
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,020
What?

81
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,020
The first one is the new director, Keshigomu.

82
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,020
I hate you, Keshigomu!

83
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,020
Please!

84
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,020
Stop!

85
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,020
Stop!

86
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,020
Stop!

87
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,020
Stop!

88
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,020
Stop!

89
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,020
Stop!

90
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,020
Stop!

91
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,020
Who?

92
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,020
The opponent is the manager, Tajima.

93
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,020
Thank you!

94
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,020
The second team is...

95
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,020
Number 8!

96
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,020
Tanaka!

97
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,020
And Tanaka's opponent is...

98
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,020
Number 13!

99
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,020
It's me!

100
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,020
I'm glad, Tanaka!

101
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,020
The third team is...

102
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,020
Number 12!

103
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,020
Number 12!

104
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,020
It's Hotohara!

105
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,020
Hotohara will draw a card with a number on it.

106
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,020
The opponent is the new director, Kubo.

107
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,020
Which team is it?

108
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,020
The fourth team is...

109
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,020
Number 20!

110
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,020
Number 20!

111
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,020
Yes!

112
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,020
Miyasako!

113
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,020
Miyasako!

114
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,020
The opponent is...

115
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,020
Number 11!

116
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,020
Number 11!

117
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,020
Matsumoto!

118
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,020
Matsumoto and Miyasako will form a team.

119
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,020
It's harder than I thought.

120
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,020
I'm looking forward to it.

121
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,020
And the last team is...

122
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,020
Number 5!

123
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,020
First, it's Kokoriko and Endo.

124
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,020
The opponent is the producer, Kobayashi.

125
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,020
It's not funny.

126
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,020
It's Endo!

127
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,020
There's one more!

128
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,020
You can do it in Shinagawa.

129
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,020
I don't want to do it.

130
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,020
Shinagawa likes manzai.

131
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,020
You can do it in the M-1 drama.

132
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,020
Shinagawa Shouji will form a team.

133
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,020
What are you going to do with that?

134
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,020
It's Hamada!

135
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,020
Hamada, can you do a rap?

136
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,020
Why?

137
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,020
I'll put Hamada in a weak team.

138
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,020
Why?

139
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,020
It's already decided.

140
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,020
What are you doing?

141
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,020
What are you doing?

142
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,020
What are you going to do with this?

143
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,020
If you say let's go, it's not a good idea.

144
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,020
Hamada will join the team.

145
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,020
The theme of manzai is martial arts.

146
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,020
The second team is Yamasaki Tanaka.

147
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,020
The theme is Ore-Ore-Sagi.

148
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,020
The third team is Kotohara and Kubo.

149
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,020
The theme is trivia.

150
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,020
The fourth team is Miyasako Matsumoto.

151
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,020
The theme is Manifesto.

152
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,020
The fifth team is Endo and Kobayashi.

153
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,020
The theme is Matsui and Major.

154
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,020
The sixth team is Shinagawa Shouji.

155
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,020
The sixth team will go to another room and make up a story.

156
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,020
They can't slip as a person who laughs.

157
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,020
What kind of story will they make?

158
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,020
I can't do it anymore.

159
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,020
Let's go to the first team.

160
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,020
Hamada, Keshigomu and Tajima.

161
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:36,020
The theme is martial arts.

162
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,020
I'm the class president.

163
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,020
I'm the backboard.

164
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,020
I'm the student council president.

165
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:52,020
The martial arts of last year was very exciting.

166
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:59,020
This year, the world champion Mike Tyson will come out.

167
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,020
All martial arts.

168
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,020
I wonder what will happen on TV.

169
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,020
But there is one thing I regret.

170
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,020
It's hard to understand the game.

171
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,020
It's hard to understand the victory.

172
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,020
I don't know if I can say that.

173
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,020
So today I came up with a very easy-to-understand martial art.

174
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,020
Rock-paper-scissors.

175
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,020
Rock-paper-scissors and Katao wins.

176
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,020
I see.

177
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,020
I don't know if I can say that.

178
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,020
Let's do it.

179
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,020
Let's do it.

180
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,020
Rock-paper-scissors.

181
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,020
That's good.

182
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,020
Rock-paper-scissors.

183
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,020
Rock-paper-scissors.

184
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,020
Rock-paper-scissors.

185
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,020
Rock-paper-scissors.

186
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,020
Rock-paper-scissors.

187
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,020
Rock-paper-scissors.

188
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,020
You are crazy.

189
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,020
I haven't seen it yet.

190
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,020
I don't like it.

191
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,020
I have another idea.

192
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,020
Really?

193
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,020
I want to say that.

194
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,020
Thai kick battle.

195
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,020
Thai kick battle?

196
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,020
Yes.

197
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,020
What is it?

198
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,020
It's a Thai kick match.

199
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,020
I see.

200
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,020
It doesn't matter if I win or lose.

201
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,020
It doesn't matter.

202
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,020
Let's do it.

203
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,020
Let me do it.

204
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,020
Hey.

205
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:28,020
Hey.

206
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:34,020
Hey.

207
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,020
Wait, wait.

208
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,020
It hurts.

209
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,020
Why?

210
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,020
It hurts.

211
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,020
Stop.

212
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,020
It hurts.

213
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,020
Stop.

214
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,020
It hurts.

215
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,020
Stop.

216
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:51,020
I didn't do it on purpose! Thank you very much!

217
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,020
Tajima-kun, you only had the lines of the song when you were a kid.

218
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,020
I apologized right away with my sleeves.

219
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,020
I'm sorry.

220
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,020
The song is by Endo-san and Kawai-san.

221
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,020
The theme is Matsui Major.

222
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:15,020
Here we go!

223
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,020
I'm Endo.

224
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,020
I'm Kobayashi.

225
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,020
We are P-PALAZ.

226
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,020
We often go to this bar.

227
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,020
It's in Nishikuni.

228
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,020
I can't tell you where it is.

229
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,020
I love baseball.

230
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,020
I watched a lot of baseball last year.

231
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,020
I did my best.

232
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,020
But I thought I'd do it.

233
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,020
You thought?

234
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,020
Why?

235
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,020
It's Godzilla, right?

236
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,020
It's Mechagodzilla, right?

237
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,020
It's Mosura.

238
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

239
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:50,020
I can't do it.

240
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,020
I'm talking about Godzilla in New York.

241
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,020
I did my best in New York.

242
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,020
I can't do it in New York.

243
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,020
I did my best in New York.

244
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,020
It's all CG.

245
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,020
I can't forget Godzilla in the movie.

246
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,020
You have no chance.

247
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:10,020
You are losing your tension while doing the cartoon.

248
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,020
I'm talking about Godzilla.

249
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,020
I went to Matsui in New York, right?

250
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,020
Where are you going?

251
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,020
I'm going to Matsui.

252
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,020
We're good friends.

253
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,020
We are good friends.

254
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,020
I'll go to New York.

255
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,020
But I don't know about Godzilla.

256
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,020
You don't know Godzilla's nickname?

257
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,020
It's Godzilla.

258
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,020
No

259
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,820
Oh, really?

260
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,620
If it's Godzilla, it's Minira, right?

261
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,620
So, it's not Gao.

262
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,620
Thank you very much.

263
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,620
Let's go to the 3rd round.

264
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,320
It's Mr. Hosei and Mr. Tanaka.

265
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,020
The theme is Ore Ore Sagi.

266
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,020
Let's go.

267
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,120
Hello, I'm Yama-chan.

268
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,420
I'm Tanaka-kun.

269
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,820
The theme is Homura.

270
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,020
I'm not convinced.

271
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,420
There were many incidents last year.

272
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,020
The incident that hurt me the most was Ore Ore Sagi.

273
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,620
That's not good.

274
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,820
Do you know?

275
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,020
It's an incident that stole a house and a relative and asked them to prepare 2 million and 3 million yen.

276
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,420
That's not good.

277
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,920
It's not good.

278
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,020
Ore Ore Sagi.

279
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,420
Let's do it right here.

280
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:24,920
Okay.

281
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,320
Oh!

282
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Prrrr!

283
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,820
Oh, it's a phone call.

284
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,320
Prrrr!

285
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,820
Gacha.

286
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,620
Hello?

287
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,320
Hello?

288
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,220
Hello?

289
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,220
It's me.

290
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,520
Who am I?

291
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,220
It's me.

292
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,520
Who am I?

293
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,320
It's Ore Ore Sagi.

294
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,320
You can't say that it's Sagi.

295
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
You can't say that it's Sagi.

296
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,020
You can't say that it's Sagi.

297
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,820
I'm counting on you.

298
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,820
Okay.

299
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,520
It's a phone call.

300
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,820
Prrrr!

301
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,820
It's a phone call.

302
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,820
Prrrr!

303
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,320
Gacha.

304
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,820
Gacha.

305
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,820
Hello?

306
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
It's coming out once!

307
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,820
It's coming out once when I say gacha!

308
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,320
I can't use the teleprompter.

309
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
What are you doing?

310
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
The teleprompter...

311
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,820
It doesn't matter now!

312
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,820
Ore Ore Sagi.

313
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,820
Can you do it?

314
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,320
I can do it!

315
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Prrrr!

316
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,820
Prrrr!

317
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Oh, it's a phone call.

318
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,820
Gacha.

319
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,320
Hello?

320
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Hello?

321
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
It's me.

322
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,820
Who am I?

323
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,320
You're that old lady, right?

324
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
That's right, but...

325
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
It's me, but...

326
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,820
So who am I?

327
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,320
No, it's me, but...

328
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,820
You can't touch me.

329
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,320
You can't touch me.

330
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
What?

331
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
It's a phone call.

332
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,820
Yes.

333
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Prrrr!

334
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,320
Oh, it's a phone call.

335
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
Prrrr!

336
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,820
Gacha.

337
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,820
Hello?

338
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
Hello?

339
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
They're both old ladies.

340
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,320
Why is it coming out once?

341
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,820
I can't use the teleprompter.

342
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
I can't use the teleprompter.

343
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,320
Prrrr!

344
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Gacha.

345
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Hello?

346
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,820
Hello?

347
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
Is that voice from Hiroshi?

348
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,820
Yes, it's from Hiroshi.

349
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
Is it really from Hiroshi?

350
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Yes, it's from Hiroshi.

351
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,820
If it's from Hiroshi,

352
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,320
please imitate that old lady.

353
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Ah!

354
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,820
Murayama Tomiichi-san!

355
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,320
Isn't that a friend?

356
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,820
That old lady...

357
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,820
Change it.

358
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,320
Change it?

359
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,820
Please.

360
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
Okay, I got it.

361
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,820
Gacha.

362
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,320
Hello?

363
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Hello?

364
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
Is that an old lady?

365
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
Is that an old lady?

366
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,820
It's an old lady.

367
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,320
Ah, it's me.

368
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Ah, it's Hiroshi?

369
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,820
Yes, yes, yes.

370
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,820
What's going on?

371
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,820
Ah, actually...

372
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,320
Yes?

373
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,820
I'd like you to prepare 1 million yen.

374
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,320
Why do you need 1 million yen?

375
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Ah...

376
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
I ran into an accident.

377
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,820
What kind of accident?

378
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,320
That's right.

379
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
If you have to pay 1 million yen,

380
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
please send me 1 million yen.

381
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,820
Eh?

382
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,320
What kind of accident?

383
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,320
That's too much.

384
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
I'd like you to cheat on me

385
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,320
around here.

386
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:06,320
Eh?

387
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,820
I feel like I'm going to get divorced.

388
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,320
This is tough.

389
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Thank you very much.

390
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,320
I want to do this at that convenience store again next year.

391
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,320
The 4th group is Hotohara-san and Kubo-san.

392
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,320
The theme is trivia.

393
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:31,320
Here we go.

394
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
Hello, I'm Hotohara.

395
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
I'm Kubo.

396
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,320
We're both beach boys.

397
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,320
I'm worried about you.

398
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
You're doing great.

399
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Are you okay?

400
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,820
It's a daily routine.

401
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,320
It's a daily routine.

402
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Well, this year has started, too.

403
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
There were a lot of things.

404
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
Especially when I watched the show Kirina,

405
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
there was a good show.

406
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
There was.

407
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Trivia.

408
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
That was fun.

409
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
It was fun.

410
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
You don't have to study math.

411
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
Do you have any math?

412
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
I don't care about math.

413
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,820
What do you mean?

414
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,320
If I can do a comic,

415
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
I want to imitate it.

416
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
No, I mean trivia.

417
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
If you suddenly want to imitate it.

418
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,320
Let me imitate it today.

419
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,320
Who can do it?

420
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Takami Sakari.

421
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Takami Sakari is popular now.

422
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Do it, girl.

423
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Oh.

424
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
You don't have a board.

425
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,320
You don't have a board.

426
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,320
Hey.

427
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
That's it?

428
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Do you have to do it

429
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
until you stop the flow?

430
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
I still have it.

431
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
I still have it.

432
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
It's not similar at all.

433
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Can you do it?

434
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
The one that looks like you.

435
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Suiken.

436
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Is it Suiken like Jackie?

437
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
Yes.

438
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
Suiken.

439
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:49,320
That's why it's difficult.

440
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
What is this?

441
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
Is this Suiken?

442
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Are you okay?

443
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
There are a lot of comedians

444
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,320
who want to be on TV.

445
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
I'm in trouble

446
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,320
if I'm on TV so much.

447
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,320
I don't know how to do this.

448
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
What's the last one?

449
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,320
It's Bruce Lee.

450
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,320
Bruce Lee?

451
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
It's Bruce Lee.

452
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:20,320
It's Bruce Lee.

453
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,320
It's Takamizaka.

454
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,320
I won't let you do it.

455
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:33,320
Thank you.

456
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
It's the fifth group.

457
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
Matsumoto and Miyasako.

458
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
The theme is manifest.

459
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Here we go.

460
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Good evening, everyone.

461
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,320
Today, I would like to study about manifest with you.

462
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
We have a manifest researcher,

463
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Mr. Uonuma,

464
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Mr. Hikari Koshi.

465
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
That's my story.

466
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
That's my story.

467
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,320
The manifest when you forget something when you go out in the morning.

468
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,320
Here we go.

469
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Manifest.

470
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Manifest.

471
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
The manifest when you are thinking

472
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,320
and you are stopped by someone.

473
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,320
It's annoying.

474
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Teacher.

475
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
Teacher.

476
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
Teacher.

477
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,320
What?

478
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Stop it.

479
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,320
The manifest when you fall from a high place.

480
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
Manifest.

481
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,320
The manifest when you fall from a high place.

482
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Manifest.

483
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,320
Manifest.

484
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:06,320
Manifest when you go to a cafe in the middle of summer.

485
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,320
Like this?

486
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
Excuse me.

487
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Ice manifest.

488
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Manifest when you meet your ex-girlfriend in an art museum.

489
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:33,320

00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Manifest when you enter McDonald's.

491
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:45,320
Fillet of fish set.

492
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Attena...

493
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,320
Miyasako.

494
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,320
Number 4.

495
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,320
It's me.

496
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Here we go.

497
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,320
Manifest.

498
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Manifest.

499
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,320
Manifest.

500
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
Manifest.

501
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,320

502
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Manifest when you get a call.

503
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,320
Manifest.

00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Manin.

505
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,320
Manin.

506
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Manifest when you are driving.

507
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
Manin.

508
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
Manin.

509
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,320
Manifest.

510
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,320
Manifest.

511
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,320
Manifest.

512
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320

00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,320
Manin.

514
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,320
Manin.

515
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
It's hot.

516
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
Number 6.

517
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Shinagawa Shoji's theme is victory.

518
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Here we go.

519
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,320
I'll do my best.

520
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,320
Last year Hanshin won the championship.

521
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,320
It's been 18 years.

522
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
I think 18 years is amazing.

523
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,320
18 years is amazing.

524
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,320
Shut up.

525
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,320
I think 18 years is amazing.

526
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,320
I think 18 years is amazing.

527
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
18 years is amazing.

528
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
You can do it.

529
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
I can't.

530
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Idiot.

531
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
I can't do it.

532
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
You can do it.

533
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
I'm scared.

534
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
I can't do it.

535
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
You are funny.

536
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
I can't do it.

537
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,320
I can't do it.

538
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,320
I'm scared.

539
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,320
You are funny.

540
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,320
I'm glad I played with you.

541
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Hanshin is a big fan of you.

542
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:48,320
I'll do my best.

543
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
I'll do my best.

544
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,320
Come on.

545
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,320
Come on.

546
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:05,320
Come on.

547
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,320
I'm scared.

548
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,320
Come on.

549
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Come on.

550
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:20,320
It's too long.

551
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
What should I do?

552
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,320
Make it shorter.

553
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,320
Come on.

554
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,320
It's too short.

555
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,320
It's too short.

556
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,320
Make it longer.

557
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:57,320
Make it longer.

558
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,320
It's too long.

559
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
I think...

560
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
What is it?

561
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
Everyone is a good guy.

562
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
What is it?

563
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
That's enough.

564
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,320
Thank you very much.

565
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,320
Thank you very much.

566
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,320
Next year, Yama-chan and Tanaka will be together.

567
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,320
What?

568
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,320
