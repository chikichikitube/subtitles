1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Next time, at Gaki no Tsukai, Chikizuki! Ice Opittashi!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Omatanimonmari Grand Prix!

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This Omatanimonmari...

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We've done it several times in the O-League.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's caused a social upheaval.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Really?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This time, we're going to use Omatanimonmari as a pair match.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
For example, if it's something red...

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Answer at the same time.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If the two people's phrases match, it's a correct answer.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If you answer 17 out of 10 questions correctly, you'll get 100,000 yen.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's good.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But if you don't get the answer right, your partner's heart will get closer and closer.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's how it is. If you get 4 questions right, your heart will get closer and closer.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It'll cause a social upheaval too.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It will.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The first pair is these people!

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Can I call this a pair?

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Is this a pair?

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Of course it's a pair.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Your voices are too loud!

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please show us your pair match.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's good.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The Monmari Machine is here!

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Are you ready?

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
On the theme of the Monmari Machine...

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Is that the theme?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Of course it is.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ryuichi Sakamoto...

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Tetsu-chan, you go first.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Tetsu-chan?

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This is tough!

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yama-san, you go first.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
When you take off your shoes, they're bare, right?

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's...

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's a pity!

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You should've done something about it!

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They were too bare.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You should've taken them off!

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Why are you taking them off?

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You should've just sat down!

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why did you take them off?

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There's no need to take them off!

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
They're partners.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's go, Yama-chan!

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is a bad color!

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's hard to see this coming!

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Tetsu-chan, get ready.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yama-san, sit down.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's a shame that they're bare.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They're so thin!

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm so sorry!

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm so sorry!

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Please take them off.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can't do this to my mother either!

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's go!

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Speaking of the Japanese Prime Minister...

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's go.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Ready, set...

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Open!

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Idiot!

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Idiot!

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Idiot!

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Are you serious?

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He's the real deal!

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But the current Prime Minister isn't the only one.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The current Prime Minister isn't saying anything.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's true.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let's move on to the next one.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's so long!

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Speaking of the ice cream...

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Speaking of dirty talent...

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's go.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Ready, set...

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Idiot!

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Why?

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't know.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
How about you?

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm Hamada-san.

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Why are you calling me an idiot?

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's so hard!

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm still here!

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Are you sure about the previous question?

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Speaking of the Japanese Prime Minister...

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I got it!

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's move on to the next one!

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What if I get it wrong?

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What if you get it wrong?

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Let's move on to the next question.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Speaking of the SFO goods...

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is a matter of chance.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Ready, set...

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Idiot!

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You got it right!

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You got it right!

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's the spirit!

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Let's move on to the next question.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Speaking of the kind people in downtown...

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Speaking of the kind people you think they are...

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's go.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Ready, set...

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Hamada Masatoshi!

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hamada Masumoto.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's not what I always say!

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's move on to the next question!

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is bad!

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This is bad!

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is bad!

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're making me cry!

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What are you talking about?

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's move on!

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Is this the last question?

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Speaking of the kind people you think they are...

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Ready, set...

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ready, set...

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Let's go!

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Ready, set...

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Strong Congo!

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Strong Congo!

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There's no strong Congo.

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is the last question!

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Speaking of the kind people you think they are...

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is bad!

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This is bad!

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's not what I always say!

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm shaking from the shivers!

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The next pair is these two!

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Good evening!

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Good evening!

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Good evening!

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Good evening!

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Good evening!

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Good evening!

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Good evening!

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This is the Nagae Kenji pair!

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They're both very refreshing.

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And they're wearing Okamoto underwear.

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's good.

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Speaking of the kind people you think they are...

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm nervous.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think they're both very refreshing.

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The Nagae Kenji pair.

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The Nagae Kenji pair.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Shingo-chan, please sit here.

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is embarrassing.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You don't have to dress like this!

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What are you talking about?

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You look like a snowman.

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What is this?

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's go!

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Speaking of the kind people you think they are...

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Ready, set...

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
A plane!

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The next question is...

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Speaking of the kind people you don't like in the Kin-chan family...

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This is easy.

158
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't know if it's easy or not.

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's go!

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Ready, set...

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Miehari!

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Amazing!

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Amazing!

164
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Is that so?

165
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is wonderful.

166
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
These two will say it, so I'm sure of it.

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sure they'll say the same thing when they ask Kin-chan.

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The next question is...

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Speaking of the kind people you don't like in Gun-Town...

170
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Let's go.

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Ready, set...

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Matcha!

173
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This is too much of a service question.

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Why? Why is it a service question?

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why is it the right answer?

176
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
There's no right or wrong answer.

177
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The next question is...

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Amazing.

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let's go.

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Speaking of the kind people you don't like...

181
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is the most difficult one.

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Let's go.

183
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Ready, set...

184
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Kin-chan!

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's right.

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's what you said, so that's why you said it.

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's right.

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Kin-chan.

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's right.

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's too much of a service question.

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's move on to the next question.

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
There are three more questions left.

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Amazing.

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I feel like I've gained weight.

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I guess you've gained weight.

196
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The next question is...

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Speaking of the kind people you don't like...

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let's go.

199
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Ready, set...

200
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Amazing.

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's the right answer.

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's the right answer.

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's the right answer.

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Amazing.

205
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Let's move on to the next question.

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Speaking of Christmas...

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Speaking of Christmas...

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Let's go.

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Ready, set...

210
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yamashita Katsuro!

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's move on to the next question.

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
There are two more questions left.

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Speaking of the kind people you don't like...

214
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Speaking of the kind people you don't like...

215
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's move on to the next question.

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Ready, set...

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yakiniku!

218
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yakiniku Steak!

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That was close.

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's the same meat.

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let's move on to the next question.

222
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I've always been interested in this.

223
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Let's touch it.

224
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's too strange.

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Here you go.

226
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You should have touched it a little more.

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So far, there were three wrong answers.

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
In the next round, O-Mata will go first.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Kazami and Nanae pair.

230
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
They got the right answer twice in a row.

231
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And they're left with nothing.

232
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's the second question.

233
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Is it 100,000 yen or a crotch?

234
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's a big difference.

235
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That's a big difference.

236
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The last question.

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Speaking of the king of vegetables...

238
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The king...

239
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Here we go.

240
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Ready, set...

241
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Katsudon!

242
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's wrong.

243
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's definitely wrong.

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So, in the next round...

245
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm watching you.

246
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Who is it?

247
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm watching you.

248
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm watching you.

249
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm watching you.

250
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm watching you.

251
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The last pair is these two.

252
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The last pair is these two.

253
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The last pair is these two.

254
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The last pair is these two.

255
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The last pair is these two.

256
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Unlike everyone else, they're the only couple.

257
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So, without further ado...

258
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Let's call it a day.

259
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Not at all!

260
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
As expected, Parko-san didn't laugh either.

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What the heck is going on here?

262
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I thought he was going to get his hair done, but...

263
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's a mess.

264
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's a mess.

265
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Did someone call me?

266
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I was laughing, but my ears hurt.

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I couldn't hear very well.

268
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That's not good.

269
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's not good.

270
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Are you okay?

271
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm worried.

272
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm worried.

273
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm worried.

274
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Are you okay?

275
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm okay.

276
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm okay.

277
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I feel like I'm in a family show.

278
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Here's the first question.

279
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What is the best couple in the entertainment industry?

280
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
This is a service question.

281
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
One, two...

282
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Takashima-san and Otsumi Hanae.

283
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Correct!

284
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't think it's Junran.

285
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Those two are the ideal couple.

286
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's not funny at all.

287
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What is the taste of a first kiss?

288
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
One, two...

289
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Lemon!

290
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Lemon and honey.

291
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That's close.

292
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The first kiss is moving!

293
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
No!

294
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That's all for the first kiss.

295
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But Pei-san is more beautiful than the other two.

296
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Pei-san is beautiful.

297
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Pei-san is not using his face.

298
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Next question.

299
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What is the manliness of downtown?

300
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This is easy.

301
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
One, two...

302
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Matsumoto-san!

303
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Correct!

304
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Next question.

305
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What is the word for proposing?

306
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That's a good one.

307
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Let's go!

308
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
One, two...

309
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Marry!

310
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Marry!

311
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Marry!

312
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I have to see this.

313
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Let's go!

314
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Marry!

315
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Marry!

316
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Marry!

317
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Marry!

318
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Next question.

319
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What is the pun for banana?

320
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
There are about eight.

321
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
One, two...

322
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Banana!

323
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's right.

324
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
If you get it right, you'll get 100,000 yen.

325
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Next question.

326
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What is the name of the king of Chinese cuisine?

327
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's a good one.

328
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
If you get it right, you'll get 100,000 yen.

329
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Next question.

330
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What is the name of the king of Chinese cuisine?

331
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's a good one.

332
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Are you ready?

333
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
One, two...

334
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Ramen!

335
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Ramen!

336
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Ramen!

337
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Ramen!

338
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Ramen!

339
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Ramen!

340
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Ramen!

341
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Ramen!

342
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Ramen!

343
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Ramen!

344
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's right.

345
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
One step before.

346
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't like this.

347
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The char siu is expensive.

348
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes.

349
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The char siu is expensive.

350
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Next question.

351
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
If you get it right, you'll get 100,000 yen.

352
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What is the name of the insect?

353
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This is...

354
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Last question.

355
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What is the name of the insect?

356
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
One, two...

357
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Antenna!

358
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Antenna!

359
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Correct!

360
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What is that?

361
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Please get it right.

362
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's the correct answer.

363
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Congratulations!

364
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's amazing!

365
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There are some people who are not rich.

366
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Can you do it by yourself?

367
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No, I...

368
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's right!

369
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I...

370
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I...

371
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Wait a minute.

372
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Wait a minute.

373
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's right.

374
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Wait a minute.

375
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's right.

376
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's right.

377
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's right.

378
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's right.

379
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I don't want to do it.

380
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Wait a minute.

381
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Masumoto-san.

382
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yes.

383
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Let's do it together.

384
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Of course.

385
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm the one who doesn't want to do it.

386
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The first one.

387
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Why are you giving me problems?

388
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't want to do it.

389
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's a simple problem.

390
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's a simple problem.

391
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Wait a minute.

392
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Speaking of the teacher...

393
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

394
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I got it.

395
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Speaking of the teacher...

396
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
One, two...

397
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Sandro-san.

398
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Sandro-san.

399
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The second one.

400
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Speaking of the Komuro Family...

401
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What does that mean?

402
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
There are a lot of Komuro Family members.

403
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
In this Komuro Family.

404
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
One, two...

405
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Amuro-san.

406
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Amuro.

407
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What did he say?

408
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Tomo-chan.

409
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Tomo-chan.

410
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But it's the Komuro Family.

411
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The first one starts.

412
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Tomo-chan.

413
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Matsumoto-san, your skin is slippery.

414
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Well, that's why I've come this far.

415
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The third one.

416
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Speaking of the female voice of love...

417
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
There are a lot of them.

418
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
One, two...

419
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Matsumoto-san.

420
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Well, that's...

421
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Well, that's...

422
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Amazing.

423
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Well, that's...

424
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Speaking of the female voice of love...

425
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
How should I read it?

426
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
How should I read it?

427
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
One, two...

428
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Matsumoto-san.

429
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Matsumoto-san.

430
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Matsumoto-san.

431
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You just said Hamamatsumoto.

432
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I didn't say it.

433
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Matsumoto-san.

434
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You read it too much.

435
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You said Hama first.

436
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You read it too much.

437
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Go home!

438
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Why are you still here?

439
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Speaking of the female voice of love...

440
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The female voice of love.

441
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
One, two...

442
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Hyakuboji!

443
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why?

444
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Hyakuboji.

445
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You don't know that?

446
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Go ahead.

447
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What kind of third one is that?

448
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What kind of third one is that?

449
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
This is...

450
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Speaking of the female voice of love...

451
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
This is easy.

452
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
One, two...

453
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That was good!

454
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That was good!

455
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That was good!

456
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That was good!

457
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Speaking of the king of electronic products...

458
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What is this?

459
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What is this?

460
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The king of electronic products?

461
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The king of electronic products.

462
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I can't do this anymore. I'm going to get a torture.

463
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm definitely going to get a torture.

464
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
This is wrong.

465
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
One, two...

466
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
The king of electronic products!

467
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Wait!

468
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Wait!

469
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Why?

470
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Why is the king of electronic products in the fridge?

471
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
This is the fridge.

472
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
This is the fridge.

473
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
This is the fridge.

474
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This is the fridge.

475
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What are you guys doing?

476
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Wait a minute!

477
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You have to chew properly.

478
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I want to chew.

479
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What are you doing?

480
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What are you doing?

481
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Why?

482
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Why is it so smelly?

483
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What are you doing?

484
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What are you doing?

485
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
This is the same everywhere, right?

486
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yes, that's right.

487
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
This is the same everywhere.

488
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
We use this when we go camping.

489
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Toyota-san.

490
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Toyota-san is here.

491
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Toyota-san.

492
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Really?

493
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
This is the same everywhere!

494
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Thank you.

495
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
This is Matsumoto-san.

496
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
This is Toyota.

497
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I bought it at Toyota.

498
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Thank you.

499
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
This is Windham.

500
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
That's a good one.

501
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's a different sense of security.

502
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Please give me one too.

503
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You're the only one who can do this.

504
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I came here a week ago.

505
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
This is good.

506
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
This is really good.

507
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
This is the same everywhere.

508
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
This is really good.

509
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Thank you for watching.
