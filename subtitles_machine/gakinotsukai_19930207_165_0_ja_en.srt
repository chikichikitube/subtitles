1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It's time for the 4th episode of CoordiNate!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is the 4th episode of CoordiNate.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Our manager has been doing this since the 2nd episode.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Ryu-chan is the first guest of CoordiNate.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He is the guest of the 4th episode of CoordiNate.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's call him.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here he comes!

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Welcome!

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I've been waiting for this moment!

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm the master of CoordiNate!

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Today, Ryu-chan will be the guest of CoordiNate.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
When did you get this?

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Ryu-chan, you are the master of CoordiNate.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Ryu-chan, it's me, right?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, it's you.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Are you going to do something?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yes, I am.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I've never heard of this.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't know what to do.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Ryu-chan should be here, right?

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, Ryu-chan is here.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Ryu-chan should be in the middle.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
These two and these two will go shopping.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I see.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll buy something that suits Ryu-chan.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How many years have we known Ryu-chan?

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We won this game, right?

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes, we did.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's what I mean.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I know everything.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We want to follow you to the downtown.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hey, hey!

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We won't be defeated.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We will do our best.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
He is an anti-gay.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You are so persistent.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You guys!

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Watch out! Watch out!

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You should move away from this.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It hurts.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Be careful.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You are going to get hurt.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm going to get hurt.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why are you so persistent?

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's dangerous.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Do you want to try it on?

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes, I do.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I want to buy a bag for Sasa-chu.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I don't know if it's going to be popular.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You are buying it here?

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You have a bad taste.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You are a three-year-old gay.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You are a three-year-old gay.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You have a bad taste.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You have a bad taste.

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You have a bad taste.

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Which one do you like?

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I like both.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Which one do you like?

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I like the one in Kansai and Kanto.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I like the one in Kansai.

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hey!

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't want to buy this kind of shoes.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't want to buy this kind of shoes.

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't have such slippers.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You don't have such slippers?

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't have such slippers.

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You are the youngest.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't have such slippers.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't have such slippers.

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Do you have such beautiful shoes?

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't have such beautiful shoes.

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You are a two-year-old gay.

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Show me your face.

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't have such beautiful shoes.

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You are a two-year-old gay.

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Show me your face.

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I like this kind of shoes.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I have a bad taste.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't want to buy this kind of shoes.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You bought a tie and a pin, right?

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I bought a tie and a pin, right?

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I bought a tie and a pin, right?

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's right.

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't think I can do this for the first time.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I have a bad taste.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't want to buy this kind of shoes.

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
First of all, the coordination of the two teams.

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll ask you one thing.

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The theme is good.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If you say the theme...

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't say the theme.

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This time, we're going to do it as a Kanto gay.

94
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You guys all look like Nishiro.

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So what's the theme?

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's light and clean.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
First of all, the coordination of the two teams.

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Ryu-chan, please come out.

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you do this, you'll be able to go to a party.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And this fashion...

101
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If you stimulate it a little, you'll be able to make a voice.

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's make a voice.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The scream of joy.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It hurts.

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The point of this is the face.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
In fashion, it's not this face.

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The point of this is the face.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I got it.

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The coordination of the two teams is like this.

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let's move on to the coordination of Downtown.

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Shall we go?

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's go.

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's okay to be round.

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's raised to the top.

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Our coordination is over.

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What's the theme?

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We started with the bag of Sasazuka Junior High School in the shopping district.

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
After all, bicycle commuting is the theme.

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Especially if you go to the countryside, you can see it well.

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
A junior high school student who is doing bicycle commuting.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's simple.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's see the coordination of Downtown.

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Ryu-chan, please come out.

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I can't touch it.

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm wearing a jersey.

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Helmet.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's a helmet.

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Even the shoes.

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I realized something good.

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's too late to go home.

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I have to go to the shower.

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Do you often take a shower in various songs?

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's all.

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I was going to drop it and go home.

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But when I saw this, I didn't want to go home.

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I didn't want to go home.

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You should go home.

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't know.

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't know.

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't know.

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm going home.

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I have to go to school in the morning.

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm going home.

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I have to go to school in the morning.

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What happened recently?

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I went skiing.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You went.

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You went with two people.

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You sometimes play with two people.

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's strange.

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That was cool.

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Look at the school.

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Look at the school.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I can do sports.

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's strange.

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's a lie.

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Everyone is having fun.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There was a lift.

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I went for the first time in my life.

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's right.

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I saw it for the first time.

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It was like that.

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There was a lift.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I went.

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I went.

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I went.

167
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I went.

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I went.

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I went.

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I went.

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I went.

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I went.

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I went.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I went.

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I went.

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I went.

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I went.

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I went.

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I went.

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I went.

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I went.

182
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I went.

183
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But it isn't for the end.

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It won't be so fun for the end.

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It makes me only thinly eyed only for the end.

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It makes me only thinly eyed only for the end.

187
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I thought she was a good girl.

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I thought she was going to fall from the top.

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Sorry, I got caught.

190
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
When I saw her, I thought I could do it.

191
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Really?

192
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No, really.

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
When I saw her, I could tell she was like this.

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But she was not feeling well.

195
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Don't say that.

196
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
She was about to fall from the top.

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The day before, she was very...

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't lie to me.

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You want to drink oolong tea, don't you?

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I think she had a fight with a black guy.

201
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Which guy?

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I don't remember.

203
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Which guy?

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
She was drunk and played table tennis.

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't remember drinking alcohol.

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I remember.

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
She had a fight with a black guy.

208
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
She had a fight with a black guy at the hotel.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
She had a fight with a black guy.

210
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What did she do after that?

211
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
She joined him with a trumpet.

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You had a trumpet with a ski?

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't remember what happened after that.

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Is that so?

215
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It would be nice if she went skiing.

216
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Everyone is skiing. We are the first ones.

217
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's enough.

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You like skiing, don't you?

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You can't do sports, either.

220
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't do it with you.

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You can't do anything.

222
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Don't do it with you.

223
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I can do anything.

224
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What can you do?

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What do you mean?

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What have you done so far?

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I've done most of it.

228
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You can't do it.

229
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
As a comedian, I can't do it well on TV.

230
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No, you are doing your best.

231
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You can't do it.

232
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
When you guys were taking a bath,

233
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I told you to sleep in your room.

234
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You were sleeping, weren't you?

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I was sleeping.

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I checked if you were sleeping.

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I left the hotel.

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I was next to the ski resort.

239
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Did you see it?

240
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
No, I didn't.

241
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
There is a liar in our school.

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
At first, he said he joined a troupe.

243
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Everyone believed him.

244
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But recently, he is with Isshiki Sae.

245
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
He was in a drama with Isshiki Sae.

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He is dating Mori from SMAP.

247
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
He is a liar.

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Why is he such a liar?

249
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Who is Mori from SMAP?

250
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't know.

251
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I don't understand women.

252
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They are liars.

253
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I've been told a lot.

254
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What?

255
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I live in Yokohama.

256
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm dating a junior high school student.

257
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Is that a lie?

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Why are you a junior high school student in Yokohama?

259
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I've been to a junior high school in Yokohama.

260
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What is that?

261
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Are you angry?

262
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't know what a junior high school student in Yokohama is.

263
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I've read a lot of fan letters.

264
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm angry.

265
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
From the opening of the fan letter.

266
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Why did you do it?

267
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I can't believe it anymore.

268
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What?

269
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I understand.

270
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I can't believe it anymore.

271
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What is that?

272
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I can't believe it anymore.

273
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's what happens when you read a fan letter.

274
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What is that?

275
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can't believe it anymore.

276
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You can't be proud of anything because you had sex with me.

277
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's what she thinks.

278
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's what she thinks.

279
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's what she thinks.

280
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Don't say that.

281
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Don't say that.

282
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That was a little annoying.

283
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
If you're a second-rate actor, you'll be proud of it.

284
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If you have sex with me, you won't be proud of anything.

285
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
If you have sex with me, you won't be proud of anything.

286
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's what you think.

287
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It doesn't matter who gets it.

288
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
If you are a third-rate actor, you won't be proud of anything because I have sex with anyone.

289
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's why you've been like this?

290
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's why you've been like this?

291
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I haven't been like this at all.

292
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I can't feel proud of myself.

293
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's a coincidence.

294
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's a coincidence.

295
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I can't feel proud of myself.

296
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Is that so?

297
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You're stupid.

298
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm stupid.

299
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What are the things that go round and round in red, white, and blue that are common in Tokoyas?

300
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Like this.

301
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Why do we have to have white, red, and blue?

302
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We don't really know.

303
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
In fact, in order to draw the basic tree, it would be better to have yellow or green in it.

304
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But it's white, red, and blue.

305
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Well, that's true.

306
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
This is...

307
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll tell you.

308
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'll cut it so that it goes round and round in white, red, and blue.

309
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What are you talking about?

310
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It has nothing to do with it.

311
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll cut it so that it goes round and round in red, blue, and black.

312
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Where's the black?

313
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Isn't that strange?

314
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Why is it strange?

315
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's this color from the beginning, so it's strange that it's black.

316
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's strange that it's black from the beginning.

317
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'll tell you. White, red, and blue can't be separated from each other.

318
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What's wrong with that?

319
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Tell me that first.

320
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If you do that, I don't know.

321
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
If you do that, I don't know if it's this color.

322
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You have to tell me that first.

323
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
An amateur is...

324
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Who said that?

325
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
An amateur is...

326
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
An amateur is...

327
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
An amateur is...

328
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
A person who doesn't have a license at all.

329
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I can't open it.

330
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Wait a minute.

331
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I can't open it?

332
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Where is that in?

333
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I can't open it.

334
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
If you do that, I don't know.

335
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
An amateur is...

336
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I can't open it.

337
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Blue.

338
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Blue.

339
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Blue vegetables.

340
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What?

341
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That's bad.

342
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Is it over already?

343
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I have a question about human faces.

344
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's natural that the faces of parents and children are similar.

345
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But sometimes there are people whose faces are similar.

346
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Why is that?

347
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Why is that?

348
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This is really true.

349
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This is really...

350
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's not that they look alike because they've been together for a long time, is it?

351
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
If you say something like that, you and I...

352
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Me and you...

353
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
How many years has it been?

354
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Me and you have been together for a long time.

355
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This and that.

356
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
How many years has it been?

357
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's been more than 20 years.

358
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That's right.

359
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Speaking of 20 years, it's already the Ginkgo ceremony.

360
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What?

361
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's already the Ginkgo ceremony.

362
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's a bad title.

363
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's true.

364
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What do you mean?

365
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's not similar.

366
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's not similar, is it?

367
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
In the end, this is the environment.

368
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Is that so?

369
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This is only good for the environment.

370
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
They live in the same house and eat the same food.

371
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
If that's the case, humans will gradually become similar.

372
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Is that so?

373
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
That's right.

374
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's why everyone's family is similar.

375
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
When I bought it and lived with my family, we were similar.

376
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But now that I live alone, I'm eating my own food.

377
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm eating something different from my family.

378
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
My face has gradually changed.

379
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Is that so?

380
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes.

381
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Even if you say that...

382
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
In the past, I had a different face.

383
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What kind of face was it?

384
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
In the past, when I lived with my family, I had a different face.

385
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's not true.

386
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
When I built a one-room house, I had a different face.

387
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Last year, I had a different face.

388
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Now I have a different face.

389
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I have a different face.

390
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What are you talking about?

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What are you talking about?

392
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
People like to imitate.

393
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Why does everyone say,

394
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Good evening, I'm Shinichi Mori when I imitate Shinichi Mori?

395
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's easy to understand, isn't it?

396
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
No, it's not.

397
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What she's saying is,

398
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What's that good evening?

399
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's easy.

400
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It doesn't have to be good evening.

401
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Good morning.

402
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm Shinichi Mori.

403
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But...

404
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That's what she's saying.

405
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's what she's saying.

406
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Why?

407
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Why is it good evening?

408
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Isn't it easy to imitate?

409
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
If you say that, it's almost good evening, isn't it?

410
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Isn't it?

411
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Is it only when you're Shinichi Mori?

412
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's right.

413
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Good evening, I'm Lupin.

414
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That's impossible.

415
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I've never heard Lupin say good evening.

416
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I can never say it.

417
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Why is it good evening only when you're Shinichi Mori?

418
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Who started it?

419
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Good evening, I'm Shinichi Mori.

420
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's right.

421
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Good evening, I'm Shinichi Mori.

422
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That's what everyone says.

423
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I always think,

424
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
There's no special permission for comedy.

425
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I want you to stop this.

426
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You have to do it properly.

427
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What do you say?

428
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I can't use anything other than this person.

429
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That's right.

430
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's why I'm talking about it.

431
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm in a lot of magazines.

432
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm in a lot of things I talked about.

433
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Playboy, come here.

434
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
My story.

435
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Is that so?

436
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Haruta and I also want to put it out.

437
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What are you talking about?

438
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Don't take other people's story.

439
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
If you put it out, you'll get 5,000 yen.

440
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You said that.

441
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Even if you say something like that, you'll get 5,000 yen.

442
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'll tell you something.

443
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I only take other people's story.

444
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Are you going up the hill?

445
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If I meet you in my dream.

446
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
If I meet you in my dream.

447
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What are you talking about?

448
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's Hiro's story.

449
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I didn't take it.

450
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I've been told a lot.

451
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Please think about it.

452
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
For example, let's go into your house.

453
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Let's say there was a pot.

454
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
This is a pretty expensive pot.

455
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What would you say if you took it?

456
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Hey, hey, hey.

457
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You'll say, thief.

458
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's not what you're thinking.

459
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Otherwise, it won't fall.

460
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No, no, no.

461
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Thief.

462
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
That's where you go into your house.

463
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's blooming in the garden.

464
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I took the grass.

465
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Do you call it a thief?

466
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'll tell you.

467
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Do you say?

468
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'll tell you.

469
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You say.

470
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'll tell you.

471
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You say.

472
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'll tell you.

473
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I've never really taken it.

474
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I've never really taken it.

475
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Hey, hey, hey.

476
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Hey, hey, hey.

477
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's my cam.

478
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yamagaki.

479
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Don't do that.

480
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Hey, hey, hey.

481
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That's a joint project.

482
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
No, it's not.

483
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
He's an idiot.

484
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I've seen him do something before we did it.

485
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I've seen the reaction of the people around me.

486
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
When I was doing it, he was looking at my face.

487
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I was looking at it with this face.

488
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:33,000
But in my heart, I thought it was good.
