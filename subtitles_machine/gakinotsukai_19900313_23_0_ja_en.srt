1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, we will be looking for Gekidotsu Tsukitsuki Kowamote-kun!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Please put a frame on this G.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's Kowamote, not KowaOmote.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What's KowaOmote?!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Who ordered this?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today, we will be looking for Gekidotsu Kowamote-kun.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How many times do we have to repeat the first episode?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Do we have to repeat it over and over again?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I don't know.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't know why we are still calling him Tsukitsuki.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Last time, we went to buy something weighing 10kg.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This time, we are going to look for Kowamote.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
He has a scary face.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He has a scary face.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You don't want to talk to someone with a scary face, do you?

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, that's true.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why are you taking me with you?

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I can only say that you have a scary face.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Isn't there a Yakuza office around here?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Isn't that just one shot?

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's not it.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You can walk around there.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If you go to an office like that, you'll be right there.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There are so many professionals.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If I get hit, I'll be Kowamote.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If I get hit, I'll be Kowamote.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So, in 15 minutes, what was today's event?

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What was it?

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, Todoroki Plaza.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's not it.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's Todoroki something pleasure.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So, in 15 minutes, we'll take three Kowamote-san with us.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Sounds good.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's go.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is a Kowamote town.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's really cute.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Isn't this Kowamote?

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's Kowamote.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Kowamote's face is Kowamote.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Excuse me.

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Excuse me.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Excuse me.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What is this?

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Are you Japanese?

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Where are you going?

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Are you a Yakuza?

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm going home.

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's right.

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Where are you going?

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm going to the ends of the earth.

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What are you talking about?

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Kowamote.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Are you Kowamote?

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Are you Kowamote?

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Kowamote.

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't talk to me like that.

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't like it.

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There's no one here.

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Excuse me.

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Excuse me.

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Father.

62
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Excuse me.

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm looking for someone with a scary face.

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Excuse me.

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Excuse me.

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Excuse me.

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Excuse me.

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What is this?

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That old man has a scary face.

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He's 90 years old.

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He's 90 years old.

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He's strong.

73
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He has a scary face.

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This program is brought to you by Sunluck.

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I did it.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm not good at it.

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I was scared.

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I was scared.

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I have one.

82
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I had a really scary face.

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I didn't speak loudly.

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's right.

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I was really scared.

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So I was in a safe place.

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I was a shopping guy before.

88
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't think I lost, but I think I bought another one.

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You bought another one.

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So I'm definitely going to win today.

91
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I see.

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is my first hand.

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes.

94
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's take a look at it.

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This person.

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What is it?

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
See, he's scary.

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This is scary.

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's go to the next one.

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He's making a lot of comments.

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's scary, but...

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's okay.

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is okay.

104
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's scary.

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Here you go.

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Where is it?

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're being bullied.

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's scary in a different way.

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't know what to do.

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There's a fear of what to do.

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's this old, but he's wearing these glasses.

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Right.

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And his hair.

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's scary in a different way.

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There's a fear of what to do.

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's true.

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's scary.

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's go to the next one.

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This person.

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
See.

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's scary.

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But he's cute.

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I was going to give up.

124
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
When he took off his hat.

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
See.

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You.

127
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Stop it.

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
See.

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He's a old man.

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He's wearing a helmet.

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't know what to do.

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll go home at night.

133
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll go home at night in two or three years.

134
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
See.

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
How old is he?

136
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How old is he?

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He's 80 years old.

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He's 80 years old.

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He's 80 years old.

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He has a pimple.

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't know what to do.

142
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He has a pimple?

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He doesn't have a pimple.

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He's angry.

145
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He's not angry at all.

146
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
He's smiling.

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He has a scar.

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He has a scar.

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm going to go to the golf course with Ishikawa.

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Really?

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm going to go to the golf course.

153
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This is scary.

154
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is scary.

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is scary.

156
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
See.

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He's old.

158
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm going to the golf course with Ishikawa.

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm going to the golf course with Ishikawa.

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Please wait.

161
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The third one.

162
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The third one.

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The last one.

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is scary.

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm going to the golf course.

166
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
See.

167
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Everyone will be surprised when they see me.

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What are you doing?

169
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm working.

170
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm working on a bicycle.

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm working on a bicycle.

172
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm working on a bicycle.

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm working on a bicycle.

174
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm working on a bicycle.

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm working on a bicycle.

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I have no sense of humor.

177
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You have no sense of humor.

178
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let me explain.

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let me explain.

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm preparing to work on a bicycle.

181
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Outside.

182
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000

See.

186
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hey, hey, hey!

187
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Hey, look over here!

188
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This is scary! This is scary!

189
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This is scary!

190
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You're so cowardly!

191
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hey, you!

192
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This is scary!

193
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey, wait!

194
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Stop with that name!

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Endo-san.

196
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Endo-san? What's your age?

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
26.

198
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
26? You're 26!

199
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're the same age!

200
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What are you saying?

201
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You've never been sold to a store, right?

202
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No, I've never been sold to a store.

203
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I didn't know that kind of people would come to the store.

204
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That kind of people are really scary!

205
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Seriously!

206
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What's your name?

207
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yoshiyoka-san.

208
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yoshiyoka-san, what's your name?

209
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
26.

210
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
26?

211
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You're so scary!

212
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This is really scary!

213
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This kind of people are really scary!

214
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I can't stand it if you two come to a comedy club.

215
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm going to lose this time.

216
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Right?

217
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm going to lose this time.

218
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm going to lose this time.

219
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm going to lose this time.

220
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Seriously.

221
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You lost to that old man today.

222
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Today, I...

223
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What?

224
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I have to hurry up and get on the Shinkansen.

225
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What do you mean, hurry up?

226
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What do you mean, hurry up?

227
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I have to hurry up and get on the Shinkansen.

228
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I have to hurry up and get on the Shinkansen.

229
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Today, you shouldn't be talking like usual.

230
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No, no, no, I'm talking really fast.

231
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But time is time.

232
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What are you talking about?

233
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm talking really fast.

234
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's why...

235
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I always talk a lot.

236
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No, this program is...

237
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's being edited a lot.

238
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's always being edited.

239
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I've been filming in the dressing room, but I can't hear anything.

240
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's right.

241
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm editing, so today there's no way to edit.

242
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is going to be like the Kampake.

243
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So I'm not going to put any scissors in.

244
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm going to just let it flow.

245
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm going to just let it flow.

246
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't want to say anything stupid.

247
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I've put scissors in.

248
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll put it in.

249
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll put it in.

250
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I can't use this.

251
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You're not going to say anything?

252
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't want to say anything stupid.

253
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're the one who says it yourself, so time...

254
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You're the one who says it yourself, so time...

255
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's why...

256
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You're the one who says it yourself, so time...

257
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The other day...

258
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And now the time has come again.

259
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I went to Bangkok.

260
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah, yeah.

261
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I went there. What's so funny about that?

262
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I went there.

263
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
At that time, I think everyone was watching it on TV.

264
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, really?

265
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We went to Bangkok to look for Sokkuri-san.

266
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Bangkok? Yes, yes, yes.

267
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What's so funny about that?

268
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I was Sokkuri of Matsumoto.

269
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Matsumoto went to look for my Sokkuri-san.

270
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Thai, Bangkok Thai, right?

271
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We went there.

272
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We did a lot of hot filming.

273
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yes, yes, yes.

274
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What do you call that thing over there?

275
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You know, there's a lot of humidity.

276
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's like Japan's summer.

277
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It was so hot that I couldn't stand it anymore.

278
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No, seriously.

279
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It was really hot.

280
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
We did a lot of filming.

281
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
My Sokkuri didn't look like Thai at all.

282
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's right. It didn't look like Thai at all.

283
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's European style.

284
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
No, it's not.

285
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There's no mistake.

286
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't want to laugh.

287
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't want to laugh.

288
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There's no mistake.

289
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't want to laugh.

290
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't want to laugh.

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
No, it's not.

292
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You're from the Philippines.

293
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What did you say?

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If you went to the Philippines, there would be a lot of them.

295
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Is that so?

296
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yes.

297
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There wouldn't be any in Thailand.

298
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There were a lot in Thailand.

299
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, it's the beach.

300
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There were a lot in Thailand.

301
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh, it's the beach.

302
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh, it's the beach.

303
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's too much to say, but mine was really similar.

304
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It was similar, right?

305
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Thai men don't know Japanese at all.

306
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes, yes, yes.

307
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But for some reason, Japanese women know a lot of Japanese.

308
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
They sing a lot of Japanese songs.

309
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They sing a lot of Japanese songs at karaoke.

310
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There are a lot of contact people.

311
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
There are a lot of contact people.

312
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You idiot.

313
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Seriously.

314
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, it's hot.

315
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Your wife said,

316
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
do you want to have a baby?

317
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't have any, why?

318
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I've never done this before.

319
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm holding back now, I want to have a baby.

320
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I want to have a baby.

321
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We're going to,

322
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
soon,

323
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
we're going to start promoting Unacore.

324
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes, yes, yes.

325
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Don't say things like that.

326
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's going to be a promotion.

327
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
When it's good, it's going to be Unacore.

328
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
If you want to promote Unacore,

329
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
you have to go to Chinchinkai.

330
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's no good.

331
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Is that so?

332
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
If you go there,

333
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
when you're a student,

334
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
you should learn English a little more.

335
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If you ask me if I can speak English,

336
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
it would be a problem.

337
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I should have studied English a little more.

338
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
When I was in junior high school,

339
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I started learning English in the first year of junior high school.

340
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It starts with,

341
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is a pen.

342
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

343
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I quickly lost sight of it.

344
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But look,

345
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
there are a lot of musicians coming to Japan now.

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Are they called Gaitare?

347
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Who came to Japan the other day?

348
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What?

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The other day...

350
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Who was it?

351
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Rolling Stones.

352
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes, yes, yes.

353
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What are they doing now?

354
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You should go.

355
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You can't study like that.

356
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I didn't see it.

357
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Have you ever been to such a fashionable concert?

358
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What kind of concert is fashionable?

359
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You!

360
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Wait!

361
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What?

362
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
When I was in junior high school,

363
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
there was only Mizue Takada who was taken by you.

364
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What is this?

365
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I was there,

366
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
but you went to Mick Jagger.

367
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Well, that's...

368
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You've never been there, have you?

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
If you want to study,

370
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
you don't have to be interested in it.

371
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You don't have to force yourself to see it.

372
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I've never seen it.

373
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Mizue Takada was certainly in the front,

374
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
so I thought,

375
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, Mizue Takada.

376
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I wish I had that kind of feeling,

377
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
but when I saw Mick Jagger in front of me,

378
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I thought,

379
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Oh, what a disgusting guy.

380
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You shouldn't say that.

381
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So,

382
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
tell me what you've been to.

383
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
First of all,

384
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I've been to Mick Jagger.

385
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You can think of it as Mizue Takada.

386
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Mick Jagger.

387
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Mick Jagger.

388
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Junko Sakurada.

389
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What about you?

390
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Mick Jagger.

391
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I've been to Mick Jagger.

392
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And then,

393
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Madonna.

394
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I've been to Madonna.

395
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I haven't been there.

396
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I haven't been there.

397
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I really wanted to go there.

398
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So,

399
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I went to Osaka Stadium.

400
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Madonna came to Osaka Stadium.

401
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
At that time,

402
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I lived really close to Osaka Stadium.

403
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I wanted to go there,

404
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
so when Madonna's concert was about to begin,

405
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I opened the window and listened to it like this.

406
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's outside, so I can't hear it.

407
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I can't hear it,

408
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
but it's faintly...

409
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Fuu.

410
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Are you kidding me?

411
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I can't hear it.

412
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
No way.

413
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Fuu.

414
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I can't say Fuu at the Yoppo-no-Mukoro.

415
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That's right.

416
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That's right.

417
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I can't hear it.

418
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I can't say Fuu until you come to me.

419
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I couldn't hear the Laika version,

420
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
but I can hear Fuu for some reason.

421
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I just put air in the gap.

422
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's weird.

423
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So,

424
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
when I hear it, I'm like,

425
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What?

426
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Ah,

427
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
search for Morita.

428
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What is that?

429
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I really liked Moritemucho.

430
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Are you looking down on me?

431
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Go to the hell!

432
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I had only been to Osaka's Festival Hall once,

433
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and it was a drift.

434
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're nasty!

435
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I watched it when I was a kid,

436
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
bam, bam, bam, bam, bam...

437
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It was amazing.

438
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Drift is the god of children.

439
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
When I was a kid, I was a kid who ran around in sports shoes.

440
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I was a kid who ran around in sports shoes.

441
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You were able to run from the audience seat at that time?

442
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I was able to run.

443
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Hey! The kids at the Festival Hall are delicious!

444
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Here.

445
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

446
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I have something to tell you.

447
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll introduce it to you.

448
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm having fun watching it every week.

449
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Show them your face.

450
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
When I was doing the tricycle race, I went to the venue and watched it for a long time.

451
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
When the two of us were doing the race, we talked a lot with the manager, Mr. Nitta.

452
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
At that time, I was talking about the SM fashion.

453
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Do you know how I feel when I'm dressed like this?

454
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What are you going to do with an amateur?

455
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I've been saying it all the time.

456
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I don't like it.

457
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Chikuri is coming.

458
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I don't like it.

459
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't like it a little bit.

460
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's okay if you don't like it a little bit.

461
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's why I feel like SM is okay.

462
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm tired of it.

463
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's why I'm thinking of a new corner.

464
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Nitta?

465
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's called the coordinate corner.

466
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's clear.

467
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I've been thinking about it.

468
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Coordinate corner.

469
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yes.

470
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm looking for what kind of clothes you want me to wear on a daily basis.

471
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'll recruit you.

472
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'll choose the clothes you want me to wear today.

473
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's right.

474
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Let's do that.

475
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Thank you very much for today.

476
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'll write it down.

477
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Why are you twisting your neck?

478
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
This is from Saitama Prefecture.

479
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Uchida Yuki-chan.

480
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You two have been on the program from 1961 to 1962.

481
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You were on the program.

482
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Is it true that you were in the clothes of human hair?

483
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's true.

484
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You were on the program, weren't you?

485
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's an imaginary program.

486
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's an imaginary program.

487
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Don't you know?

488
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm wearing a plush on such a big surface.

489
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
My tongue is moving.

490
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

491
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Wait a minute.

492
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You laughed at me.

493
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I didn't laugh much.

494
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What?

495
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It would be more interesting if there was a story about your work.

496
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
If you did something like this.

497
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
If it was a commercial that aired in Tokyo a long time ago,

498
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Mr. Donut.

499
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Hey, Mr. Donut was on the show.

500
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's the first time.

501
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's the first time I've been on a commercial.

502
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I don't know anything.

503
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I was walking with such a big donut.

504
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Don't you know?

505
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's why Mr. George and Mr. Hayashi Katagiri.

506
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You shot it in Harajuku, didn't you?

507
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
In Harajuku.

508
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
With such a big donut in the back.

509
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Donut, donut.

510
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's delicious.

511
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm eating Yudotan.

512
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I don't know.

513
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Well, I don't know.

514
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But I don't remember seeing it.

515
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Do you know that there was such a commercial?

516
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I know.

517
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It was on the edge of the screen.

518
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It was there.

519
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
To be honest, I can't see it in the morning.

520
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Because the time comes out.

521
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It comes out at 8 o'clock.

522
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It was around here.

523
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It was on top of Matsumoto's face.

524
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I don't know.

525
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I see.

526
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And there was a line.

527
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Matsumoto was talking.

528
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We were sitting on the counter.

529
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
No matter where you look, the line is the line.

530
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
There was.

531
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh, it's us.

532
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's so nostalgic.

533
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I don't know much.

534
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I see.

535
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well, that's right.

536
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
There are other things in Tokyo.

537
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Well, there are various things happening in Yokyosaki.

538
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
There are various fun things.

539
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Well, that's right.

540
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Once before.

541
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Where was it?

542
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
When we went somewhere.

543
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
When we were doing a manzai, a kid.

544
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
He was walking around us.

545
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
While we were doing a manzai.

546
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He was cutting the front and the side.

547
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The two of them came up and said,

548
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Do something about this guy.

549
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
We caught him on the stage.

550
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He took off all his clothes.

551
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
He took off his pants.

552
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
He took off his pants.

553
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
He took off his pants.

554
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He took off his pants.

555
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We were laughing together.

556
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
After that, the president there.

557
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Please take a picture with us.

558
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
He brought his family.

559
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That kid did that.

560
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Then the kid went to Masumoto.

561
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
He said, Don't ever come here again.

562
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Bang!

563
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
He said that.

564
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Well, he was the president.

565
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
He was the president's son.

566
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

567
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He was like,

568
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You idiot.

569
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
He held his head up.

570
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He closed his eyes a little.

571
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Well, in terms of the picture,

572
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It was a warm feeling.

573
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Until then, he took off his pants.

574
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
He took off his pants.

575
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I thought of a new impersonation.

576
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Well, if you don't have time,

577
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
How many times do you do it?

578
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Tamaki Koji.

579
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's a new product.

580
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Everyone is doing Tamaki.

581
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Mine is a little different.

582
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What's the difference?

583
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Why?

584
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Why do you say that?

585
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's a little different.

586
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's a little different?

587
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What's the difference?

588
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's not that similar.

589
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You can't say that it's an impersonation.

590
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But I feel something attractive.

591
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Are you crazy?

592
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm a little crazy.

593
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Tamaki Koji.

594
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What's that?

595
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Why?

596
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That's my name.

597
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What's a little different?

598
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why?

599
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Shinichi Mori.

600
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
This is an impersonation.

601
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm not confident at all.

602
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's not funny at all.

603
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
First of all, it's an impersonation.

604
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Good evening.

605
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Shinichi Mori.

606
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Everyone has done this before.

607
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's certainly similar.

608
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's not similar.

609
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's not similar.

610
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Anyone can do it if it's a man.

611
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But this is what everyone has done.

612
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I don't want to do Shinichi Mori anymore.

613
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Shinichi Mori in the morning.

614
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You all know what I mean, right?

615
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Good morning.

616
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What's that?

617
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
This is a lie.

618
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's a lie?

619
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Kusagari Masao.

620
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Really?

621
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Good evening.

622
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Kusagari Masao.

623
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You idiot.

624
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What's that?

625
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Why are you doing that?

626
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
This is a male teacher.

627
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Well, let's go home today.

628
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'll do my Kusagari Masao impersonation.

629
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Let's connect from the part where you say thank you very much.

630
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'll do that and go home.

631
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm sorry, Kusagari Masao.

632
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That's it.

633
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It was pretty good, wasn't it?

634
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
That's it.

635
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I have a lot of requests for everyone today.

636
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
First of all, I want to ask you for an idea.

637
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What kind of costume are you going to wear?

638
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Second, I want you to think about the costume of Nitta Atsuo.

639
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Nitta Atsuo costume big plan.

640
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's a big plan.

641
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
If you're good at drawing, you're good at drawing.

642
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yes.

643
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I want you to draw with these clothes.

644
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Nitta Atsuo, of course, but there are a lot of other staff.

645
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I want you to do it.

646
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What?

647
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I want you to do it with Saito.

648
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That's a good idea.

649
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I always take you to a cold location.

650
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm doing it in the car on my side.

651
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I see.

652
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I want you to do it with Saito.

653
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Saito doesn't wear anything.

654
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm going to take a car on a one-way street.

655
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm going to leave Nitta Atsuo for now.

656
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That's right.

657
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm going to make my grandfather wear something like that.

658
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That's also pretty funny.

659
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's funny.

660
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I want you to do a lot of things.

661
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I want you to do everything the same.

662
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm going to leave Nitta Atsuo.

663
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I want you to wear more and more clothes.

664
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I want you to take it off a little more.

665
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I want you to do it with Saito.
