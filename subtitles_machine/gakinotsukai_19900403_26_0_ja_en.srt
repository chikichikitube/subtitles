00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Atami Indy's secret mission!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What's up?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's just say it for today.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're here at Atami today.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're here at Atami Indy's secret mission.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We're here at Atami, but it's a little cold today.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's cold!

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's been raining a little.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Today, at Atami,

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
as you can see from our clothes,

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
we're going to be Indy Jones.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't get it at all.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
A helicopter!

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Our helicopter is going to teach us how to fly a kite.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's going to fly from the top.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Here we go!

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's heavy!

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Do you have a flashlight?

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll use it.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Do you have one?

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't have one.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Did you find it?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I found it!

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What does it say?

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What?

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What does it say?

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Tomaru Hotel, Blover Station.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This is the same!

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But if we don't look at it,

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and if we get it wrong,

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
we'll get chased away.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't get it!

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This program is brought to you by Sunlux.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Can we search for treasure

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
by following the instructions?

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What?

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This is it.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is it.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is the man's room.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There's a man's room and a woman's room.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There's a man's room and a woman's room.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hello.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hello.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hello.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hello.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hello.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hello.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Hello.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hello.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Where is it?

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Dad, I need you to put a mosaic on this.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh, really.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What's on your dad's towel?

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's like...

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's like I got a piece of Kentucky.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's on the screen.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Please show it to the towel.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's a big party.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Wow.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Hello.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is amazing.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What's this?

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a big party.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I didn't know they prepared something like this.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If you win,

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll give you instructions.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Really?

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I got it.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Get on.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm used to playing in a tea house.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Please teach me how to do it.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm not a dancer.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're not?

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This is the bedroom.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm not a dancer.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Miss Sugoroku.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Miss Sugoroku.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You look like you used to be a comedian.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Nice to meet you.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
With this lady.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Miss Atami.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's right.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll do it.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I lost.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I lost.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I should have lost.

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I should have lost.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I should have won.

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes.

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Are you ready?

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes.

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll start.

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Out.

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Safe.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I got it.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Wow.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're dirty.

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What are you doing?

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's okay.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
From Tasuki?

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
From Tasuki?

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
One, two, three, four.

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
One, two, three, four.

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
One, two, three, four.

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I want to be hugged.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Idiot.

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I see.

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's it?

117
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's it?

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Today is a service, right?

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's it.

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you ready?

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll start.

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, nine, ten.

124
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Out.

125
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Safe.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I got it.

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You're so bad.

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You should have lost.

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I lost.

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I should have lost.

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I should have won.

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I got it.

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's okay.

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You did it.

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Will you show us the kind of fight again?

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Where is it?

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't know.

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Here it is.

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Here it is.

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What?

142
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's my turn.

143
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You have to do this.

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You should hit like this.

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You're bad.

146
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I should have seen.

147
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Ah! That's it!

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's go to Atami Castle.

149
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I can't do anything else.

150
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
For whom is this for?

151
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's go to Atami Castle by this.

152
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's go to Atami Castle by this.

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I hate Atami the most in Japan.

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't think so.

155
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't think so.

156
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't think so.

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't think so.

158
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't think so.

159
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't think so.

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't think so.

161
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't think so.

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let's go to Atami Castle by this.

163
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's go to Atami Castle by this.

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There is a command post.

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Really?

166
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I can't go there.

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I can't go there.

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Please.

169
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I can't go there.

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Please, find the sea that said,

171
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's go to Atami Castle by this.

172
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Please, find the sea that said,

173
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's go to Atami Castle by this.

174
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's a beautiful place.

176
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Thank you very much.

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Look at yourself. I'll look at the other side.

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm looking for the sea.

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Found it?

180
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Found it!

181
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I found it!

182
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Atami Castle.

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's a castle that can defeat enemies.

184
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's go to Atami Castle.

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
To defeat the enemies.

186
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes.

187
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What are you looking at?

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Look at this kid's face.

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
This kid is amazing.

190
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He looks like he's having fun.

191
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But in a observatory like this,

192
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
when a child is put on something like this,

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
it's before he can throw it away.

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You can't throw it away in a few minutes.

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm really bad at this.

197
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm going to live alone.

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Do you understand?

199
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
When I grow up, I want to be a professional wrestler like Oninichan.

200
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's not that rough.

201
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's not rough.

202
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's crisp.

203
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's good, isn't it?

204
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If you can hit it every time, it's hard to hit it this way.

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I want to be an all-star.

206
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I want to be an all-star.

207
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
A match between Shizuki Combat and Yuero.

208
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Who's going to be the all-star and the star?

209
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Sorry.

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I have a gun like this, so don't turn around behind me.

211
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
People will fly.

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What is that sensei's attitude?

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What is that sensei's attitude?

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Is that attitude right?

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Who are these guys?

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Who are they?

217
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Wait a minute.

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
These guys are pretty good.

219
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Don't come near me.

220
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What is this?

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't come near me. You'll regret it.

222
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It hurts.

223
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What hurts?

224
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Run away.

225
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Run away.

226
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Are you still coming?

227
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Everyone, let's have a fight.

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Behind you.

229
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
There, there, there.

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There, there, there.

231
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I did it.

232
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What is this?

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What is this?

234
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There, there, there.

235
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
There, there, there.

236
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
There.

237
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What are these guys?

238
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They're not cool.

239
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
There.

240
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm scared.

241
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm scared.

242
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm scared.

243
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There, there, there.

244
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
There, there, there.

245
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Alright, we did it.

246
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I can't take it anymore.

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So, we beat them up.

248
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Of course.

249
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But this scene is scary.

250
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This dinosaur?

251
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Running in the car at night and falling like this.

252
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's unbearable.

253
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's scary.

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Ah, it was scary.

255
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What is this?

256
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What is this?

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What is this?

258
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Ah, there, there, there.

259
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
There, there, there.

260
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There, there, there.

261
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Everyone.

262
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
There.

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There, there, there.

264
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Why did you come back?

265
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's scary, isn't it?

266
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes.

267
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's different, isn't it?

268
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Ah.

269
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't do something like Ajiro Okawa.

270
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Why did you come back and rest?

271
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's a bit...

272
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I've been working out lately.

273
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's different, isn't it?

274
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's a good thing.

275
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I've been working out.

276
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I've been working out.

277
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The color of your body is the same as the color of the rock at the starting point.

278
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Hey, George.

279
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You said you were going to run.

280
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's right.

281
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You said you were going to run.

282
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Ah.

283
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Look at the rock.

284
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
There.

285
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
There.

286
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There.

287
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
There.

288
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There.

289
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
There.

290
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
There.

291
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There.

292
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
There.

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There.

294
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
There.

295
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There.

296
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
There.

297
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Ah, I was surprised.

298
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I was surprised.

299
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This is the secret.

300
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What are you wearing?

301
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Let me see.

302
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's a vinyl.

303
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
There is sand in my neck.

304
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Put more sand in.

305
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'll eat this.

306
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's cold.

307
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You are like the opening of the movie.

308
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You are like the opening of the movie.

309
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's not.

310
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Put more sand in.

311
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'll make you a turtle neck.

312
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,160
Big mouth mould...

313
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,600
Just like Satoro.

314
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,600
It's so much fun.

315
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,560
Right, Hamada! Keep only this!

316
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,540
Oh, indeed!

317
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,540
I can't take it anymore.

318
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,540
I can't take it anymore.

319
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,540
I can't take it anymore.

320
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,540
Help me.

321
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,540
What do you mean, help me?

322
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,540
It's not funny at all.

323
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,540
It's not funny at all.

324
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,540
It's not funny at all.

325
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,540
What's that?

326
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,540
That's CX.

327
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,540
What?

328
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,540
Go away.

329
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,540
Go away.

330
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,540
How did you like it?

331
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,540
Yes.

332
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,540
Today, we tried to do the best version.

333
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,540
This is the best version?

334
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,540
Yes.

335
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,540
We came to Atami.

336
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,540
We spent a lot of money.

337
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,540
That's right.

338
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,540
Are you selling this?

339
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,540
Yes.

340
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,540
Really?

341
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,540
Yes.

342
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,540
Where?

343
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,540
Helicopters and such.

344
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,540
That's not it.

345
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,540
Helicopters to give orders from above.

346
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,540
That's right.

347
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,540
The balance is strange from the side.

348
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,540
Then, shall we introduce the postcards?

349
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,540
Yes.

350
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,540
There are no customers.

351
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,540
Are you introducing without customers?

352
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,540
I'm introducing without customers.

353
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,540
Right?

354
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,540
I'll send you the result of the survey.

355
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,540
What is it?

356
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,540
The person you want to be a lover with.

357
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,540
Number one.

358
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
Mr. Nitta.

359
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,540
No comments below.

360
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,540
The person you want to be kind with.

361
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,540
Mr. Nitta.

362
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,540
No comments below.

363
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
The person you want to be a brother with.

364
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,540
Mr. Nitta.

365
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
No comments below.

366
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,540
The person you want to be the father of your child.

367
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,540
Mr. Matsumoto.

368
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,540
No comments below.

369
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,540
Please don't tease Mr. Nitta too much.

370
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,540
I'll accept the prize.

371
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,540
I'll accept it.

372
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,540
I'll accept it.

373
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,540
Mr. Nitta is very popular these days.

374
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,540
Don't tease Mr. Nitta too much.

375
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,540
Why?

376
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,540
I think.

377
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,540
Yes.

378
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,540
From now on, I'm going to do more and more.

379
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,540
Yes.

380
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,540
I've been thinking about what I'm missing.

381
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,540
What?

382
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,540
What do you think is missing?

383
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,540
What?

384
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,540
Warmth.

385
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,540
I have it.

386
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,540
I don't have it.

387
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,540
I don't have it today.

388
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,540
Are you stupid?

389
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,540
Let's be a little warmer.

390
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,540
It's warmer when we're in contact with each other.

391
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,540
Where did you go?

392
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,540
Really?

393
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,540
Even if you go to work.

394
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,540
Yes.

395
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,540
I did something rude the other day.

396
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,540
What did you do?

397
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,540
No, it's okay.

398
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,540
If I tell you, I'll talk like this again.

399
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,540
You can say that.

400
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,540
Yes.

401
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,540
I'm a little stupid.

402
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,540
This guy.

403
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,540
That's why.

404
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,540
It's okay.

405
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,540
I was surprised.

406
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,540
I was surprised and I thought it was parallel.

407
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,540
That's right.

408
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,540
It's on the show.

409
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,540
That's right.

410
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,540
After the show.

411
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,540
The next story.

412
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,540
No, I'm going to talk about that.

413
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,540
At that time.

414
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,540
Nozawa passed in front of us.

415
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,540
I hit Nozawa's head.

416
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,540
That's fine.

417
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,540
It's the same office.

418
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,540
I thought I was a senior.

419
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,540
I'm a senior, too.

420
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,540
That's fine.

421
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,540
Behind him.

422
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,540
Who was it?

423
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,540
I don't know.

424
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,540
There's a reason for the super cup.

425
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,540
Kazama Morio.

426
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,540
Nozawa passed in front of me.

427
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,540
I hit Nozawa's head.

428
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,540
Kazama Morio came behind him.

429
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,540
He hit Kazama Morio's head.

430
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,540
There's a reason for the super cup.

431
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:59,540
He's like this.

432
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,540
He's like this.

433
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,540
I saw him.

434
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,540
He didn't break.

435
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,540
I said,

436
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,540
I'm sorry.

437
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,540
I want you to stop.

438
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,540
I can't do that.

439
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,540
What's next?

440
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,540
Next.

441
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,540
I'll talk about this.

442
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,540
A survey again?

443
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,540
No, it's not a survey.

444
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,540
Please compare which one is better.

445
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,540
What?

446
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,540
Popularity.

447
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,540
There's a big difference, isn't there?

448
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,540
My target is from the wider part.

449
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,540
From the bottom to the top.

450
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,540
Is that so?

451
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,540
You're only from the bottom.

452
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,540
You look like you can do it.

453
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,540
I look like I can do it?

454
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,540
Your eyes are wide open.

455
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,540
How old do you think I look like I can do it?

456
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,540
You're about 12 years younger than me.

457
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,540
Yes, I have 12 kids at home.

458
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:56,540
What are you talking about?

459
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,540
I don't have any savings.

460
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,540
Really?

461
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,540
Yes.

462
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,540
How much do you have?

463
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,540
I don't have any money.

464
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,540
You only have a few hundred thousand yen.

465
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:13,540
How much would it cost if I told you to prepare 10 million by tomorrow?

466
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,540
You have to wait until next month's salary.

467
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,540
I don't have any money.

468
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,540
You have to wait until next month's salary.

469
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,540
You only have a few hundred thousand yen.

470
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,540
How much would it cost if I told you to prepare 10 million by tomorrow?

471
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:37,540
I have the same amount of money as you.

472
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,540
Compared to that, you only have a few hundred thousand yen.

473
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,540
How much would it cost?

474
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,540
I don't have any money.

475
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,540
That's not what I'm talking about.

476
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,540
Are you kidding me?

477
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,540
Idiot!

478
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,540
I was going to say the same thing.

479
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,540
I was going to say the same thing.

480
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,540
I was going to say the same thing.

481
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,540
I was going to say the same thing.

482
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:18,540
You're late.

483
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,540
That's true.

484
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,540
I've been working for years.

485
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,540
But I'm late.

486
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,540
You're late.

487
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,540
You're not good at work.

488
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,540
You're not good at work.

489
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,540
Why?

490
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,540
Why aren't you working?

491
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,540
I'm not late.

492
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,540
That's why I'm working.

493
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:50,540
I don't know if you think I'm late for work,

494
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,540
but I'm always late for work.

495
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,540
I see.

496
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,540
That's why I'm late.

497
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,540
What about you?

498
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,540
What?

499
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,540
What about you?

500
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,540
Me?

501
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,540
Yes.

502
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,540
What about you?

503
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:13,540
Are you having a hard time?

504
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,540
Are you crying?

505
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,540
What's that?

506
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,540
You look like you're having a hard time.

507
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,540
I think I'm going to sleep.

508
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,540
This is a quiz.

509
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,540
Think about it together.

510
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,540
There's a refrigerator.

511
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,540
I want to put an elephant in there.

512
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,540
There are three conditions.

513
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,540
What are they?

514
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,540
What are they?

515
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,540
First of all, you have to wake up.

516
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,540
And?

517
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,540
And?

518
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,540
There are three conditions.

519
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,540
Let's see.

520
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,540
Open the refrigerator.

521
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,540
Put an elephant in.

522
00:21:50,540 --> 00:22:01,540
Close the refrigerator door.

523
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,540
That's amazing.

524
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,540
There's another one.

525
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,540
There's another one.

526
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
Let's do another one.

527
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,540
Put a giraffe in there this time.

528
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,540
And there are four conditions.

529
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,540
What are they?

530
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,540
Open the refrigerator door.

531
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,540
Open.

532
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,540
Put a giraffe in.

533
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:23,540
Close the lid.

534
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,540
What's that?

535
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,540
There's another one.

536
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,540
Put a outlet.

537
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,540
That's it.

538
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,540
It's going to be a big one.

539
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,540
What are the conditions?

540
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,540
Open the front door.

541
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,540
Close it.

542
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,540
Open the refrigerator door.

543
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:53,540
Put an elephant in.

544
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,540
It's connected to the previous story.

545
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,540
That's the old man's fault.

546
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,540
Put an elephant in.

547
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,540
Close the lid.

548
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,540
It's funny.

549
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,540
That's it.

550
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,540
This is the Atami version.

551
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,540
And then, as I say every week,

552
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:20,540
I'm going to show you how to coordinate with Nitta.

553
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:26,540
Next week, I'd like to do an opening related to that.

554
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,540
I'll show you everything.

555
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,540
I'll see you next week.

556
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,540
I'll see you next week.

557
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,540
I'll see you next week.

558
00:23:35,540 --> 00:24:01,540
Bye.
