1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's do it!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you very much.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you ask me to do it, I'll do it right away.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's fine, but there's no All-Star among 18 people.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What do you mean?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
All-Star, right?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, there were 18 people, so I had 9 people selected, and now I'm going to bet on the draft.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
After that, I'll do a baseball game, and the losing team will be punished.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't need a par-man number two.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Actually, I don't have one either.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And I want to avoid Otomo.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Are you betting on the par-man number two?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What do you mean by betting?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Do you have a par-man number two in this baseball game?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
No, I don't.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Then I don't have one either.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't have a par-man number two in this baseball game.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No, you don't.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, let's see how the players are doing before the draft.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Number 3, the one selling 90kg, is Sakanishi.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is Toshiaki Sakanishi.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He's pretty sharp.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Really?

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, that's what everyone thinks.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, really?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He's not as good as he looks.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Is he a horse?

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I see.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He's eating to be able to eat.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Please eat.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is Producer Suga.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This guy is...

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Is he really strong?

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No, of course not.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I knew it.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He's from Tokyo.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, he's a little...

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He's like Kunaki Kajo.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Wow, he's really something.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
His sister is Kimiko Ikegami.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Really?

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Really?

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes, really.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is Saito, the chief director.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, Saito looks like he's selling something.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He's doing his best.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What are you saying?

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What?

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What are you saying?

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't think I need this.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You don't need it?

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, it can't be helped.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's a good deal.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
10 out of 10.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This guy is pretty good.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I just want it.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's okay.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I have a feeling.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This guy has been coming to Yoshihiriyano since 3 o'clock.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, really?

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Isn't he your friend?

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, that's right.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There's no one I want.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Your friend?

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
My friend.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You hit him with your palm?

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You hit him with your palm, didn't you?

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's so lame.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What is this?

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're amazing.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're amazing.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You're so weird.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're amazing.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're so grotesque after you hit him.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You're so grotesque after you hit him.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Now, let's have a draft meeting.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Now, let's have Mr. Wakabayashi, the director of Nihon TV, introduce himself.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Mr. Wakabayashi, please.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Thank you, Mr. Wakabayashi.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Please.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Thank you.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now, I will announce the names of the players.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
First, Team Matsumoto.

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
First place.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Noriyasu Hiromitsu.

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
22 years old.

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Team Zero.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Team Tamada.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
First place.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Noriyasu Hiromitsu.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
22 years old.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Team Zero.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Now that the names are overlapped, we will have a lottery.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The person who draws the red ball will win.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The person who draws the blue ball will win.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
As a result of the lottery, the first place goes to Noriyasu Hiromitsu.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
22 years old.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Team Zero.

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Team Matsumoto.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Second place.

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Team Matsumoto.

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Kawano Tooru.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
46 years old.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Tokyo Agency.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What are you doing with such an old man?

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Team Tamada.

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Second place.

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Nitta Atsuo.

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
25 years old.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Manager.

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Fifth place.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Team Matsumoto.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Sakamoto Hidenao.

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
32 years old.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Manager.

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm pretty strong, aren't I?

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Are you okay?

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm fine.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm not just batting, I'm also good at defense.

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Please suffer after death.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'll fire you.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That means there are only two people left.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yamazaki Chiebunsharo.

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Ohtomo Edi.

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Pama No.2.

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And the writer, Adachi Motoichi.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This is hard.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't care.

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm more worried than when I went to Thailand.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What?

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't care if there are two Pamas.

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What are you talking about?

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't care.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What are you talking about?

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Matsumoto Hidenao.

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
32 years old.

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Manager.

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm not just batting, I'm also good at defense.

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Please suffer after death.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Good evening.

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Good evening.

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Today's audience seems to be in good spirits.

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
In good spirits?

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How should I put it?

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I feel close to them.

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't feel like I've met them for the first time.

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Next time, we're going to play a new punishment game.

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We're going to play a new punishment game.

154
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
There are a lot of things that we have to decide on.

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What Hamada is going to do...

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Why?

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We're not playing a game, we're not deciding on the winner.

158
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This time, it's baseball.

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We're going to play baseball.

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We'll be divided into the Matsumoto and the Hamada teams.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Downs and Towns.

162
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We'll have to put in 9 or 8 staff members.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We'll have to put in 9 or 8 staff members.

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The team that loses gets punished.

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We've decided on that.

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We've decided on the members too.

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We've decided.

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We've decided today.

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes, yes, yes.

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So, the punishment game is going to be with 9 losers.

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You've done it one by one, right?

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You or I.

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes, yes, yes.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This time, the whole team is responsible.

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What are we going to do with 9 people?

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Everyone's talking about a lot of things.

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What?

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
As a plan.

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Another scary thing.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
First, the plan is that all 9 people lose their eyebrows.

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You have to walk around Kabukicho at night like this.

182
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This is pretty scary, isn't it?

183
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The camera is also hidden.

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The camera is also hidden.

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You have to walk around with your head rolled up.

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's a little dangerous, isn't it?

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is the first thing.

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The other thing is that all 9 people have to take off their shoulders.

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So, their arms go like this.

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Then, they go into the cage and become a orangutan.

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
All 9 people have to pull out their teeth.

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
One at a time.

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Then, they put them into a box and take them off one by one.

194
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Then, they have to put them on.

195
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
There are also some in the back teeth.

196
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You have to put them on in the front.

197
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This is a masterpiece.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The rating is 29%.

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This guy.

200
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You can't get 29%?

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What's so sad about it?

202
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You lost, so you have to pull out your teeth.

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Even if you pull them out, you can put them on.

204
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's someone else's teeth!

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You don't know if it's your own teeth or not.

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't like that!

207
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You don't like other people's teeth?

208
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't like this one and that one.

209
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's the problem.

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You have to put them all in the front.

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's someone else's teeth, so that's the problem.

212
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You don't like the fact that you have to pull them out.

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Why?

214
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Why do you have to pull out healthy teeth?

215
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Even if they rot.

216
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
If you say that, why do you have to put them on?

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's a punishment game.

218
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You're complaining from the bottom of your heart.

219
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You don't have to say that.

220
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You don't have to hurt your body.

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What?

222
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What is that?

223
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What is that?

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You have to pull out your nipples.

225
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You can't complain about that.

226
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Why do you have to pull out your nipples when you're playing baseball?

227
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You can't cut your nipples when you're playing baseball.

228
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You can't cut them.

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
There's nothing you can do about it.

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Have you ever had a problem with your nipples?

231
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Is there something wrong with your nipples?

232
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Tell me.

233
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Have you ever helped someone with your nipples?

234
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
There's nothing wrong with that.

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You don't need that kind of nipples.

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You don't need that kind of nipples.

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't need that kind of nipples either.

238
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's strange if you don't have them.

239
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's strange.

240
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There's nothing wrong with showing your nipples.

241
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
If you have your nipples open and smooth, it's strange.

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What do you mean?

243
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You should have them more than you don't have them.

244
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You should have them more than you don't have them.

245
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
More than I don't have them?

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You...

247
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's strange that you don't have them.

248
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Really?

249
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's right.

250
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's a bit embarrassing that you don't have them.

251
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So, cut your nipples.

252
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Why should I cut them?

253
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Listen to me.

254
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Why should I cut them?

255
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's okay.

256
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't cut them.

257
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's okay.

258
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Listen to me.

259
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Why?

260
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll cut them.

261
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I can't throw them away.

262
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Even if you throw them away, don't cut them.

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I can't cut them and throw them away.

264
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Don't cut them.

265
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If I don't have them, it's a bit embarrassing.

266
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So, I'll put them here.

267
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If that's the case, it's not strange at all.

268
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's strange.

269
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's strange that you don't have them.

270
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You don't have them after you cut them.

271
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I have them.

272
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So, cut your nipples.

273
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Cut your nipples.

274
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'll cut them.

275
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll cut them.

276
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's right.

277
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So, what should I do?

278
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I have to do it with nine people.

279
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You'll make them do something, right?

280
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I was thinking about it.

281
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'll make a drama.

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
How about this?

283
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
A drama with a punishment game?

284
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll make a drama.

285
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The nine people who win are the main characters.

286
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll make a drama.

287
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I was thinking about it.

288
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I can't make a deadly drama.

289
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's about 15 minutes long.

290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The person who wins is the victim.

291
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So, the loser will be killed.

292
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I won't be killed.

293
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What will you do?

294
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I can't punish them in the drama.

295
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What kind of punishment will you give?

296
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Well, there is one person.

297
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There is also a punishment game.

298
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Really?

299
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's in the drama, so it's okay.

300
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's in English.

301
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Even if it's a punishment game.

302
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Pararan.

303
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Just say it normally.

304
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You have to say it in Japanese.

305
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Pararan.

306
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's enough.

307
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Pararan.

308
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Did you just say Pararan?

309
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't say Pararan.

310
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I've seen a lot of dramas.

311
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The drama of an amateur is quite interesting.

312
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's it.

313
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's a story about giving a punishment in the drama.

314
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I think it's pretty good.

315
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I think the setting is interesting.

316
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But it's about the punishment in the drama.

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What kind of punishment will you give?

318
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What kind of punishment will you give?

319
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What kind of punishment will you give?

320
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Can I give you a fire?

321
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I don't like it.

322
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You are a punishment.

323
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You can't give me a little pain.

324
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Then you will be punished, too.

325
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Then I'll give you a light.

326
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'll give you a light.

327
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't think so.

328
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'll give you a light.

329
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I don't think I wanted to give me a little pain.

330
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But you wanted to do it?

331
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's fine.

332
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You don't want to do it?

333
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But you want to do something.

334
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You'll give me a fire.

335
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll give you a long-lip.

336
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What kind of boy is today?

337
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hello.

338
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Hello.

339
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Hello.

340
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh, hello, hello.

341
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You have a strange name.

342
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Mr. Rasaru Ishii.

343
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
My name is Magnum Fox.

344
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
How old are you?

345
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm 35.

346
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm 35, a month old.

347
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I see.

348
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But in this program, I'm supposed to be like a leotard.

349
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'll prepare it for you.

350
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's what I'm supposed to do.

351
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh, I see.

352
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's decided.

353
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Wait a minute.

354
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm surprised.

355
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's decided.

356
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm going crazy right now.

357
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What the hell is he doing?

358
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's really...

359
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's my underwear attack.

360
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Did you put it out yourself?

361
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yes, I asked for it on TV.

362
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes, yes, yes.

363
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I asked the entertainer to put out a postcard.

364
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I saw it.

365
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm so happy.

366
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm so happy.

367
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's better than just a postcard.

368
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'll put out a letter of recommendation.

369
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's written in the photo.

370
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's written seriously.

371
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I want to be on TV for a while.

372
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm so happy.

373
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Look at this.

374
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What is it?

375
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
If you pass, the penalty is a failure.

376
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Thank you very much.

377
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm going to be played.

378
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yes.

379
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
At this angle.

380
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I didn't come here because I want to promote my play.

381
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Well, but this is...

382
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
This is the bottom of happiness.

383
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That's right.

384
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's at Hakuhinkan.

385
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes.

386
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It starts on February 20th.

387
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yes.

388
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The three red lights will be seen for the first time in a long time.

389
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes.

390
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Recently, Komiya-kun has been fishing all the time.

391
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Fishing?

392
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yes.

393
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
He's really into it.

394
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Please do your best.

395
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Thank you very much.

396
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Thank you very much for your direction.

397
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Thank you very much.

398
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'll remember it.

399
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes.

400
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Thank you very much.

401
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I thought a girl would come.

402
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I was surprised.

403
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I expected it.

404
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What's wrong with this?

405
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Is it your own play?

406
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
No, I'm doing it on the internet.

407
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh, I see.

408
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Thank you very much.

409
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's my own play.

410
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Thank you very much.

411
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I really didn't know.

412
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I really didn't hear it.

413
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Today, the girl who brought a letter said she was going to perform.

414
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh, really?

415
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I was surprised.

416
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's true.

417
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's true.

418
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It was a strange old man.

419
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's true.

420
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I was surprised.

421
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This person's pen name is Shitoko Matsumoto.

422
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yes.

423
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm a fan of Mach-chan.

424
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm a high school girl.

425
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Please listen to the story of my friend Emuko's mother.

426
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
One day, Emuko was watching the rerun of School Wars.

427
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
My mother came and said,

428
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Oh, School Wars.

429
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Is Anderson dead?

430
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
If you say that, it's an isopia.

431
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's an isopia.

432
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's an isopia.

433
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's an isopia.

434
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's an isopia.

435
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's an isopia.

436
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's an isopia.

437
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's an isopia.

438
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
By the way, Natsumi Ogawa misunderstood Noriko Ogawa and said,

439
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Hama-chan was a lolicon.

440
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
My mother said that.

441
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
My mother.

442
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Please say something to my mother.

443
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh, really?

444
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's a big joke.

445
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's a big joke.

446
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's a big joke.

447
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's a big joke.

448
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's a big joke.

449
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's a big joke.

450
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's a big joke, but it's true that Hamada is a lolicon.

451
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What?

452
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's you.

453
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You're a lolicon.

454
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You like white socks.

455
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Hey, hey, hey.

456
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Which one of you believes me?

457
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's me.

458
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yahoo!

459
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, yeah.

460
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm a lolicon.

461
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Hama-chan is a lolicon.

462
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Thank you.

463
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Hama-chan and Mach-chan, happy New Year.

464
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Well, well.

465
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Well, well.

466
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
By the way, this is a long time ago story, but please listen to this story until the end.

467
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's okay.

468
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
By the way, this is a long time ago story, but my friend's sister...

469
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What is this?

470
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's Okinawa, right?

471
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Hama-chan came to a bar in Okinawa.

472
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And at the karaoke of the bar, a woman who was born in Osaka or a song from the South Pole.

473
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
She didn't care about the song she requested.

474
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
This is my song.

475
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Suddenly, Hama-chan ran to the karaoke and started singing with two microphones so that no one could sing.

476
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Really?

477
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Even if you're a celebrity, you don't have to sing other people's songs.

478
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Are you so confident in your singing voice?

479
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Well, I'm afraid of Hama-chan, so I don't think ordinary people can say anything.

480
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Please keep up the good work.

481
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
By the way, Hama-chan loves Ultra Super Dynamic very much.

482
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh, really?

483
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I love it very much.

484
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's right.

485
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'll tell you why I read this letter.

486
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
In this letter, there is also Machan's Manojima.

487
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I can't forgive this kind of letter.

488
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's like a conversation that says something about me.

489
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What do you think, Mr. Matsumoto?

490
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
This kind of letter is rare, isn't it?

491
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What?

492
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I can't see myself in this letter.

493
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You don't have to say that.

494
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You don't have to make a fuss.

495
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm not good at writing letters.

496
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And I'm not good at cutting letters.

497
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't know how to use it.

498
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's a little different, isn't it?

499
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
This kind of letter makes me angry.

500
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's okay.

501
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's okay.

502
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
At least write something at the end.

503
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I will never accept this kind of letter again.

504
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You should write it.

505
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Machan, Hama-chan, Happy New Year.

506
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Mr. Kyoichi appeared on the show.

507
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That's right.

508
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I was surprised.

509
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I was surprised, too.

510
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I was surprised to see him on the show.

511
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I laughed because he was hiding somewhere at 6 o'clock.

512
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I couldn't find him.

513
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I would be grateful if the TV viewers could see him like this.

514
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You want to appear on the show, don't you?

515
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's right.

516
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Why don't you send me a letter?

517
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
When you appear on the show, you should wear a swimsuit.

518
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Women should wear a swimsuit.

519
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's right.

520
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's right.

521
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
If you're a man, you should wear a turtleneck.

522
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What about Peter?

523
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I don't think so.

524
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I don't think so.

525
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:59,000
If you give me 50, I'll give you what you like.

526
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I understand.

527
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And I can't think of a punishment game.

528
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's almost done.

529
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What's in it?

530
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
This is written by Takasu and Ichito Omodo.

531
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's an interesting mini-drama.

532
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'll give you a punishment game.

533
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll give you a punishment game.

534
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
On February 1st, a movie called Nihonkai will be released on Showa Teppu.

535
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
20 people will get a ticket to watch the movie.

536
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Two people?

537
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That's right.

538
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I can't watch a movie with two people.

539
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But you have to do it one by one.

540
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yesterday, I saw a movie in Shinjuku.

541
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's called Hamazama.

542
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Really?

543
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I don't know.

544
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I bought it.

545
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I don't know.

546
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I bought it.

547
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I bought it.

548
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
The 20th person can get tickets and the 30th person can get a ticket.

549
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'll give you your ticket.

550
