The super famous Hollywood directors came to the set to audition for the leading role.

The last time, Endo was deceived.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This time, the target is the two-shot Kofori, Chihara brothers Seiji, and the three 130R Hong Kong martial arts comedians.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What will be the outcome of the prank?

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Excuse me.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000

Now, if you are ready.

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
First of all, from the first person.

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:44,000

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000

Brother?

66
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No, no.

67
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I thought you were brothers because you were very similar.

68
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
No, not at all.

69
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes.

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Well, everyone, I really look forward to seeing you as a man with a hard coat.

71
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Now, I would like to move on to the next acting task.

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Bodyguard is.

73
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You can't keep your eyes off the client all the time.

74
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And you have to eat quickly.

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So, please eat the xiaolongbao you are about to serve quickly.

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Stand by, please.

77
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Wow.

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes.

79
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
One by one.

80
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.

81
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
First person, please.

82
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Anyway, speed up.

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Come on.

84
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Please eat faster, please eat faster.

85
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Then it's no use at all.

86
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's too late.

87
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Please eat faster.

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's ridiculous.

89
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If you are going to be late, please leave.

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Thank you for waiting.

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Mr. Thomas MacLagher, who played the role of Catwoman, who was late here, has arrived.

92
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Please.

93
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Hello.

94
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Hello.

95
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Do you like tempura?

96
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's a big one.

97
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you eat natto?

98
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes.

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Thank you.

100
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Then I would like you to show a little more acting.

101
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The enemy of bodyguards is not limited to humans only.

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Sometimes they are attacked by wild animals.

103
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So now I'm going to give you the pants.

104
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Think of it as a poisonous snake.

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The snake is about to be swallowed by the snake.

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Please act it out.

107
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Are you ready?

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes.

109
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Are you ready?

110
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Cut.

111
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Wonderful.

112
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It was a very Claude-like performance.

113
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Excellent.

114
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Next, I would like to see your sense of rhythm and dance.

115
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Please show a sexy dance to the enemy of the refrigerator.

116
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Are you ready?

117
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yes.

118
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Cut.

119
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Please dance more sexy.

120
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
More sexy.

121
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Please show your sense of rhythm.

122
00:10:49,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Cut.

123
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's enough.

124
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
OK.

125
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Fighting.

126
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It was wonderful.

127
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Well done.

128
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It was very wonderful.

129
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I was impressed.

130
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Brother?

131
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
No.

132
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Twins?

133
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No.

134
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Are you twins?

135
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Twins?

136
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No.

137
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Thank you.

138
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Next, the story is about bodyguards and heroines falling in love.

139
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I would like you to kiss the three of them.

140
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The first one, please kiss your husband.

141
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:21,000

142
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000

143
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It was wonderful.

144
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It was the story about falling in love.

145
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The second one, please kiss your boyfriend.

146
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Stand by, please.

147
00:12:40,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Action.

148
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
OK.

149
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000

150
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's enough.

151
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Beautiful.

152
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It was wonderful.

153
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Excellent.

154
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000

Very nice.

160
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It was wonderful.

161
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It was the love scene.

162
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
There may not be anyone who suits the love scene as much as you do.

163
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's what he said.

164
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It was wonderful.

165
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
OK.

166
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000

Next, please show us the action scene.

168

I will talk about you.

169
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Please record it.

170
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The genius IT boy will understand everything by recording.

171
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Please take a break.

172
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:10,000
OK.

173
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Cut.

174
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
OK.

175
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's enough.

176
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000

At this point, the three judges are lined up.

185
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
They are lined up perfectly.

You did it.

190
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It was wonderful.

191
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
OK.

192
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Then.

193
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The last audition.

194
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
OK.

195
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I would like to have the last audition.

196
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
OK.

197
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
There is a scene where the bodyguard is attacked in the climax scene.

198
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yes.

199
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I would like you to play that scene.

200
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Then, please change your clothes.

201
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yes.

202
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Please get ready.

203
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
OK.

204
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
OK.

205
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Then, the main character is the sushi restaurant owner.

206
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
In fact, he is a hitman who is after the heroine.

207
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Mr. Bob, please shoot the pistol.

208
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes.

209
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Please stand by.

210
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Please stand by.

211
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Excellent.

212
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Wonderful.

213
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Really wonderful.

214
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Thank you very much.

215
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
OK.

216
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It was a very wonderful audition.

217
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
OK.

218
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
OK.

219
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yes.

220
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Then, I would like you to enter the screening.

221
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Thank you very much.

222
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Thank you for waiting.

223
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I will announce the results of the audition.

224
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Mr. James, thank you.

225
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
OK.

226
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
OK.

227
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I will announce it.

228
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The bodyguard audition.

229
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The bodyguard is...

230
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Mr. Kato.

231
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Mr. Kato.

232
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yes.

233
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yes.

234
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Let me explain.

235
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes.

236
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yes.

237
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
He was the man I had been interested in since I entered this room.

238
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yes.

239
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes.

240
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
He said that his sweet mask was perfect for the image of the movie.

241
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yes.

242
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes.

243
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But he didn't do anything.

244
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But I want to see his Matsuken Samba.

245
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yes.

246
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yes.

247
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
He is doing Matsuken Samba right now.

248
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Matsuken Samba.

249
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Mr. Kato's Matsuken Samba.

250
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I would like to watch it.

251
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yes.

252
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yes.

253
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yes.

254
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes.

255
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yes.

256
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,840
Things You Don't Ever Want to Do

257
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,520
I drove all the way to Shijuku.

258
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:22,520
It wasn't such a big intersection, but I wanted to turn right, but if it was a small intersection, Yajirushi wouldn't come out, right?

259
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
Yes, yes, yes.

260
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,520
It would come out like this, right?

261
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:32,520
So that means there's no need to ignore the traffic lights.

262
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,520
That's right! You can't go there! You can't go there for the rest of your life!

263
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,520
But if you're in the middle of the intersection, you can go to Sugiyama-san.

264
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:48,520
I was thinking, I cannot go there since so many cars are going there, so I can't do that.

265
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,520
There were about 5 cars behind me.

266
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,520
And then it went like this.

267
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:58,520
And I said, the car in front, stop.

268
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,520
And then it stopped.

269
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,520
It's not like there are traffic lights or something like that here.

270
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
But you can clearly see that it's different, right?

271
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:14,520
Well, it's different, but here it's like Kansai's nori.

272
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
What kind of nori is that?

273
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Even in Kansai, it's red.

274
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
What about the traffic lights?

275
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
I thought it was a bit strange.

276
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,520
I usually tell them to stop, so they stop.

277
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,520
Then a police officer comes and says,

278
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,520
No, if you go like that, you'll become a traffic light.

279
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,520
I see.

280
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Huh?

281
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,520
This one has a lot of hope.

282
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
It's a traffic light!

283
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
I told you it's a traffic light.

284
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,520
I didn't say that!

285
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,520
You're becoming a traffic light.

286
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
Is this a movie?

287
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,520
It's like a movie that just came out.

288
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,520
Huh?

289
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
Just be careful.

290
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
That's right.

291
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,520
I didn't let him touch my face.

292
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,520
Oh, I'm going to get a heart attack.

293
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,520
Well, that's that.

294
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
That's what the police officer said.

295
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,520
It's a bit confusing these days.

296
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Can you let me check your car?

297
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
That's what happened.

298
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
But wait a minute.

299
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
You probably don't know me.

300
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,520
If you're a talent, you don't usually look at cars like that.

301
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
But this is it.

302
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,520
So that's how it ends.

303
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
That's what I think.

304
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,520
I'm not saying I don't like it here.

305
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,520
It's possible that you'll look at the car and be careful.

306
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,520
There's nothing to worry about being investigated.

307
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,520
I opened the trunk.

308
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,520
I was waiting.

309
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,520
There was another great man.

310
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
He came up to me and said,

311
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,520
Machan!

312
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
What are you doing, Machan?

313
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
That's no good.

314
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
I opened the trunk.

315
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,520
Hey, hey.

316
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
That's enough.

317
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Didn't you notice?

318
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
I was waiting.

319
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
That's enough.

320
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
You don't have to look at it.

321
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,520
I opened the trunk.

322
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,520
Machan, I'm sorry.

323
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,520
Let me just cut the tip.

324
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,520
No way!

325
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:50,520
I'd love to see Machan's eyes.

326
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:56,520
Hey, hey.

327
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,520
I've been waiting for you.

328
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:04,520
Hey, hey.

329
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,520
I've been waiting for you.

330
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
That's enough.

331
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,520
You don't have to look at the car and be careful.

332
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,520
I opened the trunk.

333
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,520
I was waiting.

334
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,520
That's enough.

335
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:29,520
I'd love to see Machan's eyes.

336
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,520
Hey, hey.

337
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,520
The third DVD is about to be released.

338
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,520
The third DVD, which has been released for four months in a row,

339
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,520
is a one-night trip to a hot spring resort that you must not laugh at.

340
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,520
The Matsumoto team's night of terror will be revived.
