1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The winner is...

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I did it!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The winner is...

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What is it?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What's wrong?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
3, 2, 1!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hey!

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Wait!

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
3, 2, 1!

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The winner is...

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I did it!

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The winner is...

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:48,000
3, 2, 1!

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The winner is...

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The winner is...

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I did it!

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I did it!

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't want to lose by choosing a castle.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's been a long time.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's been a long time since I won.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Thank you, Kouhaku Udagashi-san!

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's been a long time since I won.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, it doesn't matter.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm relieved that it's over.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
To be continued.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Next time on Gaki no Tsukai Arahen!

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Chiki-chi! 95's Young Artists!

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Tatoeyo Seishiken!

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Tatoeyo Seishiken!

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I heard that there are two guests today.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The main guest today is wearing a number plate.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The first and third row.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Old man and woman.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Old man and woman.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
They are the main characters.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I see.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How about you, Tatoeyo?

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This...

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The one with the nose hair.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
How about you, Tatoeyo?

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The one with the blue eyes.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You are a foreigner.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You are very Japanese.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The one with the long bangs.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Where is it?

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's short.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Next time on Gaki no Tsukai Arahen!

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Chiki-chi! 95's Young Artists!

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Chiki-chi! 95's Young Artists!

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Young people, please come in!

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's go in order.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yamazaki-san, please play the number plate.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yamazaki-san, there are two of you.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is the Tohkai.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Tatoeyo has already started.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He has already started.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What's the number?

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Number 5!

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Number 5!

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's him.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Please come to the stage.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yamazaki-san!

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Tatoeyo!

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Maneki-neko.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes!

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Inoue-kun.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Fukudasao.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You just saw it.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's not good.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's not good at all.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's not like this.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Tatoeyo is not like this.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What's the correct answer?

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The correct answer is...

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Is it correct?

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Please tell us.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Is there a correct answer for something like this?

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There is. There is.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The correct answer is...

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Prince Hana.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The one who was called Prince Hana is like...

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's amazing how he nods.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Tatoeyo doesn't hurt himself.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He nods?

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He laughs and doesn't hurt anyone.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I see.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's a good example.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's Tatoeyo.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Inoue-kun, please come to the stage.

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The next number.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What's the number?

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Number 3.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Number 3.

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Please come to the stage.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is difficult.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's okay if you don't cry.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll go on.

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There's nothing.

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, no, no.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yamazaki-san.

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Please don't say there's nothing.

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yamazaki-san, that was funny.

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You can come to the front and look at your face.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Everyone will come out.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I want you to say there's nothing.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There's nothing.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Next.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What's the number?

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Number 13.

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Number 13.

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's a man.

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's difficult.

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Then, Tomoro-kun.

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Tatoeyo.

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Number 5222.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Next.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes, Yamazaki-san.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He's eating Japanese sake.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's okay.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's go to Tatoeyo.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Tatoeyo, please.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Horse's quarter.

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What are you saying?

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's okay.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He's laughing.

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's okay because he's laughing.

129
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't get hurt.

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Horse's quarter.

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's okay, right?

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Isn't this horse's quarter?

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Next.

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Tanaka-kun.

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Number 8.

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Number 8.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's here.

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's here.

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't know if it's good or bad.

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Please read the atmosphere.

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm saying something.

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Tanaka.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Tatoeyo.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Sword.

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Thank you very much.

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
End.

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Number 28.

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Number 28.

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Please.

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Thin forehead.

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes.

154
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes.

155
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Bald.

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He's laughing.

157
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He's laughing.

159
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He's laughing.

161
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
His reaction is fast.

163
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Tanaka.

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes.

165
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm looking for a part-time job.

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't know.

167
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I understand.

168
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's just go with the flow.

169
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's okay.

170
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let's just go with the flow.

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Shall we start over from the opening?

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't know yet.

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yamazaki-san.

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes.

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Are you wearing glasses?

176
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm wearing glasses.

177
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
There are so many.

178
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There are so many people like me.

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Really?

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yes.

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I wanted to say this.

182
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I wanted to say this.

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes.

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What number?

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Number 11.

186
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Number 11.

187
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You're looking at him.

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes.

189
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yamazaki-san, give an example.

190
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Death.

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
No.

192
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's completely different.

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Is it different?

194
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's completely different.

195
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Number 11 is a predator.

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Number 20 is a woman.

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Go ahead.

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Go ahead.

199
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I wonder what this person is.

200
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes.

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Excuse me.

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes.

203
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm going.

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm back.

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I succeeded in laughing.

206
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's a success.

207
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's a success.

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
There are so many people like me.

209
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I finally laughed with applause.

210
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Thank you very much.

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You are in the picture.

212
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Thank you very much.

213
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Number 31.

214
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Number 31.

215
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're in the picture too.

216
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yes.

217
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yamazaki-san.

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Takoyaki.

219
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Are you aware of it?

220
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Why?

221
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Is it cute? Takoyaki.

222
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is a girlfriend of Hangyodon.

223
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You.

224
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes.

225
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You are in the picture.

226
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Thank you very much.

227
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Number 21 is good.

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Number 21.

229
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Number 21.

230
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's the birth of labor.

231
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's...

232
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's...

233
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's...

234
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What is it?

235
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Number 10.

236
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Number 10.

237
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Number 10.

238
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Number 10.

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't know if this is the last one.

240
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Now.

241
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes.

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Nobita-kun in the picture.

243
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's some kind of bait, isn't it?

244
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's not good, Takoyaki.

245
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's...

246
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's not good, Takoyaki.

247
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's say number 24.

248
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Number 24 seems to have something.

249
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Electricity?

250
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Hey, wait a minute.

251
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't ask.

252
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What is it?

253
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Electricity?

254
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But, well...

255
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Electricity...

256
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's not bad.

257
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Then, say it out loud.

258
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is...

259
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's some kind of seed.

260
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
He's laughing so hard.

261
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

262
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I always do it like this.

263
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Hello, hello.

264
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Well...

265
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Today, I can't do it anymore.

266
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What?

267
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
My voice is so hoarse, isn't it?

268
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Is it a cold?

269
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's terrible.

270
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
My voice isn't hoarse at all.

271
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's piling up here.

272
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's not at all.

273
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I really wanted to take a rest.

274
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
When I think of the faces of the guests today,

275
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I can't take a rest.

276
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
They're waiting for me.

277
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Everyone is waiting for me.

278
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Well, that kind of feeling is important.

280
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't mind.

281
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't mind at all.

282
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
No, really.

283
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This job is really hard.

284
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I can't take a rest.

285
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I've recovered though.

286
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I was a little sick at the end of the year.

287
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You're still warm today, aren't you?

288
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Let's hug.

289
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's nice.

290
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Come here.

291
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is nice.

292
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If no one was here, I would have gone.

293
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But there are people here.

294
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
There are people here.

295
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's right.

296
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This is my handwritten letter, isn't it?

297
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's okay.

298
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I obviously didn't know.

299
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Why is it your handwritten letter?

300
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I had a fever the day before the baseball game at the end of the year.

301
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I took a car alone.

302
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It was 39.3 degrees.

303
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I went to the emergency hospital.

304
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't say that.

305
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's true.

306
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I was waiting for two people.

307
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It was cold in the corridor.

308
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm sure it's true.

309
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You're the only one who has a sore throat.

310
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There are a lot of people waiting for you at the hospital.

311
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's right.

312
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
There are a lot of people.

313
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There are people like this.

314
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Are you okay, Murakami?

315
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm going to take it off now.

316
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Please be patient.

317
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm going to take it off now.

318
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
While Murakami was going somewhere,

319
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I took it off.

320
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Murakami, if you feel sick, please go.

321
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Murakami, I'm sorry.

322
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's too late.

323
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Please help me.

324
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You're talking to yourself.

325
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You're talking to yourself.

326
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't need anything.

327
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's winter.

328
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I stopped you.

329
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I had a fever and it was hard, but I laughed while listening to it.

330
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There are a lot of people.

331
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
My grandmother came to me.

332
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Something's wrong.

333
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What's wrong?

334
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Something's wrong with my head.

335
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You talk to yourself.

336
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You're laughing at everything.

337
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Close your eyes.

338
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I've had a fever twice.

339
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I had a fever before, too.

340
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Please wait a moment.

341
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I can't pee.

342
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's hard.

343
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm sick, but I'm laughing.

344
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
There are a lot of people who are sick.

345
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm still fine.

346
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's hard.

347
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I can't breathe.

348
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I can't breathe.

349
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's a nuisance at night.

350
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's like a hungry chicken.

351
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I can't breathe.

352
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I can't breathe.

353
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I have something to say.

354
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I haven't had a fever in a long time.

355
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Thank you very much.

356
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:51,000
If I win the game and choose red, you have to say it's white.

357
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If you lose, it's not cool.

358
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's not cool.

359
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's not cool.

360
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
If I win, you have to say it's cold.

361
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
If you lose, it's not cool.

362
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If you lose, it's not cool.

363
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
My staff gave me a mask when I arrived in Hawaii.

364
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I heard you were in Hawaii.

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
When I arrived, I put on a mask and said it was a party.

366
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm glad I was asked.

367
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I said I wouldn't wear it.

368
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He didn't say anything.

369
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
He didn't say anything.

370
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I didn't see it.

371
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm working, so I can't see it.

372
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What's going on in Hawaii?

373
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
There was no party.

374
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Is there anything in Hawaii that makes you feel good?

375
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm just trying to satisfy my sexual desire.

376
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Is there anything in Hawaii that makes you feel good?

377
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'll leave it at that.

378
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What?

379
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Are you going to put on a mask?

380
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's okay.

381
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Why?

382
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's because it's hard.

383
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm having a hard time.

384
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Drink it.

385
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm really sorry.

386
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I heard it's selling it.

387
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
At the Blue Sera shop.

388
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
At the Blue Sera shop.

389
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What kind of day is it?

390
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's not usually sold, is it?

391
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's not usually sold, is it?

392
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I can't stand it.

393
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I can't stand it.

394
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I've been saying this all year round.

395
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What have you been doing?

396
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I've been doing nothing.

397
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I've been doing nothing.

398
00:18:44,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I've been doing nothing.

399
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Downtown's Matsumoto-san and Hamada-san are still wrong.

400
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Downtown's bigger one is...

401
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Still wrong?

402
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The bigger one is Matsumoto-san, and the smaller one is Hamada-san. Is there any other way to remember them?

403
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Well, Oba-han is still like that.

404
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
There are a lot of people who mistake it for Ucchan-nan-chan, right?

405
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes, yes, that's enough.

406
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I can afford it.

407
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Ucchan-nan-chan and Matsugawa...

408
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Matsugawa?

409
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
He's from the far north.

410
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Is there any other way to remember them other than the bigger one and the smaller one?

411
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
There are a lot of things, right?

412
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What things?

413
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
There are a lot of things.

414
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What things?

415
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What could it be?

416
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What could it be?

417
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
There are a lot of things, right?

418
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
There are like 50,000 things.

419
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What could it be?

420
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
There are things that are tattooed and things that aren't.

421
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Which one is tattooed?

422
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Why?

423
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Are they tattooed?

424
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Are they tattooed?

425
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Something like that.

426
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I see.

427
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
There are things that have a saber.

428
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That's easy to understand.

429
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That's easy to understand.

430
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's easy to understand.

431
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And...

432
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And what else is there?

433
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
There are things that are tattooed on the skin.

434
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What things?

435
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
There are things that are tattooed on the eyes of the sapphire.

436
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Something that isn't tattooed.

437
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's a way to understand them.

438
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The first one.

439
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yes, yes, yes.

440
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Those things that are tattooed on the sapphire.

441
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That's what my grandmother says.

442
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
There's no mistake.

443
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
First of all, there's nothing to be mistaken about.

444
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Why do old people tremble?

445
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Do they tremble?

446
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Old people tremble.

447
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Small dogs and old people tremble.

448
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's not because it's cold.

449
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What?

450
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's not because it's cold.

451
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It doesn't matter.

452
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's not because it's cold that old people tremble.

453
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Old people tremble in the middle of the summer or in the spring.

454
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's because they're motivated, isn't it?

455
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That's right.

456
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's like, I'm still alive.

457
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
If you think you're still alive, don't you tremble?

458
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What is that? Please tell me.

459
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's because they're trying to go somewhere, right?

460
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
They're trying to do it with their blood.

461
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What?

462
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The pulling power is working somewhere.

463
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
They're stopping it.

464
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
They're trying to do it with their blood, right?

465
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's just a matter of time.

466
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What is the most painful language you've ever heard?

467
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm Kiri Kiri.

468
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's strange.

469
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But if you think about it, it seems like there are a lot of repeating words, right?

470
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Is that so?

471
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Yes.

472
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Don't you think so?

473
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's not true.

474
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Zuki zuki. Uzu uzu.

475
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What is uzu uzu?

476
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It doesn't seem painful.

477
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Uzu uzu, doesn't it seem painful?

478
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Princess Princess.

479
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Now, Toyokawa Etsushi. Is that okay?

480
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I don't know.

481
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Toyokawa Etsushi, is that okay?

482
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Toyokawa...

483
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Why does it say Toyokawa Etsushi here?

484
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You're the one who said that.

485
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Toyokawa Etsushi is a neutral guy like Takeda Shinji.

486
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
How can you be neutral?

487
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I can't change that.

488
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I can't make that face.

489
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But you see, sexy guys, right?

490
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm always called sexy.

491
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm always called sexy.

492
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Who?

493
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I was called that when I was in elementary school.

494
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You were called sexy when you were in elementary school?

495
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I was called sexy.

496
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I was called after the Segawa guy.

497
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
In English.

498
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, really?

499
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes, yes, yes.

500
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm from Matsumoto, so it's different.

501
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm always called sexy.

502
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I was called sexy after Segawa.

503
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yes, I said that.

504
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You said that too?

505
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yes, I said that.

506
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You're really sexy, so you look like you've run away.

507
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Right?

508
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Really?

509
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You're not good at all.

510
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Vintage fashion doesn't suit you.

511
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Wait a minute.

512
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Have you ever done it?

513
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I've done it a lot.

514
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm always called leather.

515
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
People say I don't know if I'm a man or a woman.

516
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
People say that to you?

517
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Yes, yes, yes.

518
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
People still call me that.

519
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
When I say, huh?

520
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
They say, huh?

521
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm always called leather.
