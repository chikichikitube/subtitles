1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The 4th episode of the secret project, Matsumoto Shintoshi is serious about Shirahadori again and again.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You did Part 3, didn't you?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
No matter how you look at it, I think you're turning it the other way around.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You're saying that again?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So, it's like you got caught in Mach's moves.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I didn't get caught.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No, no, that was normal for us.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If you think about it, it's a serious Shirahadori's first challenge.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He has a sword as a toy.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In the 2nd episode, he was wearing a helmet.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In the 3rd episode, he was doing it the other way around.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And this time, Matsumoto Shintoshi again...

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Matsumoto Shintoshi!

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
...sacrifices his life.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So, I told Mach that I was going to do Part 4 today.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Come on, you can't do that.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Isn't that frustrating?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No, no, no.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Do you know the Shirahadori Shoko-gun?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes, I know it.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's pretty famous in the industry.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If you do Shirahadori, you can do the Hatsumei Shoko-gun.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I did 27.1 in Yamakaze the other day.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's amazing.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
If you do Shirahadori, you can do Downtown Deluxe.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If you do Shirahadori, you can do Gottsuei Kanji.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
If you do Part 4, everything will be better.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So, the ratings are important.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is your original plan, right?

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, it's my original plan.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't mind doing it 4 times.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You got permission.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If you do it, I'll do it.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Are you a writer?

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's my original plan.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What's wrong with him?

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What's wrong with him?

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hey, what are you doing?

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What?

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't you know?

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't you know?

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We're doing it for you.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We're doing it to make you a star.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What's wrong with him?

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What?

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you want to do something good?

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No?

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No?

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No?

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let me go.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yamazaki.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yamazaki.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So?

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Thank you.

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He's doing it for you.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He's doing it, isn't he?

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He's doing it.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He's doing it, isn't he?

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But, that's not for me.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He's doing it for you.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I see.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't worry about it.

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll do it.

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let me do it.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let me do it.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He's just like you.

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Stop!

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Stop!

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Stop!

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What's wrong?

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't do that.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Stop!

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Don't do it.

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't do it.

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Stop!

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Stop it.

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's not it.

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Stop it.

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't do it.

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't do it.

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I thought it was the other way around, so I got a cramp.

87
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Yamazaki, open your mouth.

88
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
This is the last time.

90
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,800
What are you going to do if you get hurt?

91
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,800
If you become a star with this, isn't it true?

92
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
No, what are you talking about?

93
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Don't open your mouth, Sugachan.

94
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,800
I didn't like the way you walked.

95
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,800
I want to do it properly.

96
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,800
This is the last time.

97
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Today, I'm going to do it on a white-legged bird.

98
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Like this.

99
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Let's try it with this.

100
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
What?

101
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Like this.

102
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Are you stupid? What are you talking about?

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,800
If you don't do that, you won't be trusted.

104
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Don't do that. It's dangerous.

105
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Are you okay?

106
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I'm okay.

107
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,800
I can see the friction and the problem.

108
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
The rest is just a matter of feeling.

109
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,800
It's okay if you do it.

110
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Why are you laughing?

111
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
What?

112
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
You're laughing.

113
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
I've been telling you for a long time.

114
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
What are you guys?

115
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
I'm going to be a star.

116
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,800
What is that?

117
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,800
I've been telling you for a long time.

118
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,800
I'm not talking about ratings.

119
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Let's do it.

120
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Let's take a picture together.

121
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Take a picture together.

122
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Let's take a picture together.

123
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Let's go.

124
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
It's time for the challenge.

125
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Please take a look at the moment of the challenge.

126
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Thank you very much.

127
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
I'm counting on you.

128
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Okay.

129
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Do you really want to do it?

130
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Of course I want to do it.

131
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,800
If you don't want to do it, don't do it.

132
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Please do it.

134
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
I can't do it.

135
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Do it with me.

136
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Do it with me.

137
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Do it with me.

139
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
I can't do it.

140
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Don't do it.

142
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Ladies and gentlemen.

143
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Today, we came to see Sumo.

144
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Kenko is here.

145
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,800
He talks a lot.

146
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,800
He has a face like Muro Fukudou.

147
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
He talks a lot.

148
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,800
The world of sumo is strange.

149
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,800
I heard a lot of stories.

150
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,800
In the end, you don't have to quit even if you get bald?

151
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
If you can't lose a little, you have to quit.

152
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Why? If you can't lose a little, it's okay if you're strong.

153
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,800
But that's like a uniform.

154
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,800
It's not good if you fight naked.

155
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
It's not good.

156
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,800
It's natural.

157
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,800
If you can't lose a little, you have to quit.

158
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,800
I feel sorry for you.

159
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,800
I'm sorry if you look at me.

160
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
What?

161
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,800
I can't do it.

162
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,800
It's like a gift.

163
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,800
It's hard.

164
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,800
It's like a gift.

165
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
It's hard.

166
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
If you're strong, you can do it.

167
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,800
But there's no past, right?

168
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,800
There's no one who quit because he couldn't lose a little.

169
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,800
It's not possible in other worlds.

170
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,800
The fact that you're working with your butt out.

171
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
What do you think?

172
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:45,800
When you're working with your butt out, do you have a hard time?

173
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
I think so.

174
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,800
They're from the side.

175
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Do you put something on your butt?

176
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Do you say it out loud?

177
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
I don't say it out loud.

178
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Wow.

179
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,800
What's that wow?

180
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Why did you say it out loud?

181
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Do you want it?

182
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
You want it, don't you?

183
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Why did you say it out loud when you said wow?

184
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Last week's kid was sent to the Olympics.

185
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Oh, the Olympics.

186
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,800
I can't watch the Olympics.

187
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,800
He said he got a gold medal.

188
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Last week's kid was a gold medalist.

189
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,800
He was about 90kg.

190
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,800
He said he could fly.

191
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
He was nervous.

192
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,800
When you said wow, you were lucky.

193
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,800
But I said it was a failure.

194
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Even a welder can't fly when it's windy.

195
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,800
You should have done it like this.

196
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,800
You should have said wow on a windy day.

197
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,800
You should have said wow on a windy day.

198
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,800
You should have said wow on a windy day.

199
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,800
You did your best, but you got the gold medal because of the wind.

200
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,800
There's a wind, but it's hard to do this.

201
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,800
There's a wind, but it's hard to do this.

202
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,800
The ground is gone.

203
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,800
I don't know how to do it.

204
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,800
You can't fall down even if you fly.

205
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,800
You can't fall down even if you fly.

206
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,800
You've come this far.

207
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
You've come from high up.

208
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,800
You can't be stupid if you find out.

209
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,800
You can fall down after this.

210
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,800
You can't fall down after this.

211
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Why not?

212
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
I don't like it.

213
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
There's a reason for you to fly.

214
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
It's a distance.

215
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,800
It doesn't matter.

216
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,800
It's a distance.

217
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,800
It doesn't matter if you land.

218
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,800
It doesn't matter if you land.

219
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,800
It doesn't matter if you land.

220
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,800
It doesn't matter if you land.

221
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
I'll fly.

222
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,800
You can't say that.

223
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,800
I'll fly today.

224
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,800
I'll fly today.

225
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,800
You can't say that.

226
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,800
You can't say that.

227
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
You can't say that.

228
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,800
You can't say that.

229
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,800
It doesn't matter.

230
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,800
That's your idea, isn't it?

231
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
What? You want me to get off with my shoes?

232
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
That's not a shoe!

233
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
What's that long thing?

234
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
That's not a shoe either!

235
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,800
I want you to do this!

236
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,800
No one wants to get off here!

237
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,800
You're the only one who wants to get off here!

238
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Everyone wants to get off here!

239
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
You don't understand!

240
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Why do they have to wear such tight clothes?

241
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Isn't that to prevent the wind from blowing?

242
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Prevent the wind from blowing?

243
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,800
It's to keep the wind from blowing.

244
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,800
If it's fluttering...

245
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
That's not right.

246
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
That's not right.

247
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
When the wind blows...

248
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
That's not right.

249
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
That's not right.

250
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
You have to keep it tight.

251
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,800
But it's like a parachute!

252
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,800
When you put it on a car, it's easy to drive.

253
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,800
When you put the brakes on, it's easy to drive.

254
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,800
But when you're flying, it's hard to fly.

255
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
That's right.

256
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
What are you talking about?

257
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
That was fast!

258
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Don't you think Nihon is underrated?

259
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Underrated?

260
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,800
He's underrated.

261
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,800
He's like, oh, I got a gold medal.

262
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,800
If you get a gold medal in a foreign country,

263
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,800
they'll give you a lot of money.

264
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
But in Japan...

265
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,800
There's a kid who forgot his phone in the box.

266
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,800
He was a wrestler.

267
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,800
He called, broke the gold medal, and left.

268
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,800
That was a long distance call.

269
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
No, no, no.

270
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Wasn't that funny?

271
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,800
He called and left.

272
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
It was a long distance call.

273
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
He didn't have enough money.

274
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,800
So he left a gold medal.

275
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
That's what I'm talking about!

276
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,800
That was pretty good, wasn't it?

277
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,800
Who are you talking to?

278
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Answer me!

279
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,800
I don't feel like talking.

280
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,800
But it was pretty good.

281
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,800
Um...

282
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
How was it?

283
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
A joke?

284
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,800
A quiz joke?

285
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Speed skating?

286
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
That's pretty bad.

287
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
What?

288
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
The start.

289
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
I don't care about that.

290
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
That's weird.

291
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
I'm telling you not to do it now.

292
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
I'm telling you not to do it now!

293
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,800
I'm telling you not to do it now!

294
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
You can't run like that.

295
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Don't do it!

296
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,800
You can't run like that.

297
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
You can't run like that.

298
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
I'm telling you not to do it now.

299
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
I'm telling you not to do it now!

300
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
That's weird.

301
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,800
How was it?

302
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,800
That was pretty good.

303
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,800
What do you mean?

304
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,800
You never listen.

305
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
That was pretty good.

306
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,800
That was pretty good.

307
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,800
The other day...

308
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,800
You can't do it now.

309
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
I'm telling you not to do it now.

310
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,800
I'm telling you not to do it now.

311
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,800
The other day...

312
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Why are you doing that?

313
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Why are you doing that?

314
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I was doing a shoot.

315
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,800
And suddenly the Yakuza came.

316
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
The Yakuza came.

317
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
That's weird.

318
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
That's weird.

319
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,800
He had a short perm.

320
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,800
He was wearing a red shirt.

321
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,800
He was looking at me like this.

322
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,800
He was a little far away.

323
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
He was saying,

324
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
It's too early to see the Yakuza.

325
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
It's too early to see the Yakuza.

326
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
He had a short perm.

327
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
He was wearing a red shirt.

328
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
He was saying,

329
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,800
It's too early to see the Yakuza.

330
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Who are you doing a shoot for?

331
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,800
He was wearing a short perm.

332
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,800
He was wearing a short perm.

333
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
He was saying,

334
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Who are you doing a shoot for?

335
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,800
He was throwing all the trash at me.

336
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
He was saying,

337
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
What are you doing?

338
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Come out!

339
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
He took me away.

340
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,800
He took me away.

341
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
He took me away.

342
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,800
There is a Yakuza near here.

343
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
He took me away.

344
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
He took me away.

345
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
He is a fish.

346
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
He is a fish.

347
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
I see.

348
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
I see.

349
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
I'm afraid of the Yakuza.

350
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
I'm afraid of the Yakuza.

351
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
I'm afraid of the Yakuza.

352
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
I'll tell you.

353
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
I'll tell you.

354
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,800
I'll tell you.

355
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,800
I'll tell you.

356
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
I'll tell you.

357
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
I'll tell you.

358
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
I'll tell you.

359
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
I'll tell you.

360
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
I'll tell you.

361
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
I'll tell you.

362
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
I know that if it's a yakuza,

363
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,800
That is a yakuza.

364
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,800
But I'll show you how to greet each other.

365
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,800
I've never heard you say good morning to the AV.

366
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
You're a fool.

367
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
I've never heard you say good morning to the AV.

368
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,800
I've never heard you say good morning to the AV.

369
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,800
I put it in the morning with a message.

370
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
I've been thinking for a while.

371
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,800
The lever often said big show.

372
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Does that mean the amount of water?

373
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Or does it mean the other way around?

374
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Doesn't it mean that both of them are involved?

375
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,800
The lever says big show.

376
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
But let's say you pooped.

377
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,800
When you pooped, you pooped a lot.

378
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
That's definitely not a big show.

379
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,800
But you pooped, so you have to turn the lever.

380
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
You pooped?

381
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
No, I mean you pooped.

382
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
No, I mean you pooped.

383
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Even if you poop, poop is poop.

384
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,800
You pooped for an hour and you didn't stop.

385
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,800
You pooped a lot.

386
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Which is the biggest poop?

387
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
I pooped a lot.

388
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,800
That's strange.

389
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
You shouldn't poop.

390
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,800
It's not that big a deal.

391
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:23,800
You pooped a lot, but you didn't stop.

392
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I'm glad you pooped.

393
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
I'm glad you pooped.

394
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,800
That's a big deal.

395
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:45,800
But if you have to poop, you have to turn the lever.

396
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
I don't think that's right.

397
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Why not?

398
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
It doesn't make sense.

399
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Whether it's a big show or a small show, the amount of water is the same.

400
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,800
That's not true.

401
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Even if I poop, I have to turn the lever.

402
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
That's cool.

403
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Why not?

404
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,800
I don't think that's cool.

405
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,800
What are you talking about?

406
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Don't say something I don't understand.

407
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Don't talk too much.

408
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,800
I'll tell you what to write.

409
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Go ahead.

410
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
When I pooped, I pooped a lot.

411
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,800
When I pooped, I pooped a lot.

412
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,800
It's a so-called questionnaire.

413
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,800
For whom?

414
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,800
There are a lot of people who do this on the street.

415
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
The wind of a car.

416
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
The wind of a person.

417
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
It's like that.

418
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
It's in every house, right?

419
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Yes, of course.

420
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,800
How much do people poop?

421
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
How much do people pee?

422
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
I'll pick it up once a month.

423
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Who?

424
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
This month, everyone pooped a lot.

425
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,800
What?

426
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Who's happy?

427
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
That's why I'm telling you.

428
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Who?

429
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,800
It was funny before.

430
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
Hello.

431
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,800
I'm suffering from a disease right now.

432
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:24,800
That disease is a disease where you can't stop pooping when you go into a crowd.

433
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
Don't say something I don't understand.

434
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,800
When I'm on a date, I poop a lot, so I run away.

435
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,800
I'm so happy to see them pooping on TV that I'm crying.

436
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,800
I'm jealous.

437
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
I've had a lot of drugs before.

438
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Can't I just pee on my butt?

439
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
What should I do?

440
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,800
You can put up with it.

441
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,800
I think it comes from the spirit.

442
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
What do you mean?

443
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,800
When people come together, I want to run away from there as soon as possible.

444
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,800
There's something like a turbo in my body.

445
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,800
I want to run away as soon as possible, so I poop.

446
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Poop!

447
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Poop!

448
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
Poop!

449
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Poop!
