1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,060
The holy land of bus fishing, Kawaguchiko, which wishes for a spiritual

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,060
prosperity.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,060
The Tsuji baka who are more familiar with the entertainment world have created various dramas in the history of the past 10 times.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,060
Pride and will that falls between glory and praise.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,060
This year, the curtain of the hot battle will be cut off on the dream stage.

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:22,060
This year too, the hot battle will be cut off in the dream stage

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:29,060
11th Gaki no Tsukaiyaraen's Chiki Chiki Gainojin Tsuri Contest

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,060
Thank you

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,060
Thank you

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,060
We've come

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:40,060
It's only once a year that we can host Gaki

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,060
Thank you

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,060
Let's do our best

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,060
It was June last year, but this time it's October.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,060
So there are more fish than us.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,060
That's right.

17
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,060
There are many of them.

18
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,060
I won't let you say anything.

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,060
I'll do my best.

20
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,060
Let's go!

21
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,060
Without getting married, I'm going to eat food.

22
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,060
The most unpopular guy in the entertainment world, Matsumoto Oshito.

23
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,060
Matsumoto-san, I love you!

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,060
I love you too!

25
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,060
Hello.

26
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,060
My wife said thank you very much.

27
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,060
Today, I'll catch one when Tanaka sinks into the lake.

28
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,060
I see.

29
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,060
It's difficult.

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,060
I'll catch it at 3.45.

31
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,060
I see.

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,060
I'm looking forward to it.

33
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,060
Thank you.

34
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,060
Let's go.

35
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,060
The world's best of the best.

36
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,060
The father is a comedian, Kaido Mashigura.

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,060
Itoi Shigesato.

38
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,060
There's nothing to say

39
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,060
All four of us

40
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,060
How was it?

41
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,060
It was like chewing gum during the show

42
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,060
It was a good feeling

43
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,060
Shall we start now?

44
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,060
Yes, please

45
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,060
Please

46
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,060
Please

47
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,060
Let's go

48
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,060
Following Pabii, this time it's Kaera de Boromo-ke

49
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,060
Let's eat here

50
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,060
Who wants to see?

51
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,060
It says Kaera de Boromo-ke

52
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,060
Please tell us your enthusiasm for this time

53
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,060
This time?

54
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,060
It's no good, right?

55
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,060
Let's try our best.

56
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,060
I don't even feel like trying.

57
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,060
Please do your best.

58
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,060
Thank you.

59
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,060
Let's go.

60
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,060
The one who wears the mask and is cold inside.

61
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,060
Go for it, Uenzu!

62
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,060
Overcome, Uenzu!

63
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,060
It's Kato Haruhiko!

64
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,060
It's the first time I've been called that.

65
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,060
Thank you.

66
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,060
It's really shocking.

67
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,060
This is the first time I've heard that.

68
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,060
The character is the most popular in the industry.

69
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,060
Really?

70
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,060
If it's really bad this time, I want to hear a real story from you.

71
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,060
Next year.

72
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,060
I'll tell you a story instead.

73
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,060
If you bring a story, we don't know what to do.

74
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,060
Thank you.

75
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,060
Regular Gekigen.

76
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,060
The money is going up!

77
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,060
I don't think he's wearing anything right now!

78
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,060
No, no, no!

79
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,060
Good, good, good!

80
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,060
Zero-zero!

81
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,060
I have a regular.

82
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,060
You do?

83
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,060
I don't use the internet.

84
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,060
I use the internet.

85
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,060
That's the second one?

86
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,060
I shouldn't be underestimating, but

87
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,060
I'm going to use this bus to get a lot of people to come

88
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,060
and then I'll go to the entertainment world and

89
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,060
Thank you very much!

90
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,060
Thank you very much!

91
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,060
Thank you very much!

92
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,060
The first guest is...

93
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,060
The first guest is...

94
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,060
The real Koizumi Child Train!

95
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,060
Koizumi Kozawa!

96
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,060
What is your father doing now?

97
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,060
What is that?

98
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,060
What is that?

99
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,060
Did your father do anything?

100
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,060
He did when he was little.

101
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,060
Did he say he wanted to win?

102
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,060
I thought you were local.

103
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,060
I thought you were local too.

104
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,060
I'm sorry.

105
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,060
No, it's okay.

106
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,060
I'll do my best to win.

107
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,060
Thank you.

108
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,060
Thank you.

109
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:38,560
He's a master of self-proclaimed fishing, Mr. Aikawa, who changed the

110
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:47,060
fish to a rod and hit the big brother with a forehand.

111
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,060
It's a victory.

112
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,060
But everyone is saying that this is not a winning method.

113
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,060
I've never caught a fish in front of people.

114
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,060
I want to catch one.

115
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,060
I want you to win.

116
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,060
I want to catch a fish of more than 35 cm.

117
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,060
I will do my best.

118
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,060
Thank you.

119
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,060
Thank you!

120
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,060
Now, the last one.

121
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,060
The real-life dress-lip gorilla.

122
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,060
The defending champion, Hamada Masakazu!

123
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,060
Congratulations!

124
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,060
Hello!

125
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,060
I don't remember at all!

126
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,060
You're like a memory!

127
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,060
You can't catch everyone just by looking at their faces.

128
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,060
I'm looking forward to seeing how Aikawa Shou can't catch anything today.

129
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,060
He's going to be in trouble.

130
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,060
He can't catch anything by himself.

131
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,060
I'm looking forward to seeing how he can cut the line.

132
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,060
Thank you for coming.

133
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,060
I'd like to introduce the person who comes here every time.

134
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,060
He's not here, right?

135
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,060
He's Yosuke Eguchi.

136
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,060
I heard about him.

137
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,060
He came here because of his schedule.

138
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,060
And it's a spare engine!

139
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,060
It's a spare engine!

140
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,060
I see.

141
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,060
I'm getting comments from Im-san.

142
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,060
Oh, really? That's great.

143
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,060
What?

144
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,060
It's a shame that it's fading out.

145
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,060
That's up to you!

146
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,060
The show will continue next year.

147
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,060
Please come back next year.

148
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,060
This time, we have another interview for the fishing championship.

149
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,060
We will start the interview.

150
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,060
Since it's the Senna-san corner, we will be broadcasting to the world.

151
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,060
It's been a while.

152
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,060
I'm not here.

153
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,060
Ah, here he comes.

154
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,060
The director is here!

155
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,060
The director is still...

156
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,060
He's back.

157
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,060
The director has gone abroad.

158
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,060
He's back.

159
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,060
He's here.

160
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,060
Ah, Mr. Tamura is here.

161
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,060
How do you feel?

162
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,060
Stretch it out, stretch it out.

163
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,060
The weather is not good, but it's autumn, so it's the season of autumn leaves.

164
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,060
Is that all?

165
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,060
Is that all?

166
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:23,060
I'll do my best today, so I'll do this big black bass.

167
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,060
I'm so angry.

168
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,060
How many times did you say that?

169
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,060
I was told to run away.

170
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,060
I'm so angry.

171
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,060
Why did I say that?

172
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,060
What?

173
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,060
Why did you say that?

174
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,060
What are you talking about?

175
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,060
It's not related!

176
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,060
It's not related!

177
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,060
You're rude!

178
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,060
I'm going every time!

179
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,060
Listen to what the man in front of you says!

180
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,060
Look!

181
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,060
It's not your goal!

182
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,060
You can do it!

183
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,060
To Aiga-san too!

184
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,060
To Sho-san too!

185
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,060
You can do it!

186
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,060
You're wearing sunglasses!

187
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,060
Glasses are glasses!

188
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:05,060
It's the first appearance of the

189
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,060
Oh, you're giving it to Aika-san too?

190
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,060
To Sho-san?

191
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,060
What are you doing?

192
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,060
You're wearing sunglasses.

193
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,060
I'm wearing glasses.

194
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,060
Wow, amazing!

195
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,060
This is the first time I've seen this.

196
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,060
Like this.

197
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,060
Like this.

198
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,060
I'll do my best.

199
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,060
It's like I'm going to be a star.

200
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,060
Go home.

201
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,060
You're a good guy.

202
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,060
I'm going to break this huge block.

203
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,060
It's so small!

204
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,060
It's a mistake.

205
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,060
I'll do it!

206
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,060
What is that?

207
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,060
Thank you.

208
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,060
When?

209
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,060
I heard it for the first time.

210
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,060
When?

211
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,060
It's the last.

212
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,060
It's from Tanaka.

213
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,060
It's an announcement.

214
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,060
I see.

215
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,060
I see.

216
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,060
It's too much.

217
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,060
I'm the one who arranged the tickets.

218
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,060
Attention!

219
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,060
This year, again,

220
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,060
those who came to fish without eating,

221
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,060
those who cling to this entertainment world,

222
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,060
the rich people of money,

223
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,060
Oh?

224
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,060
It's not a joke.

225
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:36,060
B-class comedian, B-class actor, B-class musician, C-class comedy writer.

226
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,060
Unfortunately, this year is also C-class comedy writer.

227
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,060
Hey, C-class comedy writer!

228
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,060
You are also B-class comedian.

229
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,060
You are getting more and more C-class comedy writer.

230
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,060
From now on, if I say something grateful to you,

231
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,060
I'll say it with all my heart!

232
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,060
Please do.

233
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,060
We are...

234
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,060
We are...

235
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,060
The water bugs of the entertainment world!

236
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,060
The water bugs of the entertainment world.

237
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,060
We don't have any hard-to-treat aura.

238
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,060
We don't have any hard-to-treat aura.

239
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,060
Chiyaki, we love you!

240
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:39,960
Sh tu ja ki is is weak?

241
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,220
I said seriously I'm weak

242
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,220
As a position, I don't think it's a dirty, unpopular thing!

243
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,220
It's not a dirty thing!

244
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,220
You're a trashy, trashy human being!

245
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,220
Please, Mr. Nittere!

246
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,220
Let us fish like this!

247
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,220
Amen!

248
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,220
Anyway, aim for the championship and do your best!

249
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,220
Dismissed!

250
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:22,220
I haven't fished much, but I want to be a good angler

251
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,220
I found out that I can fish other than fish last year

252
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:33,220
I want to fish in various ways

253
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,220
I'm going to go!

254
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,220
Kojiko-kun, you've been away from that for a while

255
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:47,220
Last time, I finished 4th place, so this time I want to get 1st place no matter what

256
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:54,220
It's my first time at a bus ride, but I heard that it's a way to catch fish

257
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,220
I want to catch one

258
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,220
Everyone, please support me

259
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,220
I want to catch one.

260
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,220
I don't like zero.

261
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,220
You said you want to catch one.

262
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,220
Yes.

263
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,220
I've only done it in the sea, but I want to catch one.

264
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,220
Bang!

265
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,220
I'll blow up the whole nature today!

266
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,220
Now, the three-man match, start!

267
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,220
I'm going to catch a fish!

268
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,220
I'm going to catch a fish!

269
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,220
I caught a fish!

270
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,220
I caught a fish!

271
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,220
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

272
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,220
The fishing competition rules are very simple.

273
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,220
The one who catches the biggest black bass within the time limit wins.

274
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:55,220
The one who started fishing earlier than any other boat is Tamada, Aikawa and Okuda.

275
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,220
Oh, there's a fish.

276
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,220
He's been fishing for 40 years, but this is his first time fishing for a bus.

277
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,220
How good is he?

278
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,220
Shou, you can't fish because you've been watching videos.

279
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,220
I can't.

280
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,220
That's a great way to learn.

281
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,220
I was eating the moment I turned on the video.

282
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,220
On the other hand, in this boat, there is a man who has forgotten the basics of bus fishing.

283
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,220
It's about 10 o'clock now, so please sink it.

284
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,220
Oh, it's about 10 o'clock.

285
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,220
Oh, it's about 10 o'clock.

286
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,220
Asano, who has participated in the first time in three years, is a little anxious.

287
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,220
And, in the morning, it's a painful fight.

288
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,220
Is it the first hit?

289
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,220
Did you get it?

290
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,220
Wow, amazing.

291
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,220
Bluegill.

292
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,220
Ah...

293
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,220
Gill.

294
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,220
No.

295
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,220
He thought it was a bus, but it was Bluegill.

296
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,220
It's Bluegill that's floating.

297
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,220
He's frustrated. He can't get it first.

298
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,220
On the other hand, this is Wakate Boat.

299
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,220
It's the first time Koizumi has been in the real mode,

300
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,220
compared to the Okiraku Combi of Yamasaki Kato.

301
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,220
Kotaro-kun, if you get the first place in the first round, you'll be cool.

302
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,220
Oh, this is...

303
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,220
It's a obstacle.

304
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,220
It's definitely Bluegill and Mizukusato.

305
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,220
Why is Black Master outside?

306
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,220
That's good.

307
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,220
That's good, right?

308
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,220
With fish.

309
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,220
What?

310
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,220
Is it coming?

311
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,220
Wow, that was a little bit of a moment.

312
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,220
It came out.

313
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,220
Really?

314
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,220
Every year, this...

315
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,220
No, it's not.

316
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,220
The number of times it shows is different.

317
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,220
Every year?

318
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,220
It's the usual thing to do in the new year.

319
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,220
And then at the end, the teacher scolds him.

320
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,220
Meanwhile, Itoi's face is again in a bad mood.

321
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,220
Agil.

322
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,220
I don't want to show it.

323
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,220
I'm not good at fishing.

324
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,220
I only know the cool ones.

325
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,220
Itoi is again a bitter bug.

326
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:09,220
From the start, 30 minutes. He's still not alone. He's going at a very slow pace.

327
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,220
Just like last year, he's also going through a lot of trials this year.

328
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,220
This is strange. I can't get used to this.

329
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,220
It's already happened.

330
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,220
What? No! How many years has it been?

331
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,220
It's trash.

332
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,220
You ask me the same question every year.

333
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,220
I'm coming!

334
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,220
Suddenly Okuda's face changes.

335
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,220
He feels the weight and lifts his heels.

336
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,220
What is this?

337
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,220
Okuda's first win in the competition.

338
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,220
I'm going.

339
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,220
What is this?

340
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,220
Put it in your pocket.

341
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,220
Put it in your pocket!

342
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,220
I want you to listen to me.

343
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,220
If you can catch one.

344
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,220
It's better if you can catch one.

345
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,220
That's right.

346
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,220
If no one can catch one, it's a victory.

347
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,220
I'll do my best.

348
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,220
Don't say that.

349
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,220
I'll do my best.

350
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,220
Usually, the one who caught one says that.

351
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,220
I see.

352
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:19,220
On the other hand, the unbelievable development in the boat of three young men with no pieces of the hit.

353
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,220
Oh, what is it?

354
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,220
You just went to the fish farm, right?

355
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,220
Hey, look! It's a Tachiro!

356
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,220
Oh, you surprised me. It's already my fish.

357
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,220
I thought it was a Tachiro.

358
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,220
Tachiro?

359
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,220
Why is it a Tachiro?

360
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,220
You're so mean!

361
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,220
I thought it was a small fish.

362
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,220
Mr. Yamasaki, this is a lake.

363
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,220
Meanwhile, Asano is struggling here.

364
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,220
And then, next to him...

365
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,220
Here it comes!

366
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,220
Matsumoto is hit!

367
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,220
Oh!

368
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,220
That's pretty good!

369
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,220
It's here!

370
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,220
Sorry!

371
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,220
The first one Matsumoto got is a big size fish!

372
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,220
It's here!

373
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,220
But it's not that small!

374
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,220
It's got a big nose and a big nose.

375
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,220
As expected of a veteran.

376
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,220
I'm not going to be able to do it.

377
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,220
I'm going to do it at 11.

378
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,220
Excuse me, I'm not only taking this boat.

379
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,220
You bastard!

380
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,220
Kotaro!

381
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,220
I'm asking you to be the leader.

382
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,220
You guys are useless.

383
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,220
I want to take it!

384
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,220
Hey!

385
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,220
Shut up!

386
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,220
Isn't it good?

387
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,220
I'm going to make him suffer.

388
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:45,220
The big guests gather once a year for the fishing competition.

389
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,220
But only two of them are fishing at this time of the year.

390
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,220
The members are looking a little worried.

391
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,220
Will they be okay?

392
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,220
It's not good at all. They're not fishing.

393
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,220
They're not fishing.

394
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,220
Only Okuda and Matsumoto.

395
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,220
Hmm...

396
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
But it's a paper boat, so it's like a coin coin.

397
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
It's a coin coin.

398
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,720
Does this have anything to do with the location over there?

399
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,720
Can't you change the boat?

400
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
It doesn't matter to me.

401
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
The bad thing about the pull is bad.

402
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
I'll catch one somehow.

403
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Kotaro-kun, is your pull okay?

404
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
Don't worry about it.

405
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
I'm getting nervous.

406
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,720
The bad guy is you, Yama-chan.

407
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,720
At that time, Aikawa, who was just playing the reel silently, was already in a frustrated mode.

408
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Please turn around.

409
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,720
I just ran the line.

410
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,720
I was watching it. I should have lost at that time.

411
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,280
He missed the chance

412
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,400
He's manly

413
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,100
That is suspicious

414
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,920
It's suspicious

415
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,420
Do you see it?

416
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,760
Somehow

417
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,700
Can you put it a little flat?

418
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,640
parallel to him

419
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,900
Small

420
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,140
Koguta gets the second fish

421
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,140
Oh, it's coming!

422
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,140
Oh, it's coming!

423
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,140
What is this?

424
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,140
It's a dangerous bird.

425
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,140
In addition, Hamada also got the first one in this tournament.

426
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,140
It's small!

427
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,140
It's so small.

428
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,140
It's a dead fish.

429
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,140
Don't lose to this!

430
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,140
Hamada-san, is it small?

431
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,140
Hamada-san's is really small.

432
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,140
I also got a small one.

433
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,140
This is a bit funny.

434
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,140
Right?

435
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,140
This is funny.

436
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,140
You can't say that.

437
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,140
I thought I could get one for my big brother.

438
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,140
But I was wrong.

439
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,140
I'm sure it was a big one.

440
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,140
It's bigger than the one before.

441
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,140
It's a good one.

442
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,140
It's bigger than the one before.

443
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,140
Okuda perfectly got the big size he was looking for.

444
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,140
Why is it so hard to cut?

445
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,140
That's strange.

446
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,140
You should believe in yourself.

447
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,140
Thank you.

448
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,140
It's fast to cut here.

449
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,140
It's fast.

450
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:38,140
By the way, Itoi is being completely separated from the bus he was looking for.

451
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,140
Please.

452
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,140
You, you.

453
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,140
Please, please.

454
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,140
Sorry.

455
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,140
How about this?

456
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,140
This one!

457
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,140
A big shock!

458
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,140
Itoi's favorite bus is not found.

459
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,140
I'm not patient enough.

460
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,140
It's sad.

461
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,140
It's sad, isn't it?

462
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,140
It's sad.

463
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,140
Well, really.

464
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,140
If everyone had caught one fish each...

465
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,140
What?

466
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,140
This bastard.

467
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,140
Somehow...

468
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,140
If you think it's suspicious, you should wait.

469
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,140
Wait?

470
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,140
If you think it's suspicious, you should wait.

471
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,140
Wait for it.

472
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,140
Ah, it's coming!

473
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,140
I caught it!

474
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,140
That was close!

475
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,140
You did it, big brother!

476
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,140
Aikawa's first fish caught!

477
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,140
Hooray!

478
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,140
I'm sorry.

479
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,140
Please show us the fish.

480
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,140
It's a little bit of a fish.

481
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,140
Wow.

482
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,140
This is a good boat.

483
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,140
Thank you.

484
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,140
Can you go on this boat?

485
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,140
That's good.

486
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,140
If you think about it, you can definitely use the fish as a boat.

487
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,140
It's scary.

488
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,140
The whole boat was in a warm atmosphere.

489
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,140
That's good.

490
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,140
It was really good.

491
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,100
Thank you boss

492
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:12,620
Good bye

493
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:25,820
We are ended

494
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,640
Arukata

495
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,640
This is the army!

496
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
Cool!

497
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,640
Attention everyone to the left hand!

498
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
The Japanese army is here!

499
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Hey, come on!

500
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,640
Thank you for your hard work!

501
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,640
Hey, Captain!

502
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,640
Next time, on the next episode of the Tri-Ten-Shen!

503
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,640
It's about time for the final round.

504
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,640
Ishikawa's army suddenly appears and faces a dangerous situation.

505
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,640
The five of them are still aiming for a slight reversal.

506
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,640
And the hero dives into the water.

507
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
In the middle of the battle...

508
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,640
Isn't this the last three?

509
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,640
The big brother is in a rage.

510
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,640
Who will be the one to grab the captain?

511
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,640
This episode was brought to you by Drangostanza.
