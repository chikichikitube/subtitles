1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Chikitsuki Manga Dojo!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Ah, get out of the way!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Once again, Chikitsuki Manga Dojo has come to an end.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Next is me, Hamada Masato.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Thank you very much.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now, let's have a look at today's guests.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
First of all, next to me is Ebisu Yoshikawa-san.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, everyone.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I didn't even know what time this show was going to start.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And next to me is Itou Miki-chan.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Thank you very much.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Have you ever been to the real Manga Dojo?

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
No, but I've been there before.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What did you think of the teacher's book?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, for the time being, I wrote what I was going to write.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Are you underestimating me?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, let's have a good time today.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Next to me is Matsumoto Hitoshi-san.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thank you very much.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not good at drawing.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Liar!

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm pretty good at drawing, though.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not very good at drawing.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, drawing is completely different from drawing.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'd like to show you how to draw.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The first question is this.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Look at this.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's in your hands, too.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's a cross mark.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This flip.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's use this flip.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let's draw a picture diary of summer.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Well, for example...

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't get angry.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Like this.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is a summer cocktail.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, that's what it is.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's something like Hawaii.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm angry.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm tired.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, then, please draw.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Here we go.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What is it?

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, Miki-chan, if you were a man, you'd be hitting me.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I see.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I see.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Ebisu-san, if you were a man, you'd be hitting me.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's start with Ebisu-san.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Here you go, Ebisu-san.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It says, I went to the pool.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What kind of picture is it?

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There are four pools.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I swam here.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
There's a fish swimming next to it.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There's an octopus swimming next to it.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There's a person swimming here.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're an idiot.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well, let's go to Miki-chan.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Miki-chan.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What is it?

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's a beach ball.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's a beach ball.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You're wrong.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, then, Matsumoto-san.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's summer, isn't it?

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's a picture diary of summer, isn't it?

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes, it is.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, I'll use the punishment.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's hot.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's a summer picture diary.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's hot.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What is this?

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll give one to Miki-chan.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Of course.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thank you.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, let's go to the next one.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If I get all of these, what will it be?

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's a top prize.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's a top prize.

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That was a good question.

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The person with the most number of 0s is the top prize.

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The moment you say, it's a top prize,

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
everyone here will clap and say, congratulations.

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And then, this segment will end.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Well, then.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You can get a bonus from the top prize.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What is this?

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This.

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's in everyone's hands.

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This hot spring mark.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Using this hot spring mark,

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
something that spins.

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Right?

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
With something that spins,

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
let's draw something that sticks to your head.

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
For example.

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's like this.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's like this, right?

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's like lightning.

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's right.

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Miki-chan, you're like lightning.

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Right?

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why does it spin?

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What are you doing?

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Spin, spin, spin, spin.

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
My eyes are spinning.

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's like this.

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now, flip.

111
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Who thought of this?

112
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Now, please flip.

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Now, please flip.

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Using this hot spring mark,

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
something that spins.

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Let's draw something that sticks to your head.

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Now, let's go.

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
First, let's start with Elis-san.

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This is a kappa.

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The sun is shining on my head.

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't have any water.

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm spinning because I'm in pain.

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Kappa.

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Elis-san, aren't you happy?

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes, I am.

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Aren't you a little scared?

127
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Miki-chan.

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's a spinning sushi.

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's getting hot in the summer.

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I drew a spinning sushi.

131
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's spinning.

132
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But it's hot in the summer,

133
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
so the steam is coming out from the top of the sushi.

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You idiot.

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Miki, you didn't even touch the girl earlier.

136
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Now, Masato-kun.

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is perfect for me.

138
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Something that spins.

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes, this.

140
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A light girl.

141
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No, something that spins.

142
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm going to spin this in Harappa.

143
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Idiot.

144
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's...

145
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You're being spinned by a person.

146
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's something that spins.

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm not going to say yes.

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll give one to Elis-san.

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Thank you.

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Congratulations.

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's over.

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hello, everyone.

153
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Hello.

154
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're noisy.

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Last week, I told you that I was thinking about new shows.

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I've been thinking about it since then,

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
but there are good ones.

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
For example, what kind of shows?

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This will definitely get 60 or 70 views.

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Are you serious?

161
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's too much.

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Will you get it?

163
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll definitely get it.

164
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
60 or 70?

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll definitely get it.

166
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What kind of show is it?

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's a crane.

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's a big costume.

169
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'll make it look cool.

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
For example, a big costume like a rock.

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's right.

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There's a Nittere at the bottom.

173
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's like a Nittere on top.

174
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's right.

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll drop the costume at 10 counts.

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll drop it on top of the Nittere.

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Zero.

178
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Bang.

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That's too much.

180
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What?

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why don't you make a proper show?

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Why?

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What are you going to do?

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I've been thinking about it.

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I want to experiment with it.

186
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
A skit with a smell.

187
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There's a big pipe on the side.

188
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We're going to make a skit here.

189
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
There's a smell coming out from the side.

190
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's like, hey, it's going to rain.

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If you go like this, the smell of the sun will come out.

192
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This will definitely get 60 views.

193
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's going to be embarrassing.

194
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Why do you have to go to the TV and smell it?

195
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I want to go home with a smile on my face.

196
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
When I go out...

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Why?

198
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm thinking about the second part of the drama.

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What do you think about this?

200
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's the end of the first episode.

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's the end of the first episode.

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There's a man who's a salaryman.

203
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He's an old man.

204
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Everyone in the family is warm.

205
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But he's sick.

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
There's a lot of crying and talking going on.

207
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There's a lot of fighting going on in the family.

208
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
There's a lot of things going on.

209
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's been an hour.

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm not saying I'm not going to die, but it's getting red.

211
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's getting red.

212
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
In the hospital.

213
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's dangerous.

214
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's dangerous.

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There's a lot of family.

216
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Dad, Dad, get a hold of yourself.

217
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm standing in front of the door.

218
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There's no laughing at all.

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm serious.

220
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's a normal drama when it's over.

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Dad's like,

222
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm not going to die.

223
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm not going to die.

224
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Dad, Dad.

225
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Dad's like,

226
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
His eyes are like,

227
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
His eyes are like,

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
His eyes are like,

229
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's only the last few seconds.

230
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The husband is like,

231
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
2 and a half hours after birth,

232
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He's like,

233
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

234
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

235
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

237
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

238
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The second time, this one,

239
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't know if it's going to be spicy, but

240
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
There's a couple.

241
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But my parents are against me getting married.

242
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I just can't get married.

243
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm going to die.

244
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I stay Medicare for things like that.

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's going to rain.

246
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
When I get home,

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay, it's written,

248
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The second time,

249
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay, it's written,

250
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But the Greenway Arisaka

251
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I've talked a lot about it.

252
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I've talked a lot about it.

253
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
zero

254
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
He was,

255
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,520
I don't know if he's with the

256
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,520
Who's going to pay for the car?

257
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,520
That's the guy who was driving the car.

258
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Are you going to pay for it?

259
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
You're a fool!

260
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
You're a fool!

261
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
It's a long story!

262
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,520
You don't need to go that far.

263
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,520
I'm thinking about the third one.

264
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,520
It's about the police.

265
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
It's about the police.

266
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
It's about the police.

267
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
It's about the police.

268
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Let's make a good police force.

269
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,520
They've been coming here since I was a kid.

270
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,520
That's right.

271
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
That's right.

272
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,520
I'm going to keep taking care of the sick.

273
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
I want you to become a police officer.

274
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Poor guy.

275
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,520
I can't stand it without tears.

276
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,520
Finally, it's time to be a police officer.

277
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
That's great.

278
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,520
I had my first...

279
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
I had my first...

280
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
I had my first...

281
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
I had my first...

282
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
I had my first...

283
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
I had my first...

284
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
I had my first...

285
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
I had my first...

286
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
I had my first...

287
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
I had my first...

288
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
I had my first...

289
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
I had my first...

290
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
I had my first...

291
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
My first...

292
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
I had my first...

293
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
I had my first...

294
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
I became an officer,

295
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
I became an official

296
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
I became an official

297
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
I became an official

298
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
I became an official

299
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,720
I became an official

300
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
Surrender the enemy.

301
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Surrender the enemy.

302
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,520
When I was視 Incorporated...

303
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,700
When I wasraft in a

304
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,760
Renovation

305
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,760
After all, I think the most pathetic thing is the goat.

306
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,760
It's the most pathetic thing in the world.

307
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
It can't be helped.

308
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
Both the dog and the cat are the same.

309
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,760
The dog and the cat are still the same, but the cat is terrible.

310
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,760
Even if you hit the goat's face, it's the same.

311
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Even if you hit the dog, it's the same.

312
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
It's the same.

313
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
I'm the only one who doesn't like the goat.

314
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,760
The one who gave you a name is the one who was influenced by other people, right?

315
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
What?

316
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Firefly squid.

317
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
I was influenced by other people.

318
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
There was a person who was shining.

319
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
You decided to name it Firefly, right?

320
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Yes.

321
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,760
Then, excuse me, but this squid is shining.

322
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
It's a firefly squid.

323
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,760
The feeling of a firefly squid that has been decided like this is really painful.

324
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Can you be quiet?

325
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,760
I want you to name it more seriously.

326
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,760
I don't care. Why do you want to name it?

327
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Are you thinking about a child's name?

328
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
I'm not thinking about it.

329
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
I'm not thinking about it.

330
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Come on.

331
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,760
I'm always thinking about it.

332
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
I'm tired of thinking about it.

333
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,760
If you think about it, I'll hit you.

334
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
I can't think about it from here.

335
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,760
If you think about it, I'll hit you.

336
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
I used to think about it a lot in the past.

337
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Are you stupid?

338
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,760
I used to think about it a lot in the past.

339
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
Don't laugh.

340
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
Don't laugh.

341
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,760
Are you stupid?

342
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
Don't think about it like that.

343
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,760
Are you thinking about a child's name?

344
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,760
I'm doing my best, but I'm not thinking about it.

345
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
Don't think about it like that.

346
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
You're really bad.

347
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
Don't think about it like that.

348
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,760
I'm the one who's thinking about it.

349
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,760
I'm the one who's paying for it.

350
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,760
I'm doing my best, but I'm not thinking about it.

351
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
Don't laugh.

352
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
I have to make you laugh.

353
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,760
That's why I can't think about it.

354
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,760
There are 15 minutes a month.

355
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,760
For example, if Hanshin Kyojin comes out, it's 15 minutes.

356
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,760
If Sakuroshiro comes out, it's 15 minutes.

357
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
If Nikuyo Kurou comes out, it's 15 minutes.

358
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Everyone is 15 minutes.

359
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
I'm 15 minutes, too.

360
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,760
I have to do a manzai for 15 minutes, right?

361
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
I'm doing a manzai.

362
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,760
If I'm not in a position to listen, I can't go home.

363
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
I can't go to the dressing room.

364
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
I can't go to the dressing room.

365
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
I can't go to the dressing room.

366
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
I can't go to the dressing room.

367
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
I'm...

368
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,760
What does that mean?

369
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,760
I'm always very serious about my feelings for comedians.

370
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
If you're there, don't talk.

371
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
I'm always thinking about it on the stage.

372
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,760
I'm going to do it today, too.

373
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,760
When comedians are sleeping, they're either going to win or lose.

374
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Wait a minute.

375
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
I'm going to do it today, too.

376
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,760
I've been waiting with my sleeves like this at least once.

377
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,760
I'm pushing it in my heart.

378
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
I'm going to win or lose.

379
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
I'm doing it.

380
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm going to go out and say,

381
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
I lost.

382
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
I'm going home.

383
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
I'm going home.

384
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,760
I'm not serious about that yet.

385
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,760
There's a time when I can't go home.

386
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
I have to go to the dressing room at 1.15.

387
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,760
I have to go to the dressing room 30 minutes before.

388
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
I can't go to the dressing room.

389
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
I have to go out alone.

390
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
I have to go out alone and do a comedy.

391
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
I have to go out and say,

392
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
Hey, hey!

393
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Go to bed!

394
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
I don't know what to say.

395
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Hey, you.

396
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,760
I'll tell you something.

397
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,760
I was wearing it.

398
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,760
What?

399
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
I was wearing it.

400
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,760
Why are you wearing your sleeves on the stage?

401
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,760
I'm going to watch your show in the audience.

402
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
You're crazy.

403
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,760
You're crazy.

404
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
You're late.

405
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Which one is more?

406
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
You're more.

407
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
It's you!

408
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
It's you!

409
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,760
In Osaka, I was doing the show from 4 p.m. to 1 p.m.

410
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Monday through Friday.

411
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Live.

412
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
For an hour.

413
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,760
At 4 p.m., when the sound of the opening came out,

414
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,760
The band came out of the door and said,

415
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,760
Hello.

416
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,760
And the show always started.

417
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
That's it.

418
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
It's a live broadcast.

419
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,760
I called the live opening.

420
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
If you're awake, come on.

421
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,760
Hey, you.

422
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,760
You woke up at 4 o'clock.

423
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,760
You were watching the opening at home.

424
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,760
It's a show called 4 o'clock.

425
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
I went to the 4 o'clock before.

426
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
In the morning.

427
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
It's 4 o'clock.

428
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
I was waiting.

429
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
You're tired.

430
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
It's open.

431
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
That's what it is.

432
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
Come on on time.

433
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,760
I often say that I'm sorry that you're late.

434
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
I'm not late.

435
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,760
There's a guy called Rollers.

436
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
He plays music.

437
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
He called me.

438
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,760
Why aren't you late?

439
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
I'm sorry.

440
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
It's important to be late.

441
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
Come on.

442
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
Even if you say so.

443
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,760
You're here.

444
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,760
I can't help it if I'm angry with you.

445
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,760
I'll do this much.

446
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,760
I'm sorry.

447
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,760
The next day, I'm late.

448
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
That's right.

449
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
He called me.

450
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
Hey.

451
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
Why are you late?

452
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,760
It's important to be late.

453
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
You're here.

454
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
I can't help it if I'm angry with you.

455
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,760
It's important to be late.

456
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
I'm angry.

457
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
Hello.

458
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Hello.

459
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,760
Don't you have a class today?

460
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,760
Really?

461
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
Are you a general?

462
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,760
What's your name?

463
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,760
I'm Matsumoto.

464
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
Matsumoto?

465
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
How old are you?

466
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
I'm a student.

467
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,760
What are you doing now?

468
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
I'm a student.

469
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Why are you here?

470
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,760
I see.

471
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,760
I understand.

472
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,760
Idiot.

473
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
Let's do it again.

474
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Let's do it again.

475
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
What are you doing?

476
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
Thank you very much.

477
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
This person is asking Hama-chan a question.

478
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,760
Can you speak without using Osaka dialect?

479
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
Please speak with Matsumoto-chan.

480
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,760
You should speak in Osaka dialect.

481
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
I can speak Osaka dialect well.

482
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
I can use standard Japanese.

483
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
Please speak in Osaka dialect.

484
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,760
What?

485
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Is it okay?

486
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
Is it okay?

487
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
It's very hot these days.

488
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,760
I see.

489
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
What time did you get on the train today?

490
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,760
I got on the train at 12.48.

491
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
What time did you get on the train?

492
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
I got on the train after 3 hours.

493
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
It's been 4 months.

494
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
I'm not used to it.

495
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,760
I can't speak fast.

496
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
But I can speak fast.

497
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,760
You can't speak fast.

498
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
I can.

499
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
Really?

500
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Yes.

501
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,760
What did you do last night?

502
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
I was on the radio yesterday.

503
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,760
I was with you.

504
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
You are an old man.

505
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
You are old.

506
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,760
It's impossible to be born as a man.

507
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
It's difficult.

508
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
It's impossible.

509
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
But it's okay.

510
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
It's been a year.

511
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,760
You are right.

512
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,760
I'm getting used to it.

513
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,760
You have to get used to it soon.

514
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,760
That's right.

515
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Let's talk in standard Japanese until the end.

516
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,760
Okay.

517
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Okay.

518
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,760
Say, let's talk.

519
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Let's talk.

520
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,760
Let's talk.

521
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,760
Even a normal person says, let's talk.

522
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,760
Say it.

523
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Say it.

524
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Really?

525
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Say it.

526
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
It's cold.

527
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,760
Is that all?

528
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,760
Do you want me to say more?

529
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,760
That's all.

530
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
That's all?

531
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
I've been talking too much lately.

532
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
That's right.

533
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,760
That's not true.

534
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,760
Half of what I heard today is not true.

535
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,760
It's simple.

536
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
I'm tired.

537
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
I don't understand.

538
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
It's embarrassing to bite.

539
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
What?

540
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,760
I don't understand what you mean by biting.

541
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
But you can't deceive me with that tone.

542
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
That's right.

543
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Let's watch the encore video of the Tokyo Dome concert.

544
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
It's fun.

545
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,760
It's fun.

546
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
It's fun.

547
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
The encore is really cool.

548
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,760
It's really exciting.

549
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,760
He changed his costume and came out.

550
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,760
He sang like this.

551
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
He wore a white suit.

552
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
You can watch the video.

553
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
It's really cool.

554
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
He wore a white suit.

555
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,760
He came out like this.

556
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,760
He sang like this.

557
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
What kind of scene is that?

558
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
That's not true.

559
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
He came out and sang like this.

560
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
Is that true?

561
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
That's true.

562
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
You can watch the video.

563
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
The audience doesn't understand.

564
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
They're excited.

565
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,760
That's not true.

566
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,760
He's laughing.

567
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
I made a mistake.

568
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,760
They don't understand when I'm excited.

569
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,760
They don't understand when I'm excited.

570
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,760
You're a mother.
