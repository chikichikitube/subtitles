1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Next time, we'll be talking about Kokoriko Endo, the 7th Henge!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Is this Endo's 7th Henge?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right. We'll be looking for a spot for Kokoriko.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today, we'll be talking about Kokoriko's...

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's call him in.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Endo, please come in.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Good evening.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Good evening, Endo-san.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Are you okay?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm okay.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm really okay.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's a bit strange.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Are you okay?

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's you who's okay!

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Look at this.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There were 7 people in the past.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The 1st place is Otomo.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
29,000 yen.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The 3rd place is Takasu, the writer.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
7,000 yen.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
At the very least, it's your turn.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's right.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If there's anything worth 7,000 yen,

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
next week, we'll be having a one-person talk.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This program was brought to you by the following sponsors.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There's a lot of new stuff coming in.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What is this? An impersonation of the staff?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What do you do?

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I impersonate Kazo Funagi.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Kazo Funagi?

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Is that okay?

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Kazo Funagi?

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Excuse me.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, well.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You impersonated Kazo Funagi at that time.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is the character.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is the character.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't know if you're watching or not.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't know.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Well, well, well.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What is that?

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Downtown's 24-hour marathon.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's Hamada.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why?

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's impossible.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's difficult.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's difficult.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What should I do?

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't think we should all do something.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't think we should all do something.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hello?

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hello?

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Is this Inoki?

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm in Shikoku.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm in Shikoku.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Thank you.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We have a script.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I think it's a little different from the first time.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No, no.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I thought it was fine.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We have to do it.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's already decided.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Excuse me.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't want you to do it.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No, I'm not. I'm not the one who's talking.

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry if I interrupted you on the way.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sorry.

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's difficult to talk for 22 hours.

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hello?

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hello?

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hello?

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Hello?

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hello?

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hello?

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes.

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's long.

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Can't you read the whole thing?

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The fact that we're starting to talk doesn't mean that we don't accept it.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I got a taxi ticket.

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Taxi?

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I have a lot of free time, so I'd like you to drop me off if you can.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Thank you.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Is this 700 yen?

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes.

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Thank you.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's a little over 3,000 yen.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm always late for work, so I don't know what to do.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's a little expensive.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's difficult.

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Is 700 yen okay?

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The price is okay.

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Teacher, do you think this is going to fall?

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's definitely not going to fall.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's not going to fall.

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's not going to fall?

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What is this?

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's a receipt for the convenience store.

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's difficult.

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's not going to fall?

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Can't you read the whole thing?

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The whole thing?

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Read it for me.

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's not going to fall?

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's impossible for convenience stores.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's impossible for convenience stores?

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's definitely not going to fall.

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's not going to fall.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Matsumoto.

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
At first, it was a little...

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
At first, it was a little funny.

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I want to read it myself.

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,020
It's a

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Enno.

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's a picture of Enno.

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's a picture of Enno.

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hey, this is the worst.

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What should I do?

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is dangerous.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Why am I dangerous?

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's cute, but it's dangerous.

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's taken.

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's taken.

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's taken.

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Face.

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's taken.

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's taken.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's taken.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Whose face is this?

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Whose face is this?

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's cute.

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Whose face is this?

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Whose face is this?

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't know.

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's taken.

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Take a good picture.

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I think it's off.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This video...

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I think it's on.

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This video.

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Let's stop each other with a more normal expression.

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're really something.

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't know what to do.

145
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's get it on.

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm telling you in the video.

147
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're telling the digital camera?

148
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm telling the digital camera.

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's get it on.

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Nothing good will come out.

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Ready, set.

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Do you want to smoke?

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Wait a minute.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What the hell did I do?

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What should I do?

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't want to smoke from here!

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Idiot!

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That was safe.

159
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But when I put out the cigarette, a firefly got stuck in my finger.

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It was so heavy that it got stuck in my finger.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Idiot.

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm gonna smoke.

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
How long have you been smoking?

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
2-3 hours.

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I've been smoking since then.

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I see.

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Then next time...

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You don't have to smoke.

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You smoke.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm smoking.

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You don't have to smoke.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You don't have to smoke.

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You don't have to smoke.

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You don't have to smoke.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Then next time, I'm gonna smoke with this.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It was normal for me to be escalating, idiot.

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Say sorry to your mother.

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Say sorry to your mother.

179
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Say sorry to your mother.

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Say sorry to your mother.

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Say sorry to your mother.

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What the hell?

183
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's 16,000 yen.

184
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's too much.

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's 16,000 yen.

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Ah, Suwa-chan, you're out.

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Thank you for your hard work.

188
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Eh?

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Thank you for your hard work.

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Thank you.

191
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
As for the amount, I'm in 3rd place.

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Really?

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yes, 16,000 yen.

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes, thank you.

195
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's just that everyone...

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
How do you say it?

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't feel like it.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll close it for a while.

199
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes.

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Thank you for your hard work.

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes, it's me.

202
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's a very dark ending.

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

204
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Thank you very much.

205
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Now, Marimo-san.

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes, yes, yes.

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Well, I'm sorry at the beginning, but...

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Let's take a look at the players' airs.

210
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's cold.

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You guys, you guys, you guys, you guys.

212
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hey, hey, hey.

213
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Stop it.

214
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Stop it.

215
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Hey.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Stop it.

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Hey, hey, hey.

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I was surprised.

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You just left a guest.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You came out of nowhere.

221
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I thought it was a guest.

222
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't know.

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't know if it's over, but...

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
There are only guests who came to see the mountain.

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yes, yes, yes.

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't know if I should say hello properly.

227
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm scared.

228
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I just ran away.

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Thank you very much.

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Good luck, good luck.

231
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Don't make me laugh.

232
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't make me laugh.

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm crazy.

234
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm crazy.

235
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Hamashou.

236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hamashou.

237
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Is there anyone on your birthday?

238
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Don't hate me.

239
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We're family.

240
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Naoko.

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Naoko.

242
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Happy birthday to you.

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Happy birthday to you.

244
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Happy birthday, dear Naoko.

245
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Happy birthday to you.

246
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The results are out.

247
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You can see it in the graph.

248
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It shows every minute.

249
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yes, yes.

250
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Last time, we started 30 minutes late for Naita.

251
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
When you start 30 minutes late, the numbers are good.

252
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
To be honest.

253
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I thought it wouldn't start.

254
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Everyone is waiting with the channel together.

255
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Do you understand?

256
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes, yes.

257
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Are you a human being?

258
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's easy to understand.

259
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I was told that.

260
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It was like I was sleeping in the afternoon.

261
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It was a very interesting result.

262
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Until now, Yamagaki has nothing to do with it.

263
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We are on the show.

264
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Until now, the number of viewers is 20.1%.

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
From now on, Yamagaki is alone.

266
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Shall we call Yamagaki?

267
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Let's call him.

268
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Now.

269
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's interesting.

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
He came out.

271
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He came out.

272
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Did you hear that?

273
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Did you hear that?

274
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This is the time when you were alone.

275
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Thank you very much.

276
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
To be honest, in the second half, we were chasing you.

277
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That part is a little like this.

278
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That's right.

279
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
This is the number of viewers that Yamagaki has.

280
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's right.

281
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
This is the number of viewers that I have.

282
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And you have exceeded 20%.

283
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You have exceeded 20% so far.

284
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I have exceeded it.

285
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I have exceeded it.

286
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This is the time.

287
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's a game.

288
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let's see.

289
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Be quiet.

290
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I won't be quiet.

291
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Ta-da.

292
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Up to here.

293
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
After all.

294
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
This is the line of 20%.

295
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yamagaki will return to the backstage once.

296
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
When I returned to the backstage, we were there.

297
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's right.

298
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's why it's gradually coming out here.

299
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yes.

300
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I have exceeded 20% there.

301
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yes.

302
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yamagaki appeared again.

303
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I thought it was Gakun.

304
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This means that the average number of viewers for Yamagaki is 18.7%.

305
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You are too angry.

306
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's enough.

307
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's true.

308
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's enough.

309
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
This is.

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I think I did my best as Yamagaki.

311
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
This time, the overall average is 19.4%.

312
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It was a little more overall.

313
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's right.

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Overall.

315
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't want to see a good guy screaming.

316
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There was a reason.

317
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I want to see the person who cried on the stage for the first time.

318
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Even though I've fallen so far, I went up a little.

319
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's true that I went down a little with the impersonation of Yumi Adachi.

320
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I went up a little because I was going to do it.

321
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I went up.

322
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I did a good job.

323
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I didn't exceed 20%.

324
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Now.

325
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Punishment.

326
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I can't accept the punishment.

327
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't look like this, but I'm really angry.

328
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That's right.

329
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If you spend too much time on your punishment, it will go down again.

330
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
No, no, no.

331
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Punishment.

332
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I think I'll get my injection.

333
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Don't die.

334
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Even if you die.

335
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Don't die.

336
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm angry.

337
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's a life-threatening thing.

338
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That's right.

339
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But the audience is not reflecting.

340
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yamazaki.

341
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes.

342
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I think so.

343
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Why is that?

344
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's embarrassing.

345
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You came out again today.

346
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The entertainer got off the stage and ran away.

347
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I saw it for the first time.

348
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I saw it for the first time.

349
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
If you're a doctor, you can't get out of your stomach.

350
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Do you know what you did?

351
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I know.

352
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's a ridiculous thing.

353
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's ridiculous.

354
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I know that.

355
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I thought about it.

356
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I think I'm going to cry.

357
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What is the punishment?

358
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't think I can do this.

359
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I can't help it.

360
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's not fun to do it here.

361
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Skydiving Bose.

362
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Dangerous.

363
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Tandem.

364
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Skydiving Bose.

365
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Wait a minute.

366
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Can you follow me?

367
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Of course.

368
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll fly with you.

369
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We'll fly together.

370
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The doctor behind us will buy it while we're flying.

371
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Wait a minute.

372
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Dangerous.

373
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The doctor behind you is not a skydiving doctor, but a hair salon doctor.

374
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm a skydiving doctor.

375
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Why?

376
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You're going to get a weird haircut.

377
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What kind of smell is that?

378
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Which one are you going to take?

379
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That's a skydiving professional.

380
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll take a skydiving professional.

381
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But that professional is not a hair salon professional.

382
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You don't want to come down in a weird way, do you?

383
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
No, no.

384
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's crazy.

385
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm not a skydiving doctor.

386
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm here.

387
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Your cute juniors are here.

388
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm here.

389
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Kokoriko also did a seven-stage performance at the opening today.

390
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
This was also Don's Belly.

391
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
If you want, I can fly with you.

392
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Of course, I'll fly with you.

393
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's for sure.

394
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Let me say something.

395
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Will it last long?

396
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It will last long.

397
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Please stop.

398
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Why can't we stop?

399
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
My nose.

400
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
My nose is coming out.

401
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Are you stupid?

402
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
My nose is coming out.

403
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That's weird.

404
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's not weird.

405
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's not weird.

406
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's not weird.

407
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If you turn around, you're not responsible.

408
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Why are we responsible?

409
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Because you're involved when you're drinking.

410
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You said you could get 20%.

411
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I didn't say that.

412
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
What are you talking about?

413
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Because this week...

414
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What are you talking about?

415
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What are you talking about?

416
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What are you talking about?

417
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The seven-stage performance is also the seven-stage performance in Edo.

418
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm not in it.

419
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm not involved.

420
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
There's a connection between here and here.

421
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That's right.

422
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I know you can't be punished.

423
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Why?

424
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
We're partners.

425
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't think so.

426
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I really don't like it.

427
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't like it.

428
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But I'm jealous of you.

429
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm jealous of you.

430
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm not jealous of you.

431
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm not wearing it.

432
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm wearing a T-shirt.

433
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Why are you wearing a T-shirt?

434
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The T-shirt is a good size.

435
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Why are you wearing a T-shirt?

436
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What kind of T-shirt is that?

437
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:09,000
After the performance, the audience who came last week had no fun.

438
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So I'm going to go to their house.

439
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm going to bring a castella.

440
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
A castella?

441
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm going to bring a castella and a raw yatsuhashi.

442
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm going to go there with a castella.

443
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Are you going to apologize for going to a castella place?

444
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
If I don't forgive them, I'll have to think about it again.

445
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

446
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I ran away.

447
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I shouldn't have run away.

448
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I brought some sweets.

449
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Isn't it something you do when you have an accident?

450
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's an accident.

451
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's called a comedy harassment.

452
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's a comedy harassment.

453
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Wait a minute.

454
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Wait a minute.

455
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Wait a minute.

456
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What did we do?

457
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You're the closest senior to me.

458
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Did you get a haircut?

459
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Did you get a haircut?

460
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What are you talking about?

461
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's not a big deal.

462
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
My partner is bisexual.

463
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That's a big deal.

464
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That's a big deal.

465
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I've done that about four times.

466
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:40,000
If you were to die tomorrow at 2 p.m., what would you do?

467
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I see.

468
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'll die at 2 a.m.

469
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'll definitely die.

470
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'll definitely die.

471
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'll tell you the truth.

472
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I won't do anything for you.

473
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What do you mean?

474
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Because I can't do anything for you.

475
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What do you mean?

476
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll die before you do.

477
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Why?

478
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's a life without you, so I can't think about it.

479
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You...

480
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You...

481
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You can't do it, can you?

482
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Why do sunflowers look at the sun and bloom?

483
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Sunflowers look at those who give them more energy.

484
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I see.

485
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's why you're always looking at me.

486
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's because it's work.

487
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The customers are always looking at me.

488
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
In the end, I'm the one taking pictures of you.

489
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Please tell me how to give a high impression to the guy at the toll booth on the highway.

490
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
When you pay the money.

491
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You open it again and pay, right?

492
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
How to give a high impression at that time.

493
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Even if you don't say anything and you get a high impression, most people don't do that.

494
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Like Mr. Goro.

495
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's right.

496
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I want to give a high impression to him.

497
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I usually open the window and say,

498
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Long time no see.

499
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Who is that?

500
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Shobari Aikawa.

501
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
He looks like him.

502
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's been a long time, Mr. Eiji.

503
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Why are you doing this now?

504
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's because of Aikawa.

505
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's a little popular among me.

506
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's been a long time.

507
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I want you to say something to him.

508
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Just one word.

509
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You don't do that, do you?

510
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
No, I don't.

511
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Have you ever said that to someone?

512
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
When I get a high impression, I say it properly.

513
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I do it properly to people who are able to work.

514
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
When I get on the highway, I usually pay 10,000 yen.

515
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I show him 10,000 yen.

516
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Do you understand?

517
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Let's all do this.

518
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Otherwise, if you pay 10,000 yen after stopping, he will be in a hurry.

519
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That's true.

520
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I have to tell him that it's 10,000 yen.

521
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But if you pay 10,000 yen, he will approach you.

522
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
What?

523
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Even if you pay 10,000 yen, he will approach you.

524
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
That's unusual.

525
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
If you open the window and pay 10,000 yen, he will approach you.

526
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
If you pay 10,000 yen, he will approach you.

527
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:59,000
If you think about cars, it's not strange, but if you don't have a car, you're a fool.

528
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I don't understand.

529
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:19,000
