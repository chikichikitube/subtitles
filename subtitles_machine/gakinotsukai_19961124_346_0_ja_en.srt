1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The first time, we were at the Gaki no Tsutaya.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We were doing a prank on Yamazaki.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Nakamura died!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Good evening.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today, we're going to trick Yamazaki for the first time in a while.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, I'm used to being tricked.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm very careful.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's right.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's what we thought.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The staff, Nakamura.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's pretend he's dead.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
He's already dead.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Actually, I thought he was dead when we finished the七変言.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He's already dead.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
First, let's call the main character.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He's already dead.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He's already dead.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is scary.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The reason why we asked Nakamura to be here today is because...

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is the most boring part.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Even if he's dead?

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is Nakamura Yoshinobu.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He's the most mischievous guy in the history of the Gaki no Tsutaya.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
He's the most mischievous guy in the history of the Gaki no Tsutaya.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Actually, this prank has already been done since last week.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Nakamura approached Yamazaki.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He promised to give Yamazaki 100,000 yen next week.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He promised to give Yamazaki 100,000 yen next week.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yamazaki was impressed by the last conversation with him scheduled for next week.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Actually, this is a big hit.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's pretend Nakamura is dead.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Then, he will appear.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Got it.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Nakamura, who was supposed to die in a car accident, appears in the back seat of the car.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Will Yamazaki be able to withstand the fear?

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I've been practicing for a long time.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I've been practicing for a long time.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Really?

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm Hagi.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm Hagi.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Good morning.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Good morning.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Good morning.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Good morning.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It seems he's going deep inside.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Is it 12 o'clock today?

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Your face is so stretched out.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You actually go for a walk?

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Are you a foodie?

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh, I see.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's like a weird prank, isn't it?

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I got it!

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I got it!

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You guys!

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's so hot!

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't want to talk to you.

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What?

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Really?

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What about you, Samo?

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I told you that I can talk to you.

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But I don't know how to do it.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Really?

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What about you, Doji?

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't know how to do it.

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Maybe tomorrow or the day after.

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Maybe we can talk about it.

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
How about you, Okamoto?

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't know how to do it.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Good evening.

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Good evening.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Is it that bad?

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I think so.

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Thank you so much.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You know, people say that he goes through a really tough time.

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okamoto, thank you so much.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Good morning.

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He's coming.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why are you going to the bathroom?

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He's coming.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Look behind you.

87
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's the same thing.

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What?

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Are you still talking about it?

90
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes.

91
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I see.

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What's wrong?

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't know.

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Are you okay?

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't know.

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't know.

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't know.

98
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't know.

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't know.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't know.

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't know.

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't know.

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't know.

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Look inside the car.

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Look behind you.

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He's coming.

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Are you okay?

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wait a minute.

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I promised you.

110
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Wait a minute.

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I promised you.

112
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What's wrong?

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What's wrong?

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't know what's going on.

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What's wrong?

116
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Did you have 100,000 yen?

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Did you have 100,000 yen?

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You were worried about that, weren't you?

119
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I've been saying that for a long time.

120
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What's going on with 100,000 yen?

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't know what's going on.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What's wrong?

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I don't know what's going on.

124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yamaguchi, do you have a job after this?

126
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't have a job.

127
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's a lie.

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's a lie.

129
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What are you doing?

131
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're a woman. You can't go out alone.

132
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Come to the dressing room.

133
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Come to the dressing room.

134
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I got it.

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I got it.

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You're so mean.

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You're so mean.

138
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Don't take money from me.

139
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's cold, isn't it?

140
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
There's a place to stand.

141
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't know what's going on, but you're over there.

142
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm over here.

143
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's decided, isn't it?

144
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It doesn't matter what kind of show it is.

145
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There's a commercial going on right now.

146
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
AM, PM.

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm being blown away by fear.

148
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm being blown away from this side.

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's annoying, isn't it?

150
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
A jet plane is blown away by such a big fan.

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's the only time I'm over there.

152
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Wait a minute.

153
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm not the only one who says I don't buy it.

154
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That's strange, isn't it?

155
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's a very detailed place.

156
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Wait a minute.

157
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
When I'm doing it alone, I'm over here and you're over here.

158
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's right.

159
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
In your case, there's a man over here.

160
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
In your case, there's a woman over here.

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
There's a woman over here.

162
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
There are two at the end.

163
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
There are two at the end.

164
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Why do you only say that at that time?

165
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You're wasting your history.

166
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Why am I over here?

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm doing this.

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Hamada is over here, so it's okay.

169
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's okay.

170
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's okay.

171
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm not in trouble.

172
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm not in trouble because I was blown away by the wind.

173
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's not the case.

174
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Why is it only today?

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Why is it only me on this day?

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm a little depressed after I got home.

177
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Why?

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't know.

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Why?

180
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's the same in magazines, isn't it?

181
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm the only one who takes pictures with a bad mouth in downtown.

182
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Why?

183
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Why am I always the opposite wind?

184
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Why is it the same today?

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Do you remember?

186
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's the same with pictures of two people.

187
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't do TV these days, but I'll do it on the cover.

188
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
When you take a picture of a single talent, you should take the best picture.

189
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
When it comes to two people, you prioritize the good image of one person.

190
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Obviously.

191
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Wait a minute.

192
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's not the case.

193
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You think too much about it.

194
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's obvious that you're the one who chooses.

195
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's Hama-chan's book.

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I chose it with the feeling of Hama-chan and lemon.

197
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's enough.

198
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You're a bad person.

199
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Even if you're alone, there are some weird pictures.

200
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes, there are.

201
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
This is a picture of the last episode of FOCUS.

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why did you take a picture of Tenno-kawa?

203
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Why did you take a picture of Yamafu?

204
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What is it?

205
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm not angry.

206
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
How is everyone?

207
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
How are you doing?

208
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm fine.

209
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm sorry to say something like an old man, but this year is early.

210
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's early.

211
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm sorry to say something like an old man.

212
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What is it?

213
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm about 40 years old.

214
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Don't say that.

215
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's right.

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm not 40 years old.

217
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's okay if a man is 40 years old.

218
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The age of a man and a woman is completely different.

219
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
A man's 40 years old is about a woman's 25 years old.

220
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Don't say that.

222
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If it's at least 10 years old, a woman's 25 years old is an old woman.

223
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
There are various ideas.

224
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
25 years old is an old woman.

225
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
A woman's 25 years old is an old woman.

226
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
A woman's 25 years old is an old woman, and a man's 40 years old is an old man.

227
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This is exactly the same.

228
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You guys are stupid.

229
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's you.

230
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Don't say that.

231
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'll say it because I'm in my place.

232
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If a man is 40 years old, can you fall in love?

233
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes.

234
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
A woman's 25 years old is the time limit.

235
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Wait a minute.

236
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
A woman's 25 years old is your time limit.

237
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
There's a difference between men and women.

238
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What's your time limit?

239
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Your...

240
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What's your time limit?

241
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
When is the man's time limit?

242
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Why are you so stubborn?

243
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What's wrong with you?

244
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're sweating all by yourself.

245
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What's wrong with you?

246
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
When is the woman's time limit?

247
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:39,000
About 35 years old.

248
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You're so mean.

249
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What's wrong with you?

250
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You have a big target.

251
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You have a lot of coins.

252
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Did you find out?

253
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm so angry.

254
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Why am I the bad guy?

255
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You're 35 years old because you're not old.

256
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You're 25 years old because you're not old.

257
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I saw the woman there.

258
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's okay. You can't be honest.

259
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
How old are you?

260
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
22 years old.

261
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
24 years old.

262
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's over next year.

263
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's okay.

264
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You're cool.

265
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:47,000
When you eat a cup of ice cream, please teach me how to lick the lid.

266
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Of course.

267
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Please teach me.

268
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Of course.

269
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's okay.

270
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What should I start with?

271
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Start with the moon.

272
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I thought you were going to teach me how to eat grapes.

273
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Please teach me how to lick the lid of a cup of ice cream.

274
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's okay.

275
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Even if you teach me how to eat grapes?

276
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Please lick the lid.

277
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Like this.

278
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I opened it.

279
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And?

280
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's a miso-like thing.

281
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You're like a mountain.

282
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's amazing.

283
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's not cool.

284
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Please teach me how to lick the lid without spilling it.

285
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
How to lick the lid without spilling it.

286
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
When you open the lid and lick the lid like this, it's not cool.

287
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's right.

288
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I see.

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So you have to open the lid and lick the lid from here.

290
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's weird.

291
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Are you so desperate?

292
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You have to go like this.

293
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's more comfortable.

294
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Why?

295
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You have to open the lid and lick the lid.

296
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You can't do it at once.

297
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You have to open the lid and lick the lid.

298
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Why are you holding the lid?

299
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What kind of situation is this?

300
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You have to put it on the desk.

301
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I know that.

302
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You have to lick the lid.

303
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't know what you're eating.

304
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You have to put it on the desk.

305
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Why?

306
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You have to put it on the desk.

307
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Where are you eating?

308
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You have to put it on the desk.

309
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't understand your background.

310
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The office!

311
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The company?

312
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The company.

313
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You have to call the company.

314
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You have to call the company.

315
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You know, right?

316
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You have to put it on the desk.

317
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You have to put it on the desk.

318
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You have to lick the lid from here.

319
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's so annoying.

320
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You don't have to do that.

321
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I want you to steal a lot from me.

322
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What do you want me to steal?

323
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Your coolness.

324
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You can teach me. I'll imitate you.

325
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What do you want me to do?

326
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Your coolness.

327
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Have you ever thought about how to walk?

328
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
When a kid starts to walk,

329
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
ladies and gentlemen,

330
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
de de de de de de.

331
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
When a kid starts to walk,

332
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
it's not cool at all.

333
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm thinking,

334
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
it's not cool today either.

335
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You should have said that earlier.

336
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Why didn't you say it now?

337
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Why didn't you say it normally?

338
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Play the music for me.

339
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What is it?

340
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You...

341
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
How many times have you done this?

342
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What is it?

343
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Are you kidding me? Get lost!

344
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's the difference.

345
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'll do that next time.

346
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't want to come out like this next time.

347
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But the hall is different every time,

348
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:22,000
so it's hard to come out from the other side.

349
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Why is it different between right and left?

350
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What is it?

351
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You're not supposed to do that.

352
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You don't have time to think.

353
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Give me some more time.

354
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I can't wait.

355
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'd like to ask Mr. Matsumoto,

356
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
who can make anyone laugh.

357
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Please make the 5-second CM caster laugh

358
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
right after the kid's broadcast.

359
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Who was that?

360
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
The one who comes out right after this.

361
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I don't know who it was.

362
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Mr. Ida?

363
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Ida?

364
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Ida Yumi.

365
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
If that person is watching this broadcast,

366
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and it's going to be broadcast as it is,

367
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
you can make him laugh.

368
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You can't make someone who's not watching laugh.

369
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That's true.

370
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's true.

371
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So if that person says that he's watching this kid,

372
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and he says,

373
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm watching this kid,

374
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and it starts,

375
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I see.

376
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Then you can do something next time.

377
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You can say,

378
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
this guy's tank lorry did this and that.

379
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
If that person says,

380
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm watching this kid,

381
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
you can make him laugh right after the next episode.

382
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But I don't think you can say that.

383
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Even if you're watching.

384
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
There are things you have to say.

385
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Like what happened to the tank lorry.

386
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
If you don't say that,

387
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
you can send a sign while commenting.

388
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
The tank lorry exploded.

389
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
That might be harder than saying it.

390
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That's fine.

391
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The tank lorry exploded.

392
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
If you read the news,

393
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
you lose your persuasion.

394
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
If you say it at the end,

395
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
you say,

396
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
No, it's the same.

397
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's the same.

398
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's the same.

399
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's the same.

400
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Then it's the tank lorry.

401
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
No, it's not.

402
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You don't have persuasion.

403
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
If I can say that it's the same,

404
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'll start filming next week.

405
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'll ask you to stand in line.

406
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
When I'm calling you,

407
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll stand in line.

408
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
When it starts,

409
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll stand diagonally.

410
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That's different.

411
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's not persuasive.

412
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Why is that?

413
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You have to look at the camera seriously.

414
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Of course it's persuasive.

415
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What about Mr. Kin?

416
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Mr. Kin is also persuasive like this.

417
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I want you to suck my nose.

418
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The tank lorry.

419
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I want you to suck my nose.

420
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
That's not good.

421
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
If you don't suck my nose,

422
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I don't know what to do.

423
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Then I'll stand diagonally.

424
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I don't know if it's like this.

425
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I think you know that.

426
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'll do it a little wider.

427
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
If it's like this,

428
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'll look at you.

429
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'll never say that.

430
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm sorry.

431
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'll start laughing next week.

432
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I want you to suck my nose a little.

433
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
This program was provided by the sponsor.

434
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I can do this anywhere, right?

435
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That's right.

436
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I can do this anywhere.

437
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I'll use it when I go camping.

438
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Mr. Toyoda.

439
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Mr. Toyoda.

440
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Mr. Toyoda.

441
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Mr. Toyoda.

442
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Really?

443
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I can do this anywhere.

444
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
That's great.

445
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Thank you.

446
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
This is Mr. Matsumoto.

447
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
This car is Toyota.

448
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I bought it at Toyota.

449
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Thank you.

450
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
This is a Windham.

451
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
That's a good car.

452
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It's a different sense of security.

453
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I want you to suck my nose, too.

454
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You're the only one who can do this.

455
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I came here a week ago.

456
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
That's great.

457
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
That's great.

458
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I can do this anywhere.

459
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That's great.

460
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That's great.
