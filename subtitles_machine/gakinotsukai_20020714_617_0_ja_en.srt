1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's hard to get out. This is a new one. It's hard to get out, isn't it?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This usually comes out while it's on, right? That's right. I don't know when it will come out.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's easier to get out once you've done it. It's easier to get out once you've done it.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's easier to get out once you've done it.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is how it looks.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I will never tell a lie.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I will never tell a lie.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If people think it's true, I don't like it.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What do you want to say?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm going to tell you a story.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I went to a sushi restaurant.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's a place I've never been to.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It was open until 5 in the morning.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It wasn't a good sushi restaurant.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It wasn't open.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I happened to go in.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There were five men.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There was a counter and a seat over here.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There were only men sitting on the counter.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
They were wearing thick tank tops.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
They were wearing thick tank tops.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Everyone was wearing tank tops.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
They were wearing thick tank tops.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It was strange.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What was it?

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It was like a hard gay.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It was like a hard gay.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It was strange.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
They were clinging on to each other.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
They were like a couple.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
They were like a couple.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I thought it was because it was a sushi restaurant.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They were all wearing tank tops.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I thought it was crazy.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But that's okay.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You can't put your hands out.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I didn't put my hands out.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I was surprised.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I thought I should eat quickly and leave.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There was a customer who asked me to hold it.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I used a lot of electricity.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I used a lot of electricity.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I didn't like it.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I really didn't like it.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I really didn't like it.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I arrived at the counter.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I arrived at the counter.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I said hello.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I suddenly felt the skinhead's neck.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I was surprised.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
There was a customer who was in the 14th grade.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It was a hard gay.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I thought it wasn't Japanese.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I thought it was a poor guy.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I asked him where he was from.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He said he was from China.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I asked him what his name was.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He said his name was Kyo.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He said he was Kyo.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I told him to do his best.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He said he was Kyo.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I told him to do his best.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I told him to do his best.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I told him to do his best.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He kept looking at me.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I was surprised.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I didn't think it was strange.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I didn't think it was strange.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I thought it was Machan.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I thought it was Machan.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm interested in the new half these days.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What are you talking about?

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What are you talking about?

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I was surprised.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I didn't think it was strange.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He was a junior.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He was the younger brother of the Chihara brothers.

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He couldn't get better.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He had an accident.

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I see.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He had a trauma.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He couldn't get better.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He remembered it.

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He didn't make a sound.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He said, I'm fine.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He said, I'm fine.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He said, I'm fine.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I was riding next to him.

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I was riding next to him.

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I had a problem with my phone.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He was angry with Yamashita.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He was angry with Yamashita.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He was angry with Yamashita.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He was like a guardrail.

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He was like a guardrail.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I was like, it's not that bad, it's not that bad!

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I was like, I'll put it forward.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I realized later that I was a little bit on the guardrail.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I put it forward and it went like,

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!

103
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And all the bumpers came off.

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
AAAAAAAA!

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I couldn't help myself.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
When I said BAM! BAM! BAM!

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You should have said AAAAAAAA!

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And then I went down and saw it again.

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
AAAAAAAA!

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I was like, it's okay, it's okay!

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It wasn't completely off.

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was like, who did this?

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
BAM!

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And then it went in.

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It went in, so it was okay.

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I said, don't worry, Junior.

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And then an old lady came up to me.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
She said, these parts are falling off.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
AAAAAAAA!

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Who did that?

122
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Junior.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
AAAAAAAA!

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
With those parts.

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Come on.

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Come on.

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You were doing something.

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's weird.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I was saying AAAAAAAA one by one.

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Then it's you.

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I know what kind of AAAAAAAA is.

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You were just saying AAAAAAAA.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I was surprised at the old lady's AAAAAAAA.

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I was surprised at the old lady's AAAAAAAA.

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I was saying, these parts are falling off.

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
AAAAAAAA!

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
She said that.

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's not true.

139
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's true.

140
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's true.

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's scary, isn't it?

142
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Even when I was walking on the street,

143
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I was saying AAAAAAAA.

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Why?

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I was saying, I can't think of a painful angle.

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't know much about it.

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't know about that.

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't know about that painful angle.

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I don't know how many times.

150
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I see.

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's how it is.

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Really.

153
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I want to poop.

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I want to poop.

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is different.

156
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who eats seven eel pies a day.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yes.

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
How erotic is the Ero Gappa?

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, eroticism doesn't exist.

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It doesn't exist.

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
There's no such thing as an erotic dog.

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's just a nickname given to the Kappa.

163
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's right.

164
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's the Ero Gappa.

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The entire Kappa is extremely erotic.

166
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Is that so?

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes.

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
There's a person called Kappa Kishitsu, isn't there?

169
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Who is it?

170
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's you.

171
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What?

172
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You're the king of the Tsumoneda Kingdom, aren't you?

173
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What are you talking about?

174
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Why are you laughing?

175
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You like the Tsumoneda Kingdom, don't you?

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No, I don't like it.

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There are a lot of people who misunderstand this, so I really want to say it.

179
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The image of the Tsumoneda Kingdom is a little strong.

180
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But this is a big mistake.

181
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What?

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
A big mistake?

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's a big mistake.

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't like the Tsumoneda Kingdom at all.

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's not just me.

186
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
All men like the Tsumoneda Kingdom.

187
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This is a serious injury.

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What do you mean?

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What do you mean by a serious injury?

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Everyone around you is talking about the Tsumoneda Kingdom with care.

191
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why?

192
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Because they like you.

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Because you're so excited about the Tsumoneda Kingdom.

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So I told you that you should talk about the Tsumoneda Kingdom today.

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I told you three things today.

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm tired.

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm not happy if I don't say it.

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Are you so excited about the Tsumoneda Kingdom?

199
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I really like the Tsumoneda Kingdom.

200
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's why the blood of the kappa is flowing.

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's what I mean.

202
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Even a normal kappa is erotic.

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
How far has the erotic kappa gone?

204
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's amazing.

205
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The erotic kappa.

206
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What's amazing?

207
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What?

208
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What's amazing?

209
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Anyway, I'll say anything.

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What's wrong with him?

211
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You're really...

212
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
How far has the erotic kappa gone?

213
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm going to put coins in the vending machine.

214
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm worried about the erotic kappa when it comes out on the ground.

215
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Now?

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm going to put it in the card in the parking lot.

217
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's difficult.

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Like this.

219
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I can't get used to it.

220
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I can't get used to it.

221
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I can't get used to it.

222
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I can get used to it if I put it in at the beginning.

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I can't get used to it.

224
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The erotic kappa.

225
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's the worst.

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's the worst.

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
There's no kappa anymore.

228
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
There used to be.

229
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The kappa was able to have sex.

230
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There's a kappa's age.

231
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I think you're a fourth generation kappa.

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I think you're a quarter.

233
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Really?

234
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's why it's erotic.

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

236
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What's so amazing about it?

237
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's amazing.

238
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What's so amazing about it?

239
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
No matter what you look at it, you're trying to make it feel like you're biting or biting a mask, aren't you?

240
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's funny.

241
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The way it is now.

242
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
When you become nude, the angel's wings tend to show.

243
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san.

244
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Seriously?

245
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Please tell me how to distinguish devil, demon and satan.

246
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'd like to know that too.

247
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Right?

248
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yes.

249
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
There are many ways to distinguish them.

250
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If you tell me the difference, I'll know how to distinguish them.

251
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The easiest way to distinguish them is...

252
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's written here on the jacket.

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What kind of jacket is that?

254
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What kind of jacket is that?

255
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's a jacket.

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's not a jacket.

257
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Are you wearing a jacket?

258
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're wearing a jacket, aren't you?

259
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm not wearing a jacket.

260
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Why is that?

261
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Why is that?

262
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Then what kind of jacket are you wearing?

263
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What kind of devil, satan are you wearing?

264
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm wearing tights.

265
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What?

266
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Am I wrong?

267
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm wearing tights all over my body.

268
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's really stupid.

269
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's the devil, satan and demon in your imagination.

270
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Really?

271
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's really stupid.

272
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I usually wear tights like a salaryman.

273
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Really?

274
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's right.

275
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And here's the devil.

276
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't get it.

277
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
There are too many devils.

278
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What do you mean?

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm pretending to be a fake.

280
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I see.

281
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I see.

282
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's right.

283
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But it's hard to distinguish.

284
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You can't do that.

285
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's right.

286
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Especially if the other person is a devil.

287
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's right.

288
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That's why you're telling me to make it easy to distinguish.

289
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yes, yes, yes.

290
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's right.

291
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Right?

292
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes.

293
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The devil is...

294
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
For example, let's say it's a war.

295
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's not good if it breaks during the war.

296
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Everyone, please make it easy to distinguish.

297
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Listen.

298
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
For example, even during a war, the devil goes like this.

299
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But satan goes like this.

300
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's because it's impossible.

301
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's why it goes like this.

302
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Please make it easy to distinguish by appearance.

303
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
By appearance?

304
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's right.

305
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Well...

306
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Usually, when you wear tights, you wear something like this.

307
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Right?

308
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What's wrong with you?

309
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
When you wear tights, you wear something like this.

310
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's why you can distinguish.

311
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You...

312
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You're mistaken for Musimakin.

313
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
If you say something like that,

314
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
is it true that it's Musimakin?

315
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, that's right.

316
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Usually...

317
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What are you saying?

318
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Your imagination and my imagination are different.

319
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's Musiba's thing.

320
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's something to scare children.

321
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But it's easy to understand.

322
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's like a traditional costume.

323
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Is that so?

324
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's why Japanese people don't wear Japanese costumes now.

325
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's right.

326
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
They wear it naturally.

327
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's right.

328
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's not like that now.

329
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's a business suit.

330
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's right.

331
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's why it's hard to distinguish.

332
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Please tell me that.

333
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Well...

334
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Usually satan is ***.

335
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But that's also a problem.

336
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's difficult.

337
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Why ***?

338
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I don't like that.

339
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I want to have a number.

340
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I see.

341
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You don't want to wear a good costume.

342
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You don't know what to wear.

343
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's right.

344
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't like ***.

345
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But I want to have two costumes.

346
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's my way of thinking.

347
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't like this.

348
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's difficult.

349
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's difficult.

350
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
This is difficult.

351
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But...

352
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You can see it if you put three people together.

353
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's like rock-paper-scissors.

354
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What do you mean?

355
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Satan is like a demon.

356
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Satan is like, you know...

357
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The demon is like...

358
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Stop it.

359
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But the demon is like a devil.

360
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Satan is like, you know...

361
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But the demon is...

362
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't understand the picture.

363
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I heard that the lyrics of the song are up to the 10th.

364
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Please tell me the lyrics of the 7th song.

365
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Do you know the 1st and the 2nd?

366
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Everyone knows the 1st.

367
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But I don't know the 2nd.

368
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't understand it at all.

369
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Where are your eyeballs?

370
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Put out your horns.

371
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Put out your eyeballs.

372
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Put out your horns.

373
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Put out your head.

374
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The 2nd is...

375
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I don't know the 2nd.

376
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You don't know the 2nd?

377
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
If you listen to it, you might think, oh, really?

378
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh, really?

379
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Please tell me the 2nd.

380
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,000
In the end, it's a song about solving the mystery of the snail.

381
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Where are your eyeballs?

382
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The 2nd is...

383
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Your...

384
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Don't think about it.

385
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Where are your hands?

386
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Seriously, where are your hands?

387
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
There are a lot of songs that are up to the 10th.

388
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There are a lot of songs that are up to the 10th.

389
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I see.

390
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What is the 7th song?

391
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The 7th is...

392
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't know the 8th and the 6th.

393
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm sorry about that.

394
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The 7th is...

395
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Where are the mansions?

396
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The body part is already over.

397
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's already over.

398
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's already over.

399
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I see.

400
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Where do you live?

401
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Where is it?

402
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
In the previous episode, you said you were the chief.

403
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You said you were going to change.

404
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I was like, have you changed?

405
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh, really?

406
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You said you were going to come to my side.

407
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I see.

408
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Are you calling me?

409
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm calling you.

410
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What?

411
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I see.

412
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's not just the 7th.

413
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What about the 10th?

414
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That's right.

415
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Right?

416
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's right.

417
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Even if you listen to the 7th...

418
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yes, yes, yes.

419
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
There are songs up to the 10th.

420
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's right.

421
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What about the 10th?

422
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What?

423
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What is the 10th?

424
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Let's go with the 10th.

425
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Let's go with the 10th.

426
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Are you going to tell me?

427
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll tell you.

428
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'll tell you.

429
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's the easiest to understand.

430
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's right.

431
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Right?

432
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's right.

433
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Then tell me.

434
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Where are your eyeballs?

435
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
First of all, the first one.

436
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Put your head out.

437
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Which one?

438
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The head.

439
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Where are your hands?

440
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
My hands?

441
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That's fine.

442
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's the 3rd.

443
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The 3rd is a little different.

444
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's not different anymore!

445
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's a little different.

446
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's a little different.

447
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I wanted to change it around here.

448
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I see.

449
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The 3rd.

450
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What time will you come?

451
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's not yours.

452
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's not yours anymore.

453
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
That's fine.

454
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What?

455
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What time will you come?

456
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What time will you come?

457
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Put your horns out.

458
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Put your head out.

459
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That's fine.

460
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The 4th.

461
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The 4th?

462
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This will surprise you.

463
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The 4th will surprise you?

464
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes.

465
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The 4th.

466
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The 4th.

467
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The 4th.

468
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Where are your eyeballs?

469
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'll ask you again.

470
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Why?

471
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'll ask you again.

472
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I haven't asked you yet.

473
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Why haven't you asked me?

474
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's really disgusting.

475
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Ask me yourself.

476
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Right?

477
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Ask me.

478
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I was surprised.

479
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I was surprised too.

480
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
When I saw the 4th, I was like, what? Again?

481
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Think about it.

482
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What?

483
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Think about it.

484
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The 5th will change again.

485
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
From here again.

486
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes.

487
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Until you go to the apartment.

488
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You're lying, right?

489
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yes.

490
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The 7th apartment.

491
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The 7th apartment.

492
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The 7th.

493
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The 5th and 6th.

494
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The 5th and 6th.

495
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yes.

496
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The 5th.

497
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Tell me about the 5th.

498
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
This is bad.

499
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What's bad?

500
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Don't come back.

501
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You're so stubborn.

502
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Where are your eyeballs?

503
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What are you trying to do?

504
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Are you Mitsui Mitsubishi Sakura?

505
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You're completely...

506
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You're trying to do something.

507
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You're trying to do something, right?

508
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The 6th.

509
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What?

510
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The 6th.

511
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
When I heard that, I was like, ah!

512
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I thought I was done for.

513
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yes.

514
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Are you drunk?

515
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I was surprised.

516
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You're completely drunk.

517
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Your...

518
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Your...

519
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Where are they?

520
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's all over the place.

521
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Really?

522
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
When I heard that, I was like, where are your eyeballs?

523
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You're going.

524
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You're going.

525
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
This is terrible.

526
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
This is terrible.

527
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This is terrible.

528
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
This is terrible.

529
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm scared.

530
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You can't put it on.

531
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The elementary school...

532
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Where are your eyeballs?

533
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Mama! Mama!

534
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The education committee is asking for your horns.

535
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You're so stubborn.

536
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
They're asking for your horns.

537
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Where is the 7th apartment?

538
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Where is the 7th apartment?

539
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
8, 9, 10. The last three.

540
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's right.

541
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'll make it look good.

542
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Really?

543
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'll make it look good.

544
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Your...

545
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Where is your love?

546
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What is this?

547
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What is this?

548
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's like a heart.

549
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You're asking for the course, the school, the apartment, and love?

550
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Where is your love?

551
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Where is it now?

552
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I see.

553
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I see.

554
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I see.

555
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I see.

556
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I see.

557
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I see.

558
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I see.

559
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
