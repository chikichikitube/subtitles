1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I like Honjyamaka more than this! Switch on!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, Chikishiki! Downtown Hoteishiki! What are you doing?

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is a strange feeling.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is the first time that young people other than us are sitting on the stage of Gaki.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Today, we are going to do a survey.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's see what it is.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I want to explain a little.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's a little confusing to explain.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well, everyone.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
There is a formula like this here.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is for famous entertainers.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, there are people who are not so famous.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You can paste it here.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
For example, the first problem is a multiple.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's 02.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You have to be careful.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If it's a multiple...

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll do it.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Make it easy to understand.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Make it easy to understand.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
From now on, let's see.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
For example.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A very famous entertainer.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
My favorite, Mutsugoro.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And the person I admire, Izumi Pinko.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The person you admire is the same sex, isn't it?

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
For example.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I want to be hugged.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You want to be hugged by Mutsugoro?

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Izumi Pinko?

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I want to be bullied.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll write it like this.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now it's your turn.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Are you ready?

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
First of all.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The person who wants to be hugged by Mutsugoro.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The person who wants to be hugged.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Switch on.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I won't show this number.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No, no, no.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This number is different.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll collect it from behind.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I won't show it.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The person who wants to be bullied by Izumi Pinko.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
These two numbers should be zero.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's why I wrote this.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Is this zero?

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's zero.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You can't do this.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Well, well, well.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The person who wants to be bullied.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The person who wants to be bullied.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If you get bullied, you'll be in trouble.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Right?

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
If you get bullied, you'll be in trouble.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What are you talking about?

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Wait a minute.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Now, let's look at the answers of the two numbers.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's look at the answers.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Ready, go.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What?

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What are you thinking?

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That means.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Which one is it?

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Do you want to be hugged by Mutsugoro?

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's go to the right place.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's go to the right place.

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's go to this one.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Good.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Right?

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let's go to this one.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
My name is Masatoshi.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let's go to this one.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I see.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This is easy.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Do you want to be hugged by Masatoshi Nagamura?

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Do you want to be hugged by Watabe?

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I see.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I want to be hugged.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I want to be hugged.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I want to be hugged.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No, there are quite a few.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There are fifty of them.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is Iyayaki.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't want to be hugged.

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What?

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Wait a minute.

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If it's something like that, it's a great number.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You said it, so I wrote it down.

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What are you talking about?

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't want to be hugged by Masatoshi Nagamura.

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If it's something like that, I can understand.

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't want to be hugged.

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If it's something like that, I can understand.

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Watabe is a bad person.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's not true.

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's just how he looks.

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Everyone thinks he's a bad person.

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So, I don't want to be hugged.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I want to be hugged.

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Isn't that right?

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's right.

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's right.

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's right.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Now, let's look at the total.

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's see the total.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Twenty-seven.

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I can't hold this side.

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Ah, it's dirty.

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
As expected, he brought me here.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm more shakure than Makisei Rio.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Kiku.

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm more shakure than Inoki.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Now, let's look at the answer.

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Tenshin.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Minus eight.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Minus eight.

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What does that mean?

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
There are many people who are not as shakure as Inoki.

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's too much.

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's right.

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No matter how you think about it, that's right.

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He's not shakure.

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is difficult.

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I need my head.

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Now, let's take a look at this.

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This is difficult.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,800
This one is quite big.

130
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,400
That's right.

131
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,200
In that sense, it's this one, isn't it?

132
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,800
It's getting more and more interesting.

133
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
It's getting more and more Matsumoto.

134
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,500
What does this mean?

135
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,300
It's a simple story.

136
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:30,300
I want to be hugged.

137
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,300
You want to be hugged, too?

138
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,800
That's right.

139
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,300
Because it's me, it's three times as much.

140
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,600
I'm very interested.

141
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,500
The closer I get to the answer, the more frustrated I get.

142
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Let's just take a look at the picture.

143
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Let's take a look at the picture.

144
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,300
0.6

145
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,600
What does 0.6 mean?

146
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,100
Does that mean there's a lot of Matsumoto?

147
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,100
That's good.

148
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:13,700
Ladies and gentlemen.

149
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,000
It's not an old-fashioned story, but it's very interesting.

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,900
Don't apologize to the guest today.

151
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,500
Why?

152
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,500
The guest today is really tired, but he's still up today.

153
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,100
Really?

154
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,700
Yes.

155
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,700
It's a new guest.

156
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,500
It's not a new guest.

157
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
It's finally a postcard.

158
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,600
If you're glad you got it, you're not going to get it.

159
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,700
Come back.

160
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,900
And the next week, come back.

161
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,900
I don't know that.

162
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,500
I feel sorry for you.

163
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,300
I don't feel sorry for you.

164
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:52,900
Why don't you make a cream bread?

165
00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:02,100
Why don't you make a cream bread?

166
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,500
You're really...

167
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,000
You seem to be making a lot of money.

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,200
There's only a few words that are different from you.

169
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,700
Down town, the two of you together, down town, please take care of me.

170
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,900
Don't be so cocky.

171
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,700
I've been talking a lot since I came out.

172
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,700
Now, please take care of me.

173
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,100
Please take care of me.

174
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,300
I've come to this program.

175
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,700
There's only a difference of 220,000 yen.

176
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,400
Where do you put that difference of 220,000 yen?

177
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,000
Cream bread.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,300
I don't like cream bread with this much money.

179
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,300
I don't like cream bread with this much money.

180
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,400
I don't like it.

181
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,100
Why not?

182
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
Because the two of you are here.

183
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,300
It's really bad to make a difference in money.

184
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,100
It's really bad to make a difference of 220,000 yen.

185
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,500
No, no, that's you.

186
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,300
And then, I'm sorry, Matsumoto.

187
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,000
Put 110,000 yen in the envelope.

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,100
I'm really sorry.

189
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,300
Why are you sorry?

190
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,300
Don't say that.

191
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,100
That's not true.

192
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,300
Then, you should calculate the difference.

193
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,900
You're right.

194
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,600
Taxes are not good for you.

195
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,700
Because you have a family who doesn't need it.

196
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,700
But still, the two of us are in the office.

197
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,300
We're making it equal.

198
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,700
The money that goes into the office.

199
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,600
You usually write down your expectations in magazines.

200
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,800
Your expectations from taxes.

201
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,900
Your income.

202
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,500
In my case, I'm told a lot more than my expectations.

203
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,900
In his case, he earns more.

204
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,400
Wait a minute.

205
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:57,100
You're saying that the same amount of money is coming in, aren't you?

206
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,700
You're saying that you're making it equal, aren't you?

207
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,900
Don't take it off.

208
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,700
Don't take it off.

209
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:20,100
It's only natural for me to spend 100,000 or 200,000 yen a year.

210
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,900
I'm amazing.

211
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,400
I'm different.

212
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I'm all-rounder.

213
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,600
I know that.

214
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,700
I'm all-rounder.

215
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,400
I know that expression.

216
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,100
I'm amazing.

217
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,900
I only eat avocados.

218
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,900
You only eat avocados?

219
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,900
You only eat avocados?

220
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,900
That's true for me.

221
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,900
I eat watermelon in the winter.

222
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,700
I have money.

223
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,500
You can pull it out.

224
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
I can pull it out.

225
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,700
I want to eat watermelon.

226
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,000
What are you talking about?

227
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,100
I have money.

228
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:13,300
My house is like a Persian carpet.

229
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,100
I saw it on TV.

230
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,700
I thought I'd seen it once.

231
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,100
I was wondering if I'd be so moved by it.

232
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,700
It was a happy yellow handkerchief.

233
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,800
Oh, you were doing it.

234
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Why would I be moved by it?

235
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,600
The guy who plays the role of Sakakura Ken is a bad guy.

236
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,400
Is that so?

237
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,000
He's a bad guy.

238
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,700
He's full of arrogance.

239
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,700
Is that so?

240
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,700
That guy is called Takeda Tetsuya.

241
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,900
He met Momoi Kaori.

242
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,300
They went on a drive.

243
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,100
They bought a new family car and went on a drive to Hokkaido.

244
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,500
That's why I was wondering if I'd be so moved by it.

245
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,300
That's why I was wondering if I'd be so moved by it.

246
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,500
I asked him to push the shutter.

247
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,700
That's how I met him.

248
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,000
I asked him if he wanted to get in the car.

249
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,600
It was like a greeting.

250
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,100
It was like a greeting.

251
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
I asked him if he wanted to get in the car.

252
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,100
He said, sure.

253
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,700
He's a bad guy.

254
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,300
He got in the car.

255
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,800
Takeda Tetsuya was polite to Sakakura Ken.

256
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,100
He got in the car and stayed at the ryokan that night.

257
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,500
Takeda Tetsuya approached Momoi Kaori.

258
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,700
Momoi Kaori didn't like it.

259
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
He started to cry.

260
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,100
He was in the car all day long.

261
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,300
He was in the car all day long.

262
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,900
He started to cry.

263
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,500
He was in the car all day long.

264
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,100
He was in the car all day long.

265
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,900
Momoi Kaori was in the car all day long.

266
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,900
He was in the car all day long.

267
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,900
He got in the car.

268
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,300
He got in the car.

269
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,300
The next day, I thought he was going to take the train, but he was right behind me again.

270
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,300
That's not good.

271
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,300
He's a bad guy.

272
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
I don't know about that.

273
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,300
Is that so?

274
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,300
That's right.

275
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,300
I sent him to the station.

276
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,300
I sent him to the station.

277
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,300
It took about 2 hours for the train to come.

278
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,300
And a crab came here.

279
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,300
A crab came here.

280
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,300
And he came back.

281
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
He came back like a crab.

282
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
That's because of Momoi Kaori.

283
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,300
When I woke up, I saw Takakura Gen with a crab.

284
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,300
Momoi Kaori and Takenashi were having a good time.

285
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,300
They were having a good time until the morning.

286
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,300
I thought, can't I get in the car anymore?

287
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,300
That's not how you say it.

288
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,300
I'm telling you, they were having a good time until the morning.

289
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
I'm telling you, they were having a good time until the morning.

290
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
I saw it. I know that.

291
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,300
In the end, he stopped the train and got on the train again.

292
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,300
Can I tell you something?

293
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
Can I tell you something?

294
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,300
I want to see if my wife is wearing a red handkerchief.

295
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,300
Red?

296
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,300
You don't look like her.

297
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,300
I want to see if she has a yellow handkerchief.

298
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,300
I want to see if she has a yellow handkerchief.

299
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,300
Don't just say that.

300
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,300
If you do that, Momoi Kaori is a good person.

301
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,300
Let's go.

302
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
Hey, Yu-san.

303
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
Listen.

304
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,300
Listen to what?

305
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,300
I'm going to the house in the car.

306
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,300
On the way, stop the train.

307
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,300
That's not how you say it.

308
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,300
Stop the train.

309
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,300
Everyone is scared.

310
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,300
That's not true. You should see it.

311
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,300
You'll be relieved.

312
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,300
I'm talking to you, but you don't listen to me.

313
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,300
What?

314
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,300
I called her, but she didn't answer.

315
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,300
I saw a yellow handkerchief.

316
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,300
I saw it.

317
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,300
Then,

318
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,300
I went up to her and told her to drink tea.

319
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,300
I left her alone.

320
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
Then,

321
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,300
I didn't even thank her.

322
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,300
I didn't even thank her.

323
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,300
I didn't do anything.

324
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,300
That's not true.

325
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
I asked her why she was in prison.

326
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,300
She said she was drunk.

327
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,300
She grabbed a drunk man's head and hit him with a rock.

328
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
She killed him.

329
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
Then she went to prison.

330
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,300
She regrets killing him.

331
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,300
When she was on the train,

332
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,300
Tako Hachiro appeared.

333
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
Tako Hachiro hit him.

334
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,300
Tako Hachiro grabbed his head and hit him.

335
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,300
He didn't regret it.

336
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
He hit him with the same handkerchief.

337
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,300
There are a lot of people talking about Yutaka Ozaki.

338
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,300
I think he and Hitachi Matsumoto are a couple.

339
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
Who is Hitachi?

340
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,300
Is his name different from yours?

341
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,300
He seems to be sharp and naive.

342
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,300
He seems to be ready for a joke.

343
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,300
If Ozaki is a teenager,

344
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,300
Hitachi Matsumoto is a bad hero.

345
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,300
He is skinnier than he was in Osaka.

346
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Hitachi Matsumoto will disappear soon.

347
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:32,300
I don't feel alive just because I think I can't hear his jokes.

348
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,300
Did you do a thorough examination?

349
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,300
No, I didn't.

350
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Then...

351
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,300
I don't want to die of illness.

352
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,300
I don't want to die of illness.

353
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,300
I want to die at the age of 40.

354
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,300
You want to die at the age of 40?

355
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,300
Yes, I want to die at the age of 40.

356
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,300
On the other hand, I did everything I wanted to do.

357
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,300
Really?

358
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,300
You did it quickly.

359
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,300
I wrote a song that remains in everyone's heart.

360
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Where is it?

361
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,300
I wrote it for everyone.

362
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,300
Who wrote it?

363
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
I wrote it.

364
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,300
What did you write?

365
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,300
I...

366
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:22,300
You had a bass on Japanese TV.

367
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,300
I wrote a song.

368
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
It's not a song.

369
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:34,300
It's not bad for everyone to burn out in their 40 years of life.

370
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,300
You're still burning out.

371
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,300
I did everything.

372
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,300
I played guitar in America.

373
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,300
I was really into Mick Jagger and Rolling Stone.

374
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,300
I was really into Mick Jagger and Rolling Stone.

375
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,300
That's the only name I know.

376
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,300
Are you a fool? Tell me.

377
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,300
I don't know.

378
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,300
Tell me the members of Rolling Stone.

379
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,300
I don't know.

380
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Don't be so cool.

381
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,300
Tell me.

382
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,300
It's Mick Jagger.

383
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,300
I'm a vocalist. Do you know?

384
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,300
I know.

385
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,300
Why?

386
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
What should I say?

387
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Members.

388
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
The vocalist is Mick Jagger.

389
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Mick Jagger.

390
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
Tell me the other members.

391
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,300
I should say the members other than Mick Jagger?

392
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,300
Yes.

393
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
What do you say to the other members?

394
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,300
I'll study here. Tell me.

395
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,300
I'll say the names of the other members other than Mick Jagger.

396
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,300
You should say.

397
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,300
You should check. If you're wrong, you're wrong.

398
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Yes.

399
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
That's fine.

400
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,300
That's fine.

401
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,300
There's no mistake.

402
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,300
There's no mistake.

403
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,300
I'll wipe my ass.

404
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:54,300
I don't listen to Rolling Stone.

405
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,300
Wait.

406
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,300
The first album is like this.

407
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
What's the title?

408
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Well.

409
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Nice to meet you.

410
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:10,300
Rolling Stone.

411
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,300
Nice to meet you.

412
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,300
Rolling Stone.

413
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,300
Yes.

414
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,300
I don't listen to it.

415
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
I love Hama-chan.

416
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,300
I want to ask you this.

417
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,300
What?

418
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,300
I want to ask you this.

419
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
What?

420
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:34,300
What's that string on the corner of the bed?

421
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,300
I want to ask you this.

422
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Well.

423
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,300
How can I explain it?

424
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,300
If there's no string.

425
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
The string is the string, isn't it?

426
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,300
The string is the string.

427
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,300
The string is the string.

428
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
The string is the string, isn't it?

429
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,300
It's not the string.

430
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,300
You said the string.

431
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,300
It's not the string.

432
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
If it's not the string, what is it?

433
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
What are you going out for?

434
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,300
Why do I have to get out of here?

435
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:12,300
That's to eat you.

436
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,300
You can't laugh like that.

437
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,300
I don't want you to think that I can't get out of here.

438
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,300
Then, please say it.

439
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,300
Everyone is waiting.

440
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,300
Are you waiting?

441
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,300
Are you waiting?

442
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,300
What?

443
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,300
Are you waiting?

444
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,300
You can change the way you say it.

445
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,300
I'm waiting.

446
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
I'm waiting.

447
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,300
What?

448
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Are you waiting?

449
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,300
I'm not a fool.

450
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
To be honest,

451
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,300
the reason why it's hard for me to answer.

452
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,300
It's because the question itself is wrong.

453
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,300
No, it's not wrong.

454
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,300
You said you thought it was the string that came out of here, didn't you?

455
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
It's not the string, is it?

456
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,300
It's not.

457
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,300
Then, what is it?

458
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,300
It's Zabuton.

459
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,300
What?

460
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,300
Do you know Zabuton?

461
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,300
It's Zabuton.

462
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,300
This is...

463
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,300
This is Zabuton.

464
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,300
You're making me scared.

465
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,300
I'm scared.

466
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,300
That's what it is.

467
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,300
That's why I was wondering what you were talking about.

468
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,300
You!

469
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,300
There's one thing I want you to know.

470
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,300
It's about the long necktie of the referee in the ring.

471
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,300
What are you wearing it for?

472
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,300
It's not for that.

473
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,300
I have to turn it over.

474
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:52,300
That's...

475
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:58,300
Why?

476
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
You know what?

477
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,300
You two are excited, right?

478
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
At that time, you don't have to break it.

479
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
Yes, yes, yes.

480
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:32,300
It's called the long necktie.
