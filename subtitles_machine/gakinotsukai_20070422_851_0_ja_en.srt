1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Karashi, try sucking it up.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Last week, the final audition for the new regular member of Gaki no Tsukai was held.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's the worst.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The participants of this audition, who will be playing the role of the main character in the final showdown, are...

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Black Mayonnaise

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Tutorial

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And Kirin

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A mirror, a mirror

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Finally, the new regular member of the Gaki no Tsukai will be announced

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The results of the evaluation will be announced

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Who will be the one to hold this crown?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Furthermore, after the audition, the unbelievable nightmare that attacked the young comedians

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is the first round.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is the first round.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is the first round.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So, the one who is good at Kotsugi and is good at Okama, do the mouth-to-mouth fight.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Here you go.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What is your store?

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What?

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What is it?

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It has nothing to do with you.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's a customer's question.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Ah, I see.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He's really angry.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't think it's a matter of time.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Isn't there a problem with your store?

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The story is pretty...

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm not joking!

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's not funny to see Okamoto's face!

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I have it!

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Shiro has it too!

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Shiro has it too!

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What?

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's not Okamoto's style to show his face in a comedy movie!

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't show your nose!

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okamoto, you can't do that!

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's not good!

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's not good.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He said that's not good.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You want to do it, right?

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Wait for the tenant!

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
From this building!

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If you say tenant's condition, the condition is the same for Tanaka!

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll do the long lines.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll do the long lines like he always does.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's good.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, Sobu-kun, please do the funny sound effects when you take the tissue.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's do it quickly.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Say the sound effects with your mouth.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Pa! Pa!

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's go on.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's go on with the Pa.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Shubi! Shubi!

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ten-taka-ten-tun!

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Tontoko-tontun!

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Tontoko-tontun!

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Tontoko-tontun!

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Tontoko-tontun!

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I see.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Sasuke!

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sasuke!

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm ready.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What do you think?

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You changed it!

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I did.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You changed it, didn't you?

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You changed it completely.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I did.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why did you do it three times?

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Which one?

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
There were many choices, but you changed it.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Which one?

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Live!

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
L-L-L-Live!

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes, you can say live.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Which one?

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Which one?

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's it, right?

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, in the end?

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Live!

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Which one?

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Live.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Live, right?

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Live is fine.

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Well, well, it's fine.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Pass!

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Amazing.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Can you sing a song by Tissue?

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I think I can sing.

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why do you look so annoyed?

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't like it.

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You don't raise your back.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll pass. Please do your best.

99
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I want you to sing while dancing.

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's right.

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You can hold it, Tissue.

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I see, I see.

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I see.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Nice, Kosugi.

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I see it while looking at the box.

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Tissue, Tissue, Tissue.

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Except for us,

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
if you put two together,

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and put one together,

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Naruto,

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
your power is completely weak.

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Go, Kakyoin!

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That was wonderful.

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I was just thinking about this, but Endo-san, can you do that?

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Me?

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That thing.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's right.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Kozue-kun, you can do that.

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's right.

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You can do that.

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's cool.

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's cool.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's cool.

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I think it's good.

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I think we can see something good.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You can decide who will do it.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I see.

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I want to see Koshii-kun.

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He has a good potential.

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes.

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's good.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's good.

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's a mess.

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's ok.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's ok to say that it's a hug.

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The way you do it is different.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's very luxurious.

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's like a celestial body.

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's amazing.

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's like a real thing.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
3, 2, 1, go!

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Do you know?

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Hey!

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hey!

145
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Ah!

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Wonderful!

147
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
As expected, it's a regular.

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Wonderful.

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Now, the way...

150
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Someone should do it.

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Then, Mr. Yamaguchi.

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is it okay to do it alone?

153
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's too small!

154
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey! Hey!

155
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hey! Hey!

156
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's perfect.

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's good, right?

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's amazing.

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's like a lecture.

160
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:32,220
The

161
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,220
...

162
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,300
school

163
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,540
remember

164
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,160
this

165
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,160
3, 2, 1, go!

166
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
You're doing it!

167
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Hohohoi! Hohohoi! Hohohoi! Hohohoi!

168
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
Wonderful.

169
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,160
Gouka!

170
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,160
You're really good at this.

171
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
I'm good at it too.

172
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,160
You two are like, what? You don't want to do it?

173
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
What about you, Tokui?

174
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,160
Oh, I'll stop.

175
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,160
Do you want Tokui to do it?

176
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Yes.

177
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
You want him to do it?

178
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Yes, I want him to do it.

179
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Then why do you want him to do it?

180
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
It's like it's just me...

181
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
You mean it?

182
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Only me?

183
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Only you?

184
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
It's just me...

185
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
It's a mess.

186
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,160
A mess?

187
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
What do you mean?

188
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,160
You hate the way you do it?

189
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Let's just say it.

190
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,160
Kousugi, look behind you and say,

191
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,160
Then, let's sit down.

193
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
I'm sorry.

194
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,160
I'm your partner, so I don't know why you're saying that.

195
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,160
But there's that kind of thing.

196
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,160
There's that kind of thing.

197
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,160
It's not on TV.

198
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,160
There's that kind of thing about partners.

199
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,160
I'm sorry.

200
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Kosugi!

201
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
Kosugi!

202
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Kosugi!

203
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,660
3

204
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,660
Yes

205
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
What is this?

206
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
What is this?

207
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
Thank you, Mr.Kosugi

208
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
Good luck

209
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Now, the face tube

210
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,160
I want to see how funny your face can be

211
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Does anyone know?

212
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Does anyone know?

213
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
I don't know

214
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
I'll stand there.

215
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,160
Then, can you do it, Mr. Hamada?

216
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Please.

217
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Please.

218
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,160
Please.

219
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Please.

220
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
What is this?

221
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Well, I think it's difficult to do this.

222
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
That's right.

223
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Mr. Hamada, please.

224
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,160
If this is the basics, then...

225
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,160
Well, it's okay to laugh at anything, but the most interesting thing is...

226
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
Even at this point, it's interesting.

227
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
Oh, that's fine.

228
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Okay, I'm in.

229
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
I'm in.

230
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
I'm in.

231
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
I'm sorry.

232
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
Pass!

233
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Pass!

234
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
Pass!

235
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,160
Thank you.

236
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
I'm sure you'll get a medal someday.

237
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
I'm not sure.

238
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Tabura!

239
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,160
It doesn't matter where you hit.

240
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Are you okay?

241
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
I see.

242
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Here you go.

243
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
The first hit.

244
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,160
You surprised me.

245
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,160
Are you a high-performance machine?

246
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
Kuma!

247
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
You look really annoyed right now.

248
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
You're right.

249
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,160
You're a big fan of Okama.

250
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Look, Hana has a lot of stuff.

251
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
That's good!

252
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
That's good, Futakura!

253
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,160
It's good, right?

254
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
This is good, right?

255
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,160
This is good, right?

256
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
It's good, right?

257
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
It's like it's there.

258
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Yes, yes, yes.

259
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Ah, that was good.

260
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
It was really good.

261
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,160
Now, who's next?

262
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
Kotsugi!

263
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Let's go.

264
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Oh my.

265
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Wow, this is great.

266
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,160
This is great.

267
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
This is great.

268
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
This is amazing.

269
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
It's like Minami Shinsuke.

270
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
This is great.

271
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
This is great.

272
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Let's shake your head a little more.

273
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
Wow!

274
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
Wow, amazing!

275
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
Ah, that's good!

276
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
That's good!

277
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
He's laughing!

278
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,160
After this, the shocking announcement of the pass!

279
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Well then, everyone.

280
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,160
That's all for the audition.

281
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Now, it's time to decide whether you can become regular users of the game.

282
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:06,160
The team that has scored more than 2000 points so far has passed.

283
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
It's a good result.

284
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Let's start.

285
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,420
Let's have a show of the judgment!

286
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:32,420
The national

287
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:20,260
commissioning

288
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:35,280
comments

289
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:35,460
Poison

290
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:35,600
cake

291
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,980
Hello I thank you very much

292
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,180
What do you say?

293
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,900
Yes

294
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,080
What's this?

295
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
No, no, no.

296
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Please, leave.

297
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,080
No, no. I've done a lot of things.

298
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Please stand up.

299
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
You've been saying you passed all this time.

300
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
What was the score?

301
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,080
Who got the most points?

302
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,080
The tutorial was the most important.

303
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,080
60 points.

304
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
That's low.

305
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
It's 2000.

306
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
You can't pass unless it's over 2000.

307
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Not at all.

308
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
Kirin is...

309
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
40, I think.

310
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
40.

311
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
41.

312
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,080
4 o'clock?

313
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,080
How about you?

314
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,080
How many drinks do you have?

315
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,080
I haven't seen much.

316
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
I haven't seen much.

317
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Thank you very much.

318
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,080
Thank you very much.

319
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,080
Please, go back.

320
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,080
From there.

321
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,080
Please drink cold drinks.

322
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,080
I don't think it's a good idea.

323
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
It's not a good idea.

324
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,080
Maybe it's not a young artist.

325
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Oh, really?

326
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
Oh, a regular artist.

327
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
A regular artist.

328
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,080
So, I'll give a chance to the young artist.

329
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,080
That's right.

330
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,080
Unfortunately, the audition for the young artist ended without a winner.

331
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,080
But, their trials were not only this.

332
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,080
Well, it's not a surprise.

333
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:13,080
I invited three people to drink with me.

334
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,080
I was talking to them.

335
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,080
I thought I would say something bad about Hamada.

336
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,080
You are his junior.

337
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,080
I was leading them.

338
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
But Hamada was avoiding it.

339
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,080
I thought I would ask him to act.

340
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,080
It's interesting.

341
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
It's interesting.

342
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,080
I don't know who will be the next one, but I'll say it's 6 people.

343
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,080
After the recording, there are many things that we think about.

344
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,080
I want to hear it.

345
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,080
Kotsugi was really rejected by Hamada.

346
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,080
I don't know if he has a crush on Ichimosu.

347
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
He has a crush on him.

348
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,080
I don't know what that is.

349
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,080
I don't want to be a partner with him.

350
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,080
He's my partner and my junior.

351
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
That's right.

352
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
That's tough.

353
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,080
Then, take him.

354
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,080
I'll go with Tanaka, and Matsumoto will come later.

355
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,080
There's a reality show.

356
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Then, I'll go.

357
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
Please take care of him.

358
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
We'll go home.

359
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Please take care of him.

360
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,080
I'll go home.

361
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,080
I'll go for a little bit and come back later.

362
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,680
This time, the flow of the Puchi-Dokkiri is

363
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,680
Yamasaki and Tanaka, who are inviting the young man to the bar

364
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,680
Matsumoto, who is late for the meeting, and Endo, who is late for the meeting, are waiting in the next room

365
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,680
The moment the bad mouth comes out, Hamada enters and says it's a dead end

366
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,680
This is the scene

367
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,680
Hamada checks the young man's words in detail in this room

368
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,680
The rest is just waiting for the moment when the young man says bad mouth

369
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,680
This time, the prank is to set up 6 cameras and do it in a year.

370
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,680
Who will be Hamada's target?

371
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,680
Hamada and Endo arrive at the store.

372
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:19,680
After 10 minutes, Yamasaki and Tanaka take the 6 young men to the store.

373
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,680
The cold is coming.

374
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,680
It's coming.

375
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,680
It's cold.

376
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,680
What is this coldness?

377
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,680
What did you do?

378
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,680
What is this?

379
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,680
It's a hair clip.

380
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
It's a hair clip.

381
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,680
I'm sorry.

382
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,680
I'm sorry.

383
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,680
I'm sorry.

384
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
Well then, good work.

385
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
Good work.

386
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,680
Good work.

387
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,680
Oh, is that so?

388
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,680
This is the room for women.

389
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Oh, here?

390
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
This is the room for women.

391
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,680
This is the room for men.

392
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
So, men don't usually enter.

393
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,680
There are a lot of girls here.

394
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,680
Here, Matsumoto arrives late as planned.

395
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,680
For now, he goes to the room where Hamada is getting ready.

396
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
This is amazing.

397
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
I want a cake.

398
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
This is delicious.

399
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,680
This is not delicious.

400
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
I want a cake.

401
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,680
Really?

402
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
Why?

403
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,680
You're popular.

404
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,680
You can't be popular.

405
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,680
I'm a painter.

406
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,680
I can't be popular.

407
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,680
Finally, the prank begins.

408
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Who is going to be the one to be Amata's model?

409
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Hello, Mr. Amata.

410
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,680
But, well, I'm a little bit of a loner.

411
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
Do you want something?

412
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
Yes.

413
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,680
I'll just take a little bit.

414
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,680
If I don't come, you'll laugh at me, right?

415
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,680
No, no.

416
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,680
Of course.

417
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,680
I'm talking about the story of KOSUGI.

418
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,680
KOSUGI is a bad guy.

419
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,680
He's a bad guy?

420
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
He's a bad guy.

421
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,680
He's a bad guy.

422
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,680
That KOSUGI's activity is...

423
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
That KOSUGI is terrible.

424
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,680
He's a terrible guy.

425
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,680
I don't like him.

426
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,680
He's my junior.

427
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,680
You're his junior?

428
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,680
I was the one who was the most upset when I said that.

429
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,680
Because I was quite confused.

430
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,680
I have a time when I don't understand.

431
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,680
Why did you say that?

432
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Why?

433
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,680
Why?

434
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
But that's a bad guy.

435
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
That's...

436
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
No, wait a minute.

437
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
That's bad.

438
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,680
No, that's...

439
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,680
That's a surprise.

440
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
It's a surprise.

441
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
It's a surprise.

442
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,680
There are times when I'm surprised.

443
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,680
Someone's been on the plane for 11 days.

444
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
I'm addicted to it.

445
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Well, you told me today.

446
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,680
I'm addicted to it again.

447
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
I've been doing this for 25 years.

448
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,680
And then, he started to throw the bucket.

449
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
It was the opposite.

450
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,680
There was a place like a natural place.

451
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,680
That rubber was amazing.

452
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,680
It was a face-kissing rubber.

453
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
The rubber of Hamasawa.

454
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
It was good.

455
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
It was good.

456
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
It was good.

457
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
It was good.

458
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
The face.

459
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
The face.

460
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
The face.

461
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Damn it.

462
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
Damn it.

463
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:44,300
What the...

464
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,380
That was the picture with Con-s Sierra.

465
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,420
That was really close.

466
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,140
I wondered if he had grown aшая.

467
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,340
It's a genuine photo.

468
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,480
Listen, don't...

469
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,340
Do you remember the gingerbread lovely day?

470
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,860
I said no.

471
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,500
That's also very good.

472
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
What?

473
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
That's annoying, isn't it?

474
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Kosugi-san.

475
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
How is it?

476
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
The rubber face.

477
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
It's pretty bad.

478
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
It's a little different.

479
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
What?

480
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
It's a little different from usual.

481
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
It's not normal.

482
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
It's not normal.

483
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
It's not normal.

484
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Ouch!

485
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:41,500
I'm sorry.

486
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,500
I'm sorry for the last one.

487
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,500
That's right.

488
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
What do you think?

489
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
That's right.

490
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,500
It's bad, isn't it?

491
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Well, how many times, how many times...

492
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,800
Oooooooohhhhh...

493
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,660
The crow's there...

494
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,660
Pay attention...

495
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,220
Beg, beg give it up, give up?

496
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,700
Naake, naake, naake!!!

497
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,100
dolphin, dolphin, whale!

498
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,120
talked to too many people

499
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,600
Pity Ushiromori

500
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
It was a ray of italics

501
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,020
What the hell man falling again

502
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,860
That's Ohyama回

503
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,220
Ohk...

504
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,080
苗木によくだっていい?

505
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,460
Who the hesitant, what's theур?

506
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,780
HUH?

507
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:09,940
**

508
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,940
No, I can't.

509
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,940
Why?

510
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,940
How about Yamada?

511
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,940
I'm not going to do it.

512
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,940
Yamada, this is...

513
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,940
What?

514
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,940
What?

515
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,940
Well, you know...

516
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,940
It's a little bit like curry.

517
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,940
The smell is a little bit...

518
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:54,940
