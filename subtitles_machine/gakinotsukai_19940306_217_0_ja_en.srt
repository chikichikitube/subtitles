1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
As expected of Karakuchi, the beer is dry.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The 4 and a half years of history of the Gaki no Tsukai Soshuu series.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
First, from the nostalgic first episode.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It was said that it was a manzai series.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It was a 30 minute manzai series.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We are Yoshimoto Kogyo.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
When we come to places like this, we can relax.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But when we are in Osaka or Kagetsu, it's hard to do this.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We come to see Yoshimoto's Eirai-san.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When we do manzai series, we come to see Yoshimoto's Eirai-san.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The Eirai-san of Yoshimoto Kogyo is behind the audience.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There was no way to say Yoshimoto Kogyo's Eirai-san.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So we call him Yakuza.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is the 3rd episode of Shinken Shirahadori.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Shinken Shirahadori.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Matsumoto Shidoshi Shinkeni Shirahadori.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Shinken Shirahadori is a recent hit series that challenges the limits of variety.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The 4th episode is about the history of Matsumoto Shidoshi Kiseki.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The 3rd episode is about the history of Matsumoto Shidoshi Kiseki.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The 4th episode is about the history of Matsumoto Shidoshi Kiseki.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The 2nd episode is about the history of Matsumoto Shidoshi Kiseki.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Wow, it's glowing.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's huge.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Wait!

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Wait!

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I got a phone call from a client. He said my sword is like a toy.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
A special project for the New Year.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm going to do a spiritual unification.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It'll take 2-3 minutes.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's go.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Come to the 3rd floor.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Come to the 3rd floor.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It was really dangerous.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's still dark.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What's going on?

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The 2nd time I saw it, it looked like it was wearing a helmet.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's impossible.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But today...

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Are you going to do it?

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm going to do it again.

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What's going on?

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I got a phone call from a client.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm going to do it for the last time.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The 4th special project.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm going to do it again.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The 4th special project.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This is also a project that will continue until part 3.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The hidden charm of downtown.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hello, everyone.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Hello.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Welcome.

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I and Hama came out of Hiroshima 10 years ago.

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We came here to become big.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We came here somehow.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We did it.

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I think it's because Hama was there.

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What are you talking about?

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's the first song.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's the first song.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It was too sudden.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I can't forget about him.

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I can't forget about him.

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I can't forget about him.

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I can't forget about him.

66
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can't forget about him.

67
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I can't forget about him.

68
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I can't forget about him.

69
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I can't forget about him.

70
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I can't forget about him.

71
00:08:47,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I can't forget about him.

72
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I can't forget about him.

73
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This is the punishment game for 3 years in a row.

74
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's Hitoshi!

75
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's Hitoshi!

76
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Hitoshi and...

77
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Mom!

78
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Mom is here.

79
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This is the punishment game for 3 years in a row.

80
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What are you doing?

81
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're disturbing my singing.

82
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What are you doing?

84
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
This is the age of impersonation.

85
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Don't say that.

86
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's difficult to impersonate a woman.

87
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm 18 years old.

88
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
18 years old?

89
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's right.

90
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm Shimakura Chiyoko.

91
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What song are you going to sing?

92
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's Tokyo, Mom.

93
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's sing.

94
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's Tokyo, Mom by Shimakura Chiyoko.

95
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's been a long time.

96
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What do you mean by a long time?

97
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's been a long time.

98
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're lying.

99
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What are you doing?

100
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're more excited than usual.

101
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's dangerous to call someone.

102
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm happy.

103
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hello?

104
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Hello?

105
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What is that?

106
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You're mischievous.

107
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What are you saying?

108
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Do you have a son who is in the second grade of elementary school?

109
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I have a sixth grader.

110
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What did you do to him?

111
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What did you do to him?

112
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm embarrassed.

113
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's not funny.

114
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Bring me the money.

115
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I have a second child.

116
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Bring me the money.

117
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Will you bring it?

118
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yes.

119
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What are you going to do?

120
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll pay you back now.

121
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's raining.

122
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Good morning.

123
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Good morning.

124
00:11:46,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Good morning.

125
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hello?

126
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's me.

127
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Did you sleep well?

128
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Listen to my mother's cry.

129
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Good morning.

130
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Look at my mother's cry.

131
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's Hitoshi.

132
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's Okan.

133
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Hitoshi and Okan.

134
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What is this?

135
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Bring me the money.

136
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Will you bring it?

137
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I have a second child.

138
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What are you going to do?

139
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Thank you very much.

140
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'll do my best next year.

141
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Thank you very much for this trip.

142
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you for having fun.

143
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Take care of yourself.

144
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I hope you get along with everyone.

145
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The second time in history.

146
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Hamashan Ebiyan.

147
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
After the high jump match, Hamada lost.

148
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He went to the dressing room.

149
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Bring it.

150
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What is it?

151
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Ebiyan.

152
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What?

153
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Ebiyan.

154
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Ebiyan.

155
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Ebiyan.

156
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Bring Ebiyan.

157
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What?

158
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Bring Ebiyan.

159
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Bring him.

160
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Bring Ebiyan.

161
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Bring Ebiyan.

162
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Let's go.

163
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Are you going to the dressing room?

164
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yes.

165
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm going to the dressing room.

166
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What is this?

167
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's a punishment game.

168
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's a punishment game.

169
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
The plane carrying Hamada is finally taking off in Japan.

170
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Can Ebiyan make it?

171
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
26 hours before departure.

172
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Arrived in Chamonix, the city of silver lovers.

173
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm scared.

174
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Look at this.

175
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What are you showing off?

176
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's easy to understand when you do that.

177
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm embarrassed to come to a foreign country.

178
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Looking for Ebiyan, he's finally starting to attack with a rope.

179
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You don't have to drink water in a place like this.

180
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And he arrives at the final destination of the cliff.

181
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Let's go home.

182
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Where is the water?

183
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Excuse me.

184
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
There's no water.

185
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
There's a waterfall down there.

186
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You can get water from there.

187
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Are you stupid?

188
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's so cold.

189
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's so hot.

190
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What's wrong with you?

191
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Where is it?

192
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Let me introduce.

193
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Ebiyan.

194
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Ebiyan.

195
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
20,000 kilometers away from Japan.

196
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Finally, Hamada has arrived at Ebiyan Water, his long-awaited dream.

197
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm here.

198
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The blessing of the Alps becomes a sparkling shower and pours into a bottle.

199
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Congratulations, Hama-chan.

200
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
This is your punishment for your youth.

201
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Our dream came true with the wind of Mont Blanc.

202
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
With a light footstep that was heavy until a moment ago,

203
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:34,000
the dream bottle becomes a journey of a kilometer.

204
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Ebiyan.

205
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's a town.

206
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I didn't say anything earlier, but the water of the Alps is the water of the Alps.

207
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Because the water of the Alps came out in Ebiyan, the name Ebiyan is attached to the water.

208
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
If Ebiyan comes here, there is no Ebiyan.

209
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's right.

210
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Does it come out from there?

211
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That's right.

212
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Hey.

213
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What are you looking at?

214
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
If you get off the plane and come here, you'll get hit right away.

215
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Because it's a punishment.

216
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If you get off the plane and come here, you'll get hit right away.

217
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But, the reality is not like that...

218
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's not like that.

219
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
If you say it, will you get hit?

220
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
That's right.

221
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That's right.

222
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's right.

223
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's right.

224
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That's right.

225
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's right.

226
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's right.

227
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The water splashes and pours back into the bottle.

228
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
This time, congratulations!

229
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And, well done, Hama-chan.

230
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Our dream has really come true.

231
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You're slow, Hama-chan.

232
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What are you doing?

233
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What is it?

234
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Are you in pain?

235
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm fine.

236
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll make you fall.

237
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
This is for you to eat!

238
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You're too excited.

239
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You!

240
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'll make you fall!

241
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
This is a Metroid.

242
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's still in use.

243
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But this energy may be useful to humanity.

244
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
A heavy Metroid is being stolen!

245
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'll make you fall!

246
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
An emergency test.

247
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Space Hunter Samus Aran.

248
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Stealing Baby Metroid.

249
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Super Phantom Software.

250
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Super Metroid.

251
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
An incredible underground fortress awaits.

252
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I met my senpai in town.

253
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He had a good look on his face.

254
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Before I knew it, he was wearing a suit.

255
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm sure I was too.

256
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I came up with an idea.

257
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Business School.

258
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Tokyo Shoka Academy.

259
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'll make you fall!

260
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What is it?

261
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Billy Joel believes in Mini-Discs.

262
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Take and listen to Mini-Discs from now on.

263
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The first ever high school game.

264
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Kaga Mariko vs. Saga.

265
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's a talk show with famous people from all over the world.

266
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But the two of them have to compete to see how many points they can get.

267
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The 4th round continues.

268
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I change my hair color every day.

269
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You can tell by looking down.

270
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I like you, sensei.

271
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I like you, sensei.

272
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I was the judge.

273
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You had a good look on your face.

274
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Mom, are you okay?

275
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The 3rd round.

276
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Kaga Mariko vs. Saga.

277
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
How many points will they get?

278
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm a woman.

279
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
If you're a father, you'll get 50 points.

280
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:27,000
If you can put Kaga Mariko's body in a half-transparent garbage bag, you'll get 20,000 points.

281
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The 4th round.

282
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Kaga Mariko vs. Saga.

283
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Today's guest is Kaga Mariko.

284
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Good evening.

285
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
We're going to talk about Kaga Mariko's reflection.

286
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No, I'm not going to win.

287
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Why not?

288
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I still have 15 points left.

289
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
How many years have you been in the entertainment world?

290
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I've never felt it.

291
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Your hands are white. You're a disgusting man.

292
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
No, I'm not.

293
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What's wrong with him?

294
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
No, no, no.

295
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Thank you very much.

296
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You're a piece of crap.

297
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What are you doing?

298
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You're amazing.

299
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm pretending to be asleep.

300
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
What's wrong with your reflection?

302
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I can't help it.

303
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Kaga Mariko's half-transparent garbage bag is a hot topic these days.

304
00:22:49,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Thank you very much.
